        <collex:text>Soon every sprinter,
            However fleet,
            Comes to a winter
            Of sure defeat:
            Though he may race
            Like the hunted doe,
            Time has a pace
            To lay him low .
            Soon we who sing,
            However high,
            Must face the Thing
            We cannot fly.
            Yea, though we fling
            Our notes to the sun,
            Time will outsing
            Us every one.
            All things must change
            As the wind is blown;
            Time will estrange
            The flesh from the bone.
            The dream shall elude
            The dreamer's clasp,
            And only its hood
            Shall comfort his grasp.
            A little while,
            Too brief at most,
            And even my smile
            Will be a ghost.
            A little space,
            A Finger's crook,
            And who shall trace
            The path I took?
            Who shall declare
            My whereabouts;
            Say if in the air
            My being shouts
            Along light ways,
            Or if in the sea,
            Or deep earth stays
            The germ of me?
            Ah, none knows, none,
            Save (but too well)
            The Cryptic One
            Who will not tell.
            This is my hour
            To wax and climb,
            Flaunt a red flower
            In the face of time.
            And only an hour
            Time gives, then snap
            Goes the flower,
            And dried is the sap.
            Juice of the first
            Grapes of my vine,
            I proffer your thirst
            My own heart's wine.
            Here of my growing
            A red rose sways,
            Seed of my sowing,
            And work of my days.
            (I run, but time's
            Abreast with me;
            I sing, but he climbs
            With my highest C.)
            Drink while my blood
            Colors the wine,
            Reach while the bud
            Is still on the vine. ...
            Then...
            When the hawks of death
            Tear at my throat
            Till song and breath
            Ebb note by note ,
            Turn to this book
            Of the mellow word
            For a singing look
            At the stricken bird.
            Say, "This is the way
            He chirped and sung,
            In the sweet heyday
            When his heart was young.
            Though his throat is bare,
            By death defiled,
            Song labored there
            And bore a child."
            When the dreadful Ax
            Rives me apart,
            When the sharp wedge cracks
            My arid heart,
            Turn to this book
            Of the singing me
            For a springtime look
            At the wintry tree.
            Say, "Thus it was weighed
            With flower and fruit,
            Ere the Ax was laid
            Unto its root.
            Though the blows fall free
            On a gnarled trunk now,
            Once he was a tree
            With a blossomy bough.”

        <collex:text>I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,
            And did He stoop to quibble could tell why
            The little buried mole continues blind,
            Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die,
            Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus
            Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare
            If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus
            To struggle up a never-ending stair.
            Inscrutable His ways are, and immune
            To catechism by a mind too strewn
            With petty cares to slightly understand
            What awful brain compels His awful hand.
            Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:
            To make a poet black, and bid him sing!

            The enamoured sun pretending that he dies

            That spider linked us with, in no least wise
            Am I uncertain that these alien skies
            Do not our whole life measure and confine.
            No less, once in a land of scarlet suns
            And brooding winds, before the hurricane
            Bore down upon us, long before this pain,
            We found a place where quiet water runs;
            I held your hand this way upon a hill,
            And felt my heart forebear, my pulse grow still."

            Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;

            Her mother pawned her wedding ring
            To lay her out in white;
            She'd be so proud she'd dance and sing
            To see herself tonight.

        <collex:text>What if his glance is bold and free,
            His mouth the lash of whips?
            So should the eyes of lovers be,
            And so a lover's lips.
            What if no puritanic strain
            Confines him to the nice?
            He will not pass this way again,
            Nor hunger for you twice.
            Since in the end consort together
            Magdalen and Mary,
            Youth is the time for careless weather:
            Later, lass, be wary.

        <collex:text>That brown girl's swagger gives a twitch
            To beauty like a queen;
            Lad, never dam your body's itch
            When loveliness is seen.
            For there is ample room for bliss
            In pride in clean, brown limbs,
            And lips know better how to kiss
            Than how to raise white hymns.
            And when your body's death gives birth
            To soil for spring to crown,
            Men will not ask if that rare earth
            Was white flesh once, or brown.

        <collex:text>These have no Christ to spit and stoop
            To write upon the sand,
            Inviting him that has not sinned
            To raise the first rude hand.
            And if he came they could not buy
            Rich ointment for his feet,
            The body's sale scarce yields enough
            To let the body eat.
            The chaste clean ladies pass them by
            And draw their skirts aside,
            But Magdalens have a ready laugh;
            They wrap their wounds in pride.
            They fare full ill since Christ forsook
            The cross to mount a throne,
            And Virtue still is stooping down
            To cast the first hard stone.

        <collex:text>With subtle poise he grips his tray
            Of delicate things to eat;
            Choice viands to their mouths half way,
            The ladies watch his feet
            Go carving dexterous avenues
            Through sly intricacies;
            Ten thousand years on jungle clues
            Alone shaped feet like these.
            For him to be humble who is proud
            Needs colder artifice;
            Though half his pride is disavowed,
            In vain the sacrifice.
            Sheer through his acquiescent mask
            Of bland gentility,
            The jungle flames like a copper cask
            Set where the sun strikes free.

            Oblivious to look and word
            They pass, and see no wonder
            That lightning brilliant as a sword
            Should blaze the path of thunder.

            So it can woo an artful flute
            With loose, elastic lips, 
            Its measurement of joy compute
            With blithe, ecstatic hips.

            And yet He called my name;
            He never gave a sign to me,
            And yet I knew and came.
            At first I said, “I will not bear
            His cross upon my back;
            He only seeks to place it there
            Because my skin is black.”
            But He was dying for a dream,
            And He was very meek,
            And in His eyes there shone a gleam
            Men journey far to seek.
            It was Himself my pity bought;
            I did for Christ alone
            What all of Rome could not have wrought
            With bruise of lash or stone.

        <collex:text>Once riding in old Baltimore,
            Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,
            I saw a Baltimorean
            Keep looking straight at me.
            Now I was eight and very small,
            And he was no whit bigger,
            And so I smiled, but he poked out
            His tongue, and called me, "Nigger."
            I saw the whole of Baltimore
            From May until December;
            Of all the things that happened there
            That's all that I remember.

        <collex:text>From where she stood the air she craved
            Smote with the smell of pine;
            It was too much to bear; she braved
            Her gods and crossed the line.
            And we were hurt to see her go,
            With her fair face and hair,
            And veins too thin and blue to show
            What mingled blood flowed there.
            We envied her a while, who still
            Pursued the hated track ;
            Then we forgot her name, until
            One day her shade came back.
            Calm as a wave without a crest,
            Sorrow-proud and sorrow-wise,
            With trouble sucking at her breast,
            With tear-disdainful eyes,
            She slipped into her ancient place,
            And, no word asked, gave none;
            Only the silence in her face
            Said seats were dear in the sun.

        <collex:text>He rode across like a cavalier,
            Spurs clicking hard and loud;
            And where he tarried dropped his tear
            On heads he left low-bowed.
            But, “Even Stephen," he cried, and struck
            His steed an urgent blow;
            He swore by youth he was a buck
            With savage oats to sow.
            
            To even up some standing scores,
            From every flower bed
            He passed, he plucked by threes and fours
            Till wheels whirled in his head.
            But long before the drug could tell,
            He took his anodyne;
            With scornful grace, he bowed farewell
            And retraversed the line.

            Dame Poverty gave me my name,

            For I was born on Saturday
            “Bad time for planting a seed,"
            Was all my father had to say,

            Death cut the strings that gave me life,

            My folks could beg or borrow.

        <collex:text>All night we danced upon our windy hill,
            Your dress a cloud of tangled midnight hair,
            And love was much too much for me to wear
            My leaves; the killer roared above his kill,
            But you danced on, and when some star would spill
            Its red and white upon you whirling there,
            I sensed a hidden beauty in the air;
            Though you danced on, my heart and I stood still,
            But suddenly a bit of morning crept
            Along your trembling sides of ebony;
            I saw the tears your tired limbs had wept,
            And how your breasts heaved high, how languidly
            Your dark arms moved; I drew you close to me;
            We flung ourselves upon our hill and slept.

            For me, my heart is pagan mad,
            My feet are never still,
            But give them hearths to keep them warm
            In homes high on a hill.
            For me, my faith lies fallowing,
            I bow not till I see,
            But these are humble and believe;
            Bless their credulity.
            For me, I pay my debts in kind,
            And see no better way,
            Bless these who turn the other cheek
            For love of you, and pray.
            Our Father, God, our Brother, Christ
            So are we taught to pray;
            Their kinship seems a little thing
            Who sorrow all the day.
            Our Father, God; our Brother, Christ,
            Or are we bastard kin,
            That to our plaints your ears are closed,
            Your doors barred from within?
            Our Father, God; our Brother, Christ,
            Retrieve my race again;
            So shall you compass this black sheep,
            This pagan heart. Amen.

        <collex:text>Now I am young and credulous
            My heart is quick to bleed
            At courage in the tremulous
            Slow sprouting of a seed.
            Now I am young and sensitive,
            Man's lack can stab me through;
            I own no stitch I would not give
            To him that asked me to.
            Now I am young and a fool for love,
            My blood goes mad to see
            A brown girl pass me like a dove
            That flies melodiously.
            Let me be lavish of my tears,
            And dream that false is true;
            Though wisdom cometh with the years,
            The barren days come, too.

        <collex:text>My father is a quiet man
            With sober, steady ways;
            For simile, a folded fan;
            His nights are like his days.
            My mother's life is puritan,
            No hint of cavalier,
            A pool so calm you're sure it can
            Have little depth to fear.
            And yet my father's eyes can boast
            How full his life has been;
            There haunts them yet the languid ghost
            Of some still sacred sin.
            And though my mother chants of God,
            And of the mystic river,
            I've seen a bit of checkered sod
            Set all her flesh aquiver.
            Why should he deem it pure mischance
            A son of his is fain
            To do a naked tribal dance
            Each time he hears the rain?
            Why should she think it devil's art
            That all my songs should be
            Of love and lovers, broken heart,
            And wild sweet agony?
            Who plants a seed begets a bud,
            Extract of that same root;
            Why marvel at the hectic blood
            That flushes this wild fruit?

        <collex:text>"Lord, being dark,” I said, “I cannot bear 
            The further touch of earth, the scented air;
            Lord, being dark, forewilled to that despair
            My color shrouds me in, I am as dirt
            Beneath my brother's heel; there is a hurt
            In all the simple joys which to a child
            Are sweet; they are contaminate, defiled
            By truths of wrongs the childish vision fails
            To see; too great a cost this birth entails.
            I strangle in this yoke drawn tighter than
            The worth of bearing it, just to be man.
            I am not brave enough to pay the price
            In full; I lack the strength to sacrifice.
            I who have burned my hands upon a star,
            And climbed high hills at dawn to view the far
            Illimitable wonderments of earth,
            For whom all cups have dripped the wine of mirth,
            For whom the sea, has strained her honeyed throat
            Till all the world was sea, and I a boat
            Unmoored, on what strange quest I willed to float;
            Who wore a many-colored coat of dreams,
            Thy gift, O Lord--I whom sun-dabbled streams
            Have washed, whose bare brown thighs have held the sun
            Incarcerate until his course was run,
            I who considered man a high-perfected
            Glass where loveliness could lie reflected,
            Now that I sway athwart Truth's deep abyss,
            Denuding man for what he was and is,
            Shall breath and being so inveigle me
            That I can damn my dreams to hell, and be
            Content, each new-born day, anew to see
            The steaming crimson vintage of my youth
            Incarnadine the altar-slab of Truth?
            Or hast Thou, Lord, somewhere I cannot see,
            A lamb imprisoned in a bush for me?
            Not so? Then let me render one by one
            Thy gifts, while still they shine; some little sun
            Yet gilds these thighs ; my coat, albeit worn,
            Still holds its colors fast; albeit torn,
            My heart will laugh a little yet, if I
            May win of Thee this grace, Lord: on this high
            And sacrificial hill 'twixt earth and sky,
            To dream still pure all that I loved, and die.
            There is no other way to keep secure
            My wild chimeras; grave-locked against the lure
            Of Truth, the small hard teeth of worms, yet less
            Envenomed than the mouth of Truth, will bless
            Them into dust and happy nothingness.
            Lord, Thou art God; and I, Lord, what am I
            But dust? With dust my place. Lord, let me die."
            Across the earth's warm, palpitating crust
            I Aung my body in embrace; I thrust
            My mouth into the grass and sucked the dew,
            Then gave it back in tears my anguish drew;
            So hard I pressed against the ground, I felt
            The smallest sand grain like a knife, and smelt
            The next year's flowering; all this to speed
            My body's dissolution, fain to feed
            The worms. And so I groaned, and spent my strength
            Until, all passion spent, I lay full length
            And quivered like a flayed and bleeding thing.
            So lay till lifted on a great black wing
            That had no mate nor flesh-apparent trunk
            To hamper it; with me all time had sunk
            Into oblivion; when I awoke
            The wing hung poised above two cliffs that broke
            The bowels of the earth in twain, and cleft
            The seas apart. Below, above, to left,
            To right, I saw what no man saw before:
            Earth, hell, and heaven ; sinew, vein, and core.
            All things that swim or walk or creep or fly,
            All things that live and hunger, faint and die,
            Were made majestic then and magnified
            By sight so clearly purged and deified.
            The smallest bug that crawls was taller than
            A tree, the mustard seed loomed like a man.
            The earth that writhes eternally with pain
            Of birth, and woe of taking back her slain,
            Laid bare her teeming bosom to my sight,
            And all was struggle, gasping breath, and fight.
            A blind worm here dug tunnels to the light,
            And there a seed, racked with heroic pain,
            Thrust eager tentacles to sun and rain;
            It climbed; it died; the old love conquered me
            To weep the blossom it would never be.
            But here a bud won light; it burst and flowered
            Into a rose whose beauty challenged, "Coward!”
            There was no thing alive save only I
            That held life in contempt and longed to die.
            And still I writhed and moaned, “The curse, the curse,
            Than animated death, can death be worse?”
            “Dark child of sorrow, mine no less, what art
            Of mine can make thee see and play thy part?
            The key to all strange things is in thy heart."
            What voice was this that coursed like liquid fire
            Along my flesh, and turned my hair to wire?
            I raised my burning eyes, beheld a field
            All multitudinous with carnal yield,
            A grim ensanguined mead whereon I saw
            Evolve the ancient fundamental law
            Of tooth and talon, fist and nail and claw.
            There with the force of living, hostile hills
            Whose clash the hemmed-in vale with clamor fills,
            With greater din contended fierce majestic wills
            Of beast with beast, of man with man, in strife
            For love of what my heart despised, for life
            That unto me at dawn was now a prayer
            For night, at night a bloody heart-wrung tear
            For day again; for this, these groans
            From tangled flesh and interlocked bones.
            And no thing died that did not give
            A testimony that it longed to live.
            Man, strange composite blend of brute and god,
            Pushed on, nor backward glanced where last he trod.
            He seemed to mount a misty ladder flung
            Pendant from a cloud, yet never gained a rung
            But at his feet another tugged and clung.
            My heart was still a pool of bitterness,
            Would yield nought else, nought else confess.
            I spoke (although no form was there
            To see, I knew an ear was there to hear),
            "Well, let them fight; they can whose flesh is fair."
            Crisp lightning flashed; a wave of thunder shook
            My wing; a pause, and then a speaking, “Look."
            I scarce dared trust my ears or eyes for awe
            Of what they heard, and dread of what they saw;
            For, privileged beyond degree, this flesh
            Beheld God and His heaven in the mesh
            Of Lucifer's revolt, saw Lucifer
            Glow like the sun, and like a dulcimer
            I heard his sin-sweet voice break on the yell
            Of God's great warriors: Gabriel,
            Saint Clair and Michael, Israfel and Raphael.
            And strange it was to see God with His back
            Against a wall, to see Christ hew and hack
            Till Lucifer, pressed by the mighty pair,
            And losing inch by inch, clawed at the air
            With fevered wings; then , lost beyond repair,
            He tricked a mass of stars into his hair;
            He filled his hands with stars, crying as he fell,
            “A star's a star although it burns in hell.”
            So God was left to His divinity,
            Omnipotent at that most costly fee.
            There was a lesson here, but still the clod
            In me was sycophant unto the rod,
            And cried, “Why mock me thus? Am I a god?"
            “One trial more : this failing, then I give
            You leave to die; no further need to live."
            Now suddenly a strange wild music smote
            A chord long impotent in me; a note
            Of jungles, primitive and subtle, throbbed
            Against my echoing breast, and tom-toms sobbed
            In every pulse-beat of my frame. The din
            A hollow log bound with a python's skin
            Can make wrought every nerve to ecstasy,
            And I was wind and sky again, and sea,
            And all sweet things that flourish, being free.
            Till all at once the music changed its key.
            And now it was of bitterness and death,
            The cry the lash extorts, the broken breath
            Of liberty enchained; and yet there ran
            Through all a harmony of faith in man,
            A knowledge all would end as it began.
            All sights and sounds and aspects of my race
            Accompanied this melody, kept pace
            With it; with music all their hopes and hates
            Were charged, not to be downed by all the fates.
            And somehow it was borne upon my brain
            How being dark, and living through the pain
            Of it, is courage more than angels have. I knew
            What storms and tumults lashed the tree that grew
            This body that I was, this cringing I
            That feared to contemplate a changing sky,
            This that I grovelled, whining, "Let me die,"
            While others struggled in Life's abattoir.
            The cries of all dark people near or far
            Were billowed over me, a mighty surge
            Of suffering in which my puny grief must merge
            And lose itself; I had no further claim to urge
            For death; in shame I raised my dust-grimed head,
            And though my lips moved not, God knew I said,
            “Lord, not for what I saw in flesh or bone
            Of fairer men; not raised on faith alone;
            Lord, I will live persuaded by mine own.
            I cannot play the recreant to these;
            My spirit has come home, that sailed the doubtful seas.”
            With the whiz of a sword that severs space,
            The wing dropped down at a dizzy pace,
            And flung me on my hill flat on my face;
            Flat on my face I lay defying pain,
            Glad of the blood in my smallest vein,
            And in my hands I clutched a loyal dream,
            Still spitting fire, bright twist and coil and gleam,
            And chiselled like a hound's white tooth.
            “Oh, I will match you yet," I cried, "to truth.”
            Right glad I was to stoop to what I once had spurned,
            Glad even unto tears; I laughed aloud; I turned
            Upon my back, and though the tears for joy would run,
            My sight was clear; I looked and saw the rising sun.

        <collex:text>For Harold Jackman
            What is Africa to me:
            Copper sun or scarlet sea, 
            Jungle star or jungle track,
            Strong bronzed men, or regal black
            Women from whose loins I sprang
            When the birds of Eden sang?
            One three centuries removed
            From the scenes his fathers loved,
            Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
            What is Africa to me?
            So I lie, who all day long
            Want no sound except the song
            Sung by wild barbaric birds
            Goading massive jungle herds,
            Juggernauts of flesh that pass
            Trampling tall defiant grass
            Where young forest lovers lie,
            Plighting troth beneath the sky.
            So I lie, who always hear,
            Though I cram against my ear
            Both my thumbs, and keep them there,
            Great drums throbbing through the air.
            So I lie, whose fount of pride,
            Dear distress, and joy allied ,
            Is my somber flesh and skin,
            With the dark blood dammed within
            Like great pulsing tides of wine
            That, I fear, must burst the fine
            Channels of the chafing net
            Where they surge and foam and fret.
            Africa? A book one thumbs
            Listlessly, till slumber comes.
            Unremembered are her bats
            Circling through the night, her cats
            Crouching in the river reeds,
            Stalking gentle flesh that feeds
            By the river brink ; no more
            Does the bugle- throated roar
            Cry that monarch claws have leapt
            From the scabbards where they slept.
            Silver snakes that once a year
            Doff the lovely coats you wear,
            Seek no covert in your fear
            Lest a mortal eye should see;
            What's your nakedness to me?
            Here no leprous flowers rear
            Fierce corollas in the air;
            Here no bodies sleek and wet,
            Dripping mingled rain and sweat,
            Tread the savage measures of
            Jungle boys and girls in love.
            What is last year's snow to me,
            Last year's anything? The tree
            Budding yearly must forget
            How its past arose or set--
            Bough and blossom, flower, fruit,
            Even what shy bird with mute
            Wonder at her travail there,
            Meekly labored in its hair.
            One three centuries removed
            From the scenes his fathers loved,
            Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
            What is Africa to me?
            So I lie, who find no peace
            Night or day, no slight release
            From the unremittant beat
            Made by cruel padded feet
            Walking through my body's street.
            Up and down they go, and back,
            Treading out a jungle track.
            So I lie, who never quite
            Safely sleep from rain at night
            I can never rest at all
            When the rain begins to fall;
            Like a soul gone mad with pain
            I must match its weird refrain;
            Ever must I twist and squirm,
            Writhing like a baited worm ,
            While its primal measures drip
            Through my body, crying, "Strip!
            Doff this new exuberance.
            Come and dance the Lover's Dance!"
            In an old remembered way
            Rain works on me night and day.
            Quaint, outlandish heathen gods
            Black men fashion out of rods,
            Clay, and brittle bits of stone,
            In a likeness like their own,
            My conversion came high-priced;
            I belong to Jesus Christ,
            Preacher of humility;
            Heathen gods are naught to me.
            Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
            So I make an idle boast;
            Jesus of the twice-turned cheek,
            Lamb of God, although I speak
            With my mouth thus, in my heart
            Do I play a double part.
            Ever at Thy glowing altar
            sick and falter,
            Wishing He I served were black,
            Thinking then it would not lack
            Precedent of pain to guide it,
            Must my heart grow
            Let who would or might deride it;
            Surely then this flesh would know
            Yours had borne a kindred woe.
            Lord, I fashion dark gods, too,
            Daring even to give You
            Dark despairing features where,
            Crowned with dark rebellious hair,
            Patience wavers just so much as
            Mortal grief compels, while touches
            Quick and hot, of anger, rise
            To smitten cheek and weary eyes.
            Lord, forgive me if my need
            Sometimes shapes a human creed.
            All day long and all night through,
            One thing only must I do:
            Quench my pride and cool my blood,
            Lest I perish in the flood.
            Lest a hidden ember set
            Timber that I thought was wet
            Burning like the dryest flax,
            Melting like the merest wax,
            Lest the grave restore its dead.
            Not yet has my heart or head
            In the least way realized
            They and I are civilized.

            This half a loaf from sumptuous crumbs your shy

            The sturdy homage of a love that throws
            Its strength about you, dawn and dusk, at bed
            And board, is not for scorn. When all is said

        <collex:text>Thie poem won second prize in the Opportunity poetry contest of 1925
            This much the gods vouchsafe today:
            That we two lie in the clover,
            Watching the heavens dip and sway,
            With galleons sailing over.
            This much is granted for an hour:
            That we are young and tender,
            That I am bee and you are flower,
            Honey-mouthed and swaying slender.
            This sweet of sweets is ours now:
            To wander through the land,
            Plucking an apple from its bough
            To toss from hand to hand.
            No thing is certain, joy nor sorrow,
            Except the hour we know it;
            Oh, wear my heart today; tomorrow
            Who knows where the winds will blow it?

            "Body and baggage, to go,
            Though the night be darker than my hair,

            She flipped a light hair from his coat,
            And sobbed against his heart.

            Envied us our thunder?

            Censure me not

            The garden plot,
            Instead of a bud

            With which it came
            From nothingness.
            The seed of a weed
            Cannot be flowered,
            Nor a hero's deed
            Spring from a coward.
            Pull up the weed;
            Bring plow and mower;
            Then fetch new seed
            For the hand of the Sower.

        <collex:text>I think when Judas' mother heard
            His first faint cry the night
            That he was born, that worship stirred
            Her at the sound and sight.
            She thought his was as fair a frame
            As flesh and blood had worn;
            I think she made this lovely name
            For him— "Star of my morn."
            As any mother's son he grew
            From spring to crimson spring;
            I think his eyes were black, or blue,
            His hair curled like a ring.
            His mother's heart-strings were a lute
            Whereon he all day played;
            She listened rapt, abandoned, mute,
            To every note he made.
            I think he knew the growing Christ,
            And played with Mary's son,
            And where mere mortal craft sufficed,
            There Judas may have won.
            Perhaps he little cared or knew,
            So folly-wise is youth,
            That He whose hand his hand clung to
            Was flesh-embodied Truth;
            Until one day he heard young Christ,
            With far-off eyes agleam,
            Tell of a mystic, solemn tryst
            Between Him and a dream.
            And Judas listened, wonder-eyed,
            Until the Christ was through,
            Then said, “And I, though good betide,
            Or ill, will go with you."
            And so he followed, heard Christ preach,
            Saw how by miracle
            The blind man saw, the dumb got speech,
            The leper found him well.
            And Judas in those holy hours,
            Loved Christ, and loved Him much,
            And in his heart he sensed dead flowers
            Bloom at the Master's touch.
            And when Christ felt the death hour creep,
            With sullen, drunken lurch,
            He said to Peter, "Feed my sheep,
            And build my holy church.”
            He gave to each the special task
            That should be his to do,
            But reaching one, I hear him ask,
            “What shall I give to you?”
            Then Judas in his hot desire
            Said, "Give me what you will." 
            Christ spoke to him with words of fire,
            “Then, Judas, you must kill,
            One whom you love, One who loves you
            As only God's son can:
            This is the work for you to do
            To save the creature man."
            "And men to come will curse your name,
            And hold you up to scorn;
            In all the world will be no shame
            Like yours; this is love's thorn.
            It takes strong will of heart and soul,
            But man is under ban.
            Think, Judas, can you play this role
            In heaven's mystic plan?"
            So Judas took the sorry part,
            Went out and spoke the word,
            And gave the kiss that broke his heart,
            But no one knew or heard.
            And no one knew what poison ate
            Into his palm that day,
            Where, bright and damned, the monstrous weight
            Of thirty white coins lay.
            It was not death that Judas found
            Upon a kindly tree;
            The man was dead long ere he bound
            His throat as final fee.
            And who can say if on that day
            When gates of pearl swung wide,
            Christ did not go His honored way
            With Judas by His side?
            I think somewhere a table round
            Owns Jesus as its head,
            And there the saintly twelve are found
            Who followed where He led.
            And Judas sits down with the rest,
            And none shrinks from His hand,
            For there the worst is as the best,
            And there they understand.
            And you may think of Judas, 'friend,
            As one who broke his word,
            Whose neck came to a bitter end
            For giving up his Lord.
            But I would rather think of him 
            As the little Jewish lad
            Who gave young Christ heart, soul, and limb,
            And all the love he had.

        <collex:text>Dead men are wisest, for they know 
            How far the roots of flowers go,
            How long a seed must rot to grow.
            Dead men alone bear frost and rain
            On throbless heart and heatless brain,
            And feel no stir of joy or pain.
            Dead men alone are satiate;
            They sleep and dream and have no weight,
            To curb their rest, of love or hate.
            Strange, men should flee their company,
            Or think me strange who long to be
            Wrapped in their cool immunity.

        <collex:text>Soul: There is no stronger thing than song;
            In sun and rain and leafy trees
            It wafts the timid soul along
            On crested waves of melodies.
            Body: But leaves the body bare to feed
            Its hunger with its very need.
            Soul: Although the frenzied belly writhes,
            Yet render up in song your tithes;
            Song is the weakling's oaken rod,
            His Jacob's ladder dropped from God.
            Body: Song is not drink; song is not meat,
            Nor strong, thick shoes for naked feet.
            Soul: Who sings by unseen hands is fed
            With honeyed milk and warm, white bread;
            His ways in pastures green are led,
            And perfumed oil illumes his head;
            His cup with wine is surfeited,
            And when the last low note is read,
            He sings among the lipless dead
            With singing stars to crown his head.
            Body: But will song buy a wooden box
            The length of me from toe to crown,
            To keep me safe from carrion flocks
            When singing's done and lyre laid down?

            And all the honeyed lies they tell
            Come there to thirst and die.
            No lie is strong enough to kill
            The roots that work below;
            From your rich dust and slaughtered will
            A tree with tongues will grow.

            Than all I am; base clay and spittle joined
            To shape an aimless whim substantial; coined
            Amiss one idle hour, this heart, though poor,
            O golden host I count upon the ends

            Is rich enough for this: to harbor there

            Let neither lose his faith, lest by such loss

            My friends: if you are true, I needs must be.

        <collex:text>I fast and pray and go to church,
            And put my penny in,
            But God's not fooled by such slight tricks,
            And I'm not saved from sin.
            I cannot hide from Him the gods
            That revel in my heart,
            Nor can I find an easy word
            To tell them to depart:
            God's alabaster turrets gleam
            Too high for me to win,
            Unless He turns His face and lets
            Me bring my own gods in.

        <collex:text>I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
            There never was a spring like this;
            It is an echo, that repeats
            My last year's song and next year's bliss.
            I know, in spite of all men say
            Of Beauty, you have felt her most.
            Yea, even in your grave her way
            Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
            Spring never was so fair and dear
            As Beauty makes her seem this year..
            I cannot hold my peace, John Keats,
            I am as helpless in the toil
            Of Spring as any lamb that bleats
            To feel the solid earth recoil
            Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
            Her tocsin call to those who love her,
            And lo! the dogwood petals cover
            Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
            White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
            About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
            While white and purple lilacs muster
            A strength that bears them to a cluster
            Of color and odor; for her sake
            All things that slept are now awake.
            And you and I, shall we lie still,
            John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
            Somehow I feel your sensitive will
            Is pulsing up some tremulous
            Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
            Grow music as they grow, since your
            Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
            For life that opens death's dark door.
            Though dust, your fingers still can push
            The Vision Splendid to a birth,
            Though now they work as grass in the hush
            Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.
            "John Keats is dead,” they say, but I
            Who hear your full insistent cry
            In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
            Know John Keats still writes poetry.
            And while my head is earthward bowed
            To read new life sprung from your shroud,
            Folks seeing me must think it strange
            That merely spring should so derange
            My mind. They do not know that you,
            John Keats, keep revel with me, too.

            To hold my fancy long;
            I'll bear a blossom with the spring,
            Or be a blackbird's song,
            I think that I shall fade with ease,
            Melt into earth like snow,
            Be food for hungry, growing trees,
            Or help the lilies blow.
            And if my love should lonely walk,
            Quite of my nearness fain,
            I may come back to her, and talk
            In liquid words of rain.

        <collex:text>Harsh World that lashest me each day,
            Dub me not that cowardly because
            I seem to find no sudden way
            To throttle you or clip your claws.
            No force compels me to the wound
            Whereof my body bears the scar;
            Although my feet are on the ground,
            Doubt not my eyes are on a star.
            You cannot keep me captive, World,
            Entrammeled, chained, spit on, spurned.
            More free than all your flags unfurled,
            I give my body to be burned.
            I mount my cross because I will,
            I drink the hemlock which you give
            For wine which you withhold—-and still,
            Because I will not die, I live.
            I live because an ember in
            Me smoulders to regain its fire,
            Because what is and what has been
            Not yet have conquered my desire.
            I live to prove the groping clod
            Is surely more than simple dust;
            I live to see the breath of God
            Beatify the carnal crust.
            But when I will, World, I can go,
            Though triple bronze should wall me round,
            Slip past your guard as swift as snow,
            Translated without pain or sound.
            Within myself is lodged the key
            To that vast room of couches laid
            For those too proud to live and see
            Their dreams of light eclipsed in shade.

        <collex:text>[Awarded First Prize in the Opportunity poetry contest of 1925]
            Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
            Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
            I heard a Negro play.
            Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
            By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
            He did a lazy sway. . . . 
            He did a lazy sway. . . . 
            To the tune o' those Weary Blues.
            With his ebony hands on each ivory key
            He made that poor piano moan with melody.
            O Blues!
            Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
            He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
            Sweet Blues!
            Coming from a black man's soul.
            O Blues!
            In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
            I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan
            "Ain't got nobody in all this world,
            Ain't got nobody but ma self.
            I's gwine to quit ma frownin'
            And put ma troubles on the shelf.”
            Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
            He played a few chords then he sang some more
            "I got the Weary Blues
            And I can't be satisfied.
            Got the Weary Blues
            And can't be satisfied
            I ain't happy no mo'
            And I wish that I had died.”
            And far into the night he crooned that tune.
            The stars went out and so did the moon.
            The singer stopped playing and went to bed
            While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
            He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.

            Oh, shining rivers of the soul!
            In a Harlem cabaret
            Six long-headed jazzers play.
            A dancing girl whose eyes are bold
            Lifts nigh a dress of silken gold.
            Oh, singing tree!
            Oh, shining rivers of the soul!
            Were Eve's eyes
            In the first garden
            Just a bit too bold?
            Was Cleopatra gorgeous
            In a gown of gold?
            Oh, shining tree!
            Oh, silver rivers of the soul!
            In a whirling cabaret
            Six long-headed jazzers play.

            When the little dawn was grey.

        <collex:text>Hey! Hey!
            That's what the
            Blues singers say.
            Singing minor melodies
            They laugh,
            Hey! Hey!
            My man's done left me,
            Chile, he's gone away.
            My good man's left me,
            Babe, he's gone away.
            Now the cryin' blues
            Haunts me night and day.
            Hey! ... Hey!
            Weary,
            Weary,
            Trouble, pain.
            Sun's gonna shine
            Somewhere
            Again.
            I got a railroad ticket,
            Pack my trunk and ride.
            Sing 'em, sister!
            Got a railroad ticket,
            Pack my trunk and ride.
            And when I get on the train
            I'll cast my blues aside.
            Laughing,
            Hey! ... Hey!
            Laugh a loud,
            Hey! Hey!

            Love.

            I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
            I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
            I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
            went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy
            bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

            If ever I cursed my black old mother
            And wished she were in hell,
            I'm sorry for that evil wish
            And now I wish her well.
            My old man died in a fine big house.
            My ma died in a shack.
            I wonder where I'm gonna die,
            Being neither white nor black?

        <collex:text>The lazy, laughing South
            With blood on its mouth.
            The sunny-faced South,
            Beast-strong,
            Idiot-brained .
            The child-minded South
            Scratching in the dead fire's ashes
            For a Negro's bones.
            Cotton and the moon,
            Warmth, earth, warmth,
            The sky, the sun, the stars,
            The magnolia-scented South.
            Beautiful, like a woman,
            Seductive as a dark-eyed whore,
            Passionate, cruel,
            Honey-lipped, syphilitic----
            That is the South.
            And I, who am black, would love her
            But she spits in my face.
            And I, who am black,
            Would give her many rare gifts
            But she turns her back upon me.
            So now I seek the North----
            The cold-faced North,
            For she, they say,
            Is a kinder mistress,
            And in her house my children
            May escape the spell of the South.

            I have almost forgotten my dream.
            But it was there then,

            Bright like a sun,--
            My dream.

            Rose slowly, slowly,
            Dimming,
            Hiding,
            The light of my dream.
            Rose until it touched the sky,--
            The wall.
            Shadow.
            I am black.
            I lie down in the shadow.
            No longer the light of my dream before me,
            Above me.
            Only the thick wall.
            Only the shadow.
            My hands!
            My dark hands!
            Break through the wall!
            Find my dream!
            Help me to shatter this darkness,
            To smash this night,
            To break this shadow
            Into a thousand lights of sun,
            Into a thousand whirling dreams
            Of sun!

        <collex:text>Aunt Sue has a head full of stories.
            Aunt Sue has a whole heart full of stories.
            Summer nights on the front porch
            Aunt Sue cuddles a brown-faced child to her bosom
            And tells him stories.
            Black slaves
            Working in the hot sun,
            And black slaves
            Walking in the dewy night,
            And black slaves
            Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river
            Mingle themselves softly
            In the flow of old Aunt Sue's voice,
            Mingle themselves softly
            In the dark shadows that cross and recross
            Aunt Sue's stories.
            And the dark-faced child, listening,
            Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.
            He knows that Aunt Sue
            Never got her stories out of any book at all,
            But that they came
            Right out of her own life.
            And the dark-faced child is quiet
            Of a summer night
            Listening to Aunt Sue's stories.

            She did not love me,
            So I wept until the red dawn
            Dripped blood over the eastern hills
            And my heart was bleeding, too.
            I am a black Pierrot:
            She did not love me,
            So with my once gay-colored soul
            Shrunken like a balloon without air,
            I went forth in the morning
            To seek a new brown love.

            My black one,
            Thou art not good
            Yet thou hast
            A purity
            Surpassing goodness.
            Ah,
            My black one,
            Thou art not luminous
            Yet an altar of jewels,
            An altar of shimmering jewels,
            Would pale in the light
            Of thy darkness,
            Pale in the light
            Of thy nightness.

        <collex:text>When Susanna Jones wears red
            Her face is like an ancient cameo
            Turned brown by the ages.
            Come with a blast of trumpets,
            Jesus!
            When Susanna Jones wears red
            A queen from some time-dead Egyptian night
            Walks once again.
            Blow trumpets, Jesus!
            And the beauty of Susanna Jones in red
            Burns in in my heart a love-fire sharp like pain.
            Sweet silver trumpets,
            Jesus!

            But Pierrot wondered why.
            For Pierrot loved the long white road,
            And Pierrot loved the moon,
            And Pierrot loved a star-filled sky,
            And the breath of a rose in June.
            I have one wife,
            Said Simple John,

            I have one wife,
            Said Simple John,
            But Pierrot left Pierrette.
            For Pierrot saw a world of girls,
            And Pierrot loved each one,
            And Pierrot thought all maidens fair
            As flowers in the sun.
            Oh, I am good,
            Said Simple John,
            The Lord will take me in.
            Yes, I am good,
            Said Simple John,
            But Pierrot's steeped in sin.
            For Pierrot played on a slim guitar,
            And Pierrot loved the moon ,
            And Pierrot ran down the long white road
            With the burgher's wife one June.

        <collex:text>Hello, sailor boy,
            In from the sea!
            Hello, sailor,
            Come with me!
            Come on drink cognac.
            Rather have wine?
            Come here, I love you.
            Come and be mine.
            Lights, sailor boy,
            Warm, white lights.
            Solid land, kid.
            Wild, white nights.
            Come on, sailor,
            Out o' the sea.
            Let's go, sweetie!
            Come with me.

        <collex:text>I was a red man one time,
            But the white men came.
            I was a black man, too,
            But the white men came.
            They drove me out of the forest.
            They took me away from the jungles.
            I lost my trees.
            I lost my silver moons.
            Now they've caged me
            In the circus of civilization.
            Now I herd with the many--
            Caged in the circus of civilization.

            For the portrait of an African boy after the manner of Gauguin
            All the tom-toms of the jungles beat in my blood,
            And all the wild hot moons of the jungles shine in my soul.
            I am afraid of this civilization--
            So hard,

            So cold.

        <collex:text>The sounds
            Of the Harlem night
            Drop one by one into stillness.
            The last player -piano is closed.
            The last victrola ceases with the
            "Jazz Boy Blues.”
            The last crying baby sleeps
            And the night becomes
            Still as a whispering heartbeat.
            I toss
            Without rest in the darkness,
            Weary as the tired night,
            My soul
            Empty as the silence,
            Empty with a vague,
            Aching emptiness,
            Desiring,
            Needing someone,
            Something.
            I toss without rest
            In the darkness
            Until the new dawn,
            Wan and pale,
            Descends like a white mist
            Into the court-yard.

        <collex:text>Well, son, I'll tell you:
            Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
            It's had tacks in it,
            And splinters,
            And boards torn up,
            And places with no carpet on the floor----
            Bare.
            But all the time
            I'se been a-climbin' on,
            And reachin' landin's,
            And turnin' corners,
            And sometimes goin' in the dark
            Where there ain't been no light.
            So boy, don't you turn back.
            Don't you set down on the steps
            'Cause you finds it's kinder hard .
            Don't you fall now----
            For I'se still goin', honey,
            I'se still climbin',
            And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
