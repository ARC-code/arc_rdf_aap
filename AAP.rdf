MOSES:
A STORY OF THE NILE
THE PARTING.—CHAPTER I.
MOSES.
Kind and gracious princess, more than friend,
I've come to thank thee for thy goodness,
And to breathe into thy generous ears
My last and sad farewell. I go to join
The fortunes of my race, and to put aside
All other bright advantages, save
The approval of my conscience and the meed
Of rightly doing.
PRINCESS.
What means, my son, this strange election?
What wild chimera floats across thy mind?
What sudden impulse moves thy soul? Thou who
Hast only trod the court of kings, why seek
Instead the paths of labor? Thou, whose limbs
Have known no other garb than that which well
Befits our kingly state, why rather choose
The badge of servitude and toil?
MOSES.
Let me tell thee, gracious princess; 'tis no
Sudden freak nor impulse wild that moves my mind.
I feel an earnest purpose binding all
My soul unto a strong resolve, which bids
Me put aside all other ends and aims,
Until the hour shall come when God—the God
Our fathers loved and worshipped—shall break our chains,
And lead our willing feet to freedom.
PRINCESS.
Listen to me, Moses: thou art young,
And the warm blood of youth flushes thy veins
Like generous wine; thou wearest thy manhood
Like a crown; but what king e'er cast
His diadem in the dust, to be trampled
Down by every careless foot? Thou hast
Bright dreams and glowing hopes; could’st thou not live
Them out as well beneath the radiance
Of our throne as in the shadow of those
Bondage-darkened huts?
MOSES.
Within those darkened huts my mother plies her tasks,
My father bends to unrequited toil;
And bitter tears moisten the bread my brethren eat.
And when I gaze upon their cruel wrongs
The very purple on my limbs seems drenched
With blood, the warm blood of my own kindred race;
And then thy richest viands pall upon my taste,
And discord jars in every tone of song.
I cannot live in pleasure while they faint
In pain.
PRINCESS.
How like a dream the past floats bạck: it seems
But yesterday when I lay tossing upon
My couch of pain, a torpor creeping through
Each nerve, a fever coursing through my veins.
And there I lay, dreaming of lilies fair,
Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all
The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life
Its glow and flush; and thus day after day
Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn,
The breath of lilies, fainting on the air,
Floated into my room, and then I longed once more
To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face
Of a familiar friend, whose absence long
Had made a mournful void within the heart.
I summoned to my side my maids, and bade
Them place my sandals on my feet, and lead
Me to the Nile, where I might bathe my weary
Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather
Healing from the sacred stream.
I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found
New tides of vigor coursing through my veins.
Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves
And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet
Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw
A little wicker-basket hidden among
The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called
My maidens and said, “Nillias and Osiria
Bring me that little ark which floats beside
The stream.” They ran and brought me a precious burden.
'Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed
With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child;
His little hand amid his clustering curls,
And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek.
He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand
To meet the welcome of the mother's kiss,
When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back
With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment
Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother's
Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept.
Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved
That I would brave my father's wrath and save
The child; but while I stood gazing upon
His wondrous beauty, I saw beside
A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me
With an eager, questioning look, and drawing
Near, she timidly said, “shall I call a nurse?”
I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her 
Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose
Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing
With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe
Within her arms and said, “Nurse this child for me;"
And the babe nestled there like one at home,
While o'er the dimples of his face rippled
The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well
Content to leave him in her care; and well
Did she perform her part. When many days had
Passed she brought the child unto the palace;
And one morning, while I sat toying with
His curls and listening to the prattle of his
Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately,
Saw me bending o’er the child and said,
“Charmain, whose child is this? who of my lords
Calls himself father to this goodly child?
He surely must be a happy man.”
          Then I said, “Father, he is mine. He is a
Hebrew child that I have saved from death." He
Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder
Had stung him, and said, "Charmian, take that
Child hence. How darest thou bring a member
Of that mean and servile race within my doors?
Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose
Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.
Then kneeling at his feet, and catching
Hold of his royal robes, I said, “Not so,
Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched
Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled
The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has
Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy
Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has
A claim upon thy mercy.”
                                                  “Charmian," he said,
“I have decreed that every man child of that
Hated race shall die. The oracles have said
The pyramids shall wane before their shadow,
And from them a star shall rise whose light shall
Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why
I root them from the land; their strength is weakness
To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they
Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian,
Give me up the child, and let him die.”
Then clasping the child closer to my heart,
I said, "the pathway to his life is through my own;
Around that life I throw my heart, a wall
Of living, loving clay.” Dark as the thunder
Clouds of distant lands became my father's brow,
And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings
Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager
Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come
Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted
Tenderness, and he said, “Charmian, arise,
Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother
Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath
Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light
Of my home; the star that faded out too
Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life
To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake,
Not thine, I'll spare the child.” And thus I saved
Thee twice-once from the angry sword and once
From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art
Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such
I claim thee now. I've nursed no other child
Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other
Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now,
With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love.
There was a painful silence, a silence
So hushed and still that you might have almost
Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick.
Throbbing of the other's heart: for Moses,
He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent
With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed
Her full heart into her lips; but there was
Firmness in the young man's choice, and he beat back
The opposition of her lips with the calm
Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak.
MOSES.
Gracious lady, thou remembrest well
The Hebrew nurse to whom thou gavest thy foundling.
That woman was my mother; from her lips I
Learned the grand traditions of our race that float,
With all their weird and solemn beauty, around
Our wrecked and blighted fortunes. How oft!
With kindling eye and glowing cheek, forgetful
Of the present pain, she would lead us through
The distant past: the past, hallowed by deeds
Of holy faith and lofty sacrifice.
How she would tell us of Abraham,
The father of our race, that he dwelt in Ur;
Of the Chaldees, and when the Chaldean king
Had called him to his sacrifice, that he
Had turned from his dumb idols to the living
God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race,
Led by his faith in God alone; and she would
Tell us,—(we were three,) my brother Aaron,
The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse,
And I, her last, her loved and precious child;
She would tell us that one day our father
Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer
Up in sacrifice the only son of his
Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father's
Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith,
But he resolved to give his son to God
As a burnt offering upon Moriah's mount;
That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning
Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand
Harps, he heard a voice bidding him stay his hand,
And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold
Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through
Its fearful test. And then she would tell us
Of a promise, handed down from sire to son,
That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped,
Would break our chains, and bring to us a great
Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace
Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds
Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets;
And then she would lift her eyes unto the far
Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs
Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within
That promised land; and now I feel the hour
Draws near which brings deliverance to our race.
PRINCESS.
These are but the dreams of thy young fancy;
I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard
Of men who have waded through slaughter
To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles
Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men
Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads
That lay between them and a throne; but I
Never heard of men resigning ease for toil,
The splendor of a palace for the squalor
Of a hut, and casting down a diadem
To wear a servile badge.
                                        Sadly she gazed
Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty
Faith and high resolves—the dark prophetic eyes
Which seemed to look beyond the present pain
Unto the future greatness of his race.
As she stood before him in the warm
Loveliness of her ripened womanhood,
Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire,
And the bright tropical blood sent its quick
Flushes o’er the olive of her cheek, on which
Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood.
Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows
O'er her face as she stood slowly crushing
With unconscious hand the golden tassels
Of her crimson robe. She had known life only
By its brightness, and could not comprehend
The grandeur of the young man's choice; but she
Felt her admiration glow before the earnest
Faith that tore their lives apart and led him
To another destiny. She had hoped to see
The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred
Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat
The throne of the proud Pharaoh's; but now her
Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang
Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted,
She to brood in silence o'er her pain, and he
To take his mission from the hands of God
And lead his captive race to freedom.
With silent lips but aching heart she bowed
Her queenly head and let him pass, and he
Went forth to share the fortune of his race,
Esteeming that as better far than pleasures
Bought by sin and gilded o'er with vice.
And he had chosen well, for on his brow
God poured the chrism of a holy work.
And thus anointed he has stood a bright
Ensample through the changing centuries of time.
CHAPTER II.
It was a great change from the splendor, light
And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts
Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage.
                                                     As he passed
Into the outer courts of that proud palace,
He paused a moment just to gaze upon
The scenes 'mid which his early life had passed—
The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,
The fountains tossing on the air their silver spray,—
The statues breathing music soft and low
To greet the first faint flushes of the morn,—
The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur
From their stony beds—the sphynxes gaunt and grim,
With unsolved riddles on their lips—and all
The bright creation's painters art and sculptors
Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth,
And dance, and revelry, and song had chased
With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours.
He was leaving all; but no regrets came
Like a shadow o'er his mind, for he had felt
The quickening of a higher life, as if his
Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth;
And yet there was a tender light in those
Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes
Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous
Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled
On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe,
And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty
Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on
Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes,
And gorgeous temples faded from his sight,
And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view.
There he saw the women of his race kneading
Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham
Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw
The increasing pallor on his sisters cheek,
The deepening shadows on his mother's brow,
The restless light that glowed in Aaron's eye,
As if a hidden fire were smouldering
In his brain; and bending o'er his mother
In a tender, loving way, he said, “Mother,
I've come to share the fortunes of my race,—
To dwell within these lowly huts,—to wear
The badge of servitude and toil, and eat
The bitter bread of penury and pain.”
A sudden light beamed from his mother's eye,
And she said, “How's this, my son? but yesterday
Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen,
Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun
But dared not enter, only they had heard
That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst
Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed
Thy knee to Egypt's vain and heathen worship;
Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst
Be engrafted in Pharaoh's regal line,
And be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
When thy father Amram heard the cruel news
He bowed his head upon his staff and wept.
But I had stronger faith than that. By faith
I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh
Were searching 'mid our quivering heart strings,
Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove
The rushes of thine ark and laid thee 'mid
The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw
The answer to that faith when Pharaoh's daughter
Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child
For her; and by that faith sustained, I heard
As idle words the cruel news that stabbed
Thy father like a sword.”
“The Hebrews did not hear aright; last week
There was a great day in On, from Esoan’s gate
Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords
And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled;
The temple of the sun was opened. Isis
And Osiris were unveiled before the people;
Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers;
Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air;
The sacrifice was smoking on the altar;
The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables
Of the sun: the music rose in lofty swells,
Then sank in cadences so soft and low
Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture.
The priests of On were there, with sacred palms
Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their
Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting
In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear
Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear
Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On
Drew near to lay their hands upon my head
And bid me swear, ‘Now, by Osiris, judge
Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us
All,' that henceforth I'd forswear my kindred,
Tribe and race; would have no other gods
Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted
Into Pharaoh's royal line, and be called
The son of Pharaoh's daughter. Then, mother
Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat
Beside thee, my lips apart with childish
Wonder, my eager eyes uplifted to thy
Glowing face, and my young soul gathering
Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard
Thee tell the grand traditions of our race,
The blessed hopes and glorious promises
That weave their golden threads among the sombre
Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid
The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again
I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant
Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom
The promise came that in his seed should all
The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac,
Blessing with disappointed lips his first born son,
From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob,
With his warm affections and his devious ways,
Flying berore the wrath of Esau; how he
Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams
A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God's
Angels did descend, and waking, with a solemn
Awe o'ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, 'How
Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I
Knew it not.' Of Joseph, once a mighty prince
Within this land, who shrank in holy horror
From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin;
Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride
Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race,
And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord
He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made
His brethren swear that they would make his grave
Among the patriarchs of his line, because
Machpelah's cave, where Abraham bowed before
The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay
His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his
Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid
The princely dead of Egypt.
          Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met
Our father Jacob on his way, thy words
Came back as messengers of light to guide
My steps, and I refused to be called the son
Of Pharaoh's daughter. I saw the priests of On
Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping
O'er the princess' face, while Pharaoh's brow grew
Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I
Endured, as seeing him who hides his face
Behind the brightness of his glory.
And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt
To cast my lot among the people of my race.”
FLIGHT INTO MIDIAN.—CHAPTER III.
The love of Moses for his race soon found
A stern expression. Pharaoh was building
A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud,
He scrupled not at means to gain his ends.
When he feared the growing power of Israel
He stained his hands in children's blood, and held
A carnival of death in Goshen; but now
He wished to hand his name and memory
Down unto the distant ages, and instead
Of lading that memory with the precious
Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he
Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold
Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold
And hard, and heartless as himself.
                                                  And Israel was
The fated race to whom the cruel tasks
Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong
And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime,
Came to the ear of Moses, and he said,
These reports are ever harrowing my soul;
I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh's
Officers exact their labors, and see
If these things be so—if they smite the feeble
At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils
Beyond their strength–if neither age nor sex
Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods."
And Moses went to see his brethren.
                                                  'Twas eventide,
And the laborers were wending their way
Unto their lowly huts. 'Twas a sad sight,—
The young girls walked without the bounding steps
Of youth, with faces prematurely old,
As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises
Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish
Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say,
We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we've bent unto
Our burdens until our shoulders fit them,
And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude
And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast
In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes,
Which seemed to say, to day we bide our time,
And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only
Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press
Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh;
They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride
And insolence, watching the laborers
Sadly wending their way from toil to rest.
And Moses' heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly
Musing, he sought a path that led him
From the busy haunts of men. But even there
The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard
A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words,
And, looking back, he saw an officer
Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand
An aged man. Then Moses' wrath o'erflowed
His lips, and every nerve did tremble
With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he
Cried unto the smiter, “Stay thy hand; seest thou
That aged man? His head is whiter than our
Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy
Bidding because thy cruel tasks have drained
Away their strength.” The Egyptain raised his eyes
With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute
His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His
Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he
Waved a menace with his hand, saying, “back
To thy task base slave, nor dare resist the will
Of Pharaoh.” Then Moses' wrath o'erleaped the bounds
Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled
The smiter to the earth, and Israel had
One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness
Chase the flushes from the Egyptian's face,
The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance,
And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs ;
And when he knew that he was dead, he hid
Him in the sand and left him to his rest.
                                                  Another day Moses walked
Abroad, and saw two brethren striving
For mastery; and then his heart grew full
Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers
Of a common wrong: should not their wrongs more
Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division,
Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, “ye
Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?”
But they threw back his words in angry tones
And asked if he had come to judge them, and would
Mete to them the fate of the Egyptian?
Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep
His secret, that his life no more was safe
In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts
Of Arabia and became a shepherd
For the priest of Midian.
CHAPTER IV.
                    Men grow strong in action, but in solitude
Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away
The bridge on which he has walked in safety
To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat
To Pharaoh's throne, and did choose the calling
Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became
A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid
The solitudes and wilds of Midian, where he
Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith
In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe
And race. Years stole o'er him, but they took
No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight
Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face
Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire
That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened
To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart
Was just as faithful to his race as when he had
Stood in Pharaoh's courts and bade farewell
Unto his daughter.
There was a look of patient waiting on his face,
A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted
Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face,
The wings of some great destiny o'ershadowing
All his life with strange and solemn glory.
But the hour came when he must pass from thought
To action,—when the hope of many years
Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel's
Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus:
One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw
A fertile spot skirted by desert sands,—
A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip
The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks;
And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire
Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame
Sent up its jets and sprays of purest light,
And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled,
Was just as green and fresh as if the breath
Of early spring were kissing every leaf.
Then Moses said I'll turn aside to see
This sight, and as he turned he heard a voice
Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he
Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head
Upon his staff and spread his mantle о'er
His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty
Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot,
By Horeb's mount, his shrinking hands received
The burden of his God, which bade him go
To Egypt's guilty king, and bid him let
The oppressed go free.
                                                  Commissioned thus
He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought
The tents of Jethro, and said "I pray thee
Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;
And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought
To throw himself across the purpose of his soul.
Yet there was a tender parting in that home;
There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips,
And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro
And his daughters stood within the light of that and gave
Clean morn, and gave to Moses and his wife
And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells.
For he had been a son and brother in that home
Since first with manly courtesy he had filled
The empty pails of Reuel's daughters, and found
A shelter 'neath his tent when flying from
The wrath of Pharaoh.
                                                  They journeyed on,
Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back
With tender love upon the home she had left,
With all its precious memories crowding round
Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking
His path across the desert, longing once more
To see the long-lost faces of his distant home,
The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their
Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon
His youthful head their parting blessing. They
Journeyed on till morning's flush and noonday
Splendor glided into the softened, mellowed
Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep’ning
On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual
Crowned, arose before him; and there he met
His brother Aaron, sent by God to be
His spokesman and to bear him company
To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting.
They talked of home and friends until the lighter
Ripple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed:
And then they talked of Israel's bondage,
And the great deliverance about to dawn
Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses
Told him of the burning bush, and how the message
Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus
They talked until the risen moon had veiled
The mount in soft and silvery light; and then
They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed
From sleep, pursued their way until they reached
The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders
Of their race, and told them of the message
Of their Father's God. Then eager lips caught up
The words of hope and passed the joyful “news
Around, and all the people bowed their heads
And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness
To God.”
                                                  That same day
Moses sought an audience with the king. He found
Him on his throne surrounded by the princes
Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage
At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip
And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew's God
Then asked in cold and scornful tones, “Has
Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt
For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt
I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has
Overflowed her banks and filled the land
With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto
Their God, then crept in want and sorrow
To their graves. Surely Mizraim's God is strong
And Israel's is weak; then wherefore should
I heed his voice, or at his bidding break
A single yoke?” Thus reasoned that proud king,
And turned a deafened ear unto the words
Of Moses and bis brother, and yet he felt
Strangely awed before their presence, because
They stood as men who felt the grandeur
Of their mission, and thought not of themselves,
But of their message.
CHAPTER V.
On the next day Pharaoh called a council
Of his mighty men, and before them laid
The message of the brethren: then Amorphel,
Keeper of the palace and nearest lord
Unto the king, arose, and bending low
Before the throne, craved leave to speak a word.
Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man,
With oily lips well versed in flattery
And courtly speech, a supple reed ready
To bend before his royal master's lightest
Breath—Pharaoh's willing tool. He said
“Gracious king, thou has been too lenient
With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they
Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle
And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now
If thou would'st have these people dwell in peace,
Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto
Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added
Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition
And revolt.”
Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh's court,
Arose. He was an aged man, whose white
And heavy beard hung low upon his breast,
Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye,
And on his face a proud and evil look.
He had been a servant to the former king,
And wore his signet ring upon his hand.
He said, “I know this Moses well. Fourscore
Years ago Princess Charmian found him
By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did
Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all
The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood
Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood
Within his veins, would rather be a servant
Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand,
He thrust aside the honors of our dear
Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth,
But for his daughter's sake he let the trespass
Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian
In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life;
But be fled, it is said, unto the deserts
Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest
Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks
And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race
To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition
And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee,
That these men shall gather their own straw
And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.”
And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his
Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh
Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshen—
That the laborers should gather their own straw,
And yet they should not ʼminish of their tale of bricks.
                                     'Twas a sad day in Goshen;
The king's degree hung like a gloomy pall
Around their homes. The people fainted 'neath
Their added tasks, then cried unto the king,
That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed
A taunt into their ears and said, “ye are
Idle, and your minds are filled with vain
And foolish thoughts; get you into your tasks,
And ye shall not ʼminish of your tale of bricks."
                              And then they turned their eyes
Reproachfully on Moses and his brother,
And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders.
'Tis an old story now, but then 'twas new
Unto the brethren,—how God's anointed ones
Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn
To lines of living light; how hands that bring
Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel
Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth
Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows
Now bright beneath the aureola of God,
Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth.
                              There was hope for Israel,
But they did not see the golden fringes
Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold,
Grey sky, and fainted 'neath the cheerless gloom.
Moses sought again the presence of the king:
And Pharaoh's brow grew dark with wrath,
And rising up in angry haste, he said,
Defiantly, "If thy God be great, show
Us some sign or token of his power.”
Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor,
And it trembled with a sign of life;
The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing
Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green,
And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful
Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth
From Moses' side, lay coiled and panting
At the monarch's feet. With wonder open-eyed
The king gazed on the changed rod, then called
For his magicians—wily men, well versed
In sinful lore—and bade them do the same.
And they, leagued with the powers of night, did
Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses'
Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss
and angry gulp, he swallowed the living things
That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses
Show that Israel's God had greater power
Than those dark sons of night.
                                        But not by this alone
Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed
Their waters; every fountain, well and pool
Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst,
Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts.
And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life;
Millions of frogs swarmed from the stream—they clogged
The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred
Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh's bed, and hopped
Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his
Ovens and his pans.
Then came another plague, of loathsome vermin;
They were gray and creeping things, that made
Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre
Spots—things so loathsome in the land they did
Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest
Dared to lift his hand to any god with one
Of these upon him. And then the sky grew
Dark, as if a cloud were passing o'er its
Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o'er
The city, and the land was swarmed with flies.
The murrain laid their cattle low; the hail
Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts,
With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops,
And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire
Had scorched it through,
                                                  Then angry blains
And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man
And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron
Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light
Divided day from morn, nor told the passage
Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat
In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a
burden
On the air,—a darkness one might almost gather
In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came
The last dread plague—the death of the first born.
                                                  'Twas midnight,
And a startling shriek rose from each palace,
Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes
Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense
Of dread, as if the mystic angels wing
Had chilled the very air with horror.
Death! Death! was everywhere—in every home
A corpse–in every heart a bitter woe.
There were anxious fingerings for the pulse
That ne'er would throb again, and eager listenings
For some sound of life—a hurrying to and fro—
Then burning kisses on the cold lips
Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells,
And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks,
And deep and heavy groans throughout the length
And breadth of Egypt. 'Twas the last dread plague,
But it had snapped in twain the chains on which
The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed;
Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste
From out the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed
To see them gather up their flocks and herds,
And household goods, and leave the land; because they felt
That death stood at their doors as long as Israel
Lingered there; and they went forth in haste,
To tread the paths of freedom.
CHAPTER VI.
But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning
From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt's wail
Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had
Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed
Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped
Near Baalzephn.
Then Pharaoh said, “the wilderness will hem them in,
The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front,
And with my chariots and my warlike men
I'll bring them back, or mete them out their graves."
                                    Then Pharaoh's officers arose
And gathered up the armies of the king,
And made his chariots ready for pursuit.
With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun,
In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold,
Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him
Rode his mighty men, their banners floating
On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering
In the morning light; and Israel saw,
With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their
Track: then women wept in hopeless terror;
Children hid their faces in their mothers' robes,
And strong, men bowed 'their 'heads in agony and dread;
And then a bitter, angry murmur rose,—
"Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast
Brought us here to die?”
'Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow
With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts
Be strong and they should his salvation see.
"Stand still," said Moses to the fearful throng
Whose hearts were fainting in the wild,“ Stand still."
Ah, that was Moses' word, but higher and greater
Came God's watchword for the hour, and not for that
Alone, but all the coming hours of time.
"Speak ye unto the people and bid them
Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters
And smite them with thy rod.” And Moses smote
The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps,
Then lay as calm and still as lips that just
Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea
Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted
Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people's
Way was God's own wondrous masonry;
The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild
Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt's
Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light
To Israel's path. Madly rushed the hosts
Of Pharaoh upon the people's track, when
The solemn truth broke on them—that God
For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror
Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, “let
Us flee,” they cried, “from Israel, for their God
Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side."
They had trusted in their chariots, but now
That hope was vain; God had loosened every
Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each
Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still
With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered
And the thunder roared and muttered on the air,
And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered
O'er their heads, for the waves began to tremble
And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose
A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread,
A gurgling sound of horror, as "the waves
Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking
Out their place again,"and the flower and pride
Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea
Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark
Upon the shore, and the song of Israel's
Triumph was the requiem of their foes.
Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs
And down the valleys, o'er the dark and restless
Sea, rose the people's shout of triumph, going
Up in praise to God, and the very air
Seemed joyous, for the choral song of millions
Throbbed upon its viewless wings.
Then another song of triumph rose in accents
Soft and clear; “'twas the voice of Moses' sister
Rising in the tide of song. The warm blood
Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins;
The roses of her girlhood were flushing
On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor
Of long departed days, for time itself seemed
Pausing, and she lived the past again; again
The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream,
A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay;
The tender tide of rapture swept o'er her soul again
She had felt when Pharaoh's daughter had claimed
Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy
Above her rescued son. Then again she saw
Him choosing "’twixt Israel's pain and sorrow
And Egypt's pomp and pride." But now he stood
Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud
She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women
In music, dance and song, as they shouted out
Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains. 
MIRIAM'S SONG
A wail in the palace, a wail in the hut,
          The midnight is shivering with dread,
And Egypt wakes up with a shriek and a sob
          To mourn for her first-born and dead.
In the morning glad voices greeted the light,
          As the Nile with its splendor was flushed;
At midnight silence had melted their tones,
          And their music forever is hushed.
In the morning the princes of palace and court
          To the heir of the kingdom bowed down;
'Tis midnight, pallid and stark in his shroud
          He dreams not of kingdom or crown.
As a monument blasted and blighted by God,
          Through the ages proud Pharaoh shall stand,
All seamed with the vengeance and scarred with the wrath
          That leaped from God's terrible hand.
CHAPTER VII.
They journeyed on from Zuphim's sea until
They reached the sacred mount and heard the solemn
Decalogue. The mount was robed in blackness,—
Heavy and deep the shadows lay; the thunder
Crashed and roared upon the air; the lightning
Leaped from crag to crag; God's fearful splendor
Flowed around, and Sinai quaked and shuddered
To its base, and there did God proclaim
Unto their listening ears, the great, the grand,
The central and the primal truth of all
The universe—the unity of God.
                                         Only one God,—
This truth received into the world's great life,
Not as an idle dream nor speculative thing,
But as a living, vitalizing thought,
Should bind us closer to our God and link us
With our fellow man, the brothers and co-heirs
With Christ, the elder brother of our race.
Before this truth let every blade of war
Grow dull, and slavery, cowering at the light,
Skulk from the homes of men; instead
Of war bring peace and freedom, love and joy,
And light for man, instead of bondage, whips
And chains. Only one God! the strongest hands
Should help the weak who bend before the blasts
Of life, because if God is only one
Then we are the children of his mighty hand,
And when we best serve man, we also serve
Our God. Let haughty rulers learn that men
Of humblest birth and lowliest lot have
Rights as sacred and divine as theirs, and they
Who fence in leagues of earth by bonds and claims
And title deeds, forgetting land and water,
Air and light are God's own gifts and heritage
For man—who throw their selfish lives between
God's sunshine and the shivering poor—
Have never learned the wondrous depth, nor scaled
The glorious height of this great central truth,
Around which clusters all the holiest faiths
Of earth. The thunder died upon the air,
The lightning ceased its livid play, the smoke
And darkness died away in clouds, as soft
And fair as summer wreaths that lie around
The setting sun, and Sinai stood a bare
And rugged thing among the sacred scenes
Of earth.
CHAPTER VIII.
It was a weary thing to bear the burden
Of that restless and rebellious race. With
Sinai's thunders almost crashing in their ears,
They made a golden calf, and in the desert
Spread an idol's feast, and sung the merry songs
They had heard when Mizraim's songs bowed down before
Their vain and heathen gods; and thus for many years
Did Moses bear the evil manners of his race—
Their angry murmurs, fierce regrets and strange
Forgetfulness of God. Born slaves, they did not love
The freedom of the wild more than their pots of flesh.
And pleasant savory things once gathered
From the gardens of the Nile.
If slavery only laid its weight of chains
Upon the weary, aching limbs, e'en then
It were a curse; but when it frets through nerve
And flesh and eats into the weary soul,
Oh then it is a thing for every human
Heart to loathe, and this was Israel's fate,
For when the chains were shaken from their limbs,
They failed to strike the impress from their souls.
While he who'd basked beneath the radiance
Of a throne, ne'er turned regretful eyes upon
The past, nor sighed to grasp again the pleasures
Once resigned; but the saddest trial was
To see the light and joy fade from their faces
When the faithless spies spread through their camp
Their ill report; and when the people wept
In hopeless unbelief and turned their faces
Egyptward, and asked a captain from their bands
To lead them back where they might bind anew
Their broken chains, when God arose and shut
The gates of promise on their lives, and left
Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia's desert sands.
But though they slumbered in the wild, they died
With broader freedom on their lips, and for their
Little ones did God reserve the heritage
So rudely thrust aside.
THE DEATH OF MOSES.—CHAPTER X.
His work was done; his blessing lay
Like precious ointment on his people's head,
And God's great peace was resting on his soul.
His life had been a lengthened sacrifice,
A thing of deep devotion to his race,
Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt's gild
And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand
And held them with a firm and constant grasp.
But now his work was done; his charge was laid
In Joshua's hand, and men of younger blood
Were destined to possess the land and pass
Through Jordan to the other side. He too
Had hoped to enter there—to tread the soil
Made sacred by the memories of his
Kindred dead, and rest till life's calm close beneath
The sheltering vines and stately palms of that
Fair land; that hope had colored all his life's
Young dreams and sent its mellowed flushes o'er
His later years; but God's decree was otherwise.
And so he bowed his meekened soul in calm
Submission to the word, which bade him climb
To Nebo's highest peak, and view the pleasant land
From Jordan's swells unto the calmer ripples
Of the tideless sea, then die with all its
Loveliness in sight.
As he passed from Moab's grassy vale to climb
The rugged mount, the people stood in mournful groups,
Some, with quivering lips and tearful eyes,
Reaching out unconscious hands, as if to stay
His steps and keep him ever at their side, while
Others gazed with reverent awe upon
The calm and solemn beauty on his aged brow,
The look of loving trust and lofty faith
Still beaming from an eye that neither care
Nor time had dimmed. As he passed upward, tender
Blessings, earnest prayers and sad farewells rose
On each wave of air, then died in one sweet
Murmur of regretful love; and Moses stood
Alone on Nebo's mount.
                                                       Alone! not one
Of all that mighty throng who had trod with him
In triumph through the parted food was there.
Aaron had died in Hor, with son and brother
By his side; and Miriam too was gone.
But kindred hands had made her grave, and Kadesh
Held her dust. But he was all alone; nor wife
Nor child was there to clasp in death his hand,
And bind around their bleeding hearts the precious
Parting words. And yet he was not all alone,
For God's great presence flowed around his path
And stayed him in that solemn hour.
          He stood upon the highest peak of Nebo,
And saw the Jordan chafing through its gorges,
Its banks made bright by scarlet blooms
And purple blossoms. The placid lakes
And emerald meadows, the snowy crest
Of distant mountains, the ancient rocks
That dripped with honey, the hills all bathed
In light and beauty; the shady groves
And peaceful vistas, the vines opprest
With purple riches, the fig trees fruit-crowned
Green and golden, the pomegranates with crimson
Blushes, the olives with their darker clusters,
Rose before him like a vision, full of beauty
And delight. Gazed he on the lovely landscape
Till it faded from his view, and the wing
Of death's sweet angel hovered o'er the mountain's
Crest, and he heard his garments rustle through
The watches of the night.
                                   Then another, fairer, vision
Broke upon his longing gaze; 'twas the land
Of crystal fountains, love and beauty, joy
And light, for the pearly gates flew open,
And his ransomed soul went in. And when morning
O'er the mountain fringed each crag and peak with light,
Cold and lifeless lay the leader. God had touched
His eyes with slumber, giving his beloved sleep.
                    Oh never on that mountain
                    Was seen a lovelier sight
                    Than the troupe of fair young angels
                    That gathered 'round the dead.
                    With gentle hands they bore bim,
                    That bright and shining train,
                    From Nebo's lonely mountain
                    To sleep in Moab's vale.
                    But they sung no mornful dirges,
                    No solemn requiems said,
                    And the soft wave of their pinions
                    Made music as they trod.
                    But no one heard them passing,
                    None saw their chosen grave;
                    It was the angels secret
                    Where Moses should be laid.
                    And when the grave was finished,
                    They trod with golden sandals
                    Above the sacred spot,
                    And the brightest, fairest flowers
                    Sprang up beneath their tread.
                    Nor broken turf, nor hillock
                    Did e'er reveal that grave,
                    And truthful lips have never said
                    We know where he is laid.
THE MISSION OF THE FLOWERS.
          In a lovely garden, filled with fair and blooming flowers, stood a beautiful rose tree. It was the centre of attraction, and won the admiration of every eye; its beauteous flowers were sought to adorn the bridal wreath and deck the funeral bier. It was a thing of joy and beauty, and its earth mission was a blessing. Kind hands plucked its flowers to gladden the chamber of sickness and adorn the prisoner's lonely cell. Young girls wore them ʼmid their clustering curls, and grave brows relaxed when they gazed upon their wondrous beauty. Now the rose was very kind and generous hearted, and, seeing how much joy she dispensed, wished that every flower could only be a rose, and like herself have the privilege of giving joy to the children of men; and while she thus mused, a bright and lovely spirit approached her and said, “I know thy wishes and will grant thy desires. Thou shalt have power to change every flower in the garden to thine own likeness. When the soft winds come wooing thy fairest buds and flowers, thou shalt breathe gently on thy sister plants, and beneath thy influence they shall change to beautiful roses.” The rose tree bowed her head in silent gratitude to the gentle being who had granted her this wondrous power. All night the stars bent over her from their holy homes above, but she scarcely heeded their vigils. The gentle dews nestled in her arms and kissed the cheeks of her daughters; but she hardly noticed them;—she was waiting for the soft airs to awaken and seek her charming abode. At length the gentle airs greeted her, and she hailed them with a joyous welcome, and then commenced her work of change. The first object that met her vision was a tulip superbly arrayed in scarlet and gold. When she was aware of the intention of her neighbor, her cheeks flamed with anger, her eyes flashed indignantly, and she haughtily refused to change her proud robes for the garb the rose tree had prepared for her; but she could not resist the spell that was upon her, and she passively permitted the garments of the rose to enfold her yielding limbs. The verbenas saw the change that had fallen upon the tulip and dreading that a similar fate awaited them, crept closely to the ground, and, while tears gathered in their eyes, they felt a change pass through their sensitive frames, and instead of gentle verbenas they were blushing roses. She breathed upon the sleepy poppies; a deeper slumber fell upon their senses, and when they awoke, they too had changed to bright and beautiful roses. The heliotrope read her fate in the lot of her sisters, and, bowing her fair head in silent sorrow, gracefully submitted to her unwelcome destiny. The violets, whose mission was to herald the approach of spring, were averse to losing their identity. “Surely," said they, we have a mission as well as the rose;" but with heavy hearts they saw themselves changed like their sister plants. The snow drop drew around her robes of virgin white; she would not willingly exchange them for the most brilliant attire that ever decked a flower's form; to her they were the emblems of purity and innocence; but the rose tree breathed upon her, and with a bitter sob she reluctantly consented to the change. The dahlias lifted their heads proudly and defiantly; they dreaded the change, but scorned submission; they loved the fading year, and wished to spread around his dying couch their brightest, fairest flowers; but vainly they struggled, the doom was upon them, and they could not escape. A modest lily that grew near the rose tree shrank instinctively from her; but it was in vain, and with tearful eyes and trembling limbs she yielded, while a quiver of agony convulsed her frame. The marygolds sighed submissively and made no remonstrance. The garden pinks grew careless, and submitted without a murmur, while other flowers, less fragrant or less fair, paled with sorrow or reddened with anger; but the spell of the rose tree was upon them, and every flower was changed by her power, and that once beautiful garden was overrun with roses; it had become a perfect wilderness of roses; the garden had changed, but that variety which had lent it so much beauty was gone, and men grew tired of roses, for they were everywhere. The smallest violet peeping faintly from its bed would have been welcome, the humblest primrose would have been hailed with delight,—even a dandelion would have been a harbinger of joy; and when the rose saw that the children of men were dissatisfied with the change she had made, her heart grew sad within her, and she wished the power had never been given her to change her sister plants to roses, and tears came into her eyes as she mused, when suddenly a rough wind shook her drooping form, and she opened her eyes and found that she had only been dreaming. But an important lesson had been taught; she had learned to respect the individuality of her sister flowers, and began to see that they, as well as herself, had their own missions,—some to gladden the eye with their loveliness and thrill the soul with delight; some to transmit fragrance to the air; others to breathe a refining influence upon the world; some had power to lull the aching brow and soothe the weary heart and brain into forgetfulness; and of those whose mission she did not understand, she wisely concluded there must be some object in their creation, and resolved to be true to her own earth-mission, and lay her fairest buds and flowers upon the altars of love and truth.</collex:text>

POEMS
LINES TO HON. THADDEUS STEVENS
HAVE the bright and glowing visions
Faded from thy longing sight,
Like the gorgeous tints of ev'n
Mingling with the shades of night?
Didst thou hope to see thy country
Wearing Justice as a crown,
Standing foremost ’mid the nations
Worthy of the world's renown?
Didst thou think the grand fruition
Reached the fullness of its time,
When the crater of God's judgment
Overflowed the nation's crime?
That thy people, purged by fire,
Would have irur! -nother path,
Careful, lest their feet should stumble
On the cinders of God's wrath?
And again the injured negro
Grind the dreadful mills of fate,
Pressing out the fearful vintage
Of the nation's scorn and hate?
Sadder than the crimson shadows
Hung for years around our skies,
Are the hopes so fondly cherished
Fading now before thine eyes.
Not in vain has been thy hoping,
Though thy fair ideals fade,
If, like one of God's tall aloes,
Thou art rip’ning in the shade.
There is light beyond the darkness,
Joy beyond the present pain;
There is hope in God's great justice,
And the negro's rising brain.
Though before the timid counsels
Truth and Right may seem to fail,
God hath bathed his sword in judgment,
And his arm shall yet prevail.
AN APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WHEN a dark and fearful strife
Raged around the nation's life,
And the traitor plunged his steel
Where your quivering hearts could feel,
When your cause did need a friend,
We were faithful to the end.
When we stood with bated breath,
Facing fiery storms of death,
And the war-cloud, red with wrath,
Fiercely swept around our path,
Did our hearts with terror quail?
Or our courage ever fail?
When the captive, wanting bread,
Sought our poor and lowly shed,
And the blood-hounds missed his way,
Did we e'er his path betray?
Filled we not his heart with trust
As we shared with him our crust?
With your soldiers, side by side,
Helped we turn the battle's tide,
Till o'er ocean, stream and shore,
Waved the rebel flag no more,
And above the rescued sod
Praises rose to freedom's God,
But to-day the traitor stands
With the crimson on his hands,
Scowling 'neath his brow of hate,
On our weak and desolate,
With the blood-rust on the knife
Aiméd at the nation's life.
Asking you to weakly yield
All we won upon the field,
To ignore, on land and flood,
All the offerings of our blood,
And to write above our slain
"They have fought and died in vain."
To your manhood we appeal,
Lest the traitor's iron heel
Grind and trample in the dust
All our new-born hope and trust,
And the name of freedom be
Linked with bitter mockery.
TRUTH
A ROCK, for ages, stern and high,
Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,
And never bowed his baughty crest
When angry storms around him prest.
Morn springing from the arms of night
Had often bathed his brow with light,
And kissed the shadows from his face
With tender love and gentle grace.
Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
Smiled on him from the distant West,
And from her throne the dark-browed Night
Threw round his path her softest light.
And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
He bared his brow to every blast
And scorned the tempest as it passed.
One day a tiny, humble seed-
The keenest eye would hardly heed-
Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,
And found a lowly hiding place.
A ray of light, and drop of dew,
Came with a message, kind and true;
They told her of the world so bright,
Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
And lured her from her hiding place,
To gaze upon earth's glorious face.
So, peeping timid from the ground,
She clasped the ancient rock around,
And climbing up with childish grace,
She held him with a close embrace;
Her clinging was a thing of dread;
Where'er she touched a fissure spread,
And he who'd breasted many a storm
Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
So Truth dropped in the silent earth,
May seem a thing of little worth,
Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
It saps its pillars proud and strong.
DEATH OF THE OLD SEA KING.
'Twas a fearful night—the tempest raved
With loud and wrathful pride,
The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds,
And rode on the raging tide.
The sea-king lay on his bed of death.
Pale mourners around him bent,
They knew the wild and fitful life
Of their chief was almost spent.
His ear was growing dull in death
When the angry storm he heard,
The sluggish blood in the old man's veins
With sudden vigor stirred.
"I hear them call,” cried the dying man,
His eyes grew full of light,
"Now bring me here my warrior robes,
My sword and armor bright.
"In the tempest's lull I heard a voice,
I knew ’t was Odin's call.
The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed
To lead me unto his hall.
"Bear me unto my noblest ship,
Light up a funeral pyre;
I'll walk to the palace of the braves
Through a path of flame and fire.”
O! wild and bright was the stormy light
That flashed from the old man's eye,
As they bore him from the couch of death
To his battle-ship to die.
And lit with many a mournful torch
The sea-king's dying bed,
And like a banner fair and bright
The flames around him spread.
But they heard no cry of anguish
Break through that fiery wall,
With rigid brow and silent lips
He was seeking Odin's hall
Through a path of fearful splendor,
While strong men held their breath,
The brave old man went boldly forth
And calmly talked with death.
"LET THE LIGHT ENTER!" DYING WORDS OF GOETHE.
Light! more light! the shadows deepen,
And my life is ebbing low,
Throw the windows widely open!
Light! more light! before I go.
Softly let the balmy sunshine
Play around my dying bed,
E'er the dimly lighted valley
I with lonely feet shall tread.
Light! more light! for death is weaving
Shadows round my waning sight,
And I fain would gaze upon him
Through a stream of earthly light.
Not for greater gifts of genius,
Nor for thoughts more grandly bright,
All the dying poet whispers
Is a prayer for light, more light.
Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
Fading slowly from his sight;
All the poet's aspirations
Centre in that prayer for light.
Blessed Jesus, when our day dreams
Melt and vanish from the sight,
May our dim and longing vision
Then be blessed with light, more light!
YOUTH IN HEAVEN.
"In heaven the angels are advancing continually to the spring-time of their yonth, so that the oldest angel appears the youngest." --SWEDENBORG.
Not for them the length’ning shadows
Falling coldly round our lives,
Nearer, nearer through the ages
Life's new spring for them arrives.
Not for them the doubt and anguish
Of an old and loveless age,
Dropping sadly tears of sorrow
On life's faded, blotted page.
Not for them the mournful dimming
Of the weary, tear-stained eye,
That has seen the sad procession
Of its dearest hopes go by.
Not for them the hopeless clinging
To life's worn and feeble strands,
Till the last has ceased to tremble
In our agéd, withered hands.
Never lines of light and darkness
Thread the brows forever fair,
And the eldest of the angels
Seems the youngest brother there.
There the stream of life doth never
Cross the mournful plains of death,
And the pearly gates are ever
Closed against his icy breath.
DEATH OF ZOMBI,
THE CHIEF OF A NEGRO KINGDOM IN SOUTH AMERICA.
CRUEL in vengeance, reckless in wrath,
The hunters of men bore down on our path;
Inhuman and fierce, the offer they gave
Was ireedom in death or the life of a slave.
The cheek of the mother grew pallid with dread,
As the tidings of evil around us were spread,
And closer and closer she strained to her heart
The children she feared they would sever apart.
The brows of our maidens grew gloomy and sad;
Hot tears burst from eyes once sparkling and glad.
Our young men stood ready to join in the fray,
That hung as a pall 'round our people that day.
Our leaders gazed angry and stern on the strife,
For freedom to them was dearer than life.
There was mourning at home and death in the street,
For carnage and famine together did meet.
The pale lips of hunger were asking for bread,
While husbands and fathers lay bleeding and dead.
For days we withstood the tempests of wrath,
That scattered destruction and death in our path,
Till, broken and peeled, we yielded at last,
And the glory and strength of our kingdom were past.
But Zombi, our leader, and warlike old chief,
Gazed down on our woe with anger and grief;
The tyrant for him forged fetters in vain,
His freedom-girt limbs had worn their last chain.
Defiance and daring still flashed from his eye;
A freenan he'd lived and free he would die.
So he climbed to the verge of a dangerous steep,
Resolved from its margin to take a last leap;
For a fearful death and a bloody grave
Were dearer to him than the life of a slave.
Nor went he alone to the mystic land-
There were other warriors in his band,
Who rushed with him to Death's dark gate,
All wrapped in the shroud of a mournful fate.
LINES TO CHARLES SUMNER.
Thank God that thou hast spoken
Words earnest, true and brave,
The lightning of thy lips did smite
The fetters of the slaye.
I thought the shadows deepened,
Round the pathway of the slave,
As one by one his faithful friends
Were dropping in the grave.
When other hands grew feeble,
And loosed their hold on life,
Thy words rang like a clarion
For freedom's noble strife.
Thy words were not soft echoes,
Thy tones no syren song;
They fell as battle-axes
Upon our giant wrong.
God grant thy words of power
May fall as precious seeds,
That yet shall leaf and blossom
In high and holy deeds.
"SIR, WE WOULD SEE JESUS."
We would see Jesus; earth is grand,
Flowing out from her Creator's hand.
Like one who tracks his steps with light,
His footsteps ever greet our sight;
The earth below, the sky above,
Are full of tokens of his love;
But ’mid the fairest scenes we've sighed,
Our hearts are still unsatisfied.
We would see Jesus; proud and high
Temples and domes have met our eye.
We've gazed upon the glorious thought,
By earnest hands in marble wrought,
And listened where the lying feet
Beat time to music, soft and sweet;
But bow'rs of ease, and halls of pride,
Our yearning hearts ne'er satisfied.
We would see Jesus; we have heard
Tidings our in most souls have stirred,
How, from their chambers full of night,
The darkened eyes receive the light;
How, at the music of his voice,
The lame do leap, the dumb rejoice.
Anxious we 'll wait until we've seen
The good and gracious Nazarene.
THE BRIDE OF DEATH.
THEY robed her for another groom,
For her bridal couch, prepared the tomb;
From the sunny love of her marriage day
A stronger rival had won her away;
His wooing was like a stern command,
And cold was the pressure of his hand.
Through her veins he sent an icy thrill,
With sudden fear her heart stood still;
To his dusty palace the bride he led,
Her guests were the pale and silent dead.
No eye flashed forth a loving light,
To greet the bride as she came in sight,
Not one reached out a joyous hand,
To welcome her home to the mystic land.
Silent she sat in the death still hall,
For her bridal robe she wore a pall;
Instead of orange-blossoms fair,
Willow and cypress wreathed her hair.
Though her mother's kiss lay on her cheek,
Her lips no answering love could speak,
No air of life stirred in her breath,
That fair young girl was the bride of death.
THANK GOD FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.
THANK God for little children,
Bright flowers by earth's wayside,
The dancing, joyous lifeboats
Upon life's stormy tide.
Thank God for little children;
When our skies are cold and gray,
They come as sunshine to our hearts,
And charm our cares away.
I almost think the angels,
Who tend life's garden fair,
Drop down the sweet wild blossoms
That bloom around us here,
It seems a breath of heaven
Round many a cradle lies,
And every little baby
Brings a message from the skies.
The humblest home with children
Is rich in precious gems,
That shame the wealth of monarchs,
And pale their diadems.
Dear mothers, guard these jewels,
As sacred offerings meet,
A wealth of household treasures
To lay at Jesus' feet.
THE DYING FUGITIVE.
SLOWLY o'er his darkened features
Stole the warning shades of death,
And we knew the mystic angel
Waited for his parting breath.
He had started for his freedom,
And his heart beat firm and high;
But before he won the guerdon
Came the message-he must die.
He must die when just before him
Lay the longed-for precious prize,
And the hopes that lit him onward
Faded out before his eyes.
For awhile a fearful madness
Rested on his weary brain,
And he thought the hateful tyrant
Had rebound his galling chain.
Then he cried in bitter anguish,
Take me where that good man dwells,
For a name to freedom precious
Lingered ’mid life's shattered cells.
But as sunshine gently stealing
On the storm-cloud's gloomy track,
Through the tempests of his bosom
Came the light of reason back.
And, without a sigh or murnur
For the friends he'd left behind,
Calmly yielded he his spirit
To the Father of mankind.
Thankful that so near to freedom
He with eager feet had trod,
Ere his ransom'd spirit rested
On the bosom of his God,
BURY ME IN A FREE LAND.
MAKE me a grave where'er you will,
In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill,
Make it among earth's humblest graves,
But not in a land where men are slaves.
I could not rest if around my grave
I heard the steps of a trembling slave:
His shadow above my silent tomb
Would make it a place of fearful gloom.
I could not rest if I heard the tread
Of a coffie gang to the shambles led,
And the mother's shriek of wild despair
Rise like a curse on the trembling air.
I could not sleep if I saw the lash
Drinking her blood at each fearful gash,
And I saw her babes torn from her breast,
Like trembling doves from their parent nest.
I'd shudder and start if I heard the bay
Of blood-hounds seizing their human prey,
And I heard the captive plead in vain
As they bound afresh his galling chain.
If I saw young girls from their mothers' arms
Bartered and sold for their youthful charms,
My eye would flash with a mournful flame,
My death-paled cheek grow red with shame.
I would sleep, dear friends, where bloated might
Can rob no man of his dearest right;
My rest shall be calm in any grave
Where none can call his brother slave.
I ask no monument, proud and high,
To arrest the gaze of the passers by;
All that my yearning spirit craves,
Is bury me not in a land of slaves.
THE FREEDOM BELL.
Ring, aye, ring the freedom bell,
And let its tones be loud and clear;
With glad hosannas let it swell
Until it reach the Bondman's ear.
Through pain that wrings the life apart,
And spasms full of deadly strife,
And throes that shake the nation's heart,
The fainting land renews her life.
Where shrieks and groans distract the air,
And sods grow red with crimson rain,
The ransom'd slave shall kneel in prayer
And bury deep his rusty chain.
Where cheeks now pale with sickening dread,
And brows grow dark with cruel wrath,
Shall Fredom's banner wide be spread
And Hope and Peace attend her path.
White-robed and pure her feet shall move
O'er rifts of ruin deep and wide;
Her hands shall span with lasting love
The chasms rent by hate and pride.
Where waters, blush'd with human gore,
Unsullied streams shall purl along;
Where crashed the battle's awful roar
Shall rise the Freeman's joyful song.
Then ring, aye, ring the freedom bell,
Proclaiming all the nation free;
Let earth with sweet thanksgiving swell
And heaven catch up the melody.
MARY AT THE FEET OF CHRIST.
He stood at Jesus' feet,
And bathed them with her tears,
While o'er her spirit surg'd
The guilt and shame of years.
Though Simon saw the grief
Upon the fair young face,
The stern man coldly thought
For her this is no place.
Her feet have turned aside
From paths of truth and right,
If Christ a prophet be
He'll spurn her from his sight.
And silently he watched
The child of sin and care,
Uncoil upon Christ's feet
Her wealth of raven hair.
O Life! she sadly thought,
I know thy bane and blight,
And yet I fain would find
The path of peace and right.
I've seen the leper cleansed,
I've seen the sick made whole,
But mine's a deeper wound-
It eats into the soul.
And men have trampled down
The beauty once their prize,
While women pass me by
With cold, averted eyes.
But now a hope of peace
Steals o'er my weary breast,
And from these lips of love
There comes a sense of rest.
The tender, loving Christ
Gazed on her tearful eyes,
Then saw on Simon's face
A look of cold surprise.
Simon," the Saviour said,
"Thou wast to me remiss,
I came thy guest, but thou
Didst give no welcome kiss.
"Thou broughtest from thy fiunt
No water cool and sweet,
But she, with many tears,
Hath bent and kissed my feet.
" Thou pouredst on my head
No oil with kindly care,
But she anoints my feet,
And wipes them with her hair.
"I know her steps have strayed,
Her sins they many be,
But she with love hath bound
Her erring heart to me.”
How sweetly fell his words
Upon her bruised heart,
When, like a ghastly train,
She felt her sins depart.
What music heard on earth,
Or rapture moving heaven
Were like those precious words--
" Thy sins are all forgiven !"
THE MOTHER'S BLESSING.
Oh, my soul had grown so weary
With its many cares opprest,
All my heart's high aspirations
Languish'd in a prayer for rest.
I was like a lonely stranger
Pining in a distant land,
Bearing on her lips a language
None around her understand.
Longing for a close communion
With some kindred mind and heart,
But whose language is a jargon
Past her skill, and past her art.
God in mercy looked upon me,
Saw my fainting, pain and strife,
Sent to me a blest evangel,
Through the gates of light and life.
Then my desert leafed and blossom'd,
Beauty decked its deepest wild,
Hope and joy, peace and blessing,
Met me in my first-born child.
When the tiny hands, so feeble,
Brought me smiles and joyful tears,
Lifted from my life the shadows,
That had gathered there for years.
God, I thank thee for the blessing
That at last has crown'd my life,
Soothed its weary, lonely anguish,
Stay'd its fainting, calm’d its strife.
Gracious Parent! guard and shelter
In thine arms my darling child
Till she treads the streets of jasper,
Glorified and undefiled.
VASHTI.
She leaned her head upon her hand
And heard the king's decree-
"My lords are feasting in my halls,
Bid Vashti come to me.
"I've shown the treasures of my house,
My costly jewels rare,
But with the glory of her eyes
No rubies can compare.
" Adorn'd and crown'd I'd have her come,
With all her queenly grace,
And, 'mid my lords and mighty men,
Unveil her lovely face.
"Each gem that sparkles in my crown,
Or glitters on my throne,
Grows poor and pale when she appears,
My beautiful, my own!"
All waiting stood the chamberlains
To hear the Queen's reply,
They saw her cheek grow deathly pale,
But light flash'd to her eye:
"Go, tell the King,” she proudly said,
" That I am Persia's Queen,
And by his crowds of merry men
I never will be seen.
"I'll take the crown from off my head
And tread it ’neath my feet
Before their rude and careless gaze
My shrinking eyes shall meet.
"A queen unveil'd before the crowd !-
Upon each lip my name ! -
Why, Persia's women all would blush
And weep for Vashti's shame!
"Go back !" she cried, and waived her hand,
And grief was in her eye:
"Go, tell the King,” she sadly said,
"That I would rather die."
"They brought her message to the King,
Dark flash'd his angry eye;
’T was as the lightning ere the storm
Hath swept in fury by.
Then bitterly outspoke the King,
Through purple lips of wrath-
What shall be done to her who dares
To cross your monarch's path ?”
Then spake his wily counsellors-
"O King of this fair land!
From distant Ind to Ethiop,
All bow to thy command.
"But if, before thy servants' eyes,
This thing they plainly see,
That Vashti doth not heed thy will
Nor yield herself to thee,
"The women, restive 'neath our rule,
Would learn to scorn our name,
And from her deed to us would come
Reproach and burning shame.
"Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand
This stern but just decree,
That Vashti lay aside her crown,
Thy Queen no more to be.”
She heard again the King's command,
And left her high estate,
Strong in her earnest womanhood,
She calmly met her fate,
And left the palace of the King,
Proud of her spotless name-
A woman who could bend to grief,
But would not bow to shame.
THE CHANGE.
The blue sky arching overhead,
The green turf 'neath my daily tread,
All glorified by freedom's light,
Grow fair and lovely to my sight.
The very winds that sweep along
Seemed burdened with a lovely song,
Nor shrieks nor groans of grief or fear,
Float on their wings and pain my ear.
No more with dull and aching breast,
Roused by the horn--I rise from rest
Content and cheerful with my lot,
I greet the sun and leave my cot.
For darling child and loving wife
I toil with newly waken'd life;
The light that lingers round her smile
The shadows from my soul beguile.
The pratile of my darling boy
Fills my old heart with untold joy;
Before his laughter, mirth and song
Fade out long scores of grief and wrong.
Oh, never did the world appear
So lovely to my eye and ear,
'Till Freedom came, with Joy and Peace,
And bade my hateful bondage cease!
THE DYING MOTHER.
COME ņearer to me, husband,
Now the aching leaves my breast,
But my eyes are dim and weary,
And to-night I fain would rest.
Clasp me closer to your bosom
Ere I calmly sleep in death;
With your arms enfolded round me
I would yield my parting breath.
Bring me now my darling baby,
God's own precious gift of love,
Tell her she must meet her mother
In the brighter world above.
When her little feet grow stronger
To walk life's paths untrod,
That earnest, true and hopeful,
She must lay her hands on God.
Tell my other little children
They must early seek His face;
That His love is a strong tower,
And His arms a hiding place.
Tell them—but my voice grows fainter--
Surely, husband, this is death--
Tell them that their dying mother
Bless'd them with her latest breath.
WORDS FOR THE HOUR.
MEN of the North! it is no time
To quit the battle-field;
When danger fronts your rear and van
It is no time to yield.
No time to bend the battle's crest
Before the wily foe,
And, ostrich-like, to hide your heads
From the impending blow.
The minions of a baffled wrong
Are marshalling their clan,
Rise up! rise up, enchanted North !
And strike for God and man.
This is no time for careless ease;
No time for idle sleep;
Go light the fires in every camp,
And solemn sentries keep.
The foe ye foiled upon the field
Has only changed his base;
New dangers crowd around you
And stare you in the face.
O Northern men! within your hands
Is held no common trust;
Secure the victories won by blood
When treason bit the dust.
'T is yours to banish from the land
Oppression's iron rule;
And o’er the ruin'd auction-block
Erect the common school.
To wipe from labor's branded brow
The curse that shamed the land;
And teach the Freedman how to wield
The ballot in his hand.
This is the nation's golden hour,
Nerve every heart and hand,
To build on Justice, as a rock,
The future of the land.
True to your trust, oh, never yield
One citadel of right!
With Truth and Justice clasping hands
Ye yet shall win the fight!
PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S PROCLAMATION OF FREEDOM.
It shall flash through coming ages;
It shall light the distant years;
And eyes now dim with sorrow
Shall be clearer through their tears.
It shall flush the mountain ranges;
And the valleys shall grow bright;
It shall bathe the hills in radiance,
And crown their brows with light.
It shall flood with golden splendor
All the huts of Caroline,
And the sun-kissed brow of labor
With lustre new shall shine.
It shall gild the gloomy prison,
Darken’d by the nation's crime,
Where the dumb and patient millions
Wait the better coming time.
By the light that gilds their prison,
They shall seize its mould’ring key,
And the bolts and bars shall vibrate
With the triumphs of the free.
Like the dim and ancient chaos,
Shrinking from the dawn of light.
Oppression, grim and hoary,
Shall cower at the sight.
And her spawn of lies and malice
Shall grovel in the dust,
While joy shall thrill the bosoms
Of the merciful and just.
Though the morning seemed to linger
O'er the hill-tops far away,
Now the shadows bear the promise
Of the quickly coming day.
Soon the mists and murky shadows
Shall be fringed with crimson light,
And the glorious dawn of freedom
Break refulgent on the sight.
TO A BABE SMILING IN HER SLEEP.
Tell me, did the angels greet thee?
Greet my darling when she smiled ?
Did they whisper, softly, gently,
Pleasant thoughts unto my child ?
Did they whisper, 'mid thy dreaming,
Thoughts that made thy spirit glad ?
Of the joy-lighted city,
Where the heart is never sad ?
Did they tell thee of the fountains,
Clear as crystal, fair as light,
And the glory-brightened country,
Never shaded by a night?
Of life's pure, pellucid river,
And the tree whose leaves do yield
Healing for the wounded nations-
Nations smitten, bruised and peeled ?
Of the city, ruby-founded,
Built on gems of flashing light,
Paling all earth's lustrous jewels,
And the gates of pearly white ?
Darling, when life's shadows deepen
Round thy prison-house of clay,
May the footsteps of God's angels
Ever linger round thy way.
THE ARTIST.
He stood before his finished work;
His heart beat warm and high;
But they who gazed upon the youth
Knew well that he must die.
For many days a fever fierce
Had burned into his life;
But full of high impassioned art,
He bore the fearful strife.
And wrought in extacy and hope
The image of his brain;
He felt the death throes at his heart,
But labored through the pain.
The statue seemed to glow with life-
A costly work of art;
For it he paid the fervent blood
From his own eager heart.
With kindling eye and flushing cheek
But slowly laboring breath,
He gazed upon his finished work,
Then sought his couch of death.
And when the plaudits of the crowd
Came like the south wind's breath,
The dreamy, gifted child of art
Had closed his eyes in death.
JESUS.
COME speak to me of Jesus,
I love that precious name,
Who built a throne of power
Upon a cross of shame.
Unveil to me the beauty
That glorifies his face-
The fullness of the Father
The image of his grace.
My soul would run to meet Him;
Restrain me not with creeds;
For Christ, the hope of glory,
Is what my spirit needs.
I need the grand attraction,
That centres 'round the ciosa,
To change the gilded things of earth,
To emptiness and dross.
My feet are prone to wander,
My eyes to turn aside,
And yet I fain would linger,
With Christ the crucified.
I want a faith that's able
To stand each storm and shock--
A faith forever rooted,
In Christ the living Rock.
FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.
BENEATH the burden of our joy
Tremble, O wires, from East to West!
Fashion with words your tongues of fire,
To tell the nation's high behest.
Outstrip the winds, and leave behind
The murmur of the restless waves;
Nor tarry with your glorious news,
Amid the ocean's coral caves.
Ring out! ring out! your sweetest chimes,
Ye bells, that call to prayer;
Let every heart with gladness thrill,
And songs of joyful triumph raise.
Shake off the dust, rising race!
Crowned as a brother and a man;
Justice to-day asserts her claim,
And from thy brow fades out the ban.
With freedom's chrism upon thy head,
Her precious ensign in thy hand,
Go place thy once despised name
Amid the noblest of the land.
O ransomed race! give God the praise,
Who led thee through a crimson sea,
And ’mid the storm of fire and blood,
Turned out the war-cloud's light to thee.
RETRIBUTION.
JUDGMENT slumbered. God in mercy
Stayed his strong avenging hand;
Sent them priests and sent them prophets,
But they would not understand.
Judgment lingered; men, grown bolder,
Gloried in their shame and guilt;
And the blood of God's poor childrep
Was as water freely spilt.
Then arose a cry to heaven,
Deep and startling, sad and wild,
Sadder than the wail of Egypt,
Mourning for the first-born child.
For the sighing of the needy
God at length did bare his hand,
And the footsteps of his judgments
Echoed through the guilty land.
Oh! the terror, grief and anguish;
Oh! the bitter, fearful strife,
When the judgments of Jehovah
Pressed upon the nation's life.
And the land did reel and tremble
Neath the terror of his frown,
For its guilt lay heavy on it,
Pressing like an iron crown.
As a warning to the nations,
Bathed in blood and swathed in tire,
Lay the once oppressing nation,
Smitten by God's fearful ire.
THE SIN OF ACHAN.
Night closed o'er the battling army,
But it brought them no success;
Victory perched not on their banners;
Night was full of weariness.
Flushed and hopeful in the morning,
Turned they from their leader's side:
Routed, smitten and defeated,
Care they back at eventide.
Then in words of bitter mourning
Joshua's voice soon arose :
" Tell us, I thou God of Jacob,
Why this triumph of our foes?”
To his pleading came the answer
Why the hosts in fear did yield:
" 'Twas because a fearful trespass
'Mid their tents did lie concealed.”
Clear and plain before His vision,
With whom darkness is as light,
Lay the spoils that guilty Achan
Covered from his brethren's sight.
From their tents they purged the evil
That had ruin round them spread;
Then they won the field of battle,
Whence they had in terror fled.
Through the track of many ages
Comes this tale of woe and crime;
Let us read it as a lesson
And a warning for our time.
Oh, for some strong-hearted Joshua !
Faithful to his day and time,
Who will wholly rid the nation
Of her clinging curse and crime.
Till she writes on every banner
All beneath these folds are free,
And the oppressed and groaning millions
Shout the nation's Jubilee.
LINES TO MILES O'REILEY.
You've heard no doubt of Irish bulls,
And how they blunder, thick and fast;
But of all the queer and foolish things,
O'Reiley, you have said the last.
You say we brought the rebs supplies,
And gave them aid amid the fight,
And if you must be ruled by rebs,
Instead of black you want them white.
You blame us that we did not rise,
And pluck war from a fiery brand,
When Little Mac said if we did,
He'd put us down with iron hand.
And when we sought to join your ranks,
And battle with you, side by side,
Did men not curl their lips with scorn,
And thrust us back with hateful pride?
And when at last we gained the field,
Did we not firmly, bravely stand,
And help to turn the tide of death,
That spread its ruin o'er the land?
We hardly think we're worse than those
Who kindled up this fearful strife,
Because we did not seize the chance
To murder helpless babes and wife,
And had we struck, with vengeful hand,
The rebel where he most could feel,
Were you not ready to impale
Our hearts upon your Northern steel?
O'Reiley, men like you should wear
The gift of song like some bright crown,
Nor worse than ruffians of the ring,
Strike at a man because he's down.
THE LITTLE BUILDERS.
YE are builders little builders,
Not with mortar, brick and stone,
But your work is far more glorious—-
Ye are building freedom's throne.
Where the ocean never slumbers
Works the coral 'neath the spray,
By and by a reef or island
Rears its head to greet the day
Then the balmy rains and sunshine
Scatter treasures o’er the soil,
"Till a place for human footprints,
Crown the little builder's toil.
When the stately ships sweep o'er them,
Cresting all the sea with foam,
Little think these patient toilers,
They are building man a home.
Do you ask me, precious children,
How your little hands can build,
That you love the name of freedom,
But your fingers are unskilled?
Not on thrones or in proud temples,
Does fair freedom seek her rest;
No, her chosen habitations,
Are the hearts that love her best.
Would you gain the highest freedona?
Live for God and man alone,
Then each heart in freedon's temple,
Will be like a living stone.
Fill your minds with useful knowledge,
Learn to love the true and right;
Thus you'll build the throne of freedom,
On a pedestal of light.
THE DYING CHILD TO HER BLIND FATHER.
DEAR father, I hear a whisper,
It tells me that I must go,
And my heart returns her answer
In throbbings so faint and low.
I'm sorry to leave you, father,
I know you will miss me so,
And the world for you will gather
A gloomier shade of woe.
You will miss me, dearest father,
When the violets wake from sleep,
And timidly from their hedges
The early snow-drops peep,
I shall not be here to gather
The flowers by stream and dell,
The bright and beautiful flowers,
Dear Father, you love so well.
You will miss my voice, dear father,
From every earthly tone,
All the songs that cheered your darkness,
And you'll be so sad and lone.
I can scarcely rejoice, dear father,
In hope of the brighter land,
When I know you 'll pine in sadness,
And miss my guiding hand.
You are weeping, dearest father,
Your sobs are shaking my soul,
but we'll meet again where the shadow
And night from your eyes shall roll.
And then you will see me, father,
With visions undimmed and clear,
Your eyes will sparkle with rapture--
You know there's no blindness there.
LIGHT IN DARKNESS.
WE'VE room to build holy altars
Where our crumbling idols lay;
We've room for heavenly visions,
When our earth dreams fade away.
Through rifts and rents in our fortune
We gazed with blinding tears,
Till glimpses of light and beauty
Gilded our gloomy fears.
An angel stood at our threshold,
We thought him a child of night,
Till we saw the print of his steps
Made lines of living light.
We had much the world calls precious;
We had heaps of shining dust;
He laid his hand on our treasures,
And wrote on them moth and rust.
But still we had other treasures,
That gold was too poor to buy,
We clasped them closer and closer,
But saw them fade and die.
Our spirit grew faint and heavy,
Deep shadows lay on our years,
Till light from the holy city,
Streamed through our mist of tears.
And we thanked the chastening angel
Who shaded our earthly light,
For the light and beautiful visions
That broke on our clearer sight.
Our first view of the Holy City
Came through our darken'd years,
The songs that lightened our sorrows,
We heard ʼmid our night of tears.

WALDEN'S
MISCELLANEOUS POEMS
WHICH THE AUTHOR DESIRES TO DEDICATE
TO THE CAUSE OF EDUCATION AND HUMANITY.
SECOND EDITION.
WASHINGTON:
PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR.
1873.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
WASHINGTON, D. C., JULY 26, 1872.
I believe the facts as stated in the following Introduction to be strictly true, and take pleasure in commending ISLAY WALDEN to a generous public for such aid as can be given him, in his effort to obtain an education. 
A. L. BARBER,
Prof. Nat. Phil. and Prin. Nor. Dept. H. U.
WAR DEPARTMENT,
PAYMASTER GENERAL'S OFFICE,
Washington, August 1, 1872.
I take pleasure in commending to the reading public the author of this work, Mr. ISLAY WALDEN, now of this city. Of the worth of his writings I leave careful readers to judge; of his own worth-his perseverance, integrity and Christian character-I can speak in terms of praise, after years of careful observation. From the time of his coming to Washington, in the winter of 1867-'68, up to the present date, I have watched with interest and pride his steady growth in grace, his rapid mental development, his unceasing devotion to principle, and his earnest labors in behalf of the poor of his race, who surely will, in days to come, remember and bless him for his coun- sels. His work in organizing Sabbath Schools among the poor colored children of this city, as well as his labors among those who could not thus be reached, by reason of their in- firmities, we know and cannot too highly approve. And all this persevering study, this devotion to duty, is the more to be commended, as we remember his affliction, a defective vision-at times almost blindness-which alone would have served to keep a less devoted servant in the background.
I trust this his first venture will meet with the success it deserves; that his quaint rhymes may please and profit all who read them; that, whatever may be the faults of metre, critics will not lose sight of the eloquence, originality and real beauty of thought that are found in his work.

INTRODUCTION.
ISLAY WALDEN was born a slave in Randolph County North Carolina. His master died when he was an infant, and he was sold twice in his mother's arms. When eight or ten years old he attracted a good deal of attention by his ingenuity in the use of carpenter's tools, and for great aptness in reckon- ing. His master would take him to market to make his calcu- lations for him, and bets were frequently made by himself and friends on Islay's being able to perform certain difficult cal- culations in three minutes time. These calculations were all mental; he never had the least training from books. His master learned to value his services in keeping things in order about the place, making little repairs, etc., so that he was never put to hard work.
From the failure of his owners, he changed hands several times. His mother died when he was about eight years old. When about eighteen years old he was engaged at a gold mine in driving oxen. The owner* was a very passionate man, and was 30 angry one day that he was about to strike an ox to the ground with a mattock. Walden remonstrated, saying, "The ox will die." It fell dead in a few moments. They threw its body into a pit where a shaft had been sunk, and while they were standing over it Walden made and re- cited impromptu his first verses—
*Of this gentleman, [Mr. JOHN MERTON,] and his estimable family, Isley Walden speaks in warm terms of commendation, a rivalry seeming to exist among them as to who could do the most to contribute to his gen- eral comfort, whether at his labors as a slave, or as careful and sympa thizing attendants in sickness.
"Poor Old Dick,
He died quick!
He died all in a minute.
Here is a shaft thirty feet,
And we have thrown him in it.
He was red,
And he is dead!
The buzzards may forsake him;
For he is buried thirty feet,
Where they can never get him."
After he had repeated this the man says, "Walden, you are a poet." Walden asked, "What is a poet?" He replied, "One who writes poetry." "What is poetry?" asked Walden.
The man explained by asking him if he did not know what hymns are? &amp;c. From this time he was running over rhymes in his head, and longing to learn. The second poem was composed on the occasion of his being attacked by a drunken man. A mob collected, and he was in danger of being killed if caught. While hiding from them under a tree he composed the lines beginning- "Now here I lie upon the ground." The surrender of General Lee occurred while he was at the mine. He left there soon after, and went from one mine to another, in North Carolina, until he came to Washington, searching for glasses to enable him to study.
He came on foot, the snow falling during part of the jour- ney. He was told by some he was too old to learn; by others that his eyes were so poor he could never study. After a good deal of wandering about he met Dr. Nichols at a preaching service at Howard University. He gave him the first real encouragement.
He composed some political ballads, which he had printed and went about the street selling them-all the time trying to find some help for his eyes, or some school where they  would teach him. He lived in this way three years, extending his travels through parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
While in New Jersey he attracted the attention of the Second Reformed Church in New Brunswick, which, through Professor Atherton, pledged one hundred and fifty dollars a year to- wards his school expenses until he should graduate.
Dr. Nichols was still his friend, and when he made applica- tion to enter Howard University a year ago his daughter taught him, patiently and faithfully, for three weeks. At the end of that time he was able to write something which re- sembled his name, read pretty well in the Second Reader, and worked examples in long division. He entered the lowest class three months behind it. At the end of six months he skipped a class, and joined another a year in advance of the one which he first entered.
Since he has been in the University he has composed a number of pieces suggested by passing events characteristic of school matters, &amp;c., which he has collected in this little book. He wishes to sell them during his vacation, to make a sum sufficient for extra expenses during another year. We do not claim great poetical merit, but think the effort worthy of encouragement. His stock of words is necessarily small, as he had no knowledge of books until within the past year.
C. C. H.
[NOTE--The proper name of the author of this little volume is Alfred Islay Walden, but, for the reason that when but a young lad a man was hung, in the same County in which he resided, with the surname of Alfred the name become repulsive to the ear of the unlettered boy, and he mentally resolved to abjure the name. Since that time he has been known only by the name of Islay Walden.]
POEMS.
INTRODUCTORY VERSES.
I WILL record each little rhyme,
Although it may not be sublime,
Shall I despise the day though small?
Can I forget my Saviour's call?
Help me to love each little thing
From which the great and noble spring!
It's very true, yet it can be,
That drops of water fill the sea?
The mustard seed is very small;
The tree it brings is great and tall,
It spreads its branches far around,
Among its boughs the birds abound.
I then may do some noble deeds,
When I have sown these little seeds,
If one should fall in some one's heart,
And give to him an upward start.
Unseen the sparrow does not fall,
For Jesus Christ takes note of all.
The little ant is smaller yet,
And we may go and learn of it.
A single tear from weeping eyes,
Is like the rain drops from the skies,
For each one does its office fill,
And I should do my Saviour's will.
Now if the spiders were to say,
Just take these little webs away,
Would they succeed in catching flies,
Or would the Bible call them wise?
The locusts are without a king,
And yet they make the forest ring!
The coney I will not omit,
Because 'tis small and full of wit.
When Jesus left the shining sky,
And came on earth, for man to die,
He gave His life upon the tree,
That he might make sin's captive free.
He did not seek to dwell with kings,
Nor did he slight the minor things;
I know that he was meek and mild,
And sought to bless each little child.
And when he said, Go forth and preach,
Did he not also bid to teach?
Although my talent may be small,
My Saviour will require it all.
THE DANGER.
Now here I lie upon the ground,
I wonder if I shall be found,
There's nothing but this little pine
By which in safety to recline.
 Now it is standing on this hill,
And if I'm safe it is God's will;
But should I now be called to die,
On wings of love I soon would fly.
 I hear the crew, now passing by,
And wonder if they 'll me descry;
For I can hear them loud proclaim,
While swearing vengeance on my name.
 I see them going hand in hand,
And hear them in their noisy band,
I hear their guns and pistols crack,
As though they were returning back.
 Jesus, to Thee I lift my prayer,
That Thou would'st save me from despair;
For they are drawing near the place
Where I have sought to hide my face.
 For now they pass and do not see,
And surely I shall soon be free,
So, let me rise upon my feet;
It may be that I can retreat.
 The little ant is smaller yet,
And we may go and learn of it.
A single tear from weeping eyes,
Is like the rain drops from the skies,
 For each one does its office fill,
And I should do my Saviour's will.
Now if the spiders were to say,
Just take these little webs away,
 Would they succeed in catching flies,
Or would the Bible call them wise?
The locusts are without a king,
And yet they make the forest ring!
 The coney I will not omit,
Because 'tis small and full of wit.
When Jesus left the shining sky,
And came on earth, for man to die,
 He gave His life upon the tree,
That he might make sin's captive free.
He did not seek to dwell with kings,
Nor did he slight the minor things;
 I know that he was meek and mild,
And sought to bless each little child.
And when he said, Go forth and preach,
Did he not also bid to teach?
Although my talent may be small,
My Saviour will require it all.
THE DANGER.
Now here I lie upon the ground,
I wonder if I shall be found,
There's nothing but this little pine
By which in safety to recline.
 Now it is standing on this hill,
And if I'm safe it is God's will
But should I now be called to die,
On wings of love I soon would fly.
 I hear the crew, now passing by,
And wonder if they 'll me descry;
For I can hear them loud proclaim,
While swearing vengeance on my name.
 I see them going hand in hand,
And hear them in their noisy band,
I hear their guns and pistols crack,
As though they were returning back.
 Jesus, to Thee I lift my prayer,
That Thou would'st save me from despair;
For they are drawing near the place
Where I have sought to hide my face.
 For now they pass and do not see,
And surely I shall soon be free,
So, let me rise upon my feet;
It may be that I can retreat.
 How near they came unto the pine
By which, in fear, I did recline;
The distance measured in good fix,
The feet were number thirty-six.
TO S. S. N.
SARAH, thy name shall ever live!
Shall have the best place in my heart,
For the instruction thou didst give,
When others bade me to depart.
 Stretch forth thy loving, gentle hands,
And bid the needy come to thee,
For there are many in the land,
Who gladly seek to learn of thee.
 Thy gentle hand shalt bless the poor,
Shall wipe away the tears they shed;
And from thy bounty I am sure,
The poor and needy shall have bread.
 Thy steadfast feet shall tread the way,
That saints and angels long have trod
If thou wilt only watch and pray,
And seek to serve the living God.
DOUBTS AND FEARS.
 
IT WAS the time of fear and dread,
I looked to Calvary;
I had not where to lay my head,
My Saviour pitied me.
He seemed to speak in words unknown,
Looking from Calvary;
He seemed to say, why weep and moan
Oh! why not come to me?
 My answer was, I could not come
With sins so much oppressed;
While they were rising, one by one,
Upon my weary breast.
 Jesus, the Son of God, still lives,
And scatters doubts and fear;
His power the sins of all forgives,
And bids them disappear.
 JESUS, MY FRIEND.
JESUS, thy love did leave its charms
Engraved upon my heart;
Thou bad'st me fly unto thine arms,
 And from my sins depart.
 It was the time I came to thee,
With sin so much oppressed,
It was thy love that rescued me,
 And gave my spirit rest.
 But since that time I've gone astray,
My love is cold to Thee,
And I am in the crooked way,
 Thy light I cannot see.
 O could I see thy love again,
Come beaming from the sky,
And know that I am free from sin,
And feel that thou art nigh!
 I would no longer linger here,
And sink with fear and shame,
But I would seek the cross to bear,
And own my Saviour's name.
 Now let me to my Saviour go,
And lean upon his breast,
Where peace and love forever flow,
In heaven, among the blest.
[The above lines are the second religious ones ever com
posed by me, and these were suggested to me on a pleasant
Sabbath day, when returning from Sabbath school; and, mu-
sing on my soul's welfare, both in time and in eternity, I was
suddenly aroused by some very wicked boys who were
spending the Lord's day in idle sport, smoking and swearing,
thus profaning God's name and day. I wondered how long
man will be permitted to disregard the Bible, and violate the
laws of the land!--How long he will shut himself out from
good society, and bind himself in fetters of sin and death?-the
death that never dies! May they soon hear, turn and ive.]
EULOGY ON A CLASSMATE.
TO E. E. S.
SWEET and pleasant are thy features,
Kind, and lovely are thy ways,
Fairer than ten thousand creatures,
The brightest vision of my days!
 I mark thy steps from day to day,
And know that they are firm and true,
I only wish a word to say;
Take heed to all you speak or do.
 From thy door a glancing look,
Upon my heart what wonders wrought!
Thy smiles from me my sorrows took.
Oh, how I felt! Oh, what I thought!
 Now let me to yon garden go,
Where flowers bloom so fair and gay,
There I shall find some one I know,
Who will entice me there to stay.
 Among the flowers, great and small,
The sweetness I will much admire;
Till one I find amidst them all,
That I may pick, and then retire.
 Art thou not in gorgeous green,
Where all the living flowers grow,
How is it that thou art the queen
Of all who see, and all who know?
 But for myself, let me employ,
Ten thousand tongues, this one to aid,
That I may speak my inward joy,
When thee I see, thou pretty maid.
 Kind Miss, I thee must bid adieu,
To thee, and all who thee surround;
But let me say, there's none like thee,
In all the world, that I have found.
PRAYER FOR THE SCHOOL.
JESUS, my Saviour, and my King,
Oh, grant this school a song to sing,
That we together here may meet,
And bow and worship at thy feet.
 And when we shall have left this place,
Then give us of thy richest grace,
And lead each one unto his home,
That we may praise thee on thy throne!
 And if we here shall meet no more,
Then let us meet on Canaan's shore,
Where we may walk the streets around,
And wear a robe, and starry crown.
TEMPERANCE.
STRETCH forth thy loving gentle hand
And raise thy banner to the sky,
Go, save the drunkards of the land,
When others shall have passed them by.
 Oh, stretch thy net across the sea,
And gather in both great and small,
Yes, bid the drunkards come to thee,
And save them from the dreadful fall.
 Thy ship is anchored near the shore,
Ten thousand stand upon her deck,
And she can carry thousands more.
Fearless of winds, or storms, or wreck.
 How millions gather thick around,
With each eye fixed upon her sails,
To see her venture o'er the sound,
Moved onward by the gentle gales.
 She soon will reach the happy land,
And gently touch the blissful shore,
Where millions round their Saviour stand,
Who'll sail this temperance boat no more.
This was composed during the Congressional Temperance
Meeting held at Howard University, at which Dr. Chickering
presided, and Senator Pomeroy, and others made speeches.
MY REFUGE.
WHY do I doubt and tremble here,
Beneath this load of sin I bear?
Is there no one to pity me,
In all this grief and misery?
 Why do I shrink with fear and shame,
And dare to own my Saviour's name?
Did He not die upon the tree,
That sinful man might thus be free?
 Is there no room upon His breast,
Where I may lay my head to rest?
Did He not die a death of shame,
And bear for man the dreadful pain?
LETTER TO MISS SMITHERMAN.
THIS letter was written to a little child living in North
Carolina, that I used to tend and pet. The first word she
spoke was my name:
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., May 8, 1872.
MISS SMITHERMAN :
While sitting in my room thinking to whom my first May
letter should be addressed, I thought of you as the one I
should most like to honor, knowing that you will receive it
with pleasure, as it comes from one whom you have not seen
for five years.
I am living in the City of Washington, and am a student
at Howard University. I am making rapid progress in my
studies, having overtaken a class that was a year ahead of me.
I have followed the precepts of your father and mother,
and for this reason I have run the road of wisdom without
getting discouraged.
As a Christian, I endeavor to do all I can for Christ; as
a student, to compete with my class-mates; as a politician,
to prove true to my country; as a citizen, to be law-abiding
I am very busy at this time preparing for our annual
examination.
Some say that I am a poet, because I sometimes write a
verse or two. The following lines I have dedicated to you:
MISS Nancy Jane, I long to see
Those golden charms of thine,
While standing in a garden green,
Where nature is sublime.
 Within the place where flowers bloom,
Around thy head so gay,
Where birds and bees do loud proclaim
Thou art the queen of May.
 Oh, could I see thy piercing eyes,
As they reflect the light
Which drives away thy midnight dreams,
And makes thy visions bright
 I long to see thy tender smiles,
So gentle and so gay,
That drive away the cares of life,
And make life's darkness day.
 While thou art in that tranquil place,
Let evening shades draw nigh,
Where thou may'st in the moonbeams stand,
And view the starry sky.
 Then cast thine eyes around about,
And view the willow tree,
And when thou dost recall the past,
Oh, then remember me!
 I left the South, and journeyed East,
This goodly land to see;
But I have never found a child
That I could love like thee.
 When thou was't in thy mother's arms,
Those arms so dear to thee,
I saw thee when thou sweetly smiled,
And then thou called'st for me.
 So much surprised thy mother was,
She quickly did exclaim,
"My little daughter, though so young,
Has plainly called thy name!"
 I hastened to that tranquil place,
And took thee in my arms,
I smiled and kissed thy dimpled cheeks,
And looked upon thy charms.
 And now I look upon the arm
On which thy head did rest,
And well remember how thou slept,
When leaning on my breast.
 I cannot tell your pa and ma
How I esteem those days;
Nor can I tell them how I love
Their kind and pleasant ways.
 My little friend, I'd like to ask,
Art thou a child of God?
And do you walk the narrow path
That saints and angels trod?
 It is a straight and shining road,
And leads through wisdom's ways,
And if you'd be a child of God,
Oh, start in early days!
 Now, if we never meet again
About the old home place,
Then may we meet in heaven above,
Around God's throne of grace.
 Remember me to all my friends,
In words which I proclaim;
Then give my love to all thy house,
And thou accept the same.
ONE TO LOVE.
OH, where 's the maid that I can love,
With love which I have never told?
Where is the one that I would like
To comfort me when I am old?
 Do I not see before my face,
A mate prepared for every one?
Then sure there's one prepared for me,
Nor need I trudge the road alone.
Now who is he that speaks to me
Of Mormons and of Mormonhood?
While this you know, the Lord has said,
They twain shall be one flesh, one blood!
Come listen, then, to what I say
Before this evening's work is done,
That you can do as you may please,
But I'd be satisfied with one.
THE SACRED STREAMS.
JESUS, that stream shall ever flow
That washed my sins away;
That made my heart as white as snow,
And moved me then to pray.
It is a stream of pure delight,
Flowing both deep and wide;
Each ripple doth reflect the light,
Proceeding from Thy side.
It is a stream where all can meet
And drink a full supply;
Can bow and worship at Thy feet,
And praise Thy name most high.
There millions in Thy presence stand,
They bid us welcome home;
They tell us of that happy land,
Where all in Christ are one.
And if we will consent to go,
We there shall bathe again
In waters bright that can, we know,
Cleanse from the foulest stain.
THE NATION'S FRIEND.
THIS nation has a faithful friend,
T In whom she may confide;
Whose influence is like a sea,
Flowing both deep and wide.
Let us behold the sea, how calm-
What ships her billows float,
Come let us hasten to the shore,
And get on freedom's boat.
Upon her deck the nations meet;
The white and colored there,
Where no first place nor second known,
No difference in the fare,
I saw her raise her banner high,
And cast it to the breeze,
While tempests raged and billows rolled
She sailed through gulfs and seas.
Through smoke and fog she onward went
This nation to defend,
When Dixie cried, "Take her last son,
And her last dollar spend."
When hissing shot around her fell,
From rebel cannon's mouth,
She stood the storm, the rain, the hail,
And now can stand the drouth.
I heard her cry, white sailing on-
And Justice is her name—
Grant equal rights to every man,
And amnesty the same.
She soon will land her noble crew
Within a city bright,
Where nations in one brotherhood
Drink national delight.
 
Where we may have our public schools,
With open doors displayed;
Where all may drink at wisdom's fount
With none to make afraid.
Young friends, I know you will be there
Bright, shining, as the sun;
With equal rights secured to all,
When Sumner's work is done.
The nation's friend! still firm he stands,
With neither sleep nor slumber,
Come every Freedman in this land
And hail the name of Sumner.
ADAM AND EVE.
I PLANT this tree to try thy faith,
And, if thou only wilt obey,
Thou shalt ever see my face,
And I will bless thee day by day.
The good of life I'll not withhold,
Nor kindred pleasures will deny,
But thou shalt walk in streets of gold,
And thou shalt never, never die.
Thy days and years shall have no end;
Šickness nor sorrow shalt thou know;
And in old age thou shalt not bend,
Except thou yield unto the foe.
Go, freely drink from every fount,
From streams as they go laughing on,
Proceeding down from every mount,
Singing their merry, merry song.
It is not well to be alone;
There should be one to comfort thee;
And from thy side I'll take a bone,
And soon in one thy twain shalt be.
In yonder place I think I see
Adam reclining in the shade,
Rejoicing near the green bay tree,
E'en in the place where Eve was made.
List ye to what this man will say,
This man who never spake before;
And see how wise, though made of clay,
Now he has some one to adore.
Bone of my bone, I know thou art,
And Eve thy name shall ever be ;
I'll wear thine image in my heart,
And thou shalt ever cleave to me!
 
THE LITTLE HELPER.
[The day of the celebration of the Fifteenth Amendment
I was passing through the crowd in the street when a little
girl, CLARA SAUNDERS, (whom I knew not at the time, but is a
student at Howard University,) noticed my eyes, and thinking
I could not see and would be run over, took me by the hand
and lead me to a place of safety. The kindness made such an
impression, I was moved to write this little poem.]
BEHOLD the great and swelling crowd,
While thronging through the street,
And then behold the hand that keeps
Me from the horses feet.
The great and small have passed me by,
And here unseen I stand;
I have no sympathy, no help,
Except this little hand.
And now I bless this little hand,
Which gently takes my arm;
Kind Jesus, guide this little child,
And keep her from all harm.
The proud and gay are passing by,
And foolishly have scorned,
When they have met me on the street
Afflicted as when born.
But now and then I meet a child
As harmless as a dove,
Who tells me by its little deeds,
That God alone is love.
Dear Saviour, bless this little child,
Whate'er her name may be;
Dost Thou not see her little heart,
How kind she's been to me!
LOVE'S SOLILOQUY.
OH. why have I thus failed to write
A line upon my heart's delight?
The reason why I cannot tell,
For it, I think, is known too well.
I need not say that she is pretty;
But I am sure she is quite witty,
She is both comely to behold,
And, in my sight, as pure as gold.
I like the style in which she's dressed,
And place her now among the blessed;
There is no one more neat than she
Among the fairer ones I see.
It's true I take a complex view,
Instead of one, I look at two;
The one, because she's neat and trim,
The other one is fair and slim.
'Tis very true, one has a beau,
The other one has none I know:
The one may dwell e'en near my heart,
The other one must then depart.
There's only one that I can love,
And she's as harmless as a dove;
She is not drifted by the tide
With twenty beaux around her side.
I have seen one all dressed in green;
The other one may be a queen:
I think one has a pleasant mother,
The other one a handsome brother.
Now, shall I tell the first one's name,
For fear that you may think in vain?
Shall I record on history's page,
The other one is not of age?
When you have seen the other oue,
Then think of mother's only son,
To her be kind, be just and true,
That she may thus confide in you.
And when you have been kind to her,
A favor you will then confer,
I hope that you will never slight
The one who is my heart's delight.
OUR MAY-DAY WALK.
WE went out to the Soldiers' Home,
W With happy hearts and free,
And as we stepped within the grove
All eyes were fixed on me.
They seemed to speak in words like these:
"Will he not write a poem ?
"Does he not feel the gentle breeze
"On which our thoughts are borne."
And as they range through worlds unknown,
I thought I heard them say:
That" WALDEN ought to write a verse,
'Upon the first of May !"
Let nature in sublimity,
With golden rays of light,
Loan him a pen with diamond point,
And tell him what to write.
Let May put on her coat of green
And bid him freely speak,
That we may have a word or two
Before we stop to eat.
We cannot feel the hidden spark
That burns within his breast;
Nor can we tell him what to say,
For nature's thoughts are best.
I hope he'll think upon the bridge,
And of the willow tree;
I hope he'll think of every one,
And then he 'll think of me."
Depart from me all cares of life,
And let me here compose
A line or two upon this place
In verses or in prose.
This is a fair and pleasant place,
And lovely to behold;
The place where aged soldiers live,
I often have been told.
Now let the soldier cast his eye
Upon the fields of green,
And I am sure he will proclaim
The MATRON is the queen!
Then let the Captain take a view,
Although he is afar,
And with the soldiers he 'll proclaim,
Each lady is a star.
Here while I view the tender leaves,
And hear the gay birds sing,
My thoughts are borne upon the breeze,
That kindly welcomes Spring.
They swiftly fly to nature's arms,
And in her bosom rest,
"Till she unfolds her richest charms,
Close hid within her breast.
And then they will return again,
As constant as the dove,
And join the angels when they sing,
That God is only love.
Now while I'm in this tranquil place,
The evening shades appear,
Where I can view the landscape o'er
And none but I am here.
With love and kindness one comes down,
And by me takes her seat,
And kindly asks me to accept
A piece of bread and meat.
Of course I will accept of it,
And glad to eat I am,
And think within my heart there is
A Mary in this land.
Yet let me speak of one more friend,
I should not slight her name,
Whom I have found both just and true-
It is Miss E. L. Crane!
Young friends, if we no more shall meet
Within the Soldier's Home,
Oh! may we meet in Heaven above
Around God's brilliant throne.
May 1, 1872.
THE YOUNG MAN'S COMFORTER.
THERE is not one that can be found
More happy than the man unbound,
If he will not himself engage
To any one of any age.
He then can live a single life;
When free from wed and free from wife
There'd be no one that could control
Nor disregard him when he's old.
According to the lines above
There is no one that he should love;
But if he thinks this is not right,
Then let him seek his heart's delight.
CONSECRATION OF SELF.
JESUS, I feel the quickening spark,
O how it burns within!
'Tis love that purifics the heart,
And cleanses from all sin.
And now I stretch my hands to Thee;
Dear Saviour bid me fly,
That I may in thy presence be,
And reign above the sky.
Where I may wear a starry crown,
Through ceaseless years to come,
And in the city I'll be found,
Around thy dazzling throne.
TO MY BENEFACTOR.
IT's true I have a friend, indeed,
Whom I can safely trust and heed;
He's been to me a shining light,
And seeks to guide my feet aright.
When doubt and fear shall cloud my skies,
Then he will come and sympathize;
He found me in a seeking state,
And placed me here among the great.
Will he not lead me with his hand
Toward Canaan's fair and happy land?
Will he not mark each step I take,
Or mend each sacred link I break?
I came to him when much oppressed,
And soon he eased my troubled breast;
And now I bless the way he led,
When all my sorrows quickly fled.
INQUIRY.
I LOVE to look on thee kind friend,
Would like to ask thy name.
My leisure hours with thee I'd spend,
And learn from whence thou came.
I'd gather wisdom from your voice,
Advancing day by day,
Please gratify my ardent choice,
Thy name! what is it? pray.
DEDICATED TO M. W. W.
ON MAKING, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A SHIRT.
MARY, my shirt is neatly made,
Each stitch is in its proper place;
There's not a wrinkle to be seen.
Nor basting thread that will deface.
I've criticised with all my might;
I thought the button holes were shirked,
But I was struck with much surprise
To find they all were neatly worked.
I turned it in and turned it out,
I sought to find some fault with it;
I tried it on, and tried it off,
I never had so neat a fit.
I think I see within it stitched,
A figure of your daily life;
It surely tells that you will make,
Some happy man a thrifty wife.
And now I speak unto the hand
That never made a shirt beföre :-
Work hard to cultivate the mind,
Then arduous task's will soon be o'er.
GRACE AT TABLE.
BLESS us as we together meet,
And sanctify the food we eat;
Blest be the God who wisdom gives,
The food by which the spirit lives.
And when we shall have left this place,
Lord, give us of Thy richest grace,
Help us to love Thee now-and then,
Forever and ever-and Amen.
ODE TO GEN. 0. 0. HOWARD.
KIND Saviour, hear the voice of prayer,
And do thou bless this sacred hour,
May peace and comfort now be sent,
Upon our loving President.
Its true he 's in a heathen land,
Where red-men may around him stand,
With tomahawk and scalping knife,
And threaten vengeance on his life.
While he is in the distant West,
May all he docs be for the best,
Be Thou his shield both day and night,
And ever guide his feet aright.
We know his trust is in Thy name,
And in Thy love he doth remain,
For he did prove himself most true,
When fighting by the starry blue.
O lead him o'er the Rocky Mounts!
And let him drink from sparkling founts;
And when he 's where the water gleams,
Then let him bathe in crystal streams.
And when he hears the wild beast moan,
Then let him think of friends at home;
For there does dwell his loving wife,
Who comforts him mid earthly strife.
Let birds and bees both sing his praise,
To lighten up his dreary days;
Let nature in her beauty shine,
Teaching that all things are divine.
Another word I should have said-
I'd like to ask, has he a bed?
A shelter where within to rest,
While he is in the distant West?
O grant me words that I may write,
More on the President to night,
The words I need I do not know,
Except they shall from Webster flow.
Congress of power has given a lease,
Oh, aid him Lord, in making peace!
And guide him with thy sacred hand,
That he may bless his native land.
Yes, bless it in Thy sacred name,
And break each link in error's chain;
For in this land there's hardly one,
So many generous deeds has done.
Will Thou return him home again,
Both free from sorrow and from pain;
That we may see his loving face,
All lighted with Thy richest grace.
And when he turns to East or West,
He'll view his labor Thou hast blessed;
Or turns to either North or South
He'll bless the poor by word of mouth.
And when he comes within the school,
He'll see how well we keep each rule.
Although to us they may seem tight,
Yet we believe that they are right.
And when from scenes like these we go,
To journey on with friend or foe,
May happy thoughts around be showered,
When we recall the name of Howard!
CAST YOUR CARES UPON THE LORD.
T is the King, the Prince of Peace,
Who holds the reins of time;
Who sits upon His Father's throne,
And rides upon the wind.
"Tis He, whom angels do adore,
And praise His name most high,
He walks upon the mighty deep,
And reigns with God on high.
He spreads the clouds beneath the sky,
And bids them disappear,
He guides the pilgrim with His eye
And scatters doubt and fear.
He holds the lightning in His hand,
Till he shall bid it fly,
And then it darts from East to West,
Athwart the cloudy sky.
"Tis he who is the sinner's friend,
And only such can be,
He bled and died, that all might live,
When nailed upon the tree.
LETTER TO DR. SEE.
This letter was written to the Secretary of the Reformed Church of America.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., June 4, 1872.
DR. SEE:
Dear Friend: I should have written you before, but being
very busy in my studies, I have been putting it off until
should have time.
We are preparing for examination, and my idle momenta are all passed.
I am doing very well in my studies, and have found time,
in connection with them, to attend about half of the Theo-
logical lectures. During this year I have composed about
thirty poems. I am going to have a book published this sum-
mer, which I hope will meet a favorable consideration from
the reading public.
DOCTOR, I love the great Reformed,
And pause within her arms;
I dare not scorn her day when small,
Nor trifle with her charms.
How long she stood within God's sight,
Pure and undefiled?
How long has it been her delight
To save each little child?
Oh! when did she His banner raise,
And cast it to the breeze?
How long will she be tossed upon
This world's tempestuous seas.
Her millions she has landed safe,
Upon fair Canaan's shore;
There 're millions yet within her arms,
And room for millions more.
Now let me praise the great Reformed,
And magnify her name,
For all the kindness she has shown,
Since from the South I came.
She did not turn away from me
But bade me go in peace,
And kindly asked me to accept
A place among the least.
Dear Saviour, bless the great Reformed,
And keep her in thy care,
And when she trembles in the storm,
Then scatter doubt and fear!
ON A FRIEND.
WHY thus I write I cannot tell,
I cannot give the reason why,
Except it is because thou hast
Become the apple of mine eye,
I cannot speak the words I wish,
However true they all may be,
Because I know the gay and vain
Have placed their longing eyes on thee.
Shall I betray the noble thoughts
Which guard thine image day and night?
Or shall I speak of Mr. A**,
Who seeks to put those thoughts to flight?
A** thy beauty doth admire,
B** thy kind and loving ways,
And C** because thou sheddest light
To cheer and bless his dreary days.
But for myself, intelligence,
Beauty and meekness reign alone;
And she must love the Son of God
Who sits upon His Father's throne.
I will not write another line
Lest critics say I flatter you;
And they would say I prove unkind
And you might think I am untrue.
ON A SEAMSTRESS.
MY shirt is truly neat and strong
Although for it I waited long;
I know Miss S**** will never slight,
Nor sew on shirts by candle light.
I long have known this one who sews,
And now commend her to her beaux,
She has no artificial ways
To cause young men on her to gaze.
CALL TO SABBATH SCHOOL.
I hark unto this liberal call;
For you are all invited,
And if you stay away I know,
The children will be slighted.
Oh! why not come into the school-
For you may be a teacher;
Of all the beauties of the day,
This is the brightest feature.
The President will sure be there,
And that will be exciting,
And a short lecture I will give,
If you will be confiding.
The children will together meet,
They'll look to see your coming,
While birds and bees within the grove,
Will greet you with their humming.
The school will meet at three o'clock,
A pleasant time to spend,
And when we hear the clock strike five,
Our exercise will end.
TO THE GRADUATING CLASS.
YOUNG men, there is one honor yet,
One I'm sure each one can get;
An honor that is tried and true,
One that will ever stand by you.
When entering on the field of life,
Each graduate should have a wife,
One who will guide his feet aright,
And ever be his heart's delight.
"Tis true, quite true, you 're leaving college,
With minds well stored with useful knowledge;
But oh, all this will prove in vain,
Except some lady's heart you gain.
"Tis true you stood upon the stage,
Examples of the modern age;
But life is vain if you are wise
If there's no star in all your skies.
But if each one will still live single,
I'm sure your pockets cannot jingle;
I care not who may be your choice,
If you'll obey this warning voice.
Go forth, therefore, in all the land,
And reap success on every hand ;
Go make yourselves a shining name,
Then you'll deserve eternal fame.
 
ON A FRIEND.
KIND friend why dost thou look so sad?
What may thy troubles be?
Oh dost thou fear some one will take
The one so kind to thee?
She is a fair and charming one
She dazzles every eye,
It is enough to make thee weep,
Enough to make thee sigh.
A LADY FRIEND.
o tell Miss V** to quickly come,
And bring her pen and ink,
That she may write each word I speak
Or each one that I think.
She can unfold my darkest thoughts
And make them plain to me,
I know not one so full of art
No one so apt as she.
She was with me on first of May;
For me she then did write
With little kind and gentle deeds,
She 's like my heart's delight.
ADDITIONAL POEMS.
INTRODUCTORY TO SECOND EDITION.
MY book is largely growing;
MUCH Its leaves are multiplied;
Its pages are much longer,
And nearly twice as wide.
At first I thought the reader
Had not the time to spare,
To hail my little volume
As it floated in the air.
I thought perhaps while floating
Away through empty space,
Perchance would there discover
Some long forgotten race.
I knew not it would mingle
Among the great and wise,
Or that it would be subject
Unto the critic's eyes.
I thought it was inferior,
And of the minor class,
I knew not how the ladies
Would read it as they pass..
 
But now I find it's useful,
And laden every page,
For truly it must mingle
With those of every age.
Therefore I should have measured;
Should not have thought it vain
To make its little mysteries
Unto the reader plain.
But surely there's no secret
Where thought is not sublime,
That I have thus destroyed
By keeping up my rhyme.
But if I should in future
Find this to be the case,
I'd take my silver pencil
And all these lines erase.
I'd rather use a license,
Or grammar's laws dispense,
Than for to let my metre
Or rhythm govern sense.
The reader will remember
My chances are but slim,
Or else this little volume
Would be in better trim.
Remember, too, in Dixie
That I was born a slave.
And all my early genius.
Was locked within the grave.
Remember my condition-
A mark within my eyes-
And all my inspirations
Are showered from the skies.
I cannot read of authors,
Nor those of noble fame,
For I'm just a learning
The author, Milton's, name.
I cannot borrow subjects,
Nor rob them of their style,
My book amid their volumes,
Like me, is but a child.
Therefore, I bless this volume,
And send with it my heart,
That it may to the critic
My better thoughts impart.
Go forth, then, little volume,
Much good from thee may spring,
If thou continueth pleading
The merits of thy King.
And others yet may follow,
All changed within their scale,
But thou, upon thy mission,
I am sure ean never fail.
 
PHILADELPHIA, SEPT., 1872.
TO THE FACULTY OF HOWARD UNIVERSITY:
GENTLEMEN, I my pen have raised,
   The one by which your Board I've praised;
It is a pen of noble deeds,
   By which I have sown wisdom's seeds.
It is a pen I long have trained.
   By it a thousand hearts I 've gained,
For it was truly made of steel,
   Therefore to it your hearts will yield.
For truly it does speak to-day,
   As did it on the first of May;
For then I know it did record
   Your little and your great reward.
Remember that its highest aim
   Is much like yours-is much the same;
For you will heal the wounded heart,
   And give the young an upward start.
Therefore I place upon its wings
   The name of her who plays and sings,
And all thy honors I 'Il extend
   If you will be this singer's friend.
And then in every swelling note,
   Arising from the singer's throat,
In every song your name she 'll praise,
   If you will crown her student days.
I hope that you 'll accept of me,
   Not only one, but names of three;
And then excuse these lines I write,
   For one is dark and two are white.
Behold their names I did omit,
   For them there is no place as yet,
Therefore it's well that each one knows,
   That I can send their names in prose.
Kind friends, I know you 've not the time
   To bother with each little rhyme,
Therefore you 'll look beyond each link,
   And judge from what you know I think.
I hope that you will keep for me.
   The room I think is number three,
For there my things are put away,
   Within that room, I long to stay.
For you I have an," areolite'
   Which I shall send when you shall write,
And it I know will please you well,
   To know the land in which it fell.
Ten catalogues I hope you'll send
   For here four days I have to spend,
To me send them by the Express,
   For now I have not my address.
 
There's other things I'd like to say,
But I have not the time to-day,
I've not the time to longer write,
For evening's shades foretell the night.
When in Philadelphia lately, loosing my ticket, my funds
being at the ebb, I took the following method to secure trans-
portation at reduced rates; remembering the old adage,
Where there is a will there is a way."
TO ALFRED HORNER.
DEAR SIR,
IF you to me a pass will give,
I'll cause your name in time to live,
It in my book I will record
Which will be for your own reward.
You may not know what I will gain,
Except you send me on your train,
Nor do you know what I will loose
If you to me a pass refuse.
I would address the President
But here my time is quite near spent.
A man whose heart is without bound
The dearest friend the needy's found.
 
LETTER TO MISS CRANE.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY;
Washington, D. C., Aug. 23, 1872.
·
THY pen, dear friend, is made of gold,
It always tells the truth,
It serves me now while I am old,
As well as when a youth,
It often guides my thoughts aright,
When they would go astray,
It is my body-guard by night,
As well as in the day.
I look on it as would I thee,
Its worth I 've never told,
For all the kindness shown to me,
Its value 's more than gold.
Its gold to me like ancient dross,
Compared with all her wealth,
Like thee it helps to bear the cross
In sickness and in health.
For me new friends it makes each day,
New lines it does record,
It causes me to watch and pray,
And trust upon the Lord.
It often pleads the needy's case,
It makes his troubles known;
It puts him in his proper place,
And points him to God's throne.
It knows a maid both just and true,
One weighed in virtue's scale,
Whom I will now present to you,
Whose deeds can never fail.
A student she would gladly be,
She has no means nor friend
Who freely would, that she can see,
For her a dollar spend.
Oh! lay her case before the east,
Or thy own native State,
That they may take her from the least,
And place her with the great.
Tell them, for me, their name shall live
With thine on history's page,
If they Miss Johnson aid will give,
The fair one of this age.
No one his dollar will withhold,
From such a worthy girl;
The miser, too, will bring his gold-
His treasures he 'll unfurl.
Remember, that her parents died
When she was but a child.
She has no lovers by her side,
Though she is meek and mild.
Kind Miss, to you no more I'll say,
I'll leave you in God's care,
I hope you have a pleasant day,
For such an one is here.
LETTER TO REV. MR. HARTRAUGHT.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., October 19, 1872.
Rev. Mr. HARTRAUGHT:
Dear Sir: I would have gladly remained in New Bruns-
wick longer last summer; but, as you know, my vacation was
nearly spent when I reached there, and being anxious to get
back to Washington by the opening of the term, I departed
thence. I was much strengthened while there by your Sab-
bath school, prayer meetings, and other religious worship,
and would like very much to be with you to-day-if it were
possible--
BECAUSE it is the Sabbath day,
A day of rest provided ;
Upon this day, in every church,
Our God has long presided.
When first I came unto thy church,
I heard sweet voices singing-
From God I thought the angels were
To thee glad tidings bringing.
I sure was there to hear thee pray-
Was there whilst thou was't preaching;
How precious did the gospel sound,
Which thou to us was't teaching.
The Lord will blest thy day and age,
Give souls to thee for hire,
When thou wilt with thy little flock,
To brighter fields aspire.
Remember, there 's a rising up
Of all the friends of Jesus;
Remember, too, there is a God,
An eye that ever sees us.
Are we not marching onward to
"Eternal weights" of Glory?
Did not the prophets and the saints
Before us tell the story?
Is there not love for us unseen,
Where we shall live forever?
Is there an end to life unknown?
The answer comes, "No, never!"
Then let us strive with all our might,
Exerting every power;
That we may rest in Heaven above,
Through one eternal hour.
TO JOHN K. SMITH,
A VENERABLE OLD GENTLEMAN OF TRENTON, N. J., WHO IS AN ESTEEMED FRIEND OF MINE.
THESE many years my pen has sped,
These many years to duty led;
And now it bends unto my will,
As though it were an eagle's quill.
 
For days and years it has been tried,
Nor to me has it ever lied;
Therefore its worth is more than gold,
For it the truth has ever told.
And now it does record for thee,
How very kind thou art to me;
It tells me that thou art my friend,
And dost for me thy money spend.
And it would truly speak the fruth,
Were it to trace thee to thy youth.
And it would fill my heart with joy,
To hear of thee when but a boy.
But, oh, it's called to other things,
To lead me to life's gushing springs,
Where I may drink a full supply,
And write on man, on earth, and sky,
It's called to guide my hand aright,
To lead me into wisdom's light;
It's moved to point me to the Lord,
For He the faithful will reward.
DEDICATED TO A YOUNG LADY
REPRESENTING THE INDIAN RACE AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., October 11, 1872.
The reason of my writing this poem is, that in every paper I read, this question repeatedly presents itself:
'CAN THE INDIANS BE CIVILIZED AND CHRISTIANIZED ???
According to my experience with them in the University,
I think it properly answered by saying "Yes."
We have a young lady to whom this poem is dedicated,
who is my table-mate. She is bright and intelligent; and I
am sure any one coming into her presence, and conversing
with her, or, if circumstances permit, hearing her read some
of her essays, cannot return without feeling that he had been
in company with one who represents her race honorably.
I have often thought from her punctuality in attendance
at church, that every one might learn a lesson, which no one
can teach, only those who practice the same.
Now, I regard those questions as did I those frequently
asked in our late war, "If the colored people could bear arms
and fight for their country?" "Could they be made loyal
citizens, or lifted from a state of degradation, from under the
scales in which men are weighed, and put upon the platform
of common manhood?" We answered those questions with
the sword and by the ballot; and, likewise, the Indians will
answer these important questions in perhaps twenty years to
come, if they are justly dealt with. They only ask our Gov-
ernment to give them good and true men, and they will do
their part.
WHILE sitting in my room kind Miss,
I thought I'd sing a praise,
But now I think I'll write a word,
To lighten up thy days.
It's true I often write on Queens,
And those of noble fame;
But now I seek to write a line
Upon thy honored name.
What's in thy name moves me to write,
This little verse on thee?
Perhaps it is thy pleasant ways,
And cheering looks to me.
How oft I think of thee, kind Miss,
And oft admire thy grace,
Because I know that thou art of
Another noble race!
When by the bells to meals we're called,
Or round the table meet,
With anxious eye I look to see
If thou art in thy seat.
And then I cast my eyes around,
Through hall, though long and wide,
And then I quickly look to see
Thy tea-mate by thy side.
But first of all the bell is rung,
And each within his place,
In silence each one bows his head,
"Till some one asks the grace.
Then each in seat with upturned plates,
And scarce a word is said,
Until we have a full supply
Of meats and baker's bread.
And dishes, too, are passing round
About from you and me;
And Clara she looks up and asks-
Pray, sir, what can it be?
It 's pork, of course, or else it 's beef;
Perchance it may be ham-
Except the baker cooked a goose,
And passed it off for lamb.
And if he has a cut will tell,
If round about its swallow,
For surely it is not so dead,
That it would fail to halloo.
While all of this is going on,
There 're other things in view;
For oft I catch myself, dear Miss,
Exchanging looks with you.
But soon we 're through, the bell does ring,
We 're called by duty's 'larms;
Nor can I longer sit and look
Upon thy brilliant charms.
I'd speak of all my table mates
Had I another pen,
For surely we 're as happy guests
As here have ever been.
WISH FOR AN OVERCOAT.
H! had I now an overcoat,
For I am nearly freezing;
My head and lungs are stopped with cold,
And often I am sneezing.
And, too, while passing through the street,
Where merchants all are greeting,
They say, young man this is the coat
That you should wear to meeting.
Then, looking down upon my feet,
For there my boots are bursting,
With upturned heels and grinning toes,
With tacks which long were rusting.
Ah! how they view my doeskin pants
With long and crooked stitches,
They say, young man would you not like
To have some other breeches ?
My head is also hatless too,
The wind is swiftly blowing,
They say, young man will you not freeze?
See ye not how it 's snowing?
And now they take me by the hand,
And lead me toward the store,
And some are pulling down the coats
Before I reach the door.
So walk I in, their goods to price,
To quench a thirst that's burning,
And freely would I buy a coat,
But nothing I am earning.
They say to me, I should have known,
That winter time was coming,
When I was roaming through the park,
With birds around me humming.
Their logic's true, I must confess,
And all they say is pleasant;
But did I know that I would have
No overcoat at present?
To satisfy these craving Jews,
To buy I am not able,
For it is more than I can do
To meet my wants at table.
Therefore my skin will toughly grow,
Will grant to me this favor,
That I may learn to stand as much
As little Jack, the sailor.
And if I live till winter's passed,
Though nature's harps unstringing,
I then will fly to yon woodland
To hear the oak trees singing.
Then I will not on hero's fame,
Ride swiftly on to victory,
Although my saddle may be made
Of cotton sacks or hickory.
But if I die, farewell to all,
Oh! who will tell the story,
That I have lived a noble life.
And now gone home to glory?
Yes, who will chant a song of praise
For me who will be weeping—
When I have yielded to the grave,
And 'mid the dead am sleeping?
But some will ask, "how did he die?
It was without my knowing;
Was it because he caught a cold,
Last year when it was snowing?"
The answer now comes hurling back,
In words I cannot utter,
It was not by a cold alone,
But partly bread and butter.
[This poem is dedicated to my own necessities and wants.]
TO HON. SENATOR POMEROY.
[These lines were written in honor of the above gentleman,
to whom the temperance cause is so much indebted.]
HOWARD UNIVERSITY, Washington, D. C.
DEAR SIR:
HY name, within my book,
Is like an eagle's wing,
It bears each rhyme unto the prince,
And onward to the king.
And also shines on history's page,
It dazzles every eye,
Because it's like a twinkle from
A rainbow in the sky.
And now its light reflects upon
Thy many honored deeds,
On all my race by thee bestowed,
In shape of wisdom's seeds.
Thy country, sir, has read this book,
And looked upon thy name;
No anger burned within her breast,
On cheek no blush of shame.
And, too, she 's also proud of thee-
She want's ten thousand more,
Whose hand is open like the king's-
Extended to the poor.
She blessed the day that gave thee birth-
Will multiply thy days,
Of all her bright and rising sons,
Kind friend thou hast the praise.
TO MISS N. J.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., August 19, 1872.
MISS N. J**, I my pen have taken,
The one that is so just and kind,
And all the fair ones I 've forsaken,
Because thou hast my heart and mind.
To thee these lines may be surprising,
Because they're of an early date;
But would'st thou be more sympathizing
If I to write should longer wait?
On thee I look with much compassion,
Tender, O, I know thou art;
I like thy style and love the fashion-
Thine image dwells within my heart.
Thy little hand is yonng and tender,
Arduous tasks it should not know;
Thy graceful form is neat and slender,
Like lilies that in gardens grow.
Behold for thee there is a calling,
Within the land among the free;
For there the wise in sin are falling,
How would'st thou like to be with me?
O wilt thou try to come to college,
Where wisdom teacher's do impart,
And here partake of richest knowledge,
Overflowing mind and heart?
Arise! come up a little higher,
Do never stop beneath thy grade,
To higher ranks why not aspire?
Pray tell me why hast thou delayed?
There's been no gentle hand to lead me,
Not since my pa and ma have died,
Nor one so kind to clothe and feed me—
No one the task has ever tried.
Kind Miss, I spoke as would a brother-
As one whose heart beats firm and true;
Because I knew thou hadst no other
To kindly tell thee what to do.
And now to thee I 'd tell a mystery,
Although in it myself I'd praise,
Therefore leave it to other history,
To speak of all my happy days.
I might tell thee my heart is willing
That I should be thy guide through life,
But while I am not worth a shilling,
Why should I seek thee for a wife?
My friend I know that I 'm a student
Preparing for some distant land;
Pray tell me if it would be prudent,
Were I to ask thee for thy hand?
For I can see stamped in thy features
What never living man has seen,
That thou wouldst make a handsome creature,
And also me a loving queen.
To thee, kind Miss, I 'll write no longer.
For evening shades are drawing nigh;
Perhaps thy love is growing stronger,
The moments whisper, passing by.
 
GRATITUDE.
To the President and Members of the Christian Association:
Having learned that my resignation was reconsidered by
you, and having been treated with such brotherly love, I am
constrained to express my gratitude to you in an humble
manner:
FOR when I heard this glorious news,
It filled my heart with joy,
And quickly to my pen I sprang,
As though I were a boy.
Indeed it did remove all doubt,
And filled my heart with pleasure,
And now I write regardless of
My rhythm or my measure.
I must confess in words of truth,
I found myself in danger,
And when I came within your court,
I felt as would a stranger.
I listened long to hear your call-
In this way long was waiting;
But soon I heard a shepherd's voice,
And with him lambs were bleating.
I thought, perhaps, it was my chance,
Perhaps it was a warning,
Perhaps I would not live to see
The light of day when dawning.
And, too, the road on which I trod,
Was dark and much descending,
And all I met within that way,
Were quarrelling and contending.
And oft I tried to bow and pray-
To pray I was not able;
For all my supplications were
As but an empty fable.
I gladly did embrace this chance,
And quickly came to Jesus;
When I remembered that there was
A God that ever sees us.
TO PROFESSOR ATHERTON.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., Dec. 12, 1872.
DEAR SIR: Two years will soon have passed since my con-
nection with this University, and I am happy to say I am pro-
gressing finely; and am rapidly approaching my sixth exami-
nation, at which time every energy shall be bent to its utmost
extreme. I have been making out my expenses which I find
to be very heavy, though not to be compared with the small
amount of knowledge which I have gained; and, too, when I
consider that these privileges of going to school have par-
tially grown out of your influence, I am constrained to express
my gratitude to you. I should have made an acknowledgment
ere this, but thought it best to wait until I am sufficiently
competent; and would still wait longer-
BUT this my pen is getting old,
Its noble limbs are dull and cold,
Therefore to thee I write in praise,
In honor of its active days.
My hand no longer will it serve,
Nor will it on my paper curve;
For it is robed in shrouds of death-
Without a pulse, without a breath.
On lines no longer will it slide,
Nor will it over paper glide;
No longer will it lead the youth
In ways of virtue and of truth.
Nor will it longer honor thee
For kindness thou hast shown to me,
Nor will it longer thus record
A line of praise unto the Lord.
No longer will I doubt and shake,
For fear its limber legs will break;
Nor will it longer shiver names,
Nor turn my paper into flames.
No longer will it hop and skip,
Recording thoughts expressed by lip;
Nor will its little wiry toes
Transcribe my poetry into prose.
This little pen no more will write,
For it will pass away this night;
No longer will it sing a praise
In honor of its youthful days.
Wilt thou accept this line or two,
That's written by a friend so true;
Accept it in the writer's name,
Who's free from sorrow and from shame.
 
THE GOLDEN RULE:
ITS INRRODUCTION AT THE UNIVERSITY.
[This rhetorical poem was written in honor of Prof. A. L.
Barber, who was the principal on my entering school.]
WHEN first we came unto this school,
They introduced the golden rule,
And put us in the narrow way
In which we journey on to-day.
How precious did that rule appear
To us who had assembled here;
And in that road a shining light
To guide each student's feet aright.
But soon new laws were multiplied,
And roads branched out on either side;
A law applied to every case,
A road prepared for every race.
And we with not a word to say,
Except those laws we should obey,
Nor did a foot once turn aside,
To tread the way both rough and wide.
But blended laws and roads in one,
That we no duty thus might shun;
Unto God's sceptre bowed and prayed
That we might never be dismayed.
As soon as classes were assigned
And teachers given, much refined;
Each heart was filled with many joys
Among the girls, among the boys.
Now looking back upon the past,
To view the ranks where we were classed,
And each one's friend will quickly see,
That we were placed within Class D.
With energy we sought to rise,
To mingle with the great and wise;
In ways unknown we do succeed,
And now we bear the highest meed.
Another thought I may unfurl,
Because we represent the world;
Of every tribe and every race,
And each one in his proper place.
Like yonder Sun, his highest rays,
The nation's eyes will on us gaze,
And she will mark the way we tread
When we to higher ranks have fled.
And when you 've left the shores of time
I'll weave your footprints up in rhyme;
And change my verses to a song
When you those pearly gates shall throng.
And when I come I 'll look to see
The one so kind to you and me;
And there together we will sing,
And make the heavenly echoes ring.
Teacher, I would not flatter you,
To say that you are just and true,
Nor prove unkind to my class-mate,
To say he often calls you great.
But speaking for myself alone,
Have you not to me pity shown?
Your ways e'er long have been my guide-
To you a thousand hearts have tied.
And now we step upon the boat,
Which will on higher billows float;
And onward she will cast her sail,
When driven by the nightly gale.
And had we now an ounce of time,
We would on higher ladders climb;
The gates of college we would raise,
And then on deeper mysteries gaze.
But, ah! the day is growing late,
To hear my song you cannot wait
But had my harp another string,
This song I then would play and sing.
TO MISS W * * * * *
Will you accept of an apology for my not seeing you safely
to Minor Hall last evening, with my umbrella, whilst raining.
I did not mean to leave you exposed, but another young lady
said that "We would not get wet," and I thought she had ref
erence to you and herself, though she meant another person.
 
THEREFORE you were not slighted,
Not in the least degree;
Although, when not a thinking,
I turned aside from thee.
I thought it was a token
That A. G. spoke for all,
And feared myself to ask your
Permission to the hall.
Then I, with this impression,
Kind Miss, what could I do?
Could I escort you safely,
Without consent from you?
And then, too, shamed to venture
Or linger by your side,
And this explains the reason
Why thus I turned aside.
Therefore, you will excuse me,
For I have made it plain,
And sorry that I left you,
Last night within the rain.
Now, when the night grows darker,
And rain shall harder fall,
Then you shall have my presence
From prayer to Miner Hall.
Or when the moon is shining,
And stars shall fill the sky,
I will not then forsake you,
Nor let you pass me by.
 
ODE TO MR. DUNLAP AND FAMILY.
Much honor is due Mr. Dunlap and family, both from my-
self and race. He was one of the leading men of Philadelphia
in the anti-slavery movement, and a just man. I went to
Philadelphia with soldiers and sailors from Washington in
1866, to celebrate the nomination of U.S. Grant. Before I
was ready to return I lost my ticket. I was left by my com-
panions without any means for securing another, for I did not
have enough money to hire a night's lodging, and every per-
son whom I met rejected me on that account. Coming down
Broad street about eight o'clock in the night I was interrupted
by two gentlemen, who, on seeing me, said: "There goes a
carpet-bagger." I replied that carpet-baggers do not come
from the South.
"Where are you from?" asked Mr. William Dunlap. "I
am from North Carolina, but from Washington here." After
questioning me closely, "Take my card," said he, "and go
to my house, tell my wife to give you a good supper and bed,
and I hope you will remain with us until Monday." I thanked
him and started. On reaching the door I at first hesitated to
ring the bell; finally I pulled the knob which brought Mrs.
Dunlap to the door. She is a generous lady and had a pro-
found reverence for the words of her husband. After pre-
senting Mr. Dunlap's card, she politely invited me into the
parlor. In a short time Mr. Dunlap came in and inquired for
the stranger. "He is in the parlor," said Mrs. Dunlap. Iwas
soon surrounded by all the members of that happy because a
good family. After receiving an introduction to them all,
supper was prepared; and although Mr. and Mrs. Dunlap had
eaten before, they sat down and took tea with myself. Now,
after supper, Mr. Dunlap requested me to give a brief sketch
of my life, which I gladly did. The whole family seemed to
me to be exceedingly interested in my story, but little Wil-
liam and Eliza, although very young, looked upon me-with
purely angelic faces, and before the evening passed I became
the centre of attraction. At last the clock struck ten. Mr.
Dunlap took down his bible and read a chapter. The family
sang a hymn and I was invited to lead in prayer. It was, of
course, an arduous task, but I performed it to the best of my
ability.
I was then directed to a well arranged bed-chamber, where
I enjoyed sweet repose from the fatiguing scenes of the day.
On awaking in the morning I found myself in so different a
place from what I had anticipated, that I was at a loss to de-
termine whether I was awake or dreaming. You will readily
believe that this beautiful apartment was a striking contrast
to the coal-box I was about to seek shelter for the night on
one of the wharves of that great city. The floor was nicely
carpeted; the bed made of feathers, and dressed with rose-
bordered blankets, and a snow-ball counterpane, with pillows
as soft as downy pillows are. There was a large spring-bot-
tomed rocking-chair, a bowl and pitcher, a bureau with a large
mirror on it, and many other things which augmented the
comfort and happiness of its fortunate occupant. I remained
with them until Wednesday, at which time, being supplied
with passage money, I left for Washington. At the reception
given General Grant in Philadelphia, Eliza Dunlap was the
only child our great President kissed, and I have dedicated
the following lines to her:
OH! thou my pen with sacred fame;
Canst thou record Eliza's name?
For she 's both gentle, meek and mild,
A happy little loving child,
Come view the ground on which she 'll tread,
Go bless the crown upon her head;
For tranquil lights spring from her eyes,
Like rainbows mid the bending skies.
She 's quite as lovely to be seen,
As any earth or Heavenly queen,
With rosy cheek and slender span;
With curly hair and timid hand.
My pen, I'd freely bid thee sing
Her name unto the proudest king;
But ah! I know thou would'st impart
The dearest secrets of my heart.
But soon from me thou shalt be sent
Unto U. S., the President;
'Mid wise men there, her praises chant,
In honor of Ulysses Grant.
Go sing them softly, sing them well,
For she 's the child we called the belle,
I bid thee linger there and stay
Until she 's crowned the queen of May.
On eagles' wing I bid thee fly,
Aloft beyond the fleeting sky,
And then on wheels of swiftest speed,
Among my pens go take the lead.
Thy way is straight, O do not miss,
For she's the child he gave a kiss,
And from that cheek did spring a rose,
Which I have better told in prose.
THE WIDOW.
One very cold morning I met a widow at the depot whom
the train had left. Wishing to comfort her, I introduced
myself as follows:
LADY, excuse me if you please,
Your infant looks as it would freeze,
And you as one in great distress,
Why do you wear this mourning dress?
She seems to pause before she speaks,
With fading colors on her cheeks,
Within her heart she deeply sighed,
To tell me that her husband died.
Think not the train will long delay,
Or critics will their art display;
Or you shall tread this lonely street,
Without a lamp unto your feet.
Please tell me, Ma'm, where yon reside,
And of the one who lately died,
And then perhaps I will impart
The better feelings of my heart.
"Kind friend, I know you've not the time
To weave my language up in rhyme,
Nor am I able to express
The reason why I wear this dress.
"But I'm a widow thus you see,
With not a heart to pity me,
And I am destined thus to roam
Two thousand miles or more from home.
"My dear was wounded in the head,
It was a shot that killed him dead;
And thus was wafted from my side
A heart to me so closely tied.
"Can I forget his dying groans,
Which round me fell in mournful tones?
Can I forget his dying sigh,
That onward bore him to the sky?
"O, no, forget I never can,
The traitor shot, the blood that ran;
I can't forget the mournful day
When he was placed within the clay.
"Now all I wish while here below
Is for a robe as white as snow;
That when I shall be called to die.
Like him on wings of love I 'll fly,
"But hark! I heard the whistle blow,
Soon on my journey I must go ;
Good-by, remember me kind sir,
That I may neither doubt nor fear."
O heaven give a gentle smile,
And bless the widow and her child,
Let friends and strangers be her guide
In honor of the one who died.
To MRS. N. Z.
AN ADDRESS TO DIXIE.
OH! Dixie in thy wounded station,
Thou canst not be a separate nation,
Nor canst thou break the cord that's binding,
Nor set confederate mills to grinding.
I saw thee when both young and tender,
All lifted up with pomp and splendor,
And then thy chariots rolled in grandeur,
While I was picking on my "banjo."
But since that time I saw thee falling,
When North and South for troops were calling,
Each nation from a place of resting,
Unto the fields of great contesting.
How soon I saw the battle raging,
With heroes in the strife engaging;
I heard the swords and sabres clashing
With horse and rider onward dashing.
'Twas o'er the dead and on the dying,
While shot and shell through air were flying,
Unto their groans I paused and hearkened
To see the elements were darkened.
But, first to me it was surprising,
To see my noble friends arising,
A million flags the troops were raising,
The nation's eyes were on them gazing,
From pole to pole I saw them leaping,
While Sherman through the South was sweeping,
I saw their crimson colors fading,
While northern land Lee was invading.
Went Sheridan through the South abouding,
And many troops he was surrounding;
O how the widows' hearts were breaking
When Lee and Davis calls were making.
 
I saw thy rosy cheeks as changing,
While mighty guns Grant was arranging.
Nor could they longer bloom in flowers,
Nor stand against the Northern powers.
But now I see the war is ended,
And all thy anger is suspended;
Peace I think I hear thee crying,
As thou art to the Union flying.
And Hallelujahs I am singing,
To see my race from bonds are springing,
For sure a better time is coming,
The insects whisper through their humming.
So now farewell to plough and hoeing,
For I to Yankee town am going;
No longer will I drive this wagon,
Nor under slavery's chains be swagging,
But Dixie, oh, the land of cotton,
Let slavery die and be forgotten;
And we will turn unto each nation
With greater zeal for education.
Although thou long hath been mistaken
And of the right thou hast forsaken;
But yet I see within thee planted
The love to thee thy fathers granted.
Therefore, thou shouldst be more inspired
When father's love in youth is fired,
Be lifted from thy degradation
Above the bonds of long probation.
O like the mighty swelling ocean,
Whose billows roll with great commotion,
The races yet will come together,
In ties of love that none can sever.
Dedicated to the good will of all persons towards the pros-
perity of the South.
THE ICY POEM.
What gave rise to this little poem was, that a party of stu-
dents went out on a skating expedition on a pond near the
University, and the ice not being sufficiently strong, it gave
way with them. I imagined myself there, and the following
lines suggested themselves to my mind about the hour of 12
o'clock p. m.
BE still! I thought I heard it cracking
Around on every side,
And soon they will be driven by
The wind upon the tide.
It breaks, it bends, and shivers now
Around about their feet,
And every nerve is standing still,
And hearts refuse to beat.
Behold I see them standing on
A little icy isle,
Pray, who will bring the hero forth,
Or save the loving child.
Look, look, I see them whirling round,
All hurried by the gale,
And not a breath I breathed on land,
For fear their hearts will fail.
But Hollingsworth is speaking now
Unto the little dove,
He says, "If you will trust in me
I'll prove to you my love.
"While secret shouts are coming forth,
Think not they do resound,
Remember, I am present now,
And you shalt ne'er be drowned,
"Therefore be calm, be well composed,
Although within the tide,
Then if you have to suffer here,
I'll linger by your side."
Dear sir, I cannot feel alarmed,
Not in the least degree,
When I remember heaven smiles,
And Jesus looks on me.
Nor can I ever be dismayed,
While angels gather nigh,
But if I have to perish here,
On wings of love I 'll fly.
Now all is calm on isle and land,
And not a word is said,
I cannot hear my own heart beat,
Nor foot, if one should tread.
Ten thousand swelling thoughts arise,
From heart to heart they leap;
Pray tell me who will trust himself
Upon the mighty deep?
New plans by Simmons now are made,
Whose heart can never fail,
He quickly comes to her relief,
And with him brings a rail.
But first of all a bridge he builds,
From floating isle to land.
And first to step upon the rail
To offer her his hand.
Then bless the one who saves my friend,
To him I will impart
The richest treasures of my soul,
And dearest of my heart.
Now turning I from such a scene,
To one that's more severe,
A greater accident than this
Have we among us here.
Behold! another 's breaking through,
And downward she is sent,
So Shadd he comes by double quick,
To save her he is bent.
 
'Tis in the deep and takes her up,
And holds her in his arms,
With fading cheek and throbbing heart,
He looks upon her charms.
God bless these men who saved my friends,
Grant each a happy life;
O grant them health, O grant them wealth,
And each a loving wife.
But where am I 'midst all of this,
Why do I from them stay;
Is it because I take no part
Within their icy play?
O, no, my soul is with them now,
And with them do abound,
And stand between the icy cliffs
That neither one should drown.
Behold I stand with outstretched arms,
Come hither! is my cry,
Unto the right, unto the left,
To either one I fly.
Dear friends this sight is hard to see;
Can angels bear the scene?
For yonder sank my heart's delight,
And floated there my queen.
I shut my eyes and wring my hands,
O whither shall I go
Shall I launch out upon the deep,
Where billows ebb and flow?
O then forbid that I should see
Another icy day,
If it must nip the buds which else
Would bloom so fair in May.
Young friends, from this a warning take,
This thought do not erase,
But never hop and skip upon
The deep's cold, icy face.
But first of all go bless the Son
Of God, who ever reigns,
Who sent his angel of the sea,
To break these icy chains.
Then go and bring my swiftest steed,
Convey them to the hall,
And tell for me the matron dear,
About their icy fall.
O that her hand would be their guide,
For such a hand must be,
They should not trifle with the ice,
Nor with the laughing sea.
How glad I am and proud to say
No damage has been done
To you young men like heroes stood,
Till you the victory won.
 
So fare you well my playful friends,
And weeping as we part,
But may each one to each confide
Through time, in each one's heart.
DEDICATED TO THE JUNIOR SOCIETY.
WALDEN'S DEPARTURE FROM THE JUNIOR LITERARY SOCIETY.
THINK not I come to curry favor,
For that would be beneath my aim,
And I would crucify my honor,
And put my manhood thus to shame.
I merely come to right the crooked,
To make amends where I was wrong,
I will not trifle with your follies,
Nor raise my hand against the strong.
I must confess through heat of passion,
Your president I did offend,
Pray tell me does he reign supremely?
One uncondemned can he suspend?
You, ravenous, wolf like, would devour
And swallow me up heels and head,
If not by a quick and sudden spring,
The victim of your venom fled.
Your nets my feet shall never tangle,
Nor will I tread your winding way,
Wrongward, downward, deep descending,
Oh, vote him out I heard you say.
Whose thoughts should be both high and lofty,
With upturned eyes towards the sky,
You should not treat an humble member,
That he might from your colors fly.
True courtesy among you Juniors
Is what I long have sought to gain,
In spite of all my humble efforts,
My work to me seems all in vain.
Therefore, it's best that we should sever,
Before another rising sun,
That each may in this fleeting contest
Think that he has the victory won.
I'd freely give up my tuition,
Or give to you my heart and hand,
If we could live in union severed,
Or else within this happy band.
It's hard to sever ties of friendship,
Or cords of love which closely bind,
Perhaps from this we 'll take a warning,
May learn to be both just and kind.
Therefore, I bid you happy Juniors,
A mournful, long and last farewell,
There 're other things around us rising
Which I have not the time to tell.
May luck and friendship guard your future,
My prayers shall follow you till death,
While still my pulse continues beating,
Or I may beat a fleeting breath.
THE HAND OF DEATH INVISIBLE.
WHAT hand is this that leads me on?
Shall I refuse to go-
To my eternal destiny,
Of happiness or woe?
Invisible it does appear,
Unseen by mortal eye,
I cannot turn to right nor left,
Nor can I from it fly.
"Tis nature's voice that speaks within,
That skakes this mortal frame,
"Tis justice making her demand,
And death presents her claim.
This hand will ever lead me on
From childhood to the grave—
Will break the chain that holds me fast,
Emancipate the slave.
Therefore my thoughts should upward tend,
To realms of bliss above,
Where heavenly hosts beyond the clouds
Will greet my soul in love.
 
CORRESPONDENT SOLICITED.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., April 17, 1873.
MISS VIRGINIA DELANEY:
Dear Miss: If not mistaken in the person whom I think you
are, which can hardly be so, I would like very much to create
a correspondence between us, if it would be in accordance
with your wishes.
Please consider this proposal and give me an answer at
your pleasure.
FOR thls my pen has long displayed,
E'er long its been delighted,
To know thou art a fair young maid
Whom no one yet has slighted.
From year to year it onward glides,
I glory in its winging;
It whispers through the graceful slides
Virginia oft is singing.
Will it not gladden every heart,
Through rhythm and its measure,
And give the young an upward start,
And thrill each nerve with pleasure?
Therefore, if thou'll accept this line-
Think not that I am hasty;
For had I now a second's time,
I'd say that I am tasty.
Remember that I 'm full of pride,
Of pity and compassion,
And she who lingers by my side
Should like my style and fashion.
My pride will never lead to shame,
Nor down to degradation,
While it shall be my highest aim
To elevate my nation.
For thou canst see the stars are bright,
And worlds around are swelling,
Therefore it will be thy delight
To overlook my spelling.
Therefore, unfold each fleeting thought,
Seek well for the intention,
Which nature's hand alone has wrought
In words I need not mention.
Kind Miss, to thee no more I'll say,
Nor add unto my measure,
Except to write without delay
When it may be your pleasure.
ISLAY WALDEN.
IN HONOR OF DR. TABOR JOHNSON.
MAY 1, 1873.
'Twas on the first of May of last year in our rambles about
the vicinity of the Soldiers' Home that I indited "The May
Walk," a small poem to be found in the preceding pages of
this volume. This year, on the same day, I was wending my
way in an opposite direction-to the Congregational Church-
where my esteemed friend, the doctor, was to be married to
his now lovely wife. Whilst stopping for a moment to assist
 a friend in moving some articles of furniture from the pave.
ment to his house, the bridal party passed on their way to the
Church. However, although I missed the wished for oppor-
tunity to witness the ceremonies, the muse of poetry suggested
thoughts, as they passed by, which I hope the doctor will find
no fault in my embodying them with my other collections.
OME, idle pen, and let us sing
To May, the flowery month of spring,
And, too, with gladsome voice, we 'll hail
The May queen with the bridal veil.
Sweet month, one year ago our roam-
The hills and vales 'round Soldiers' Home-
Was bright with flowers and verdure green,
Fit tributes to thy fairy queen.
The scene has changed: for you, kind friend,
We'll garlands with our poesy blend,
And humbly at your feet now lay
Our offerings to YOUR Queen of May.
The happy bridegroom and the bride
In blissful love sit side by side,
Whilst twit'ring birds, with swelling throats,
Are caroling their matin notes.
Go, loved ones, meet the waiting group
Of anxious friends, who fondly hope
That each recurring first of May
May prove a golden wedding day.
O many, prosperous years be thine;
And may angelic hosts entwine
A wreath for each, of faith and love-
A fadeless crown in Heaven above.
PLACE THY TRUST IN GOD.
HOWARD UNIVERSITY,
Washington, D. C., April 15, 1872.
MISS CATHERINE HILL:
Dear Niece: I received yours a few days ago, and was glad
to learn that you were all well and anxious to see me return
home next Christmas, which I hope to be able to do. I was
more than gratified to know that the letter which you sent me
was written by your own dear little hand. I did not read very
many lines before I was lead to weep to hear you say that you,
your mother and your aunt had professed religion, and had
joined the church at the old " Quaker Meeting House." Your
beautiful letter carried me back to the old Meeting House.
Ah! I imagine that many of the brethren who were accustomed
to meet there have fallen asleep and have been long since
gathered to their fathers. I am glad to know that the children
are seeking their Saviour, and are thus preparing themselves
to occupy the positions in the church which their parents must
soon vacate.
There is another very striking passage in your epistle, in
which you say that the Lord has wonderfully blessed me in
taking me from home and placing me in an institution of
learning where I may be educated. I would to the Lord that
there was a school in your neighborhood, so that instead of
learning to read and write in the Sabbath school you could
learn more about our blessed Redeemer. You asked me if it
is wrong to spend your time this way on the Sabbath. It is a
question hard to be answered by myself; but if you were in
Washington I suppose I would think it wrong, for here we have
both Sabbath and every day schools. But situated as you are,
I think it no harm, provided it does not lead to anything more;
for it is not so much what one does, but the motive which
prompts the act. You also said you wish you had such privi-
leges as I enjoy, that you might study and do more good for
the poor children in your neighborhood in the way of teaching
them. I sympathize with you much, and were I able you
should not pant for learning any longer, but should come even
here and drink from the same well of knowledge out of which
I draw daily. But I can continue to pray for you. I was ac-
custamed to pray that the Lord would convert your soul, and
your mother's and Aunt Lucy Jane's, and you have all been
converted. In a like manner will He again hear my prayer,
and provide a manner by which you may be educated, if He
so wills it. You well know how I have worked to enjoy the
advantages of education, but on account of being near sighted
(and it was supposed I could not study) I was rejected even
by Christian teachers, and particularly by one Christian insti-
tution; and when all had forsaken me the Lord took me up
from a state of degradation and ignorance and placed me even
here through the great Reform Church of America. But
first Dr. Turner, who died with one hand upon the lever
which helps to move the great educational machinery of this
country-and particularly among our race-and the other
setting forth truths of the Bible in their purity, opened the
door of his institution for me, and I entered there, and would
have gone to school there, but I found it much to my advan-
tage to come to Howard University. In conclusion allow me
to say, that I first put my trust in man because he would talk
very pleasantly to me, pat me on the back, and say in an in-
direct manner, "Depart, and be ye educated; a young man
like you is worthy of an education." My experience has
taught me this lesson, that it is better to trust in God than in
the promises of mankind, though some men are really instru-
ments for good in His hands, all along the winding ways of
life, to point us to a higher station than that in which we are
placed, even by circumstances.
When I was about giving up all hopes of getting an educa-
tion I visited President Grant, and after talking to him a while
I pulled out a copy of a little poem which I composed, which
I presented to him on bidding him good bye. He gave me a
warm shake of that heroic hand which so materially aided in
emancipating four millions of slaves, crushing the rebellion,
and is now so successfully binding the heart of every Ameri-
can to his country's cause, and said, "Never pause until you
become educated." Such words, coming from such a source,
to an uncultivated mind, indeed left impressions that time only
can efface. But after all I found it was better to trust in God
and myself, for there are things which man cannot belp us to
do, neither can we ask him.
 
I have written a long letter to you that I might tell you of
a Friend to whom you can make all your necessities known;
for you will find that there are very dark times in life, and
what I have said is true; and when you shall have experi-
enced the truthfulness of it you will exclaim--
WE truly need a friend below,
Who may our wants and troubles know;
There 're always times when sorrows press:
How dear a friend amid distress.
The Lord to us a friend will be,
Even to all eternity,
If we within his love confide,
And haven near his bleeding side.
What peace, what joy and delight,
How angels guard my soul by night,
How happy must my station be
When Christ the Lord remembers me.
This life within its brightest ray,
An emblem of an endless day;
Should I not count each moment dross,
When I behold my Saviour's cross?
Then help me, Lord, my cross to take,
And all my sinful ways forsake.
That when I shall be called to die,
On wings of love to thee I 'll fly.
I remain your affectionate uncle,

INFELICIA.
RESURGAM.
I.
YES, yes, dear love! I am dead!
Dead to you!
Dead to the world!
Dead for ever!
It was one young night in May.
The stars were strangled, and the moon was blind with the flying clouds of a black despair.
Years and years the songless soul waited to drift out beyond the sea of pain where the shapeless life was wrecked.
The red mouth closed down the breath that was hard and fierce.
The mad pulse beat back the baffled life with a low sob.
And so the stark and naked soul unfolded its wings to the dimness of Death!
A lonely, unknown Death.
A Death that left this dumb, living body as his endless mark.
And left these golden billows of hair to drown the whiteness of my bosom.
Left these crimson roses gleaming on my forehead to hide the dust of the grave.
And Death left an old light in my eyes, and old music for my tongue, to deceive the crawling worms that would seek my warm flesh.
But the purple wine that I quaff sends no thrill of Love and Song through my empty veins.
Yet my red lips are not pallid and horrified.
Thy kisses are doubtless sweet that throb out an eternal passion for me!
But I feel neither pleasure, passion nor pain.
So I am certainly dead.
Dead in this beauty!
Dead in this velvet and lace!
Dead in these jewels of light!
Dead in the music!
Dead in the dance!
II
Why did I die?
O love! I waited—I waited years and years ago.
Once the blaze of a far-off edge of living Love crept up my horizon and promised a new moon of Poesy.
A soul's full life!
A soul's full love!
And promised that my voice should ring trancing shivers of rapt melody down the grooves of this dumb earth.
And promised that echoes should vibrate along the purple
spheres of unfathomable seas, to the soundless folds of the clouds.
And promised that I should know the sweet sisterhood of the stars.
Promised that I should live with the crooked moon in her eternal beauty.
But a Midnight swooped down to bridegroom the Day.
The blazing Sphynx of that far off, echoless promise, shrank into a drowsy shroud that mocked the crying stars of my soul's unuttered song.
And so I died.
Died this uncoffined and unburied Death.
Died alone in the young May night
Died with my fingers grasping the white throat of many a prayer.
III
Yes, dear love, I died!
You smile because you see no cold, damp cerements of a lonely grave hiding the youth of my fair face.
No head-stone marks the gold of my poor unburied head.
But the flaunting poppy covered her red heart in the sand.
Who can hear the slow drip of blood from a dead soul?
No Christ of the Past writes on my laughing brow His "Resurgam."
Resurgam.
What is that when I have been dead these long weary years!
IV.
Silver walls of Sea!
Gold and spice laden barges!
White-sailed ships from Indian seas, with costly pearls and tropic wines go by unheeding!
None pause to lay one token at my feet.
No mariner lifts his silken banner for my answering hail
No messages from the living to the dead.
Must all lips fall out of sound as the soul dies to be heard?
Shall Love send back no revelation through this interminable distance of Death?
Can He who promised the ripe Harvest forget the weeping Sower?
How can I stand here so calm?
I hear the clods dosing down my coffin, and yet shriek not out like the pitiless wind, nor reach my wild arms after my dead soul!
Will no sun of fire again rise over the solemn East?
I am tired of the foolish moon showing only her haggard face above the rocks and chasms of my grave.
O Rocks! O Chasms! sink back to your black cradles in the West!
Leave me dead in the depths!
Leave me dead in the wine!
Leave me dead in the dance!
V.
How did I die?
The man I loved —he—he—ah, well!
There is no voice from the grave.
The ship that went down at sea, with seven times a thousand souls for Death, sent back no answer.
The breeze is voiceless that saw the sails shattered in the mad tempest, and heard the cry for mercy as one frail arm clung to the last spar of the sinking wreck.
Fainting souls rung out their unuttered messages to the silent clouds.
Alas! I died not so!
I died not so!
VI.
How did I die?
No man has wrenched his shroud from his stiffened corpse to say..
"Ye murdered me!"
No woman has died with enough of Christ in her soul to tear the bandage from her glassy eyes and say:
"Ye crucified me!"
Resurgam! Resurgam!

DREAMS OF BEAUTY.
VISIONS of Beauty, of Light, and of Love,
Born in the soul of a Dream,
Lost, like the phantom-bird under the dove,
When she flies over a stream—
Come ye through portals where angel wings droop,
Moved by the heaven of sleep?
Or, are ye mockeries, crazing a soul,
Doomed with its waking to weep?
I could believe ye were shadows of earth,
Echoes of hopes that are vain,
But for the music ye bring to my heart,
Waking its sunshine again.
And ye are fleeting. All vainly I strive
Beauties like thine to portray;
Forth from my pencil the bright picture starts,
And—ye have faded away.
Like to a bird that soars up from the spray,
When we would fetter its wing;
Like to the song that spurns Memory's grasp
When the voice yearneth to sing;
Like the cloud-glory that sunset lights up,
When the storm bursts from its height;
Like the sheet-silver that rolls on the sea,
When it is touched by the night—
Bright, evanescent, ye come and are gone,
Visions of mystical birth;
Art that could paint you was never vouchsafed
Unto the children of earth.
Yet in my soul there's a longing to tell
All you have seemed unto me,
That unto others a glimpse of the skies
You in their sorrow might be.
Vain is the wish. Better hope to describe
All that the spirit desires,
When through a cloud of vague fancies and schemes
Flash the Promethean fires.
Let me then think of ye, Visions of Light,
Not as the tissue of dreams.
But as realities destined to be
Bright in Futurity's beams.
Ideas formed by a standard of earth
Sink at Reality's shrine
Into the human and weak like ourselves,
Losing the essence divine;
But the fair pictures that fall from above
On the heart's mirror sublime
Carry a signature written in tints,
Bright with the future of time,
And the heart, catching them, yieldeth a spark
Under each stroke of the rod—
Sparks that fly upward and light the New Life,
Burning an incense to God!
[missing figure]
MY HERITAGE.
"MY heritage!" It is to live within
The marts of Pleasure and of Gain, yet be
No willing worshiper at either shrine;
To think, and speak, and act, not for my pleasure,
But others'. The veriest slave of time
And circumstances. Fortune's toy!
To hear of fraud, injustice, and oppression,
And feel who is the unshielded victim.
Cold friends and causeless foes!
Proud thoughts that rise to fall.
Bright stars that set in seas of blood;
Affections, which are passions, lava-like
Destroying what they rest upon. Love's
Fond and fervid tide preparing icebergs
That fragile bark, this loving human heart.
O'ermastering Pride!
Ruler of the Soul!
Life, with all its changes, cannot bow ye.
Soul-subduing Poverty!
That lays his iron, cold grasp upon the high
Free spirit: strength, sorrow-born, that bends
But breaks not in his clasp—all, all
These are "my heritage!"
And mine to know a reckless human love, all passion
and intensity, and see a mist come o'er the scene, a dimness steal o'er the soul!
Mine to dream of joy and wake to wretchedness!
Mine to stand on the brink of life
One little moment where the fresh'ning breeze
Steals o'er the languid lip and brow, telling
Of forest leaf, and ocean wave, and happy
Homes, and cheerful toil; and bringing gently
To this wearied heart its long-forgotten
Dreams of gladness.
But turning the fevered cheek to meet the soft kiss of the winds, my eyes look to the sky, where I send up my soul in thanks. The sky is clouded—no stars—no music—the heavens are hushed.
My poor soul comes back to me, weary and disappointed.
The very breath of heaven, that comes to all, comes not to me.
Bound in iron gyves of unremitting toil, my vital air is wretchedness—what need I any other?
"My heritage!" The shrouded eye, the trampled leaf, wind-driven and soiled with dust—these tell the tale.
Mine to watch
The glorious light of intellect
Burn dimly, and expire; and mark the soul,
Though born in Heaven, pause in its high career,
Wave in its course, and fall to grovel in
The darkness of earth's contamination, till
Even Death shall scorn to give a thing
So low his welcome greeting!
Who would be that pale,
Blue mist, that hangs so low in air, like Hope
That has abandoned earth, yet reacheth
Not the stars in their proud homes?
A dying eagle, striving to reach the sun?
A little child talking to the gay clouds as they flaunt past in their purple and crimson robes?
A timid little flower singing to the grand old trees?
Foolish waves, leaping up and trying to kiss the moon?
A little bird mocking the stars?
Yet this is what men call Genius.

JUDITH.
"Repent, or I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight thee with the sword of my mouth."—
Revelation ii. 16.
I.
ASHKELON is not cut off with the remnant of a valley.
Baldness dwells not upon Gaza.
The field of the valley is mine, and it is clothed in verdure.
The steepness of Baal-perazim is mine;
And the Philistines spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
They shall yet be delivered into my hands.
For the God of Battles has gone before me!
The sword of the mouth shall smite them to dust.
I have slept in the darkness—
But the seventh angel woke me, and giving me a sword of time, points to the blood-ribbed cloud, that lifts his reeking head above the mountain.
Thus am I the prophet.
I see the dawn that heralds to my waiting soul the advent of power.
Power that will unseal the thunders!
Power that will give voice to graves!
Graves of the living;
Graves of the dying;
Graves of the sinning;
Graves of the loving;
Graves of despairing;
And oh! graves of the deserted!
These shall speak, each as their voices shall be loosed.
And the day is dawning.
II.
Stand back, ye Philistines!
Practice what ye preach to me;
I heed ye not, for I know ye all.
Ye are living burning lies, and profanation to the garments which with stately steps ye sweep your marble palaces.
Your palaces of Sin, around which the damning evidence of guilt hangs like a reeking vapor.
Stand back!
I would pass up the golden road of the world.
A place in the ranks awaits me.
I know that ye are hedged on the borders of my path,
Lie and tremble, for ye well know that I hold with iron grasp the battle axe.
Creep back to your dark tents in the valley.
Slouch back to your haunts of crime.
Ye do not know me, neither do ye see me.
But the sword of the mouth is unsealed, and ye coil yourselves in slime and bitterness at my feet.
I mix your jeweled heads, and your gleaming eyes, and your hissing tongues with the dust.
My garments shall bear no mark of ye.
When I shall return this sword to the angel, your foul blood will not stain its edge.
It will glimmer with the light of truth, and the strong arm shall rest.
III.
Stand back!
I am no Magdalene waiting to kiss the hem of your garment.
It is mid-day.
See ye not what is written on my forehead?
I am Judith!
I wait for the head of my Holofernes!
Ere the last tremble of the conscious death-agony shall have shuddered, I will show it to ye with the long black hair clinging to the glazed eyes, and the great mouth opened in search of voice, and the strong throat all hot and reeking with blood, that will thrill me with wild unspeakable joy as it courses down my bare body and dabbles my cold feet!
My sensuous soul will quake with the burden of so much bliss.
Oh, what wild passionate kisses will I draw up from that bleeding mouth!
I will strangle this pallid throat of mine on the sweet blood!
I will revel in my passion.
At midnight I will feast on it in the darkness.
For it was that which thrilled its crimson tides of reckless passion through the blue veins of my life, and made
them leap up in the wild sweetness of Love and agony of Revenge!
I am starving for this feast.
Oh forget not that I am Judith!
And I know where sleeps Holofernes.

WORKING AND WAITING.
Suggested by Carl Müller's Cast of the Seamstress, at the Dusseldorf Gallery.
I.
LOOK on that form, once fit for the sculptor!
Look on that cheek, where the roses have died!
Working and waiting have robbed from the artist
All that his marble could show for its pride.
Statue-like sitting
Alone, in the flitting
And wind-haunted shadows that people her hearth.
God protect all of us—
God shelter all of us
From the reproach of such scenes upon earth!
II.
All the day long, and through the cold midnight,
Still the hot needle she wearily plies.
Haggard and white as the ghost of a Spurned One,
Sewing white robes for the Chosen One's eyes—
Lost in her sorrow,
But for the morrow
Phantom-like speaking in every stitch—
God protect all of us—
God shelter all of us
From the Curse, born with each sigh for the Rich!
III.
Low burns the lamp. Fly swifter, thou needle—
Swifter, thou asp for the breast of the poor!
Else the pale light will be stolen by Pity,
Ere of the vital part thou hast made sure.
Dying, yet living:
All the world's giving
Barely the life that runs out with her thread.
God protect all of us—
God shelter all of us
From her last glance, as she follows the Dead!
IV.
What if the morning finds her still bearing
All the soul's load of a merciless lot!
Fate will not lighten a grain of the burden
While the poor bearer by man is forgot
Sewing and sighing!
Sewing and dying!
What to such life is a day or two more?
God protect all of us—
God shelter all of us
From the new day's lease of woe to the Poor!
V.
Hasten, ye winds! and yield her the mercy
Lying in sleep on your purified breath;
Yield her the mercy, enfolding a blessing,
Yield her the mercy whose signet is Death.
In her toil stopping,
See her work dropping—
Fate, thou art merciful! Life, thou art done!
God protect all of us—
God shelter all of us
From the heart breaking, and yet living on!
VI.
Winds that have sainted her, tell ye the story
Of the young life by the needle that bled;
Making its bridge over Death's soundless waters
Out of a swaying and soul-cutting thread.
Over it going,
All the world knowing!
Thousands have trod it, foot-bleeding, before!
God protect all of us—
God shelter all of us,
Should she look back from the Opposite Shore!

THE RELEASE.
I.
"Carry me out of the host, for I am wounded."
THE battle waged strong.
A fainting soul was borne from the host.
The tears robed themselves in the scarlet of guilt, and crowned with iron of wrong, they trod heavily on the wounded soul,
Bound close to the dark prison-walls, with the clanking chains of old Error.
Malice and Envy crept up the slimy sides of the turrets to mark out with gore-stained fingers the slow hours of the night.
The remorseless Past stood ever near, breathing through the broken chords of life its never-ending dirge.
Yet, Ahab-like, the poor soul lingered on, bleeding and pining, pleading and praying.
Only through its mournful windows did the yearning soul dare speak;
Still through the tears did it ever vainly reach outward some kindred soul to seek.
Unheeding did the ranks sweep by;
And the weary soul sank back with all its deep unuttered longings to the loneliness of its voiceless world.
Hearing only the measured tread of Guile and Deceit on their sentinel round.
Wherefore was that poor soul of all the host so wounded?
It struggled bravely.
Wherefore was it doomed and prisoned to pine and strive apart?
It battled to the last. Can it be that this captive soul was a changeling, and battled and struggled in a body not its own?
Must Error ever bind the fetters deep into the shrinking flesh?
Will there come no angel to loose them?
And will Truth lift up her lamp at the waking?
Shall the cold tomb of the body grow warm and voice forth all the speechless thought of the soul when the sleeping dead shall rise?
Will there be no uprising in this world?
O! impatient Soul, wait, wait, wait.
II.
"The Angel
Who driveth away the demon band
Bids the din of battle cease."
O prisoned Soul, up in your turrets so high, look down from thy windows to-day!
Dash down the rusty chains of old Error, and unbar the iron doors,
Break the bonds of the Past on the anvil of the Present.
O give me some token for the music that I have sent through your lonely chambers!
Wave but the tip of your white wing in greeting to the Angel that I have sent you!
Look forth on thy fellow Soul pausing at the gate!
List to the sound of his voice that rushes past the red roof, and with unfurled wings, sweeps up its music through the ivory gates to thee!
No other song can thrill its echoes up to thy captive life.
For this Angel hath chilled the hot hand of Sin, and crushed down the grave of the crimson eyes of the Past.
The daylight looms up softly, and feathery Hope is on guard.
O waiting Soul, come forth from your turrets, so lone and high!
Listen to the low sweet music of promise, rushing wildly through floods of God-inspiration of love, up to Eternity.
Tremble not at the bars. Come forth!
The tongue you fear sleeps in frozen silence, and doth thy mighty secret keep.
[missing figure]
IN VAIN.
I.
O FOOLISH tears, go back!
Learn to cover your jealous pride far down in the nerveless heart that ye are voices for.
Your sobbings mar the unfinished picture that my trembling life would fill up to greet its dawn.
I know, poor heart, that you are reaching up to a love that finds not all its demands in thy weak pulse.
And I know that you sob up your red tears to my face, because—because—others who care less for his dear Love may, each day, open their glad eyes his lightest wish to bless.
But, jealous heart, we will not give him from drops that overflow thy rim.
We will fathom the mysteries of earth, of air and of sea, to fill thy broad life with beauty, and then empty all its very depths of light deep into his wide soul!
II.
Ah! When I am a cloud—a pliant, floating cloud—I will haunt the Sun-God for some eternal ray of Beauty.
I will wind my soft arms around the wheels of his blazing chariot, till he robes me in gorgeous trains of gold!
I will sing to the stars till they crown me with their richest jewels!
I will plead to the angels for the whitest, broadest wings that ever walled their glorious heights around a dying soul!
Then I will flaunt my light down the steep grooves of space into this dark, old world, until Eyes of Love will brighten for me!
III.
When I am a flower—a wild, sweet flower—I will open my glad blue eyes to one alone.
I will bloom in his footsteps, and muffle their echoes with my velvet lips.
So near him will I grow that his breath shall mark kisses on all my green leaves!
I will fill his deep soul with all the eternal fragrance of my love!
Yes, I will be a violet—a wild sweet violet—and sigh my very life away for him!
IV.
When I am a bird—a white-throated bird—all trimmed in plumage of crimson and gold, I will sing to one alone.
I will come from the sea—the broad blue sea—and fold my wings with olive-leaves to the glad tidings of his hopes!
I will come from the forest—the far old forest—where sighs and tears of reckless loves have never moaned away the morning of poor lives.
I will come from the sky, with songs of an angel, and flutter into his soul to see how I may be all melody to him!
Yes, I will be a bird—a loving, docile bird—and furl my wild wings, and shut my sad eyes in his breast!
V.
When I am a wave—a soft, white wave—I will run up from ocean's purple spheres, and murmur out my low sweet voice to one alone,
I will dash down to the cavern of gems and lift up to his eyes Beauty that will drink light from the Sun!
I will bring blue banners that angels have lost from the clouds.
Yes, I will be a wave—a happy, dancing wave—and leap up in the sunshine to lay my crown of spray-pearls at his feet.
VI.
Alas! poor heart, what am I now?
A weed—a frail, bitter weed—growing outside the garden wall
All day straining my dull eyes to see the blossoms within, as they wave their crimson flags to the wind.
And yet my dark leaves pray to be as glorious as the rose.
My bitter stalks would be as sweet as the violet if they could.
I try to bloom up into the light.
My poor, yearning soul to Heaven would open its velvet eyes of fire.
Oh! the love of Beauty through every fibre of my lonely life is trembling!
Every floating cloud and flying bird draws up jealous Envy and bleeding Love!
So passionately wild in me is this burning unspeakable thirst to grow all beauty, all grace, all melody to one—and to him alone!

VENETIA.
BRIGHT as the light that burns at night,
In the starry depths of Aiden,
When star and moon in leafy June
With love and joy are laden;
Bright as the light from moon and star,
Stars in glorious cluster,
Be the lights that shine on this life of thine
Be the beauty of its lustre.
Beneath the moon in leafy June,
Sweet vows are fondly spoken;
Beneath the stars, the silvery tune
Of music floats unbroken.
Beneath the sky, and moon and stars,
Come nestling birds of beauty,
And Love with Bliss, and Hope with Joy
Troop down the path of duty.
Oh! ever may'st thou, bird of mine,
Nestle to my bosom sweetly,
Birds of my soaring, feathery hope,
That flyeth to me so fleetly.
Oh! ever thus may vows of love
My yearning soul inherit—
Vows unbroken, as those spoken
By celestial spirit.
And when the vow thou breathest now,
For me, for mine and only,
Shall float to Aiden's starry land,
Where none are lost or lonely,
Believe me, when the angel bends
His loving ear to listen,
Radiant will be the smile that blends
With the beauteous tears that glisten.
For darling, those who love us here
With tender, sweet emotion,
With love that knows no stop or fear,
But burneth with devotion;
'Tis only but another proof
That something good is left us,
That we are not by Heaven forgot,
That Heaven hath not bereft us.

THE SHIP THAT WENT DOWN.
I.
WHO hath not sent out ships to sea?
Who hath not toiled through light and darkness to make them strong for battle?
And how we freighted them with dust from the mountain mines!
And red gold, coined from the heart's blood, rich in Youth, Love and Beauty!
And we have fondly sent forth on their white decks seven times a hundred souls.
Sent them out like sea-girt worlds full of hope, love, care and faith.
O mariners, mariners, watch and beware!
II.
See the Ship that I sent forth!
How proudly she nods her regal head to each saluting wave!
How defiantly she flaps her white sails at the sun, who, in envy of her beauty, screens his face behind a passing cloud, yet never losing sight of her.
The ocean hath deck'd himself in robes of softest blue, and lifted his spray-flags to greet her.
The crimson sky hath swooped down from her Heaven-Palace, and sitteth with her white feet dabbling in the borders of the sea, while she sendeth sweet promises on the wings of the wind to my fair Ship.
O mariners, mariners, why did ye not watch and beware?
III.
The faithless sky is black.
The ocean howls on the Ship's rough track.
The strong wind, and the shouting rain swept by like an armed host whooping out their wild battle-cry.
The tall masts dip their heads down into the deep.
The wet shrouds rattle as they seem to whisper prayers to themselves;
But the waves leap over their pallid sails, and grapple and gnaw at their seams.
The poor Ship shrieks and groans out her despair.
She rises up to plead with the sky, and sinks down the deep valley of water to pray.
O God, make us strong for the battle!
IV.
What says the mariner so hurried and pale?
No need to whisper it, speak out, speak!
Danger and peril you say?
Does your quivering lip and white cheek mean that the good Ship must go down?
Why stand ye idle and silent?
O sailors, rouse your brave hearts!
Man the rocking masts, and reef the rattling sails!
Heed not the storm-fires that so terribly burn in the black sky!
Heed not the storm-mad sea below!
Heed not the death-cry of the waves!
Foot to foot, hand to hand! Toil on brave hearts!
Our good Ship must be saved!
Before us lies the goal!
V.
Too late, too late!
The life-boats are lost.
The rent spars have groaned out their lives, and the white sails have shrouded them in their rough beds of Death.
Strong mariners have fainted and failed in the terror and strife.
White lips are grasping for breath, and trembling out prayers, and waiting to die.
And the Ship, once so fair, lies a life-freighted wreck.
The Promises, Hopes, and Loves, are sinking, sinking away.
The winds shriek out their joy, and the waves shout out their anthem of Death.
Pitiless wind!
Pitiless ocean!
VI.
O mariners, is there no help?
Is there no beacon-light in the distance?
Dash the tears of blood from your eyes, and look over these Alps of water!
See ye no sail glittering through the darkness?
Is there no help?
Must they all die, all die?
So much of Youth, so much of Beauty, so much of Life?
The waves answer with ravenous roar;
They grapple like demons the trembling Ship!
Compassless, rudderless, the poor Ship pleads.
In vain! in vain!
With a struggling, shivering, dying grasp, my good Ship sank down, down, down to the soundless folds of the fathomless ocean.
Lost—lost—lost.

BATTLE OF THE STARS.
(After Ossian.)
ALONE on the hill of storms
The voice of the wind shrieks through the mountain.
The torrent rushes down the rocks.
Red are hundred streams of the light-covered paths of the dead.
Shield me in from the storm,
I that am a daughter of the stars, and wear the purple and gold of bards, with the badges of Love on my white bosom.
I heed not the battle-cry of souls!
I that am chained on this Ossa of existence.
Sorrow hath bound her frozen chain about the wheels of my chariot of fire wherein my soul was wont to ride.
Stars, throw off your dark robes, and lead me to the palace where my Eros rests on his iron shield of war, his gleaming sword in the scabbard, his hounds haunting around him.
The water and the storm cry aloud.
I hear not the voice of my Love.
Why delays the chief of the stars his promise?
Here is the terrible cloud, and here the cloud of life with its many-colored sides.
Thou didst promise to be with me when night should trail her dusky skirts along the borders of my soul.
O wind! O thought! Stream and torrent, be ye silent!
Let the wanderer hear my voice.
Eros, I am waiting. Why delay thy coming? It is Atha calls thee.
See the calm moon comes forth.
The flood is silver in the vale.
The rocks are gray on the steep.
I see him not on the mountain brow;
The hounds come not with the glad tidings of his approach.
I wait for morning in my tears.
Rear the tomb, but close it not till Eros comes:
Not unharmed will return the eagle from the field of foes.
But Atha will not mark thy wounds, she will be silent in her blood.
Love, the great Dreamer, will listen to her voice, and she will sleep on the soft bosom of the hills.
O Love! though Mighty Leveler,
Thou alone canst lay the shepherd's crook beside the sceptre,
Thou art the King of the Stars.
Music floats up to thee, receives thy breath, thy burning kisses, and comes back with messages to children of earth.
Thou art pitiful and bountiful
Although housed with the golden-halted Son of the Sky, with stars for thy children, dwelling in the warm clouds, and sleeping on the silver shields of War, yet ye do not disdain the lonely Atha that hovers round
the horizon of your Grand Home. You awake and come forth arrayed in trailing robes of glory, with blessing and with song to greet her that seeketh thy mighty presence.
Thy hand giveth Morn her power;
Thy hand lifteth the mist from the hills;
Thy hand createth all of Beauty;
Thy hand giveth Morn her rosy robes;
Thy hands bound up the wounds of Eros after the battle:
Thy hands lifted him to the skirts of the wind, like the eagle of the forest
Thy hands have bound his brow with the spoils of the foe.
Thy hands have given to me the glittering spear, and helmet of power and might;
Nor settles the darkness on me.
The fields of Heaven are mine.
I will hush the sullen roar of the enemy.
Warriors shall lift their shields to me.
My arm is strong, my sword defends the weak.
I will loose the thong of the Oppressed, and dash to hell the Oppressor.
A thousand warriors stretch their spears around me.
I battle for the stars.
It was thy hands, O Love, that loosed my golden tresses, and girded my white limbs in armor, and made me leader of the armies of Heaven.
Thy voice aroused the sluggard soul.
Thy voice calleth back the sleeping dead.
Thou alone, O Mighty Ruler, canst annihilate space, hush the shrieking wind, hide the white-halted waves,
and bear me to the arms and burning kisses of my Eros.
And it is thou who makest beautiful the prison-houses of earth.
I once was chained to their darkness, but thou, O Love, brought crimson roses to lay on my pale bosom, and covered the cold damp walls with the golden shields of the sun, and left thy purple garments whereon my weary bleeding feet might rest.
And when black-winged night rolled along the sky, thy shield covered the moon, and thy hands threw back the prison-roof, and unfolded the gates of the clouds, and I slept in the white arms of the stars.
And thou, O Beam of Life! didst thou not forget the lonely prisoner of Chillon in his gloomy vault? thy blessed ray of Heaven-light stole in and made glad his dreams.
Thou hast lifted the deep-gathered mist from the dungeons of Spielberg;
Ugolino heard thy voice in his hopeless cell:
Thy blessed hand soothed Damiens on his bed of steel;
It is thy powerful hand that lights up to Heaven the inspired life of Garabaldi.
And it is thy undying power that will clothe Italy in the folds of thy wings, and rend the helmet from the dark brow of old Austria, and bury her in the eternal tomb of darkness.
Thou didst not forget children of earth, who roll the waves of their souls to our ship of the sky.
But men are leagued against us—strong mailed men of earth,
Around the dwellers in the clouds they rise in wrath.
No words come forth, they seize their blood-stained daggers.
Each takes his hill by night, at intervals they darkly stand counting the power and hoot of Heaven.
Their black unmuzzled hounds howl their impatience as we come on watch in our glittering armor.
The hills no longer smile up to greet us, they are covered with these tribes of earth leading their war-dogs, and leaving their footprints of blood.
Unequal bursts the hum of voices, and the clang of arms between the roaring wind.
And they dare to blaspheme the very stars, and even God on His high throne in the Heaven of Heavens, by pleading for Love.
Love sacrifices all things to bless the thing it loves, not destroy.
Go back to your scorching homes;
Go back to your frozen souls;
Go back to your seas of blood;
Go back to your chains, your loathsome charnel houses;
Give us the green bosom of the hills to rest upon;
Broad over them rose the moon.
O Love, Great Ruler, call upon thy children to buckle on the armor of war, for behold the enemy blackens all earth in waiting for us.
See the glittering of their unsheathed swords.
They bear blood-stained banners of death and destruction.
And, lo, their Leader comes forth on the Pale Horse.
His sword is a green meteor half-extinguished.
His face is without form, and dark withal, dark as the tales of other times, before the light of song arose.
Mothers, clasp your new-born children close to your white bosoms!
Daughters of the stars, sleep no more, the enemy approacheth!
Look to your white shields!
Bind up your golden tresses!
See the blood upon the pale breasts of your sisters.
Where are your banners?
O sluggards, awake to the call of the Mighty Ruler!
Hear ye not the clash of arms? Arise around me, children of the Land Unknown.
Up, up, grasp your helmet and your spear!
Let each one look upon her shield as the ruler of War.
Come forth in your purple robes, sound your silver-tongue trumpets;
Rush upon the enemy with your thousand and thousands of burnished spears!
Let your voices ring through the Universe, "Liberty, liberty for the stars." Thunder it on the ears of the guilty and the doomed!
Sound it with the crash of Heaven's wrath to the hearts of branded—God-cursed things who have stood up and scorned their Maker with laughing curses, as they dashed the crown from her brow, and hurled her into Hell.
Pray ye not for them, hills! Heed ye not, O winds, their penitence is feigned!
Let your voices, O floods, be hushed! stars, close your mighty flanks, and battle on them!
Chain them down close to the fire!
They were merciless, bind their blood-stained hands.
They are fiends, and if ye loose them they will tear children from their mothers, wives from their husbands, sisters from their brothers, daughters from their fathers.
And these fiends, these children of eternal damnation, these men will tear souls from bodies, and then smear their hands with blood, and laugh as they sprinkle it in the dead up-turned faces of their victims.
It is Atha thy leader that calls to you.
Beat them down, beat them down.
I know these war-dogs,
They strangled my warrior, Eros!
Warrior of my soul;
Warrior of the strong race of Eagles!
His crimson life crushed out on the white sails of a ship.
Battle them down to dust.
Battle them back into their own slimy souls;
Battle them, ye starry armies of Heaven, down into the silent sea of their own blood;
Battle on, the wind is with ye;
Battle on, the sun is with ye;
Battle on, the waves are with ye;
The Angels are with ye;
God is with us!
MYSELF.
"La patience est amère; mais le fruit en est doux!"
I.
AWAY down into the shadowy depths of the Real I once lived.
I thought that to seem was to be.
But the waters of Marah were beautiful, yet they were bitter.
I waited, and hoped, and prayed;
Counting the heart-throbs and the tears that answered them.
Through my earnest pleadings for the True, I learned that the mildest mercy of life was a smiling sneer;
And that the business of the world was to lash with vengeance all who dared to be what their God had made them.
Smother back tears to the red blood of the heart!
Crush out things called souls!
No room for them here!
II.
Now I gloss my pale face with laughter, and sail my voice on with the tide.
Decked in jewels and lace, I laugh beneath the gaslight's glare, and quaff the purple wine.
But the minor-keyed soul is standing naked and hungry upon one of Heaven's high hills of light.
Standing and waiting for the blood of the feast!
Starving for one poor word!
Waiting for God to launch out some beacon on the boundless shores of this Night.
Shivering for the uprising of some soft wing under which it may creep, lizard-like, to warmth and rest.
Waiting! Starving and shivering!
III.
Still I trim my white bosom with crimson roses; for none shall see the thorns.
I bind my aching brow with a jeweled crown, that none shall see the iron one beneath.
My silver-sandaled feet keep impatient time to the music, because I cannot be calm.
I laugh at earth's passion-fever of Love; yet I know that God is near to the soul on the hill, and hears the ceaseless ebb and flow of a hopeless love, through all my laughter.
But if I can cheat my heart with the old comfort, that love can be forgotten, is it not better?
After all, living is but to play a part!
The poorest worm would be a jewel-headed snake if she could!
IV.
All this grandeur of glare and glitter has its night-time.
The pallid eyelids must shut out smiles and daylight.
Then I fold my cold hands, and look down at the restless rivers of a love that rushes through my life.
Unseen and unknown they tide on over black rocks and chasms of Death.
Oh, for one sweet word to bridge their terrible depths!
O jealous soul! why wilt thou crave and yearn for what thou canst not have?
And life is so long—so long.
V.
With the daylight comes the business of living.
The prayers that I sent trembling up the golden thread of hope all come back to me.
I lock them close in my bosom, far under the velvet and roses of the world.
For I know that stronger than these torrents of passion is the soul that hath lifted itself up to the hill.
What care I for his careless laugh?
I do not sigh; but I know that God hears the life-blood dripping as I, too, laugh.
I would not be thought a foolish rose, that flaunts her red heart out to the sun.
Loving is not living!
VI.
Yet through all this I know that night will roll back
from the still, gray plain of heaven, and that my triumph shall rise sweet with the dawn!
When these mortal mists shall unclothe the world, then shall I be known as I am!
When I dare be dead and buried behind a wall of wings, then shall he know me!
When this world shall fall, like some old ghost, wrapped in the black skirts of the wind, down into the fathomless eternity of fire, then shall souls uprise!
When God shall lift the frozen seal from struggling voices, then shall we speak!
When the purple-and-gold of our inner natures shall be lighted up in the Eternity of Truth, then will love be mine!
I can wait.
[missing figure]
INTO THE DEPTHS.
I.
LOST—lost—lost!
To me, for ever, the seat near the blood of the feast.
To me, for ever, the station near the Throne of Love!
To me, for ever, the Kingdom of Heaven—and I the least.
Oh, the least in love—
The least in joy—
The least in life—
The least in death—
The least in beauty—
The least in eternity.
So much of rich, foaming, bubbling human blood drank down into the everlasting sea of Sin.
The jasper gates are closed on the crimson highway of the clouds.
The Seven Angels stand on guard.
Seven thunders utter their voices.
And the angels have not sealed up those things which the seven thunders have uttered.
I have pleaded to the seventh angel for the little book.
But he heedeth me not.
All life is bitter, not one drop as sweet as honey.
And yet I prophesy before many people, and nations, and tongues, and kings!
II.
Lost—lost—lost!
The little golden key which the first angel entrusted to me.
The gates are closed, and I may not enter.
Yet arrayed in folds of white, these angels are more terrible to me than the fabled watcher of the Hesperides golden treasures.
Because it is I alone of all God's creatures that am shut out.
For others the bolts are withdrawn, and the little book unsealed.
With wistful eyes, and longing heart, I wander in the distance, waiting for the angels to sleep.
Tremblingly I peer through the gloaming of horrid shadows, and visions of wasted moments.
But the white eyelids of the angels never droop.
In vain I plead to them that it was I who built the throne.
In vain do I tell them that it was I who gemmed it with Faith and Truth, and the dews of my life's morn.
In vain do I tell them that they are my hopes which they stand in solemn guard to watch.
In vain do I plead my right as queen of the starry highway.
In vain do I bind my golden tresses with the pale lilies of the valley.
In vain do I display to them my purple broidered robes, and the silver badge of God's eternal bards that I wear on my white bosom.
In vain do I wind my soft arms around their silver-sandaled feet.
They heed me not.
But point to the whirlpool called the world.
Must the warm, living, loving soul a wanderer be?
Are all its yearnings vain?
Are all its prayings vain?
Will there be no light to guide me?
Will there be strong arm at the helm?
Must the full lamp of life wane so early?
Ah, I see, all is lost—lost—lost!
III.
Deep into the depths!
Struggling all the day-time—weeping all the night-time!
Writing away all vitality.
Talking to people, nations, tongues, and kings that heed me not.
Cast out of my own kingdom on to the barren battle-plain of bloodless life.
A thousand foes advancing?
A thousand weapons glancing!
And I in the sternest scene of strife.
Panting wildly in the race.
Malice and Envy on the track.
Fleet of foot, they front me with their daggers at my breast.
All heedless of my tears and prayers, they tear the white flowers from my brow, and the olive leaves from my breast, and soil with their blood-marked hands the broidered robes of purple beauty.
Life's gems are torn from me, and in scattered fragments around me lie.
All lost—lost—lost!
IV.
Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord!
Weeping all the night-time.
Weeping sad and chill through the lone woods.
Straying 'mong the ghostly trees.
Wandering through the rustling leaves.
Sobbing to the moon, whose icy light wraps me like a shroud.
Leaning on a hoary rock, praying to the mocking stars.
With Love's o'erwhelming power startling my soul like an earthquake shock.
I lift my voice above the low howl of the winds to call my Eros to come and give me light and life once more.
His broad arms can raise me up to the light, and his red lips can kiss me back to life.
I heed not the storm of the world, nor the clashing of its steel.
I wait—wait—wait!
V.
How can I live so deep into the depths with all this wealth of love?
Oh, unspeakable, passionate fire of love!
Cold blood heedeth ye not.
Cold eyes know ye not.
But in this wild soul of seething passion we have warmed together.
I feel thy lava tide dashing recklessly through every blue course!
Grand, beauteous Love!
Let us live alone, far from the world of battle and pain, where we can forget this grief that has plunged me into the depths.
We will revel in ourselves.
Come, Eros, thou creator of this divine passion, come and lay my weary head on your bosom.
Draw me close up to your white breast and lull me to sleep.
Smooth back the damp, tangled mass from my pale brow.
I am so weary of battle—
Take this heavy shield.
I am so weary of toil—
Loosen my garments.
Now, wrap me close in your bosom to rest.
Closer—closer still!
Let your breath warm my cold face.
This is life—this is love!
Oh, kiss me till I sleep—till I sleep—I sleep.
SALE OF SOULS.
I.
OH, I am wild—wild!
Angels of the weary-hearted, come to thy child.
Spread your white wings over me!
Tenderly, tenderly,
Lovingly, lovingly,
Plead for me, plead for me!
II.
Souls for sale! souls for sale!
Souls for gold! who'll buy?
In the pent-up city, through the wild rush and beat of human hearts, I hear this unceasing, haunting cry:
Souls for sale! souls for sale!
Through mist and gloom,
Through hate and love,
Through peace and strife,
Through wrong and right,
Through life and death,
The hoarse voice of the world echoes up the cold gray sullen river of life.
On, on, on!
No silence until it shall have reached the solemn sea of God's for ever;
No rest, no sleep;
Waking through the thick gloom of midnight, to hear the damning cry as it mingles and clashes with the rough clang of gold.
Poor Heart, poor Heart,
Alas! I know thy fears.
III.
The hollow echoes that the iron-shod feet of the years throw back on the sea of change still vibrate through the grave-yard of prayers and tears;—
Prayers that fell unanswered,
Tears that followed hopelessly.
But pale Memory comes back through woe and shame and strife, bearing on her dark wings their buried voices;
Like frail helpless barks, they wail through the black sea of the crowded city,
Mournfully, mournfully.
IV.
Poor Heart, what do the waves say to thee?
The sunshine laughed on the hill sides.
The link of years that wore a golden look bound me to woman-life by the sweet love of my Eros, and the voice of one who made music to call me mother.
Weak Heart, weak Heart!
Oh, now I reel madly on through clouds and storms and night.
The hills have grown dark,
They lack the grace of my golden-haired child, to climb their steep sides, and bear me their smiles in the blue-eyed violets of our spring-time.
Sad Heart, what do the hills say to thee?
They speak of my Eros, and how happily in the dim discolored hours we dreamed away the glad light, and watched the gray robes of night as she came through the valley, and ascended on her way to the clouds.
Kisses of joy, and kisses of life,
Kisses of heaven, and kisses of earth,
Clinging and clasping white hands;
Mingling of soft tresses;
Murmurings of love, and murmurings of life,
With the warm blood leaping up in joy to answer its music;
The broad shelter of arms wherein dwelt peace and content, so sweet to love.
All, all were mine.
Loving Heart, loving Heart,
Hush the wailing and sobbing voice of the past;
Sleep in thy rivers of the soul,
Poor Heart.
V.
Souls for sale!
The wild cry awoke the god of ambition, that slumbered in the bosom of Eros;
From out the tents he brought forth his shield and spear, to see them smile back at the sun;
Clad in armor, he went forth to the cities of the world, where brave men battle for glory, and souls are bartered for gold.
Weeping and fearing, haggard and barefoot, I clung to him with my fainting child.
Weary miles of land and water lay in their waste around us.
We reached the sea of the city.
Marble towers lifted their proud heads beyond the scope of vision.
Wild music mingled with laughter.
The tramp of hoofs on the iron streets, and the cries of the drowning, and the curses of the damned were all heard in that Babel, where the souls of men can be bought for gold.
All the air seemed dark with evil wings.
And all that was unholy threw their shadows everywhere,
Shadows on the good,
Shadows on the bad,
Shadows on the lowly,
Shadows on the lost!
All tossing upon the tide of rushing, restless destiny;
Upon all things written:
Souls for sale!
Lost Heart, lost Heart!
VI.
A soul mantled in glory, and sold to the world;
O horrible sale!
O seal of blood!
Give back my Eros.
His bowstring still sounds on the blast, yet his arrow was broken in the fall.
Oh leave me not on the wreck of this dark-bosomed ship while Eros lies pale on the rocks of the world.
Driven before the furious gale by the surging ocean's strife;
The strong wind lifting up the sounding sail, and whistling through the ropes and masts; waves lash the many-colored sides of the ship, dash her against the oozy rocks.
The strength of old ocean roars.
The low booming of the signal gun is heard above the tempest.
Oh how many years must roll their slow length along my life, ere the land be in sight!
When will the morning dawn?
When will the clouds be light?
When will the storm be hushed?
It is so dark and cold.
Angels of the weary-hearted, come to your child!
Build your white wings around me.
Tenderly, tenderly,
Pity me, pity me.
ONE YEAR AGO.
IN feeling I was but a child,
When first we met—one year ago,
As free and guileless as the bird,
That roams the dreary woodland through.
My heart was all a pleasant world
Of sunbeams dewed with April tears:
Life's brightest page was turned to me,
And naught I read of doubts or fears.
We met—we loved—one year ago,
Beneath the stars of summer skies;
Alas! I knew not then, as now,
The darkness of life's mysteries.
You took my hand—one year ago,
Beneath the azure dome above,
And gazing on the stars you told
The trembling story of your love.
I gave to you—one year ago,
The only jewel that was mine;
My heart took off her lonely crown,
And all her riches gave to thine.
You loved me, too, when first we met,
Your tender kisses told me so.
How changed you are from what you were
In life and love—one year ago.
With mocking words and cold neglect,
My truth and passion are repaid,
And of a soul, once fresh with love,
A dreary desert you have made.
Why did you fill my youthful life
With such wild dreams of hope and bliss?
Why did you say you loved me then,
If it were all to end in this?
You robbed me of my faith and trust
In all Life's beauty—Love and Truth,
You left me nothing—nothing save
A hopeless, blighted, dreamless youth,
Strike if you will, and let the stroke
Be heavy as my weight of woe;
I shall not shrink, my heart is cold,
'Tis broken since one year ago.
GENIUS.
"Where'er there's a life to be kindled by love,
Wherever a soul to inspire,
Strike this key-note of God that trembles above
Night's silver-tongued voices of fire."
GENIUS is power.
The power that grasps in the universe, that dives out beyond space, and grapples with the starry worlds of heaven.
If genius achieves nothing, shows us no results, it is so much the less genius.
The man who is constantly fearing a lion in his path is a coward.
The man or woman whom excessive caution holds back from striking the anvil with earnest endeavor, is poor and cowardly of purpose.
The required step must be taken to reach the goal, though a precipice be the result.
Work must be done, and the result left to God.
The soul that is in earnest, will not stop to count the cost.
Circumstances cannot control genius: it will nestle with them: its power will bend and break them to its path.
This very audacity is divine.
Jesus of Nazareth did not ask the consent of the high priests in the temple when he drove out the "money-changers;" but, impelled by inspiration, he knotted the cords and drove them hence.
Genius will find room for itself, or it is none.
Men and women, in all grades of life, do their utmost.
If they do little, it is because they have no capacity to do more.
I hear people speak of "unfortunate genius," of "poets who never penned their inspirations;" that
"Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest;"
of "unappreciated talent," and "malignant stars," and other contradictory things.
It is all nonsense.
Where power exists, it cannot be suppressed any more than the earthquake can be smothered.
As well attempt to seal up the crater of Vesuvius as to hide God's given power of the soul.
"You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops, and to make no noise
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven, "
as to hush the voice of genius.
There is no such thing as unfortunate genius.
If a man or woman is fit for work, God appoints the field.
He does more; He points to the earth with her mountains, oceans, and cataracts, and says to man, " Be great!"
He points to the eternal dome of heaven and its blazing worlds, and says: "Bound out thy life with beauty."
He points to the myriads of down-trodden, suffering men and women, and says: "Work with me for the redemption of these, my children."
He lures, and incites, and thrusts greatness upon men, and they will not take the gift.
Genius, on the Contrary, loves toil, impediment, and poverty; for from these it gains its strength, throws off the shadows, and lifts its proud head to immortality.
Neglect is but the fiat to an undying future.
To be popular is to be endorsed in the To-day and forgotten in the To-morrow.
It is the mess of pottage that alienates the birthright.
Genius that succumbs to misfortune, that allows itself to be blotted by the slime of slander—and other serpents that infest society—is so much the less genius.
The weak man or woman who stoops to whine over neglect, and poverty, and the snarls of the world, gives the sign of his or her own littleness.
Genius is power.
The eternal power that can silence worlds with its voice, and battle to the death ten thousand arméd Hercules.
Then make way for this God-crowned Spirit of Night, that was born in that Continuing City, but lives in lowly and down-trodden souls!
Fling out the banner!
Its broad folds of sunshine will wave over turret and dome, and over the thunder of oceans on to eternity.
"Fling it out, fling it out o'er the din of the world!
Make way for this banner of flame,
That streams from the mast-head of ages unfurled,
And inscribed by the deathless in name.
And thus through the years of eternity's flight,
This insignia of soul shall prevail,
The centre of glory, the focus of light;
O Genius! proud Genius, all hail!"

DRIFTS THAT BAR MY DOOR.
I
O ANGELS! will ye never sweep the drifts from my door?
Will ye never wipe the gathering rust from the hinges?
How long must I plead and cry in vain?
Lift back the iron bars, and lead me hence.
Is there not a land of peace beyond my door?
Oh, lead me to it—give me rest—release me from this unequal strife.
Heaven can attest that I fought bravely when the heavy blows fell fast.
Was it my sin that strength failed?
Was it my sin that the battle was in vain?
Was it my sin that I lost the prize? I do not sorrow
for all the bitter pain and blood it cost me.
Why do ye stand sobbing in the sunshine?
I cannot weep.
There is no sunlight in this dark cell. I am starving for light.
O angels! sweep the drifts away—unbar my door.
II.
Oh, is this all?
Is there nothing more of life?
See how dark and cold my cell.
The pictures on the walls are covered with mould.
The earth-floor is slimy with my wasting blood.
The embers are smouldering in the ashes.
The lamp is dimly flickering, and will soon starve for oil in this horrid gloom.
My wild eyes paint shadows on the walls.
And I hear the poor ghost of my lost love moaning and sobbing without.
Shrieks of my unhappiness are borne to me on the wings of the wind.
I sit cowering in fear, with my tattered garments close around my choking throat.
I move my pale lips to pray; but my soul has lost her wonted power.
Faith is weak.
Hope has laid her whitened corse upon my bosom.
The lamp sinks lower and lower. O angels! sweep the drifts away—unbar my door!
III.
Angels, is this my reward?
Is this the crown ye promised to set down on the foreheads of the loving—the suffering—the deserted?
Where are the sheaves I toiled for?
Where the golden grain ye promised?
These are but withered leaves.
Oh, is this all?
Meekly I have toiled and spun the fleece.
All the work ye assigned, my willing hands have accomplished.
See how thin they are, and how they bleed.
Ah me! what meagre pay, e'en when the task is over!
My fainting child, whose golden head graces e'en this dungeon, looks up to me and pleads for life.
O God! my heart is breaking!
Despair and Death have forced their skeleton forms through the grated window of my cell, and stand clamoring for their prey.
The lamp is almost burnt out.
Angels, sweep the drifts away—unbar my door!
IV.
Life is a lie, and Love a cheat.
There is a graveyard in my poor heart—dark, heaped-up graves, from which no flowers spring.
The walls are so high, that the trembling wings of birds do break ere they reach the summit, and they fall, wounded, and die in my bosom.
I wander 'mid the gray old tombs, and talk with the ghosts of my buried hopes.
They tell me of my Eros, and how they fluttered around him, bearing sweet messages of my love, until one day, with his strong arm, he struck them dead at his feet.
Since then, these poor lonely ghosts have haunted me night and day, for it was I who decked them in my crimson heart-tides, and sent them forth in chariots of fire.
Every breath of wind bears me their shrieks and groans.
I hasten to their graves, and tear back folds and folds
of their shrouds, and try to pour into their cold, nerveless veins the quickening tide of life once more.
Too late—too late!
Despair hath driven back Death, and clasps me in his black arms.
And the lamp! See, the lamp is dying out!
O angels! sweep the drifts from my door!—lift up the bars!
V.
Oh, let me sleep.
I close my weary eyes to think—to dream.
Is this what dreams are woven of?
I stand on the brink of a precipice, with my shivering child strained to my bare bosom.
A yawning chasm lies below. My trembling feet are on the brink.
I hear again his voice; but he reacheth not out his hand to save me.
Why can I not move my lips to pray?
They are cold.
My soul is dumb, too.
Death hath conquered!
I feel his icy fingers moving slowly along my heart-strings.
How cold and stiff!
The ghosts of my dead hopes are closing around me.
They stifle me.
They whisper that Eros has come back to me.
But I only see a skeleton wrapped in blood-stained cerements.
There are no lips to kiss me back to life.
O ghosts of Love, move back—give me air!
Ye smell of the dusty grave.
Ye have pressed your cold hands upon my eyes until they are eclipsed.
The lamp has burnt out.
O angels! be quick! Sweep the drifts away!—unbar my door!
Oh, light! light!

ASPIRATION.
POOR, impious Soul! that fixes its high hopes
In the dim distance, on a throne of clouds,
And from the morning's mist would make the ropes
To draw it up amid acclaim of crowds—
Beware! That soaring path is lined with shrouds;
And he who braves it, though of sturdy breath,
May meet, half way, the avalanche and death!
O poor young Soul!—whose year-devouring glance
Fixes in ecstasy upon a star,
Whose feverish brilliance looks a part of earth,
Yet quivers where the feet of angels are,
And seems the future crown in realms afar—
Beware! A spark thou art, and dost but see
Thine own reflection in Eternity!

MISERIMUS.
"Sounding through the silent dimness
Where I faint and weary lay,
Spake a poet: 'I will lead thee
To the land of song to-day.' "
I.
O BARDS! weak heritors of passion and of pain!
Dwellers in the shadowy Palace of Dreams!
With your unmated souls flying insanely at the stars!
Why have you led me lonely and desolate to the Deathless Hill of Song?
You promised that I should ring trancing shivers of rapt melody down to the dumb earth.
You promised that its echoes should vibrate till Time's circles met in old Eternity.
You promised that I should gather the stars like blossoms to my white bosom.
You promised that I should create a new moon of Poesy.
You promised that the wild wings of my soul should shimmer through the dusky locks of the clouds, like burning arrows, down into the deep heart of the dim world.
But, O Bards! sentinels on the Lonely Hill, why breaks there yet no Day to me?
II.
O lonely watchers for the Light! how long must I grope with my dead eyes in the sand?
Only the red fire of Genius, that narrows up life's chances to the black path that crawls on to the dizzy clouds.
The wailing music that spreads its pinions to the tremble of the wind, has crumbled off to silence.
From the steep ideal the quivering soul falls in its lonely sorrow like an unmated star from the blue heights of Heaven into the dark sea.
O Genius! is this thy promise?
O Bards! Is this all?

A MEMORY.
I SEE her yet, that dark-eyed one,
Whose bounding heart God folded up
In His, as shuts when day is done,
Upon the elf the blossom's cup.
On many an hour like this we met,
And as my lips did fondly greet her,
I blessed her as love's amulet:
Earth hath no treasure, dearer, sweeter.
The stars that look upon the hill,
And beckon from their homes at night,
Are soft and beautiful, yet still
Not equal to her eyes of light.
They have the liquid glow of earth,
The sweetness of a summer even,
As if some Angel at their birth
Had dipped them in the hues of Heaven.
They may not seem to others sweet,
Nor radiant with the beams above,
When first their soft, sad glances meet
The eyes of those not born for love;
Yet when on me their tender beams
Are turned, beneath love's wide control,
Each soft, sad orb of beauty seems
To look through mine into my soul.
I see her now that dark-eyed one,
Whose bounding heart God folded up
In His, as shuts when day is done,
Upon the elf the blossom's cup.
Too late we met, the burning brain,
The aching heart alone can tell,
How filled our souls of death and pain
When came the last, sad word, Farewell!

HEMLOCK IN THE FURROWS.
I.
O CROWNLESS soul of Ishmael!
Uplifting and unfolding the white tent of dreams against the sunless base of eternity!
Looking up through thy dumb desolation for white hands to reach out over the shadows, downward, from the golden bastions of God's eternal Citadel!
Praying for Love to unloose the blushing bindings of his nimble shaft and take thee up to his fullest fruition!
Poor Soul! hast thou no prophecy to gauge the distance betwixt thee and thy crown?
Thy crown?
Alas! there is none.
Only a golden-rimmed shadow that went before thee, marking in its tide barren shoals and dust.
At last resting its bright length down in the valley of tears.
Foolish soul! let slip the dusty leash.
Cease listening along the borders of a wilderness for the lost echoes of life.
Drift back through the scarlet light of Memory into the darkness once more.
A corpse hath not power to feel the tying of its hands.
II.
To-night, O Soul! shut off thy little rimmings of Hope, and let us go back to our hemlock that sprang up in the furrows.
Let us go back with bleeding feet and try to break up the harvestless ridges where we starved.
Let us go down to the black sunset whose wings of fire burnt out thy flowery thickets of Day, and left a Night to swoop down the lonesome clouds to thee.
Go back to the desolate time when the dim stars looked out from Heaven, filmy and blank, like eyes in the wide front of some dead beast.
Go, press thy nakedness to the burnt, bare rocks, under whose hot, bloodless ribs the River of Death runs black with human sorrow.
To-night, O Soul! fly back through all the grave-yards of thy Past.
Fly back to them this night with thy fretful wings, even though their bloody breadth must wrestle long against Hell's hollow bosom!
III.
Jealous Soul!
The stars that are trembling forth their silent messages to the hills have none for thee!
The mother-moon that so lovingly reacheth down her arms of light heedeth not thy Love!
See, the pale pinions that thou hast pleaded for gather themselves up into rings and then slant out to the dust!
The passion-flowers lift up their loving faces and open
their velvet lips to the baptism of Love, but heed not thy warm kisses!
Shut out all this brightness that hath God's Beauty and liveth back the silence of His Rest.
Cease knocking at the starry gate of the wondrous realm of Song.
Hush away this pleading and this praying.
Go back to thy wail of fetter and chain!
Go back to thy night of loving in vain!
IV.
O weak Soul! let us follow the heavy hearse that bore our old Dream out past the white-horned Daylight of Love.
Let thy pale Dead come up from their furrows of winding-sheets to mock thy prayers with what thy days might have been.
Let the Living come back and point out the shadows they swept o'er the disk of thy morning star.
Have thou speech with them for the story of its swimming down in tremulous nakedness to the Red Sea of the Past.
Go back and grapple with thy lost Angels that stand in terrible judgment against thee.
Seek thou the bloodless skeleton once hugged to thy depths.
Hath it grown warmer under thy passionate kissings?
Or, hath it closed its seeming wings and shrunk its white body down to a glistening coil?
Didst thou wait the growth of fangs to front the arrows of Love's latest peril?
Didst thou not see a black, hungry vulture wheeling down low to the white-bellied coil where thy Heaven had once based itself?
O blind Soul of mine!
V.
Blind, blind with tears!
Not for thee shall Love climb the Heaven of thy columned Hopes to Eternity!
Under the silver shadow of the cloud waits no blushing star thy tryst.
Didst thou not see the pale, widowed West loose her warm arms and slide the cold burial earth down upon the bare face of thy sun?
Gazing upon a shoal of ashes, thou hast lost the way that struck upon the heavy, obstructive valves of the grave to thy Heaven.
Mateless thou needs must vaguely feel along the dark, cold steeps of Night.
Hath not suffering made thee wise?
When, oh when?
VI.
Go down to the black brink of Death and let its cool waters press up to thy weary feet.
See if its trembling waves will shatter the grand repeating of thy earth-star.
See if the eyes that said to thee their speechless Love so close will reach thee from this sorrowful continent of Life.
See if the red hands that seamed thy shroud will come around thy grave.
Then, O Soul! thou mayst drag them to the very edges of the Death-pit, and shake off their red shadows!
Thy strong vengeance may then bind the black-winged crew down level with their beds of fire!
VII.
But wait, wait!
Take up the ruined cup of Life that struck like a planet through the dark, and shone clear and full as we starved for the feast within.
Go down to the black offings of the Noiseless Sea, and wait, poor Soul!
Measure down the depth of thy bitterness and wait!
Bandage down with the grave-clothes the pulses of thy dying life and wait!
Wail up thy wild, desolate echoes to the pitying arms of God and wait!
Wait, wait!

HEAR, O ISRAEL!
(From the Hebrew.)
"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God."—
Jeremiah xxxii. 38.
I.
HEAR, O Israel! and plead my cause against the ungodly nation!
'Midst the terrible conflict of Love and Peace, I departed from thee, my people, and spread my tent of many colors in the land of Egypt.
In their crimson and fine linen I girded my white form.
Sapphires gleamed their purple light from out the darkness of my hair.
The silver folds of their temple foot-cloth was spread beneath my sandaled feet.
Thus I slumbered through the daylight.
Slumbered 'midst the vapor of sin,
Slumbered 'midst the battle and din,
Wakened 'midst the strangle of breath,
Wakened 'midst the struggle of death!
II.
Hear, O Israel! my people—to thy goodly tents do I return with unstained hands.
Like as the harts for the water-brooks, in thirst, do pant and bray, so pants and cries my longing soul for the house of Jacob.
My tears have unto me been meat, both in night and day:
And the crimson and fine linen moulders in the dark tents of the enemy.
With bare feet and covered head do I return to thee, O Israel!
With sackcloth have I bound the hem of my garments.
With olive leaves have I trimmed the border of my bosom.
The breaking waves did pass o'er me; yea, were mighty in their strength—
Strength of the foe's oppression.
My soul was cast out upon the waters of Sin: but it has come back to me.
My transgressions have vanished like a cloud.
The curse of Balaam hath turned to a blessing;
And the doors of Jacob turn not on their hinges against me.
Rise up, O Israel! for it is I who passed through the fiery furnace seven times, and come forth unscathed to redeem thee from slavery, O my nation! and lead thee back to God.
III.
Brothers mine, fling out your white banners over this Red Sea of wrath!
Hear ye not the Death-cry of a thousand burning, bleeding wrongs?
Against the enemy lift thy sword of fire, even thou, O Israel! whose prophet I am.
For I, of all thy race, with these tear-blinded eyes, still see the watch-fire leaping up its blood-red flame from the ramparts of our Jerusalem!
And my heart alone beats and palpitates, rises and falls with the glimmering and the gleaming of the golden beacon Flame, by whose light I shall lead thee, O my people! back to freedom!
Give me time—oh give me time to strike from your brows the shadow-crowns of Wrong!
On the anvil of my heart will I rend the chains that bind ye.
Look upon me—oh look upon me, as I turn from the world—from love, and passion, to lead thee, thou Chosen of God, back to the pastures of Right and Life!
Fear me not; for the best blood that heaves this heart now runs for thee, thou Lonely Nation!
Why wear ye not the crown of eternal royalty, that God set down upon your heads?
Back, tyrants of the red hands!
Slouch back to your ungodly tents, and hide the Cain-brand on your foreheads!
Life for life, blood for blood, is the lesson ye teach us.
We, the Children of Israel, will not creep to the kennel graves ye are scooping out with iron hands, like scourged hounds!
Israel! rouse ye from the slumber of ages, and, though Hell welters at your feet, carve a road through these tyrants!
The promised dawn-light is here; and God—O the God of our nation is calling!
Press on—press on!
IV.
Ye, who are kings, princes, priests, and prophets. Ye men of Judah and bards of Jerusalem, hearken unto my voice, and I will speak thy name, O Israel!
Fear not; for God hath at last let loose His thinkers, and their voices now tremble in the mighty depths of this old world!
Rise up from thy blood-stained pillows!
Cast down to dust the hideous, galling chains that bind thy strong hearts down to silence!
Wear ye the badge of slaves?
See ye not the watch-fire?
Look aloft, from thy wilderness of thought!
Come forth with the signs and wonders, and thy strong hands, and stretched-out arms, even as thou didst from Egypt!
Courage, courage! trampled hearts!
Look at these pale hands and frail arms, that have rent asunder the welded chains that an army of the Philistines bound about me!
But the God of all Israel set His seal of fire on my breast, and lighted up, with inspiration, the soul that pants for the Freedom of a nation!
With eager wings she fluttered above the blood-stained bayonet-points of the millions, who are trampling upon the strong throats of God's people.
Rise up, brave hearts!
The sentry cries: "All's well!" from Hope's tower!
Fling out your banners of Right!
The watch fire grows brighter!
All's well! All's well!
Courage! Courage!
The Lord of Hosts is in the field,
The God of Jacob is our shield!

WHERE THE FLOCKS SHALL BE LED.
WHERE shall I lead the flocks to-day?
Is there no Horeb for me beyond this desert?
Is there no rod with which I can divide this sea of blood to escape mine enemies?
Must I pine in bondage and drag these heavy chains through the rocky path of my unrecompensed toll?
Must I, with these pale, feeble hands, still lift the wreathed bowl for others to drink, while my lips are parched and my soul unslaked?
Must I hold the light above my head that others may find the green pastures as they march in advance, whilst I moan and stumble with my bare feet tangled and clogged with this load of chains?
Must I still supply the lamp with oil that gives no light to me?
Shall I reck not my being's wane in these long days of bondage and struggle?
Is there no time for me to pray?
Others are climbing the hill-side of glory whilst I am left to wrestle with darkness in the valley below.
Oh where shall I lead the flocks to-day?
Once the soft white flowers of love bloomed upon my bosom.
But, oh! see this iron crown hath crushed the purple blood from my temples until the roses are drowned in it and 'tis withered and weeping on my breast.
The dear hands that planted the sweet flowers should not have been the ones to clasp this heavy iron band round my aching head.
Oh why is it that those we love and cling to with the deepest adoration of our unschooled natures should be the first to whet the steel and bury it in the warm blood that passionate love had created?
Answer me, ye who are ranged mockingly around me with your unsheathed knives. Answer me.
I know that ye are waiting to strike, but answer me first.
I know that if my tearful eyes do but wander from ye one moment, your trembling cowardly hands will strike the blow that your black souls are crying out for.
But let your haggard lips speak to give me warning.
Ye wait to see if these tears will blind me.
But I shall not plead for mercy.
Weak and fainting as I am, I fear you not.
For, lo! behold!
I bare to you my white mother bosom!
See, I draw from my heart a dagger whose blade is keener than any ye can hold against me.
The hands I loved most whetted it, and struck with fatal precision ye never can, for he knew where the heart lay.
No one else can ever know.
Look how the thick blood slowly drips from the point of the blade and sinks into the sand at my feet.
The white sand rolls over and covers the stains.
Flowers will spring up even there.
One day the sands will loose their seal, and they will speak.
The first shall be last and the last shall be first.
The first is my own life and the last my child.
That one will bloom eternally.
And together we will sound the horn that shall herd the flocks and lead them up to the Father's pastures.
For I know that somewhere there grows a green bush in the crevice of a rock, and that the enemy's foot may not crush it nor his hand uproot it.
A golden gate shall be unloosed, and we shall feed upon the freshness of the mountains.
But, see, the furnace has been heated seven times.
I still stand barefoot and bondage-bound, girt around my warriors, and chained and down-trodden upon these burning sands.
And yet I will escape.
Look, the pillar of cloud is over my head.
He who saved the bush on Horeb from the flames can lead me through the Red Sea, beyond the reach of these Egyptians with their rumbling chariots, tramping steeds, clashing weapons, and thunders of war.
Above the tumult I hear the voice of Aaron.
When the sun rises the chains shall be unsealed.
The blood shall be lifted from the earth and will speak.
The task-masters shall perish.
The white flocks shall be led back to the broad plains of Hebron.
I still see the pillar of cloud.
God is in the midst of us!
PRO PATRIA.
America, 1861
GOD'S armies of Heaven, with pinions extended
Spread wide their white arms to the standard of Light;
And bending far down to the great Heart of Nature,
With kisses of Love drew us up from the Night.
Proud soul of the Bondless! whose stars fleck with crimson,
And warm dreams of gold ev'ry pillar and dome,
That strengthens and crowns the fair temples upswelling
To glitter, far-seen, in our Liberty's home—
The spirits of Heroes and Sires of the People,
Leaned down from the battlements guarding the world;
To breathe for your Destiny omens of glory
And freedom eternal, in Honor impearled.
The storm-goaded mountains, and trees that had battled
With winds sweeping angrily down through the years,
Turned red in the blood of the roses of Heaven,
'Neath fires lit by sunset on vanishing spears.
The soft Beam of Peace bronzed the rocks of stern ages,
And crept from the valley to burn on the spire;
And stooped from the glimmer of gems in the palace,
To glow in the hovel a soul-heating fire.
Each turret, and terrace, and archway of grandeur,
Its beauty up-rounded through laughs of the light;
And world-crown'd America chose for her standard
The blush of the Day and the eyes of the Night.
Then Liberty's sceptre, its last jewel finding,
Was waved by a God o'er the years to be born,
And far in the future there rusted and crumbled
The chains of the centuries, ne'er to be worn.
The wave-hosts patrolling the sullen Atlantic,
With helmets of snow, and broad silvery shields,
Ran clamoring up to the seed-sown embrasures,
And fashioned new dews for the buds of the fields:
They spread their scroll shields for the breast of Columbia,
And turned their storm-swords to the enemy's fleet;
Their glory to humble the tyrant that braved them,
Their honor to lave fair America's feet!
No hot hand of Mars scattered red bolts of thunder
From out the blest land on their message-wind's breath;
But softly the murmur of Peace wantoned o'er them,
And soothed War to sleep in the Cradle of Death,
Then hiding their snow plumes, they slept in their armor,
And as the sun shone on their crystalline mail;
Lo! Freedom beheld, from her mountains, a mirror,
And caught her own image spread under a sail!
So, blest was Columbia; the focus of Nature's
Best gifts, and the dimple where rested God's smile;
The Queen of the World in her young strength and beauty,
The pride of the skies in her freedom from guile.
Aloft on the mount of God's liberty endless,
Half-veiled by the clouds of His temple she stood,
Arrayed in the glory of Heaven, the mortal,
With vigor Immortal unchained in her blood.
A bright helm of stars on her white brow was seated,
And gold were the plumes from its clusters that fell
To light the gaunt faces of slaves in old kingdoms,
And show them the way to the hand they loved well.
No gorget of steel rested on her bare bosom,
Where glittered a necklace of gems from the skies;
And girding her waist was the red band of sunset,
With light intertwined 'neath the glance of her eyes.
The sword that had bridged in the dark time of trouble,
Her heart's grand Niagara rolling in blood;
Still sheathless she held; but it turned to a sunbeam.
And blessed what it touched, like a finger of God!
The robes of her guardian Angels swept round her,
And flashed through the leaves of the grand Tree of Life,
Till all the sweet birds in its depths woke to music,
And e'en the bruised limbs with new being were rife.
The Eagle's gray eyes, from the crag by the ocean
Undazed by the sun, saw the vision of love,
And swift on the rim of the shield of Columbia,
The bold Eagle fell from the white throne of Jove.
Columbia! My Country! My Mother! thy glory
Was born in a spirit Immortal, divine;
And when from God's lips passed the nectar of heaven,
Thy current baptismal was deified wine!
Thou born of Eternal! the hand that would harm thee
Must wither to dust, and in dust be abhorred,
For thine is the throne whose blue canopy muffles
The footfalls of angels, the steps of the Lord!
But hush! 'Twas the flap of the raven's dark pinions
That sounded in woe on the breeze as it passed;
There cometh a hum, as of distance-veiled battle,
From out the deep throat of the quivering blast;
There cometh a sound like the moan of a lost one
From out the red jaws of Hell's cavern of Death;
The Eagle's strong wing feels the talon of Discord,
And all the fair sunlight goes out with a breath!
And see how the purple-hued hills and the valleys
Are dark with bent necks and with arms all unnerved;
And black, yelling hounds bay the soul into madness—
The Huntsman of Hell drives the pack that has swerved!,
The pale steeds of Death shake the palls of their saddles,
And spread their black manes, wrought of shrouds, to the wind,
The curst sons of Discord each courser bestriding,
To guide the Arch-Demon, who lingers behind
They thunder in rage, o'er the red path of Battle,
Far up the steep mount where fair Liberty keeps
The soul of a Tyrant in parchment imprisoned;
God pity us all, if her Sentinel sleeps!
Our Father in Heaven! the shadow of fetters
Is held in the shade of the Dove's little wing;
And must it again on our smothered hearts settle?
Peace slain—and the knell of our Honor they ring!
Behold! from the night-checkered edge of the woodland
A wall of red shields crowdeth into the land,
Their rims shooting horror and bloody confusion,
Their fields spreading darkness on every hand.
A forest of morions utter grim murder—
Threats kissed by the sun from their long tongues of steel;
Lo, forests of spears hedge the heart of Columbia,
And soon their keen points her fair bosom may feel!
Her Cain-branded foes! How they crawl in the valley,
And creep o'er the hills, in their dastardly fear!
Afraid, lest their victim should suddenly waken
And blast them for e'er with a womanly tear!
Like hunters who compass the African jungle,
Where slumbers Numidia's lion by day,
They falter and pale, looking back at each other,
And some, in their falsehood, to Providence pray!
Assassins of Liberty! comes there not o'er you
A thought of the time, when the land you would blight,
Though slumbering 'mid tombs of a hundred dead nations,
Though Britain's steel bulwarks broke into the light?
And can ye forget the hot blood-rain that deluged
The Hearts of the Fathers, who left to your care
The beautiful Trust now in slumber before you,
They starved, fought, and fell to preserve from a snare?
Would ye splash, in your madness, the blood of the children,
With merciless blows, in the poor mother's face?
Turn back, ye Assassins! or wear on your foreheads
For ever the brand of a God-hated race!
Down, down to the dust with ye, cowards inhuman!
And learn, as ye grovel, for mercy to live,
That Love is the Sceptre and Throne of the Nation,
And Freedom the Crown that the centuries give!
Unrighteous Ambition has slept in our limits
Since fearless Columbia sheathed her bright blade:
And at her dread Vengeance on those who awake it,
The soul of the stoutest might well be dismayed.
Beware! for the spirit of God's Retribution
Will make a red sunrise when Liberty dies;
The Traitors shall writhe in the glow of a morning,
And drown in the blood that is filling their eyes!
The bright blade of old, when it leaps from the scabbard
Like Lightning shall fall on the traitorous head,
And hurl with each stroke, in its world-shock of thunder,
A thrice cursed soul to the deeps of the Dead!
Beware! for when once ye have made your Red Ocean,
Its waves shall rise up with tempestuous swell,
And hurl your stained souls, like impurities, from them
Up death's dark slope, to the skull beach of Hell!

KARAZAH TO KARL.
COME back to me! my life is young,
My soul is scarcely on her way,
And all the starry songs she's sung,
Are prelude to a grander lay.
Come back to me!
Let this song-born soul receive thee,
Glowing its fondest truth to prove;
Why so early did'st thou leave me,
Are our heaven-grand life of love?
Come back to me!
My burning lips shall set their seal
On our betrothal bond to-night,
While whispering murmurs will reveal
How souls can love in God's own light.
Come back to me!
Come back to me! The stars will be
Silent witnesses of our bliss,
And all the past shall seem to thee
But a sweet dream to herald this!
Come back to me!
A FRAGMENT.
"Oh! I am sick of what I am. Of all
Which I in life can ever hope to be.
Angels of light be pitiful to me."
THE cold chain of life presseth heavily on me to-night
The thundering pace of thought is curbed, and, like a fiery steed, dasheth against the gloomy walls of my prisoned soul.
Oh! how long will my poor thoughts lament their narrow faculty? When will the rein be loosed from my impatient soul?
Ah! then I will climb the blue clouds and dash down to dust those jeweled stars, whose silent light wafts a mocking laugh to the poor musician who sitteth before the muffled organ of my great hopes. With a hand of fire he toucheth the golden keys. All breathless and rapt I list for an answer to his sweet meaning, but the glittering keys give back only a faint hollow sound—the echo of a sigh!
Cruel stars to mock me with your laughing light!
Oh! see ye not the purple life-blood ebbing from my side?
But ye heed it not—and I scorn ye all.
Foolish stars! Ye forget that this strong soul will one day be loosed.
I will have ye in my power yet, I'll meet ye on the grand door of old eternity.
Ah! then ye will not laugh, but shrink before me like very beggars of light that ye are, and I will grasp from your gleaming brows the jeweled crown, rend away your glistening garments, and hold ye up blackened skeletons for the laugh and scorn of all angels, and then drive ye out to fill this horrid space of darkness that I now grovel in.
But, alas! I am weary, sick, and faint.
The chains do bind the shrinking flesh too close.
"Angels of light, be pitiful to me."
Oh! this life, after all, is but a promise—a poor promise, that is too heavy to bear—heavy with blood, reeking human blood. The atmosphere is laden with it When I shut my eyes it presses so close to their lids that I must gasp and struggle to open them.
I know that the sins of untrue hearts are clogging up the air-passages of the world. and that we, who love and suffer, will soon be smothered, and in this terrible darkness too.
For me—my poor lone, deserted body—I care not. I am not in favor of men's eyes.
"Nor am I skilled immortal stuff to weave.
No rose of honor wear I on my sleeve."
But the soft silver hand of death will unbind the galling
bands that clasp the fretting soul in her narrow prison-house, and she may then escape the iron hands that would crush the delicate fibres to dust.
O soul, where are thy wings? Have they with their rude hands torn them from thy mutilated form? We must creep slowly and silently away through the midnight darkness. But we are strong yet, and can battle with the fiends who seek to drive us back to the river of blood.
But, alas! it is so late, and I am alone—alone listening to the gasps and sighs of a weary soul beating her broken wing against the darkened walls of her lonely cell.
"My labor is a vain and empty strife,
A useless tugging at the wheels of life."
Shall I still live—filling no heart, working no good, and the cries of my holy down-trodden race haunting me? Beseeching me—me, with these frail arms and this poor chained soul, to lift them back to their birthright of glory.
"Angels of light, be pitiful to me."
I have wearied Heaven with my tears and prayers till I have grown pale and old, but a shadow of my former self, and all for power, blessed power! Not for myself—but for those dearer and worthier than I—those from out whose hearts my memory has died for ever.
But, alas! it is vain.
Prayers and tears will not bring back sweet hope and love.
I may still sigh and weep for these soft winged nestling
angels of my lost dreams till I am free to seek them in the grand homes where I have housed them with the golden-haired son of the sky.
It is midnight, and the world is still battling—the weak are falling, the strong and the wrong are exulting.
And I, like the dying stag, am hunted down to the ocean border, still asking for peace and rest of the great gleaming eyes that pierce the atmosphere of blood and haunt me with their pleading looks. Whispers are there—low, wailing whispers from white-browed children as though I could bear their chained souls o'er Charon's mystic river of their purple blood.
Alas! star after star has gone down till not one is in sight. How dark and cold it is growing!
Oh, light! why have you fled to a fairer land and left
"An unrigged hulk, to rot upon life's ford—
The crew of mutinous senses overboard?"
It is too late. I faint with fear of these atom-fiends that do cling to my garments in this darkness.
Oh! rest for thee, my weary soul,
The coil is round thee all too fast.
Too close to earth thy pinions clasp:
A trance-like death hath o'er thee past.
Oh, soul! oh, broken soul, arise,
And plume thee for a prouder flight.
In vain, in vain—'tis sinking now
And dying in eternal night.
"Suffer and be still."
Death will bind up thy powerful wings, and to the organ music of my great hopes thou shalt beat sublimer airs.
Wait until eternity.

THE AUTOGRAPH ON THE SOUL.
IN the Beginning, God, the great Schoolmaster, wrote upon the white leaves of our souls the text of life, in His own autograph.
Upon all souls it has been written alike.
We set forth with the broad, fair characters penned in smoothness and beauty, and promise to bear them back so, to the Master, who will endorse them with eternal life.
But, alas! how few of us can return with these copybooks unstained and unblotted?
Man—the school-boy Man—takes a jagged pen and dips it in blood, and scrawls line after line of his hopeless, shaky, weak-backed, spattering imitation of the unattainable flourish and vigor of the autograph at the top of our souls.
And thus they go on, in unweary reiteration, until the fair leaves are covered with unseemly blots, and the Schoolmaster's copy is no longer visible.
No wonder, then, that we shrink and hide, and play truant as long as we possibly can, before handing in to the Master our copy-books for examination.
How soiled with the dust of men, and stained with the blood of the innocent, some of these books are!
Surely, some will look fairer than others.
Those of the lowly and despised of men;
The wronged and the persecuted;
The loving and the deserted;
The suffering and the despairing;
The weak and the struggling;
The desolate and the oppressed;
The authors of good books;
The defenders of women;
The mothers of new-born children;
The loving wives of cruel husbands;
The strong throats that are choked with their own blood, and cannot cry out the oppressor's wrong.
On the souls of these of God's children of inspiration, His autograph will be handed up to the judgment-seat, on the Day of Examination, pure and unsoiled.
The leaf may be torn, and traces of tears, that fell as prayers went up, may dim the holy copy, but its fair, sharp, and delicate outlines will only gleam the stronger, and prove the lesson of life, that poor, down-trodden humanity has been studying for ages and ages—the eternal triumph of mind over matter!
What grand poems these starving souls will be, after they are signed and sealed by the Master-hand!
But what of the oppressor?
What of the betrayer?
What of him that holds a deadly cup, that the pure of heart may drink?
What of fallen women, who are covered with paint and sin, and flaunt in gaudy satins, never heeding the black stains within their own breasts?—lost to honor, lost to themselves; glittering in jewels and gold; mingling with
sinful men, who, with sneering looks and scoffing laughs, drink wine beneath the gas-light's glare.
Wrecks of womanly honor!
Wrecks of womanly souls!
Wrecks of life and love!
Blots that deface the fair earth with crime and sin!
Fallen—fallen so low that the cries and groans of the damned must sometimes startle their death-signed hearts, as they flaunt through the world, with God's curse upon them!
What of the money-makers, with their scorching days and icy nights?
Their hollow words and ghastly smiles?
Their trifling deceits?
Their shameless lives?
Their starving menials?
Their iron hands, that grasp the throats of weary, white-baited men?
Will their coffins be black?
They should be red—stained with the blood of their victims!
Their shrouds should be [ make ] with pockets; and all their gold should be placed therein, to drag them deeper down than the sexton dug the grave!
How will it be with him who deceives and betrays women?
Answer me this, ye men who have brought woe and desolation to the heart of woman; and, by your fond lips, breathing sighs, and vows of truth and constancy—your deceit and desertion, destroyed her, body and soul!
There are more roads to the heart than by cold steel.
You drew her life and soul after you by your pretended love. Perhaps she sacrificed her home, her father and her mother—her God and her religion for you!
Perhaps for you she has endured pain and penury!
Perhaps she is the mother of your child, living and praying for you!
And how do you repay this devotion?
By entering the Eden of her soul, and leaving the trail of the serpent, that can never be erased from its flowers; for the best you trample beneath your feet, while the fairest you pluck as a toy to while away an idle hour, then dash aside for another of a fairer cast.
Then, if she plead with her tears, and her pure hands, to Heaven, that you come back to your lost honor, and to her heart, you do not hesitate to tear that suffering heart with a shameless word, that cuts like a jagged knife, and add your curse to crush her light of life!
Have ye seen the blood-stained steel, dimmed with the heart's warm blood of the suicide?
Have ye seen the pallid lips, the staring eyes, the unclosed, red-roofed mouth—the bubbling gore, welling up from a woman's breast?
Have ye seen her dying in shivering dread, with the blood dabbled o'er her bosom?
Have ye heard her choked voice rise in prayer—her pale lips breathing his name—the name of him who deceived her? Yes! a prayer coming up with the bubbling blood—a blessing on him for whom she died!
Why did she not pray for her despairing self?
O God! have mercy on the souls of men who are false to their earthly love and trust!
But the interest will come round—all will come round!
Nothing will escape the Schoolmaster's sleepless eye!
The indirect is always as great and real as the direct.
Not one word or deed—
Not one look or thought—
Not a motive but will be stamped on the programme of our lives, and duly realized by us, and returned and held up to light heaven or flood hell with.
All the best actions of war or peace—
All the help given to strangers—
Cheering words to the despairing—
Open hands to the shunned—
Lifting of lowly hearts—
Teaching children of God—
Helping the widow and the fatherless—
Giving light to some desolate home—
Reading the Bible to the blind—
Protecting the defenceless—
Praying with the dying.
These are acts that need no Poet to make poems of them; for they will live through ages and ages, on to Eternity. And when God opens the sealed book on the Day of Judgment, these poems of the history of lives will be traced in letters of purple and gold, beneath the Master's Autograph.
ADELINA PATTI.
THOU Pleiad of the lyric world
Where Pasta, Garcia shone,
Come back with thy sweet voice again,
And gem the starry zone.
Though faded, still the vision sees
The loveliest child of night,
The fairest of the Pleiades,
Its glory and its light.
How fell with music from thy tongue
The picture which it drew
Of Lucia, radiant, warm, and young—
Amina, fond and true.
Or the young Marie's grace and art,
So free from earthly strife,
Beating upon the sounding heart,
The gay tattoo of life!
Fair Florence! home of glorious Art,
And mistress of its sphere,
Clasp fast thy beauties to thy heart—
Behold thy rival here!
DYING.
I.
LEAVE me; oh! leave me,
Lest I find this low earth sweeter than the skies.
Leave me lest I deem Faith's white bosom bared to the betraying arms of Death.
Hush your fond voice, lest it shut out the angel trumpet-call!
See my o'erwearied feet bleed for rest.
Loose the clinging and the clasping of my clammy fingers.
Your soft hand of Love may press back the dark, awful shadows of Death, but the soul faints in the strife and struggles of nights that have no days.
I am so weary with this climbing up the smooth steep sides of the grave wall.
My dimmed eyes can no longer strain up through the darkness to the temples and palaces that you have built for me upon Life's summit.
God is folding up the white tent of my youth.
My name is enrolled for the pallid army of the dead.
II
It is too late, too late!
You may not kiss back my breath to the sunshine.
How can these trembling hands of dust reach up to bend the untempered iron of Destiny down to my woman-forehead?
Where is the wedge to split its knotty way between the Past and the Future?
The soaring bird that would sing its life out to the stars, may not leave its own atmosphere;
For, in the long dead reaches of blank space in the Beyond, its free wings fall back to earth baffled.
Once gathering all my sorrows up to one purpose—rebel-like—I dared step out into Light, when, lo! Death tied my unwilling feet, and with hands of ice, bandaged my burning lips, and set up, between my eyes and the Future, the great Infinite of Eternity, full in the blazing sun of my Hope!
From the red round life of Love I have gone down to the naked house of Fear.
Drowned in a storm of tears.
My wild wings of thought drenched from beauty to the color of the ground.
Going out at the hueless gates of day.
Dying, dying.
III.
Oh! is there no strength in sorrow, or in prayers?
Is there no power in the untried wings of the soul, to smite the brazen portals of the sun?
Must the black-sandaled foot of Night tramp out the one star that throbs through the darkness of my waning life?
May not the strong arm of "I will," bring some beam to lead me into my sweet Hope again?
Alas, too late! too late!
The power of these blood-dripping cerements sweeps back the audacious thought to emptiness.
Hungry Death will not heed the poor bird that has tangled its bright wing through my deep-heart pulses.
Moaning and living.
Dying and loving.
IV.
See the poor wounded snake; how burdened to the ground;
How it lengthens limberly along the dust.
Now palpitates into bright rings only to unwind, and reach its bleeding head up the steep high walls around us.
Now, alas! falling heavily back into itself, quivering with unuttered pain;
Choking with its own blood it dies in the dust.
So we are crippled ever;
Reaching and falling,
Silent and dying.
V.
Gold and gleaming jewel shatter off their glory well in the robes of royalty, but when we strain against the whelming waves, the water gurgling down our drowning throats, we shred them off, and hug the wet, cold rocks lovingly.
Then old death goes moaning back from the steady footing of Life baffled.
Ah! is it too late for me to be wise.
Will my feeble hands fail me in the moveless steppings back to the world?
Oh! if youth were only back!
Oh! if the years would only empty back their ruined days into the lap of the Present!
Oh! if yesterday would only unravel the light it wove into the purple of the Past!
Ah! then might I be vigilant!
Then might the battle be mine!
Nor should my sluggish blood drip down the rocks till the noon-tide sun should draw it up mistily in smoke.
Then should the heaviness of soul have dropped as trees do their weight of rainy leaves.
Nor should the sweet leash of Love have slipped from my hungry life, and left me pining, dying for his strength.
I should have wrapt up my breathing in the naked bosom of Nature, and she would have kissed me back to sweetest comfort, and I would have drawn up from her heart draughts of crusted nectar and promises of eternal joys.
Oh! it is not the glittering garniture of God's things that come quivering into the senses, that makes our lives look white through the windings of the wilderness.
It is the soul's outflow of purple light that clashes up a music with the golden blood of strong hearts.
Souls with God's breath upon them,
Hearts with Love's light upon them.
VI.
If my weak puny hand could reach up and rend the sun
from his throne to-day, then were the same but a little thing for me to do.
It is the Far Off, the great Unattainable, that feeds the passion we feel for a star.
Looking up so high, worshipping so silently, we tramp out the hearts of flowers that lift their bright heads for us and die alone.
If only the black, steep grave gaped between us, I feel that I could over-sweep all its gulfs.
I believe that Love may unfold its white wings even in the red bosom of Hell.
I know that its truth can measure the distance to Heaven with one thought.
Then be content to let me go, for these pale hands shall reach up from the grave, and still draw the living waters of Love's well.
That is better, surer than climbing with bruised feet and bleeding hands to plead with the world for what is mine own.
Then straighten out the crumpled length of my hair, and loose all the flowers one by one.
God is not unjust.
VII.
Oh! in the great strength of thy unhooded soul, pray for my weakness.
Let me go! See the pale and solemn army of the night is on the march.
Do not let my shivering soul go wailing up for a human love to the throne of the Eternal.
Have we not watched the large setting sun drive a
column of light through the horizon down into the darkness?
So within the grave's night, O my beloved! shall my love burn on to eternity.
O Death! Death! loose out thy cold, stiff fingers from my quivering heart!
Let the warm blood rush back to gasp up but one more word!
O Love! thou art stronger, mightier than all!
O Death! thou hast but wedded me to Life!
Life is Love, and Love is Eternity.
[missing figure]
SAVED.
I.
O SOLDIERS, soldiers, get ye back, I pray!
Hush out of sound your trampings so near his lowly head!
Hush back the echoes of your footfalls to the muffling distance!
O soldiers, wake not my sleeping love!
Get ye back, I pray!
To-morrow will he wake, and lead ye on as bravely as before.
To-morrow will he lift the blazing sword above a crimson flood of victory.
Get ye back and wait
He is weary, and would sleep.
II.
Soft, soft, he sleepeth well.
Why stand ye all so stern and sad?
So garmented in the dust and blood of battle?
Why linger on the field to-day? See how the dark locks hang in bloody tangles about your glaring eyes!
Get ye to your silent tents, I pray!
See ye not your soldier-chief sleeps safe and well?
What say ye?
"Dead!"
O blind, blind soldiers! Should I not know?
Have I not watched him all the long, long battle?
On this cold and sunless plain my tottering feet struck the pathway to my soldier.
My loving arms have clasped him from the black, hungry jaws of Death.
With the neglected sunshine of my hair I shielded his pale face from the cannon-glare.
On my breast, as on a wave of heaven-light, have I lulled him to the soft beauty of dreams.
He has been yours to-day; he is mine now.
He has fought bravely, and would sleep.
I know, I know.
III.
O soldiers, soldiers, take him not hence!
Do not press tears back into your pitiful eyes, and say: "His soul hath found its rest."
Why lean ye on your blood-stained spears, and point to that dark wound upon his throat?
I can kiss its pain and terror out.
Leave him, I pray ye!
He will wake to-morrow, and cheer ye in your tents at dawn.
And ye shall see him smile on her who soothes his weary head to sleep through this long night.
It was I who found him at the battle's dreadful close.
Weary and wounded, he sank to rest upon the field.
Murmuring out his tender voice, he called my name, and whispered of our love, and its sweet eternity.
'Mid brooding love and clinging kisses, his tender eyes let down their silken barriers to the day.
Their pale roofs close out the defeat, and in my arms he finds the joy of glorious victory.
IV.
O soldiers, leave him to me!
The morning, bridegroomed by the sun, cannot look down to the midnight for comfort.
In the thick front of battle I claimed what is mine own.
I saw the Grim Foe open wide his red-leafed book, but he wrote not therein the name of my brave love.
Life hath no chance that he cannot combat with a single hand.
Now he wearies from the struggling grace of a brave surrendering.
He sleeps, he sleeps.
V.
Go, soldiers, go!
I pray ye wake him not.
I have kissed his pale, cold mouth, and staunched the crimson wound upon his throat.
The mournful moon has seen my silent watch above his lonely bed.
Her pitying eyes reproached me not.
How durst yours?
Go, soldiers, go!
VI.
I charge ye by the love ye bear your sleeping chieftain, wake him not!
To-morrow he will wake, eager to wheel into battle-line.
To-morrow he will rise, and mount the steed he loveth well, and lead ye cheerily on to the attack!
To-morrow his voice will ring its Hope along your tramping troops!
But oh! wait, wait!
He is weary, and must sleep!
Go, soldiers, go!
[missing figure]
ANSWER ME.
I.
IN from the night.
The storm is lifting his black arms up to the sky.
Friend of my heart, who so gently marks out the life-track for me, draw near to-night;
Forget the wailing of the low-voiced wind:
Shut out the moanings of the freezing, and the starving, and the dying, and bend your head low to me:
Clasp my cold, cold hands in yours;
Think of me tenderly and lovingly:
Look down into my eyes the while I question you, and if you love me, answer me—
Oh, answer me!
II.
Is there not a gleam of Peace on all this tiresome earth?
Does not one oasis cheer all this desert-world?
When will all this toil and pain bring me the blessing?
Must I ever plead for help to do the work before me set?
Must I ever stumble and faint by the dark wayside?
Oh the dark, lonely wayside, with its dim-sheeted ghosts peering up through their shallow graves!
Must I ever tremble and pale at the great Beyond?
Must I find Rest only in your bosom, as now I do?
Answer me—
Oh, answer me!
III.
Speak to me tenderly.
Think of me lovingly.
Let your soft hands smooth back my hair.
Take my cold, tear-stained face up to yours.
Let my lonely life creep into your warm bosom, knowing no other rest but this.
Let me question you, while sweet Faith and Trust are folding their white robes around me.
Thus am I purified, even to your love, that came like John the Baptist in the Wilderness of Sin.
You read the starry heavens, and lead me forth.
But tell me if, in this world's Judea, there comes never quiet when once the heart awakes?
Why must it ever hush Love back?
Must it only labor, strive, and ache?
Has it no reward but this?
Has it no inheritance but to bear—and break?
Answer me—
Oh, answer me!
IV.
The Storm struggles with the Darkness.
Folded away in your arms, how little do I heed their battle!
The trees clash in vain their naked swords against the door.
I go not forth while the low murmur of your voice is drifting all else back to silence.
The darkness presses his black forehead close to the window pane, and beckons me without.
Love holds a lamp in this little room that hath power to blot back Fear.
But will the lamp ever starve for oil?
Will its blood-red flame ever grow faint and blue?
Will it uprear itself to a slender line of light?
Will it grow pallid and motionless?
Will it sink rayless to everlasting death?
Answer me—
Oh, answer me!
V.
Look at these tear-drops.
See how they quiver and die on your open hands.
Fold these white garments close to my breast, while I question you.
Would you have me think that from the warm shelter of your heart I must go to the grave?
And when I am lying in my silent shroud, will you love me?
When I am buried down in the cold, wet earth, will you grieve that you did not save me?
Will your tears reach my pale face through all the withered leaves that will heap themselves upon my grave?
Will you repent that you loosened your arms to let me fall so deep, and so far out of sight?
Will you come and tell me so, when the coffin has shut out the storm?
Answer me—
Oh, answer me!

INFELIX.
WHERE is the promise of my years;
Once written on my brow?
Ere errors, agonies and fears
Brought with them all that speaks in tears,
Ere I had sunk beneath my peers;
Where sleeps that promise now?
Naught lingers to redeem those hours,
Still, still to memory sweet!
The flowers that bloomed in sunny bowers
Are withered all; and Evil towers
Supreme above her sister powers
Of Sorrow and Deceit.
I look along the columned years,
And see Life's riven fane,
Just where it fell, amid the jeers
Of scornful lips, whose mocking sneers,
For ever hiss within mine ears
To break the sleep of pain.
I can but own my life is vain
A desert void of peace;
I missed the goal I sought to gain,
I missed the measure of the strain
That lulls Fame's fever in the brain,
And bids Earth's tumult cease.
Myself! alas for theme so poor
A theme but rich in Fear;
I stand a wreck on Error's shore,
A spectre not within the door,
A houseless shadow evermore,
An exile lingering here.

PREFACE.
I was born in the Green River Country, Hart County, Kentucky, May 30th, 1851. I was a slave until the Emancipation. My parents left me and went to the Good Land when I was yet a boy. My chances for an education have not been good. In that matter, however, I have done what I could. I have labored with my hands, taught school, and preached a RISEN, present Savior—not a bad lot after all. I am now an Elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the stationed pastor at Springfield, Ohio, and General Financial Agent of Wilberforce University. With this brief account of myself, I pass to notice the Institution in whose interest I have written, and whose permanent endowment I hope to secure.
Wilberforce University is situated three and one-half miles North-East of Xenia, Greene County, Ohio; surrounded by beautiful farms, and from the West, looked down upon by a group of heavily wooded hills. It is one of the most desirable College sites in Ohio. The locality is eminently healthy. A considerable creek, winding around the grounds to the Southward, drains the neighboring fields, and gives the whole surrounding an admirably neat aspect. A number of fine springs break out in the deep ravines around the College, bubbling and laughing, with lucid health sparkling in their faces. The campus is laid out on a beautiful plateau, lying South-East of the University, and covered by a splendid grove with here and there a neat cottage among the trees.
THE BUILDING.
The University Building is of substantial brick and slate roofed. The rooms are large and airy. The accommodations good. Probable value of buildings and grounds, (52 acres), sixty-five thousand dollars [$65,000.00]. No incumbrances.
MISSION.
The school, though under the auspices of the A. M. E. Church, is STRICTLY NON-SECTARIAN in its pretensions, and has, as its general mission, the imparting of CHRISTIAN EDUCATION to the colored race. The special mission of the Normal and Scientific Departments is the preparation of Christian Teachers for Southern fields of labor. The Theological Department has, as its special work, the training of efficient preachers, to carry an enlightened Gospel among the freedmen.
The great and good founder of the institution, Bishop D. A. Payne, D. D., has lived to see much of the fruits of his labor in the last-named department. Bishop Payne came to the Presidency of the University when in its trembling infancy, and for fifteen years holding up the motto, "LIKE PRIEST, LIKE PEOPLE," he cried in the ears of the churches: "Give us educated preachers for the freedmen," until many big hearted and good young men rose up and followed him. His successor, the Rev. Benjamin F. Lee, B. D., one of his students, shows that he lacks nothing of his master's spirit, efficient in training, strong in intellect, replete in goodness and supported by a Faculty who share his rare qualities; he goes right to work with a VIM that means inspiration.
THE OBJECT OF THIS PUBLICATION.
My object in placing these verses before an intelligent people is, First, to carry to their minds the purpose of the founders of Wilberforce. That purpose, as stated in the last Catalogue of the Institution, is "An aim to inspire and increase in the pupil self-respect, self-control and self-development."
Now may I not hope that, however imperfect or faulty these lines may be, they will, in some measure, show "self-development." And this is the very thing most needed among the poor colored young men of our country; and hence, an EMPHASIS of the claims of Wilberforce upon those who are interested in the welfare of the freedman. Very few of the colored students of our land, there are, who can depend upon their parents for efficient aid in going to school. Too many, alas, like the author, have NO parents, NO aid. How wise then the encouragement of an educational system of "self-development." With the motto, "ECONOMY, THRIFT, MANHOOD," the humble, poor young man, finds his way out of obscurity into usefulness.
The founders of Wilberforce, knowing best the needs of the classes among which she was destined to operate, knew best how to supply them; and in this arrangement they have been happy. The poor young man, without preparatory training, coming to Wilberforce, soon learns to study out problems for himself, and hence, to THINK for himself. He learns that if he cannot excel, he CAN do something else—he can do WHAT he can—he can try—he can dare to fail. He soon learns the difference between a successful DO-NOTHING, and an honorable failure. If such a young man leaves Wilberforce between terms, to gather means for his support, MARK YOU, he will return, and not only that, he will bring up his studies with him.
The production of NOT A MAN, AND YET A MAN, whatever it is, is owing to that spirit of "self-development" which Wilberforce inspires.
Secondly, my object in publishing is, to introduce myself to the people. Those who read will feel acquainted with me. Some may think well of me, and even INVITE me to talk with them about our Wilberforce. There is nothing like being kindly thought of by a people before you go among them. Certainly none will despise the effort.
And now, dear public, NOT A MAN, AND YET A MAN, comes to your doors, let him in! As to his merits, let readers judge.
Our canvassers get ONLY such part of the sales as will help them honestly to live. Purchase, therefore, remembering that your mite goes to the aid of a noble cause, and, if any one, after having read, feel to give of his earthly goods more largely, let him send such donations to the author at Springfield, Ohio.
Letters of comment on the merits of this work, and also of encouragement for Wilberforce, are SINCERELY solicited of the reader, by
THE AUTHOR.
PROLOGUE.
The shepherd-king of Judah's olden days,
Waked his sweet harp to sing Jehovah's praise,
Then this his theme was in his happy hour:
"Captivity hath lost her horn of power.
The mighty Arm hath broke oppression's staff,
And drives the spoiler's hosts, as wind drives chaff,
And moves his kingdoms as the thistle down,
By wanton whirlwinds here and there is blown!"
How panting thousands of his faithful tribe,
Drank this sweet strain, no mortal can describe.
Young freedom then first raised his voice sublime,
And spoke his triumphs in the ear of Time.
The soldier sang it on his tented hill,
The maiden at her toilsome slow hand-mill;
The shepherd piped it where he sauntered 'mong
His bleating folds, and desert paths along;
And morn and eventide, the Temple's choir
Poured forth the strain, by matron joined and sire.
The wilderness and solitary waste,
With gladsome music woke, and joyous haste;
Engedi's palmy hills their voices gave,
And echo answered from the prophet's cave;—
"Ye seed of Jacob sound the jubilee,
The Lord hath triumphed and His hosts are free.
Spread thro' the heathen's land the joyous news,
The Mighty God's the refuge of the Jews!
Our shield and strength, our everlasting Sun,
And who shall gainsay what His hand hath done?"
Their sister nations heard the swelling strain,
And ages answered ages back again,
Till yet along the march of centuries
The idea of God and Freedom flies.
Sweet strain! How rapture in it yet is heard
Wherever righteousness her horn hath reared!
Remoteness lends a sweetness to the sound
By changes undisturbed, by lore not bound.
It lives while empires sink and pass away,
Wisdoms go out, and languages decay.
High o'er the heights of tall ambitions gaze,
Beyond proud emulation's wildest maze,
And Freedom there hath set her glorious stars,
Eternal more than Jupiter or Mars.
Her Washington rides first upon our sky,
Lending his brilliance to the thousands nigh.
Next Lincoln, whom a grateful nation mourns,
Shoots blazing from the age which he adorns.
Sinks on the eve of dreadful war's alarms,
But sinks with a saved nation in his arms!
And Old John Brown of Harper's Ferry fame,
Peace to his shade, and honor to his name,
The negro's light of hope, the friend of right,
Looms on life's deep, a melancholy light;
The comet of his age, ominous, lone,
And saddest that on earth has ever shone.
But peerless champion of Equal Rights,
Great Sumner STANDS, like those majestic hights
That guard New England shores from Ocean's shocks,
With lifted arms of everlasting rocks;
And with the strength of ages in their locks.
'Twas he who, on his bosom, bore a race,
And met their proud oppressor face to face;
Rose like some Ajax, in his ponderous strength,
And drove his lance, with all its trenchant length,
Full on the brazen disk of slav'ry's shield,
Until the monster wrong, beneath it reeled.
And when the smoke of war had cleared away,
And in the nation's sky there broke new day;
'Twas he, who, mailed in all the might of lore,
The valiant friends of mankind went before,
To wipe the blots of caste from freedom's code,
And all its axioms of wrong explode;
Lift equal justice up, exalt her laws,
And in her temple plead the black man's cause.
Let love lorn bards illuminate their lays,
With moonlight soft, and sing some Juno's praise;
Or whine with cadence sweet, and sickly sweet,
Their few torn hopes at some Diana's feet;
Let school-house heroes rave around the walls,
Where patriotism rises, treason falls,
Sing loud heroics of a glorious strand,
A freedom's eagle, and a white man's land;
Let fools pass by and wag their empty heads,
Deride the sons of Slavery's humble sheds,
And statesmen prate of law and precedence,
My pen appeals to right and common sense.
The black man has a cause, deny who dares,
And him to vindicate my muse prepares.
A part of this great nation's hist'ry, he
Has made in valor and fidelity.
His sweat has poured to swell our ample stores,
His blood run freely to defend our shores;
And prayers ascended to the Lord of all,
To save the nation from a direful fall.
Who has not felt in childhood's heart the thrill
Of bloody Georgetown and of Bunker's Hill?
Who has not heard the drums of freedom swell,
When Putnam triumphed and when Warren fell?
Proud were our sires, Ticonderoga's boast,
Fearless defenders of Atlantic's coast.
When from fair freedom's terraced hights, we turn
A backward gaze, our grateful bosoms burn,
To see those heroes with red battle clenched,
Till in brave blood their humble fields are drenched.
With Valley Forge's snowy locks to see
The desp'rate fingers of young liberty,
Grappling, and see his valiant misery;
And then o'er Delaware's rough wint'ry stream,
To see a thousand loyal muskets gleam
In night's cold face; and hear the strong brave oars
That meet the hurrying ice between the shores!
And can we then forget that patriots, black,
Marched with white brothers to the dread attack?
And when in these late years, the war fiend came,
On tempest horsed, and waved a sword of flame,
When giant treason shook his locks of gore,
And from the East to West the Union tore;
When our free institutions shook and reeled,
Hope turned her eyes towards the battle-field;
And loyal hearts that ne'er before had quaked,
Then quaked, and all their hoarded riches staked.
A nation's hands were then imploring raised,
While freedom's arch with bolts of ruin blazed.
Where then the prowess of a century,
The loud boast of white-handed chivalry?
Where, when in triumph wild, the Southern hordes
Unbent their strength, and drew their fearless swords?
Ah! well, we prayed, and God in his own time,
His sable answer sent on Dixie's clime.
The strong armed negro threw off slavery's yoke,
And loud as thunder on the world's ear broke
His shouts of ONWARD! To the front he went,
And in the smoke and din of battle blent,
With brothers white, where color nothing meant.
And there, till our victorious banner swept
Once more the hights of freedom, and we wept
For joy, he stood beneath our starlit dome,
Until a grateful UNION called him home.
Now let the nation fling him from her arms,
Forget the part he bore, when war's alarms
Were rumbling hoarsely in her troubled ear,
And direful overthrow was plainly near;
Forget the hands that caught her falling stars,
And tore loud triumph from the flaunting bars
Of treason; yea, despise the sable race,
And music then will breathe the name with praise!
NOT A MAN, AND YET A MAN.
THE MOVERS.
'Twas in the long ago,
'Twas in the age of woods
Of Young America,
That moving, rattling, slow
Towards the Western plain,
A single settler's train,
Drawn on by oxen teams,
Was seen, as when in dreams,
Strange sights and solitudes,
Upon our vision play.
The tall forests swim in a crimson sea,
Out of whose bright depths rising silently,
Great golden spires shoot into the skies,
Among the isles of cloud-land high, that rise,
Float, scatter, burst, drift off, and slowly fade,
Deep in the twilight, shade succeeding shade.
And by yon leaning rocks beneath the hill
Whose sloping base, a peaceful streamlet laves,
With fitful joyance bubbling in its waves,
The train guard pausing, winds his signal shrill.
Long roll the echoes, and the patient train,
In order halt along the silent plain.
From under wagon covers eight or nine,
Two anxious rows of female faces shine,
And whispers buzz from lips to lips around:
"That's Rodney's horn!" "Is this the camping ground?"
Loud low the oxen, leaning in their gear,
Replying heifers low along the rear;
And ere the seated driver drops his threads,
Come leaping on and toss their hornless heads.
Mark how enjoyment this wild scene pervades,
How ruddy maidens vie with ruddy maids;
These gathering fagots from yon lofty wood;
They ranging vessels and preparing food;
While seated round, their lordly umpires rest
On upturned stones, and view them doubly blest,
Such were the scenes the early travelers met,
When they towards the West their faces set.
Then, movers all their earthly ware would load,
And drive a whole great farm of stock upon the road.
Moving was moving then. The house cat e'en,
High in her sleepy reign was onward seen,
Riding, among utensils old and rare,
And roost and all, the ancient cock was there;
And thro' the silent forest blew his horn,
By day occasional, but always night and morn.
SAVILLE.
Fair Saville! earliest village of the wood,
To break the reign of ancient solitude,
Where erst the dusky tennants of the shade,
Along the Mississippi's waters strayed;
Thou once did flourish on the lap of fame,
When to thy rude abodes adventure's wand'ring footsteps came.
I turn with reverential step and slow,
To trace the scenes my recollections know.
Where now thy cliffs bleak winter's wiles oppose,
When through the screeching air his blasts he throws,
There warring totems once prolonged their stay,
And then e'en with reluctance went their way.
And where yon blossomed fields, and orchards green,
Fresh meadows, and contented flocks are seen,
There erst the Indian reared his wigwam rude,
Deep in the wide forest's pathless solitude.
Dear to me yet, and every day more dear,
Familiar sounds revive upon my ear;
Familiar scenes come to me o'er the past,
And I, recoiling from the Future vast,
Revisit in my dreams and solitude,
The pleasant places of thy borders rude.
Thus, when from tempest-brooding heav'ns I fly;
When life's meridian's in a pensive sky,
Back to the charms of other days I come,
And seem a traveler returning home.
Then cumbrous backwoods life wide o'er the vale,
Heard a responsive tongue in every gale.
Loud baying hounds pressed hard the fleety deer,
Replying horns pursued along the rear,
Wild song attuned the breezy throat of morn;
The plowman whistled to his growing corn,
And lads with hoes, garrulous as they went,
Close on his heels their nimble footsteps bent.
And there was heard from morn till evening late
The various accents of a happy state,
The waste echoing to the axe remote,
The anvil groaning as the blacksmith smote,
The plashy labors of the slumb'rous mill,
The brook reposing as the wheel stood still;
Loud shouts arising childhood's sports among,
And matrons scolding as their flax wheels sung.
And often gathered when the joyous Spring,
Had livened Winter's latest lingering,
When all the voiceless wastes of recent gloom
Awoke to song and warbled into bloom;
Beneath the spreading shades that arch yon green
In happy groups the village train were seen.
Near where yon footpath climbs behind the town,
And straggles off into a hazel down,
Their wonted sports through shining hours would stray,
Till time unnoticed brought the close of day;
And silent wheeling, scarce above the fence,
The crooked bat did aimless flights commence;
Slow-toned the cow-bell, and sad whippoorwill
Mourned in her darkling copse behind the hill.
Then when the tasks of ev'ning all were done,
Around the blazing hearth new sports begun;
When corn was pestled for the next day's meals,
The bands were slackened on their cumb'rous wheels,
The woodsman from his labor had come home
And plowmen from their furrows wearysome;
Loud glee pursued the "blind man" round and round,
Till roaring laughter tripped him to the ground.
The "old gray witch," slow-motioned, then would stare,
While the gay rompers felt a secret scare,—
Went crouching from her, dodged from wall to wall,
Or in the corners scrambling, tumbled all.
Thus poured the murmuring tide of childish mirth,
While sober converse leaned around the hearth,
And weighty matters in each earnest breast,
Beguiling time, prolonged the way to rest.
Oh happy times of man's innocency!
When earth was as like Heaven as could be,
When simple relish made each sport more dear,
Delayed the seasons and prolonged the year.
Within yon rude-built pile with gables gray,
With which the wanton blasts of Winter play,
When all disconsolate they moan and fret,
The simple council of the village met.
Where mutual interests called them to consult
Life's surest course, and probable result.
Hark! yon small rusty bell shakes from its throat
A few slow sounds, the assembling hour to note.
No paid men patriotic speeches make,
No brazen instruments their music wake,
Nor pages pass their sparkling draughts around,
And yet the weight of policies profound,
Burdens each breast, and doctrines pure and sound,
Consult a future people's liberties,
Without the pomp of courtly vanities.
Their theme the building of a colony,
Their views as various as their interests be,
The past is traversed with a sober gaze,
Truths gathered from experience's ways,
And probabilities dexterously thrown
In Reason's scales, to balance up or down.
Suggestions follow; till each one in turn,
His neighbor's leading views succeeds to learn.
Discussion then proceeds, orderly, clear,
Each member striving simplest to appear,
And each assuming rather to be taught,
Than teach the other, e'en if teach he ought.
If different grounds their judgments mild divide,
Each yields his own to take the other's side;
Or, if one holds a point at one's expense,
He argues only in his point's defense,
And not against the others, shows how plain
His views are to discover his friend's gain.
Thus order o'er the council all prevails,
And harshness ne'er reflection's ear assails.
So when some peaceful stream pursues its course
Down moaning falls and rapids gurgling hoarse,
Each separate object finds a tongue distinct,
But all together blend, and each in one's extinct.
These names were chief in council: 'Squire Grimes,
A stern Lycurgus of the backwoods times,
And pious parson Deems, of honored name,
And mild Sir Maxey of lineal fame.
A man of little more than medium size
Was he, with soft brown hair and hazel eyes,
A light gray even beard, an open face,
An easy carriage, and a happy trace
Of deep reflection in his general mien,
That e'en by dull observers might be seen.
Unlike the Cæsar of a forest shed,
To daring deeds, and frontier perils bred,
So sensitive his elevated mind,
For combat and disaster too refined,
At bloody sights a horror seized his breath,
And fears swum thro' his veins at thought of death.
And such is man, to different fortunes born;
When different schools his early life adorn,
A hero dwindles to a merest lout
When nothing calls the latent hero out.
The name of Gabriel Grimes, whene'er one spoke,
The thought of law immediately awoke.
His mien meant law, his voice and his attire,—
In truth the very man seemed born a 'Squire.
Not tall was he but round, and fat and tan,
And twice as thick as any other man.
Reserved, yet free, incautious, yet alert,
He suffered ne'er his character a hurt
By weightless talk. When others laughed he'd frown,
When others frowned he'd laugh, and so renown,
E'en as the jackal hunts the lion down,
Ran after him all frothy mouthed; and praise
Sounded her horn at his peculiar ways.
'Twas granted all the depths of law he knew,
For what he did know, others ne'er saw thro'.
His strength lay not in doing mighty things,
But giving mighty inferences wings,
And thus it is with many great of earth,
Not what they are, but what we think them worth.
But David Deems, his opposite in all,
Was pleasant, candid, unassuming, tall.
A cloud of fleecy locks hung peacefully
About his neck, according happily
With his broad look of open charity,
And ever in his careful placid face
The sweet light shone of vital inward grace,
Like dawnings of a better world—no glare
Of hot ambitions e'er ascending there,
Nor earth's polluting fires. His was no mien
Of sanctity affected, while between
His precepts and his practice, regions lay
Untraversed in his life; but as the day,
The cloudless lustre of his zealous soul
Beamed solid forth, and held in mute control,
Or stirred with song-cheer all within his reach.
He practiced how to live as well as preach,
And when he prayed, "Our debtors be forgiven,"
His soul and mind and strength conversed with Heaven,
Denouncing sin, the rebel, trembling heard,
And breathless hung upon his lightest word;
Describing bliss, wretchedness raised her eyes,
And with his lifted hand assayed to rise,
To spurn cold earth and dwell beyond the skies.
But when with pity streaming down his cheek,
The pierced bleeding Lamb of God, so meek
He pointed to, loud sobs responsive told
What sway o'er hearts a godly man may hold.
Ah, God! for more such in these turbid days,
Who preach to save souls, not to win mere praise,
Who walk with men to lead them out of vice,
And cause them to secure the "pearl of price."
'Twas then fair Saville that thy just renown
Was trumpeted in all the pride of town.
For all the hunting stations far and near,
Thou wast a depot to all hunters dear.
The tide of immigration drifting e'er,
Far on thy desert shores, some pioneer;
Soon far around, in distant wilds unknown,
Rude lodges from adventurer's hands were strewn,
And Husbandry went forth with sturdy hand,
To clear the waste and dress a prosperous land.
The voice of cleavers in yon valleys wide,
Were heard from breaking morn till eventide;
Loud rang their sudden axes blow on blow,
Deep thro' the waste re-echoed from below,
Great trees came crashing with a thundering sound,
Heaved from their stumps, and groaned along the ground.
Lo! in the mountains where yon wild cascade
Leaps thro' the sun and trembles in the shade,
Or sings in the sad ear of loneliness;
Where noteless birds come in the drowsiness
Of pulseless Summer's unremitting heat,
Where o'er the stream the forest branches meet,
Where rocks oppose the climber's sterile way—
And gorges yawn beneath in rugged gray,
High in the seat of Ancient Solitude,
The border woodsman rears his cabin rude.
Equipped with rifle, axe, and faithful dogs,
Here dwells the sovereign of a hut of logs;
By one attended of the fearless fair,
A consort in the wilds well worth his care.
By day the husband ventures forth for food,
Far from his lodge, within some friendly wood;
At eve returning to that constant one,
Who dared to bide his coming all alone.
Then when the twilight spreads her mantle pale
O'er wood and hill, and darkens in the vale,
His axe, and ready loaded gun near by,
His watchful mastiffs snugly napping nigh,
The window latched, and stoutly barred the door,
The day's adventures are recounted o'er.
The bear is now pursued over fallen logs,
Opposed by these, and pressed by eager dogs,
The herd's seen pouring thro' the startled dell,
The fleet stag's shot and hung up where he fell.
Thus on, the current of narration flows,
Deeper and deeper wearing as it goes,
Till heavy slumber settles on their eyes;
Converse moves sluggish, thoughts slower arise,
And faint and fainter flick'ring, sink the rays,
That wander from the fagot's dying blaze,
Till embers pale surviving—nothing more,
Light them to rest to dream their chattings o'er.
Look where yon hunters two or three or more,
The solitary wilds to westward now explore.
Thro' mountain paths, by lakes and streams they roam,
The woods their dwelling-place, the world their home!
In beast skins clad, dark jungles wind they thro',
With eager strides their desert way pursue,
And with wild pleasure gaze on every prospect new.
At times hopelessly lost these wandered long,
The hostile tribes of savages among.
By day their only show of safety
Their excellence in sylvan strategy.
The wild bird's song seemed as a mournful tale,
And e'en a twig's fall turned their faces pale;
And every little throat did omens bear,
That shocked their senses with a seige of fear,
Till restless hunger whetted valor keen,
And dared the perils of the dismal scene.
When thro' the darkling bosom of the dell
The footsteps of the cautious ranger fell
In measured silence on the Indian trail,
And fierce alarm was tongued by every gale;
When streamed the burning wigwam's lurid light
Against the forest walls of troubled night,
And quick-eyed dragoons threaded every pass,
O'er mountain rocks, and in the deep morass,
Then cougar-footed strategy slunk in
Before the lion tread of Discipline.
For these, fair Saville, these frontiersmen bold,
Whose praise in song or story ne'er was told,
For these, thou wast a haven where all turned,
And where for all a genial hearth e'er burned.
When fugitives to this free home of ours,
Sought liberty beneath thy Western bowers;
From shores whence bigotry, with flaming hand,
Expelled poor conscience naked from the land,
Pale wanderers flocked to thee in many a trembling band.
From torpid Norway's habitations drear,
Where Summer smiles to soothe the frigid year
In vain, and boisterous, railing torrents moan
The bitter discord of their cheerless zone,
And wintry blasts o'er naked landscapes shriek,
While sparse fed herds migrate from peak to peak
In dismal groups, to browse the thawing slope,
Or huddle in the drowsy mountain cope;
From fair Italia's hills of evergreen,
O'er-canopied in stillest blue serene,
From fields where Summer plants her fragrant train
Beside the lucent streamlets of the plain;
From old determined Britain; morose Wales—
Where life's as stately as a ship with sails—
From Scotia's genial bourne of soul and song,
Where poverty, though simple, spurns the wrong,
Where love and labor meet fraternally;
Fair land of Burns and wand'ring minstrelsy;
From Germany's wide realms of smoke and beer,
Where dreamy metaphysics sits austere;
From over-flowing, ever-bowing France,
The home of fashions, fopperies and dance;
From sacred Judah, and beyond the Nile,
And from priest-ridden Erin's suppliant isle,
Escaping bands from Famine, Tyranny
And Ignorance, fled here for liberty.
A home for empty indigence was here;
The broken spendthrift found a friendly sphere,
The hopeless suiter came in all his throes,
To sport away the burdens of his woes;
Here wealth and romance found a fit abode,
And hand-in-hand with fame and fancy strode;
Ambition, in his sanguinest career,
Found a theatre for his conquests here;
And grave philanthropy, advising stood,
Disposed to do the unborn future good;
And here apostles of the hidden life
Implored kind Heaven to hold the winds of strife,
Pronounced swift judgment on transgression's ways,
Encouraged virtue, recommended praise,
Enlivened hope, taught faith to patient be,
Cheered manly toil and lauded charity.
With strongest cords of mutual interest bound,
All hands together were employed found.
Engaged to arm against a common foe,
The strength of unity they learned to know;
And what convenience Art had them denied,
United, willing hands full well supplied.
They reared their cabins, built their forest forts
Together, hunted, fished and held their sports.
The sick they joined to nurse with sleepless care,
To soothe the suffering, knew no pains to spare,
And when from earth the patient spirit fled,
They joined their mournful tributes to the dead.
Thus plenty flourished on the lap of ease,
And even danger's self was made to please.
Bold industry at hardships learned to smile,
Uproot vast wants and hew down woods of toil.
So when the forest matron crowned her board
With health and sustenance from her good hoard,
The unknown wanderer had a welcome there,
And indolence was e'en allowed a chair.
Lo! where yon woodsman skirts the neighboring weald,
And nears his smoking cot behind the field.
His step aweary quickens at each pace,
And satisfaction lightens his tired face
As home he views; Home! isle in time's rough sea,
Where rests the voyager serene and free
From hollow, howling sorrows, that surround
His rock, and shake life's groaning depths profound—
Where winds repose, in long unruffled peace,—
Dear isle! where love's bright shine doth never cease—
And where no sooner doth the bloomy train,
Their sweetness drop, than blooms revive again.
Lo, now the evening star in grandeur still
Ascends yon upland wood and sheep cote hill,
Like some pale maiden at the trysting late,
Hard thro' the twilight peering o'er the gate;
The loud cur at the hollow nightfall bays,
And whispers flutter round the bright hearth's blaze,
Then nearer draws the rustic to his seat,
His warming heart outstrips his hasting feet;
All day his manly arms to labor bared,
Have wrought the task, returning want prepared.
Blest be the man, who void of all pretense,
Repays in ample sweat kind Providence,
For all His goods, and great beneficence!
And blest the consort of his lusty cares,
Who seeks his pleasures and his labor shares.
Behold the pilgrim leaning at their door,
Water he begs and shelter—nothing more;
The frowning wealth of some far distant land,
Has driven him to leave with empty hand.
See how the wond'ring little ones apprise
Their busy mother with their sparkling eyes.
She to the stranger bows, extends a chair,
And chides her bright-eyed cherubs if they stare.
Hark! now the cotter's well-known steps draw near,
And patter faster as the stile they clear.
Soon in the door appears his open face,
A flock of kisses fly to his embrace;
The smaller, raised upon his manly breast,
Chirp out, and crow, and carrol at the rest.
And the kind housewife, hasty to obey
A tender conscience, happy seems as they.
Her eyes upon the hoary stranger bent,
Speak her desire, and ask her lord's consent.
All signs and looks unpleasant are repressed,
And ample supper set before their guest;
Who, having vanquished potent hunger quite,
Is kindly pressed upon to stay all night!
Blest be the man! his hands arrest his wants,
His charity is great, but never vaunts.
He now to quiet night's embrace repairs,
And sleeps away his weariness and cares.
Sweet be the visions of his manly breast,
Nor by remorseful dreams of wealth, nor banished joys opprest.
These were the mighty days of little things,
Ere soaring vanity had yet her wings.
Her patron wealth was then but poorly known,
For gain was satisfied with but his own.
Then aspirations of the noblest kind,
Dear humble comfort to her hights confined.
These were the good old times of simple worth,
When love and reverence met at every hearth;
When strong toil stretched beneath green plenty's tree,
And worshipped home's best god dear Industry.
Then gaunt-armed indiscretion, pale and sore,
Groaning beneath disease's dreaded sting
Through sleepless hours, was never known. The king
Most terrible of all the hordes of bale,
Intemp'rance, did not then the peace assail
Of hopeful hearts, breathing out crime and hate,
And houseless want and hearths all desolate.
Then blushing beauty's cheek of tender hues,
Showed not excessive drink and what ensues.
Ah! fatal days of wantonness and wine,
In which now youthful wealth assays to shine,
Deriding with the jeers of native glee,
The homespun customs of their ancestry!
Regarding lights which made our land sublime,
As smouldering embers on the hearth of time.
In wilds remote from fame's resounding horn,
Where courts were never dreamed of, kings were born,
Or minds that might have worn star-gemmed renown,
And added lustre to a James' crown
With all the sovereign claims of Royalty,
Wisdom, valor, and sterling honesty.
The way from office then was hedged by fines,
The way to office now by party lines.
Oh, God! for a return to simple ways,
Such as crowned Saville in her valiant days,
Ere yet the pluming warrior's barb'rous knife
Cut down the flower on the lap of life!
But, Saville, pause! for God's sake pause! I beg!
For thy fair bosom warms a viper's egg.
The hatching ruin will thy young life sting,
And pour a deadly poison thro' thy nature's spring.
Thou hold'st one slave! Of barbarisms old
An evil seed now in thy life takes hold.
Prosperity's big rain to cheer thee falls,
And plenty overhangs thy garden walls;
Soft blooming gladness in thy hedges peep,
And green delight doth at thy waysides creep,
Contentment murmurs in thy valleys low,
And health's rejoicing streams from fruitful hillsides flow;
But Justice n'er can say, "peace be in thee,"
While one beneath thy grinding heel pants to be free.
Ah! can'st thou hold the life of one in chains,
With eighty-five per cent. of Saxon in his veins?
Oh, Saville, look at what a crime thy nature stains!
Thy Rodney, see, how noble he appears,
Just on the summit of his tender years!
His Summers number scarce a single score,
And yet his manly face seems marked by more.
When pity calls, his brawny arm assumes
A woman's softness, and as light becomes.
But when the right enlists him to oppose,
On whate'er grounds, whatever of her foes,
His face as gentle as a sleeping child's,
Would dare the fury of the roaring wilds;
His nerves put on their fearless strength, and steeled
By valor stern, the knife or rifle wield.
Erect in air he stands full six-feet, three,
Broad shouldered, strong, a goodly man is he.
A lover of fair women, and as blind
To her weaknesses as Egyptian night,
A fondler with soft childhood, and as kind
To its mistakes, as if mistakes were right;
Skilled in the feats that backwoods life adorn,
Although a stranger to the backwoods born,
The shelly clamor of the Autumn trees,
Or howl of beasts, or savages alike can please.
And he a slave? Ah, Saville, can it be
That such a noble heart can not beat free!
THE OLD SAC VILLAGE.
Ye who read in musty volumes
Pages worn of Backwoods Times,
Of the red man and the white man,
In the thrilling days of danger,
In the gall of border troubles,
In the wastes of deadly revenge,
And the ruffian hands of torture;
And of long and fierce death grapples,
With the bloody hands of combat,
On the yawning edge of famine;
Of adventure's rustling footsteps,
When the knees of stoutest valor
Smote together as they paused, where
Lynx-eyed strategy lay crouching,
On the bosom of still ambush,
Ready from his hands to let loose
A loud leash of swift cruelties;
Ye who read these musty volumes,
Till a strange sensation thrills you,
As of Indians skulking near you,
Lay aside your volume lightly,
Hear me sing of Nanawawa.
Ye who pore for weary hours,
In the deep wild nooks of legend,
In the forest-nooks of legend,
Gath'ring up these strange old relics,
For your idle thoughts to play with;
Such as wigwams rude, and war posts,
Belts of wampum, bows and arrows,
Scalping-knives, and rough stone hatchets,
Peace pipes and great council fires,
Forest senates, and wise treaties,
Forest seers and superstitions,
And inconstancy and cunning,
In the savage world of promise;
Ye who pore for weary hours
In these pathless nooks of legend,
Wake, and hear of Nanawawa.
Ye who wander long delighted,
In the distant realms of romance,
On the mountain hights of romance,
And in woody depths of romance,
Getting lost in shady windings,
Looking not to find your way out,
But a wood to wander off in,
And a nook to lose yourselves in;
With majestic trees around you,
Clasping in their arms of grandeur,
Densest depths of sleeping silence,
Clear, deep, still lakes, on whose margins
Peaceful herds feed, dreams the heron,
On whose bosoms swift and light glide
Birch canoes, arrowy darting,
Like soft shadows, smooth and soundless;
Floating thro' unbroken stillness,
Save the distant fret of oar-locks,
And the pebbly speech of bright waves;
Ye who seek these depths of romance,
Where the noon-beam parts the fore locks
Of the forest looking shyly,
Where a thousand wind-swung branches,
Wild songs pour in Solitude's ear,
And the heart of meditation
Slowly beats and warms in beating;
Pause, and hear of Nanawawa.
Ye who shut up in warm houses,
Late on sombre Winter evenings,
Lulled by pleasant roaring grate fires,
And the cozy flap of curtains,
And the chirp of vacant childhood,
And the cheery streams of gaslight
Meekly stealing, that pause, bashful,
On the plushy lap of softness;
Ye who thus shut up in houses,
Dream of early life and hardships,
Shut in humble frontier cabins,
Far out on the unknown borders;
Dream of weariness o'ercoming
The lost traveler on his journey
Overtaken by the snow-storm;
Lone at night and his path dimming,
Sinking down to sleep his death sleep;
Chilly leagues from any dwelling,
And while loneliness bewails him,
Through the drear woods shrieks the gray blast,
Shrieks the eager flying North blast,
As a hungry eagle shrieketh;
Ye who shut up thus in houses,
Dream of these fell border hardships;
Hear me sing of Nanawawa.
Ah! ye shall behold a beauty!
On the lap of an old forest,
In the wigwam of her fathers,
By the cascades of her childhood
Ye shall see a sylvan maiden,
Meek as April's first fresh rose is,
Sweet as blushing light e'er looked on,
Brilliant as a melting dewdrop,
But in love pensively youthful.
In the days that long ere these times,
Went their way with loud importance,
On the thrilling lips of warfare,
And the tongue of backwoods valor,
Told to many generations;
There was a rude Indian village,
Far within a glen sequestered,
In the basin of a clear brook,
Near the waters of the Wabash,
In the Mississippi valley.
In this ancient birch bark village,
With his daughter, Nanawawa,
Dwelt the chief of all the Sac tribes,
Old and austere Pashepaho,
Powerful and warlike Stabber.
On a hill, the Stabber's tent stood
High above the other lodges,
And the goodliest among them.
Once upon the moon of bright nights,
On a day in budding April,
At his tent door sat the Stabber,
With his chin leaned on his hands, sat
Knitting thoughts above his sage brow,
And pursuing speculations,
Through the sober depths of study.
"What a brilliant sun-set," said he,
As the world of quiet West woods
Slowly reddened into amber,
And the sunset-spangled clouds threw
Up their long arms tipped with fire,
And sank down in sleepy glory,
In a deep still sea of glory.
"Sing a camp song, Nanawawa,"
"I will help you sing it over."
Said he, turning to his daughter.
"On the morrow is the full moon,
And the great feast of the Sac tribes,
When the Chiefs of all the nations
Will come in to see the Stabber
And report upon the country.
They will tell me of their huntings,
And of fishings in their clear streams,
Of their pleasant sugar makings,
And of fields of green maize growing;
They will tell of wild adventures
With the bear and with the bison,
And will tell the great traditions
Of their tribes and of their totems.
Goodly presents they will bring me,
Venison to make the feast with,
Bear skins to adorn my tent with,
Paints to make my old age youthful,
Beads to brighten favor's dull eyes,
Wampum to revive old friendships,
And great words to move the heart with.
"Sing a camp song, Nanawawa,
Sing until the time of sleep comes,
I will join and help you sing it."
Nanawawa sang a camp song,
And the Stabber joined the singing,
Till asleep they sat and sang yet,
Till they went to sleep a singing.
Morning came, and as the hours
Went their way, they brought crowds with them,
Of the distant tribes and totems.
Noon approached, and saw the great feast,
In its highest wild demeanor,
In the savage hights of ardor.
Eating, drinking, gaming, dancing,
Mingled in a ceaseless whirling
To the sound of forest music.
Evening came, and as the feast sank
To repose, as sinks the warrior
On his shield, of fields aweary
And the long parade of armies,
To the tent door of the Stabber,
Chieftains came and stood in silence.
Pashepaho in his tent floor,
On his bear skins sat a smoking.
Not a word said he to any,
But a seat he motioned them to,
And went dryly on a smoking
As they settled close around him.
Young men, chiefs of the Ojibways,
The Miamis, and Dacotahs,
And the mighty Sacs and Foxes,
Laid their presents rare and costly,
At the Stabber's feet; and seated
On their armor, in great phrases
Of their forest tongues, made speeches.
On her tent floor, Nanawawa
Looking not upon the young men,
Heard their sounding words of valor.
Tho' the eyes of great chiefs sought her,
She would starve their eager glances,
Turning from them on the tent floor.
Pashepaho's Speech to the Young Men.
Pashepaho heard the young men
Till their lofty words had ended,
And in accents stern, thus answered:
"For your presents, I am thankful.
By your speeches I'm encouraged.
Peace now lighteth all the Nations
As a noon sun lights the prairies.
Time once was when peace was broken
Up in all our Western borders.
Horsed on fire, bloody battle
Rode throughout our ancient forests.
From his home within the sunrise,
From his land of bells and steeples,
From the regions of the East wind,
The hoar dwelling place of Wabun,
Then Spake the Great Father to us,
To his red tribes spake in loud tones
As of thunder in the forests.
"Now be peaceable, my children,
Dwell in friendship's tents together,
You, my red sons and my white sons."
Then he took his great war hatchet,
That could strike with blows of thunder,
And into the mountains wandered,
Went forth in the deepest valleys,
And at one blow hewed a pine down,
Fell a great pine of the valleys,
That looked upward into Heaven,
With the East winds in his left hand,
And the West winds in his right hand,
And the noon-beams in his forelocks;
Took this old pine of the valleys,
And to make a war-post, reared it.
Then he spake again, in this wise:
"Lo! the war-post now ascendeth!
See the war-post of the nations,
Now the Great Spirit beholds it;
See it pointing into Heaven
Like the finger of a giant!
Bury now your hatchets neath it,
And be peaceable my children,
Dwell in friendship's tents together."
Then the sky above the war-post,
Grew as clear as any crystal,
And the dreamy air was softened,
And the dazing blue seemed higher,
And the far off hills seemed farther,
And all sounds were low and solemn.
Then the red sons and the white sons,
Neath the war-post sat together.
When the red sons spake in this wise:
"Raise your eyes and look now, brothers,
See it now is Indian Summer.
Lo! the sky is all serene now,
And the hills are all a sleeping,
How the brown woods now are yawning?
Now the slow streams sing in whispers.
And the South wind passeth softly
In her moccasins of damp moss.
Lo! this now is Indian Summer,
And the time to go a hunting.
We will leave you now, and hasten
To the mountains for a bear hunt.
Our light canoes are waiting
By the waters. Brothers, farewell.
Then spake the Great Father to us,
As we stood beside the waters,
By the moorings of our canoes,
And shook-hands with all our brothers.
"Thus your hunting grounds, my red sons,
Shall extend; my white sons know them.
From Kaskaskia to Cahokia,
From St. Vincennes to St. Louis,
Up the Wabash, Illinois,
The Wisconsin, and Great Water,
To the regions of the North wind,
Where the bold St. Lawrence spreadeth
Out the fingers of his right hand;
Where the dun moose snuffs the lake fog,
Snuffs the cold breath of the North Lakes,
And the slow bear baffles Winter,
In his sullen reign of deep snows;
Where the son of Giant waters
Rocks the earth as in a cradle,
And sings lullabys of thunder
In the ear of old Forever,
Till the darkness sighs and shudders,
And the white hills quake and whisper,
"Lo, Niagara is waking!"
From this birth-place of the hoar blasts,
To the wigwam of the South wind,
In the myriad-voiced prairies,
Where the wild goose sounds her pibroch,
And the wild duck talks her nonsense,
And the heron shoots her slant flights,
From her dreamings in the long grass;
These shall be—then loud he uttered—
Hunting grounds for you forever."
Then said Pashepaho, turning
From his audience, and smoking,
"Peace now lighteth up our forests,
And our wigwams all are cheerful."
NANAWAWA'S SUITORS.
When the Stabber's speech had ended,
And his presents all were gathered,
And his pipe the chiefs had all smoked,
Four young chiefs of goodly mein, came
Round the princess of the forest,
And upon the tent floor kneeling,
Made obesience to her lowly.
Then they rose and gave her presents,
Costly beads and many colored
One presented, one a necklace
Of rare stones, one silver brooches
For her hair, and one gold wristlets.
All then went and sat in silence,
Waiting for the maiden's answer.
Pausing, seemed the maid more pretty.
Youthful seemed in indecision.
At the presents looked and suitors,
Looked at one and then the others.
Ah! how lovely now her soft eyes
Shone as her young hands grew doubtful.
Fairest daughter of the wigwams,
Blithest warbler of the deep shades,
Sweetest flower that e'er shined there,
Having o'er her native sweetness
Rarest hues of loneliness shed.
Ah! she was a lovely doubter!
Beads about her perfect neck hung,
Like the clusters of a ripe vine.
Wristlets clasped her naked round arms,
With reluctance seemed to clasp them,
As a lover clasps a lover.
Undecided, ah, how youthful,
Ah, how rare was Nanawawa!
Pashepaho silent sitting,
With a true parental pride, watched
His fair daughter thro' the pipe smoke
That in clouds his head environed.
At the door-way of the wigwam,
Then a chief stood, a Dacotah,
Leading a young captive with him,
A fair child of some white settler.
In the captive's face, the light shone
Of intelligence and training.
He the hopes showed of proud parents.
Long his locks, and golden, floated
To his shoulders, blue his eyes were,
And as sunbeams penetrating.
But captivity's cold buffets
Pensive made him seem and forlorn.
Then the presents of the young chiefs,
Nanawawa threw back to them,
Rose and met the young Dacotah,
Took the captive by the right hand,
And the young chief by the left hand,
And into the wigwam led them.
"Here," said she, "This is my present,
As the captive's hand she held to,
Give me this lad for a present."
"I have brought him for your present,"
Sighed the hopeful young Dacotah.
Thus it was that Nanawawa
Found a lover in her wigwam,
Found a husband at her door-way.
For within her heart she whispered,
In her heart the thought she uttered,
"I have found a husband surely."
But a secret hid she kept it,
Though she to her own heart told it,
Pashepaho never knew it.
Many days in happiness dwelt
Nanawawa and the captive;
For the Stabber took the captive,
Smeared his face with many colors,
Hung his golden locks with brooches,
Armed him with a bow and arrows,
And his son, the White Loon, named him;
Nanawawa's brother called him.
Meanwhile all the village loved him,
Loved young Nanawawa's brother.
In their huntings and their fishings,
All the young men of the village
Sought companionship in White Loon.
For the deer hunt he was ready,
For the bison chase and bear hunt;
And when Spring had warmed the rivers,
And their flow from mountains quickened,
On the bosom of the full tide,
His canoe was seen with others.
He was called the lucky fisher.
Thus it was that in the Sac town,
White Loon grew to be admired.
And at every tent door pausing,
In the morning or the evening,
Groups of cheerful faces met him,
With their dusky smiles of welcome.
Old men talked of him with wise looks,
And the young with brightened faces.
Children spoke of him in whispers,
And with little looks of wonder,
Grouped behind him in the tent doors;
For to them he was a prophet.
He could tell of ghosts and genii,
In the woods and in the waters;
In the rolling Susquehanah,
And the broad and rapid Hudson,
And the blue and peaceful Huron,
He could tell of evil genii,
Clasping hands upon the waters,
And to elfin music dancing
On the clear and moonlit waters.
Thus it was he told the children
Of a proud and faithless lover,
And the genii of the waters,
On the dark shores of Lake Huron.
"In a land of lakes and great woods,
In a green and distant country,
On the high cliffs of Lake Huron,
High as two pine trees together,
In a wigwam of great oak trees,
Lived a mighty chief of white men.
Old the man, and long his beard was
As the bow string of a warrior.
Long his hair, and thick and white was,
Like the pine's locks in a snow storm.
This chief had a lovely daughter.
Light was she, and full of sunshine,
And her words were all as cheerful
As a stream that glideth onward.
And her songs were all as buoyant
As the loud songs of a cascade.
In her speech music of groves was,
In her hair the gold of sunset,
In her cheek the blush of sunrise,
On her brow the shade of twilight,
In her eyes the blue of soft skies;
And her teeth were rows of pearl beads.
This fair squaw a young chief once loved,
And her hand in marriage promised.
But her heart was light and wayward,
And smiled on him, but went from him,
Till his eyes were mooned in frenzy,
And he fell into Lake Huron.
From the high cliffs that looked downward
From behind the great oak wigwam,
Genii, dancing on the lake's breast,
Saw him fall, and seized him sinking,
And with shouts of music, bore him
To a land beneath the waters.
Night by night then came his lover
To the bluffs behind her wigwam,
And long hours in the moonlight
Gazed down on the sleepy waters.
Thus she thought once when she went there:
"Oh! I'm sorry! I am sorry!
Since he's gone; Oh, now I'm sorry!
Could he hear me in his dark grave
Of the frightful rocking billows,
I would say to him, forgive me!
Speak, O waves, for now your hoarse words
Breaking on the rocks may tell me!
Can he hear my heart lamenting?"
Now the genii heard her sorrows,
Formed a circle of enchantment,
And upon the billows seated,
Filled the ravished air with sweet sounds;
Till the fair squaw, like her lover,
Fell among them, and they seized her,
And away with laughter bore her,
In the blue and silent Huron.
Now within the land of shadows,
Far beneath the sad still Huron,
In the deep home of the genii,
These two lovers are seen riding
E'er behind two harnessed moonbeams."
And of giants in the mountains,
White Loon also told the children.
Thus he told them of the giants:
"In a land of pines and great rocks,
In a far off land of mountains,
In the gateway of the sunrise,
Where the East wind shakes the door latch
On the wigwam of the sunrise.
There were giants in the old days;
Giants tall as mountain pine trees.
When it stormed upon the mountains,
And the woods were black with terror
And their speech was low and dismal,
Then, when thunders rolled and rumbled
On the stony streets of Heaven;
In the wigwams of the valleys.
Sat the stoutest warriors trembling,
And in whispers low and fearful
Muttered, 'Listen at the giants!
Ugh, the giants now are angery,
And will tear the very hills down!' "
Thus it was that White Loon's wisdom
Made him to his friends a prophet.
NANAWAWA'S LAKELET.
Where the dark ash upward towereth,
And the maple drops her brown shade,
And the rough oak spreads his broad arms,
And the wild vine weaves her festoons;
Where the noon breeze pants for sunlight,
And the sunbeams wandereth shyly,
And the night-winds wrestleth lightly,
With the lone leaf of the forest;
Where the moon-beams creepeth softly,
In a dim veil looking faintly;
In this ancient grand high forest,
In the right hand of Kaskaskia,
And the left hand of Cahokia,
And the regions of the Wabash;
Was the little rush bound lakelet,
Of the forest—Nanawawa's.
Tall trees in the solemn old woods,
On the western slopes and hilltops,
Threw their shadows in the bottoms.
Parting ferns and water-lilies,
And the rushes, that with wet lips
Sipped the lakelet's clear, cool waters;
Nanawawa's birch canoe flashed
Light and noiseless as the shadow
Of a cloud upon a meadow.
In this fleet canoe sat White Loon,
But the oars held Nanawawa,
And the boat plied with her bare arms,
And to White Loon talked in whispers.
Now a moon rose o'er the forest
Of the great Northwestern Country,
And looked down into the lakelet
As a maid looks in her mirror.
All the air was in a slumber,
And the forests, in a deep nap,
Breathed not as soft light stole o'er them,
Wrapt in fleecy garb of thin mists,
Night had gently closed her eyelids,
Clasping all the world in silence;
Save the creek that in the lake leapt,
Coming from the wooded hillside,
Saying strange things to the clear moon.
As the boat flashed thro' the moonlight,
White Loon near to Nanawawa
Drew his face, and spoke in this wise:
"White Loon loves you, Nanawawa!"
When these words fell, both her oars fell,
And she upward at the moon gazed,
With both hands dropped in the water.
As the forest maiden's soul swam
In her eyes, White Loon leaned o'er her,
Drew her naked bosom to him,
Drew her to him close and listened;
With his breathings half suspended,
Listened to her words of music
Dropping like a wasted shower
Thro' the leafy depths of Autumn;
"Nanawawa loves you, White Loon,
"White Loon you must build a wigwam."
White Loon raised his eyes and answered:
"By yon cascade in the mountains,
High above the village looking,
I will build my great birch wigwam,
Ere the wintry hours approacheth."
And his heart with aspen lightness
Turned toward a happy future.
Forest-love brings forethought with it.
Nuptial care dwells in the wildwood;
In the Indian's poor wigwam
Love's bright sunshine casteth shadows.
Thus it was that White Loon, wooing
On the lakelet of the forests,
In the clear and placid moonlight,
Saw a happy future rising
And its pleasant tasks revealing.
Thus it was he built a wigwam,
Dressed it carefully with bear skins,
And the door adorned with stag's horns,
To abide the bridal entrance.
Then it was he went a hunting,
Went far off into the mountains,
Seeking food to meet the winter.
Saying, as he clambered onward,
With the eager warrior's hunted;
"I will soon return, I'm hoping,
Let our hunting time be short now."
DEATH OF PASHEPAHO.
Lo! the old Sac village slumbered
In the basin of the Wabash,
And the doorway of the vallies,
Like some brown old matron napping
On the threshold of her cottage,
When her distaff lieth idle.
All the plaintive vale was cooing,
And the hazy hills were piping,
And the mournful gales were flapping
Thro' their somber realms of sere woods.
Sang the crane migrating southward,
Answered the itin'rant heron
In her dank and grassy rev'rie,
By the blue and pensive waters.
Then it was that sate the Stabber;
In the middle of his tent floor;
Sate with sober words and features,
Talking of the times he once knew,
Now with the departed past blent,
Now deep in the grave of years laid.
At his side sat Nanawawa,
And her voice like running waters
O'er a pebbly bed descanting,
Sank upon his ears with rapture;
With a wild and lonely rapture,
As she asked him of the old times.
"Nanawawa," said he, trembling,
"You had better take a husband.
From the great tribes of the west plains,
Take a strong and valiant young chief,
For I soon must go and leave you.
From the wigwam of your mother,
Sixteen years ago you followed;
From the lone spot where we left her,
Where the mournful vine entwines her,
Where the wild briar blooms above her,
Where the wild birds sing unto her;
From that spot I love to think of,
Sixteen years ago you followed
To this wide and unknown country.
Since that time you've e'er been with me,
E'er been sunlight in my tent door,
Ever been the joy of old age;
But my daughter, Oh! my daughter,
Oh! my hind, my Nanawawa!
I am now upon a journey,
And you now cannot go with me!"
Nanawawa could not answer,
And for tears saw not the Stabber,
As he leaned upon the tent floor,
And went on to utter faintly:
"What is that I hear a coming?
Don't I hear the sound of footmen
Coming from a distant country?
Ah! I hear the tread of warriors,
They are coming in a hurry!
I behold great lands before me,
Now I see green mountains rising,
And I see the peaceful wigwams,
Just across the river yonder!
Nanawawa, I must leave you!
Come and see me in the morning.
Oh! my daughter, come and see me!"
Nanawawa caught her father,
Stooping o'er him, called and called him,
Pressed his face against her pale cheek,
Held his hands and watched his still lips.
Then a wail burst from the wigwam;
Pashepaho had ceased breathing!
SAVILLE IN TROUBLE.
Sing muse! of Saville and the direful day
When beauty fell, to ruthless hands a prey;
And life a sacrifice to savage hate,
Smoked on the alter of a peaceful State.
The pensive forest in his saddest wear,
Leaned on the threshold of the Autumn sere,
And mourned his ills in parting Summer's ear.
And waters leaving for the distant main
Sang their departure in a muffled strain.
The dove complaining at the barn was heard,
In wanton gales the naked orchards stirred.
And scarce within the dreamy vision's reach
The sheep cote elms flapped their rocky speech.
In Saville, then, the border village rude,
Full plenty's songs the ear of labor wooed,
And lulled him on the lap of solitude.
The sun had swum high on his blazoned way,
Exulting in the power of his sway.
And rural comfort's well-contented hum,
Rejoiced in each household cherrysome.
The milkmaid gossipped at her busy churn,
The groaning windlass coughed at each slow turn,
The distaff whirred and chattered in the door,
The swift brooch danced along the sounding floor;
The matron scolded, and her hands applied,
The loom reechoed and the wheel replied.
Sir Maxey then, with horns, and hunters proud,
For chase assembled in a roaring crowd.
The champing horses pawed the anxious ground,
And windy signals roused the kenneled hound.
And as the mingling bands their saddles strode,
The wayside trembled and deep groaned the road.
Three miles from Saville, in the branchy West,
The horsemen on their boist'rous way had pressed,
When on the wild marge of a pathless wood,
Whey reined their speed, and, list'ning, eager stood.
The hounds had touched a trail upon the brink,
Where late an antlered stag had come to drink,
And cool, within the windings of a brook,
That mused away thro' many a forest nook.
Soon lively baying o'er the distance broke,
The hills re-echoed and the forest spoke.
The flying pack their goodly prey had sprung,
St. Vincennes' pulseless woodlands deep among.
Like eagles flashing from the vaulted blue,
The firey steeds in level flight pursue.
In winding glens their hoofy thunders break,
And cliffs responsive all their voices wake.
Sir Maxey, putting spurs, directs the course,
And sweeps away upon his coal black horse.
His comrades follow close in lengthy file,
Wind their glad horns and prime their guns the while.
The woods before them part upon the eye,
And pass in dizzy currents as they fly;
And crouching thickets scamper as they near,
And flee together as they disappear.
Beyond the vision's bounds they thus have gone,
Up hill and down, o'er streams and on and on.
Meanwhile, alone on foot young Rodney hastes
Along a passage that divides the wastes.
Forbid to rank he cannot take his place
With mounted hunters in the merry chase.
The day wore on, and yet no tidings gave,
Of horse or hunter to the anxious slave,
Till he, despairing, turned to watch a trail,
That saunteringly wound along the vale.
The chase now hushed; the stag beyond his range,
Had lost his loud pursuers in a forest strange;
Till worn and hungry, these leisurely drew
To where small fenceless fields adorned their view.
Beyond, bark lodges here and there were seen,
Where lofty woods climbed o'er a long ravine.
And slowly nearing, on their wond'ring eyes,
Soft circling smoke-wreathes from a village rise,
And float in dreamy banks against the peaceful skies.
They pause, look onward, know not what to say,
When thus, Sir Maxey, spurring, leads the way:
"Come on, we'll venture down and ask for food
And friendship in this city of the wood."
The hunters follow at a timid pace,
And apprehension kindles in each face.
They reach the village, slowly thro' it ride,
And every part explore from side to side.
They find it is deserted by all save
Small groups of children and the aged brave.
These sit in converse at their wigwam doors,
While memory the valiant past explores.
They on the neighb'ring slopes in peaceful plays,
Their numbers gather and their voices raise.
The squaws are lab'ring in their scanty fields,
Content with what their wild industry yields;
To bide their warriors' much desired return
From distant hunting grounds and long sojourn.
The Autumn hills appear in brown repose,
And, clothed in lofty forests, seem to dose.
And solitude asserts her reign, remote
From civilization's rest-disturbing throat.
But, hoofy 'larm the woody silence breaks,
The lone boughs flutter and the scene awakes.
Around the hunters, childhood flocks to gaze,
And age arising, looks in mute amaze
Upon the daring strangers, who proceed
To rifle tents, and load each ready steed
With what few skins their wintry hunt can hoard,
And swallow what poor food their empty stores afford.
The helpless fathers of the forest race
Glance fearful each into the other's face,
Pursue the pillagers with heated eyes,
And empty out their souls in frequent sighs;
While in their gath'ring frowns and gestures rude,
Wild valor overleaps decrepitude,
And such a flourish of contempt displays,
As shows that stern resentment is ablaze.
Ah! could they but recall the fleeting years,
Or backwards journey to where disappears
The dim seen past, and reach that stalwart time
When nimble life exulted in its prime;
Three-fold the numbers that their tents defile,
Would meet destruction in their conduct vile.
The hunters mount menacing as they go,
And thro' the village disappearing slow,
Betake them to the woods and brisker ride
Along the neighb'ring forest's eastern side.
There where a peaceful streamlet ambles by
Thro' dabbling ferns and gossips cheerfully
With shaggy roots that reach into the flood,
They spy a maid just bord'ring womanhood.
Now ranging feathers in her head-gear fair,
And with her fingers combing out her hair,
She on the prone bank stands, where smoothly flows
The liquid mirror, and her beauty shows.
Now grand old sylvans raise their solemn heads,
And make obesience as she lightly treads
Beneath their outstretched arms, and looks around
To gather nuts upon the leaf-spread ground.
The hunters see her, wayward, wild and sweet;
She sees them not, nor hears their horses' feet.
"Hold!" cries Sir Maxey, "What a lovely maid!
Ah! what a princess of this ancient shade!
Let me behold her! Quiet! Don't move!
Did admiration e'er see such a dove?
Young love no sweeter image ever drew
Upon imagination's tender view.
Her perfect form in idle movements seems
The fleeting creature of our youthful dreams."
A rougher comrade at his elbow growls,
"A purty good 'un o' the dusky fowls,
She's hard o' hearin', le'me try my gun;
Give her a skere, and see the red wench run."
His deadly eye directs, his rifle speaks,
The maiden throws her arms and runs and shrieks;
Towards the hunters pitiously flies,
The mournful wastes lamenting with her cries,
Till at their feet she sinks, and all is o'er,
Poor bleeding Nanawawa is no more.
Kind Heaven reports the shameful news around,
Far as her sorrowing winds can waft the sound;
Soft echo in her grot hears with a sigh,
And saddened hills refuse to make reply.
"I struck her," grunts the ruffian, looking down,
"Let's leave," Sir Maxey mutters with a frown;
And on they ride, and covenant to keep
The crime a secret in their bosoms hidden deep.
But hark! what mean those distant shouts that rise
And seem to flap and clamor in the skies?
Flying this way, the pulseless air they wing,
And nearer, clearer, shriller, faster ring.
The forest rages, groan the loud hills sore,
The hoarse earth murmurs and the heavens roar.
Returning warriors flash the trees between;
The fatal gun has called them to the scene.
Blazing resentment fires their warlike blood,
They've passed their dwellings and enraged pursued.
And mark the hunter whom their wrath o'ertakes,
For on his head a storm of ruin breaks.
Sir Maxey's band their loud pursuers hear,
And spurring onward leave them on the rear;
For Saville wheeling quick each headlong steed,
And dash between the forests with defiant speed.
The raging warriors reach the bloody scene,
See Nanawawa lifeless on the green,
A moment pause and scan the mournful place,
Still, crafty vengeance darkening in each face,
The way the band went, narrowly then view,
And all another route at once pursue.
But one tall form his further flight restrains;
Lo! over Nanawawa's sad remains
The White Loon bends, and kisses her pale cheek,
And trembling lips that can no longer speak;
While from his eyes the streams of loud grief start,
And downwards pour the anguish of a manly heart.
As some wild wand'ring brook that surges hoarse,
And chafes and struggles in its winding course
Through tangled roots, and under mossy stones,
And over foamy cat'racts makes its moans,
Till headlong down the mountain's steepy sides,
The smoother current unobstructed glides;
Flows ev'ner as it meets the level main,
And murmurs leisurely along the plain;
So now the pluming bands their numbers drew,
In fretful streams the pathless forests thro'.
This way and that, low crouched, they galloped on,
Stood list'ning, here and there, a hight upon;
Moved down in level flight beyond the glade,
And glided into silent ambuscade;
And in the branchy covert pond'ring lay
Beside the coming hunter's thoughtless way.
As hungry cougars in the deep morass,
To seize on unsuspecting herds that pass,
Lie close and closer as their prey draws nigh,
Glance at each other with impatient eye,
And press the eager moments as they fly;
So watch these cougars of the wilderness,
And so the moment of assault they press.
With envious haste their barb'rous knives they clasp,
And poise their hatchets in a deadly grasp,
And leaning forward on their ponies wait,
Like eagles on their pinions. Coming straight
Along the gorge the hunter's chatting trot
All unsuspecting; till the fatal spot
They reach, when forth from stilly ambush nigh,
The yelling furies on their pathway fly.
Once from the tangling branches fairly freed,
Wild retribution fledges savage speed,
Straight on the hunter's right and left they wheel,
And thro' their vitals plunge the reeky steel
Swift as their iron strength the blows can deal.
All, save Sir Maxey, perish; he again
Rides through the storm like lightning to the plain,
Drives up his speed and shaves the lev'ler main.
So when fierce eagle shoots along the skies,
Breaks thro' the ambient clouds and downward flies,
Above the landscape swings his open sail,
And hangs in stately triumph o'er the vale.
Forward he leans at each successive bound,
As on and on he reaches o'er the ground.
Hard bears his courser on th' unyielding reins,
Close-scented danger swells his fiery veins,
Dilates his nostrils, to his knees inclined,
And pours their steamy volumes on the wind.
O'er log, stone, ditch, mound, shrub and brushy heaps,
Away, away he unobstructed sweeps.
In vain the heaving earth beneath him groans,
In vain the rising distance makes her moans,
In vain the wand'ring eye his flight pursues,
In vain the ear his feet receding woos;
Across their utmost limits both he shaves,
Drown'd in the roiling depths of dusty waves.
The passing gale behind him list'ning swings,
To view the rival of her speedy wings,
With breath suppressed, as when some maiden sees,
A deer go fleeting by her 'mong the trees.
Meanwhile, away behind, disheartened not,
The streaming warriors hard pursuing trot.
What tho' the courser leave them like the wind?
His trail they see and stopping they will find.
Five miles or more, from where began the flight,
Along the summit of a woody hight,
Sir Maxey reins his courser to the ground,
And far and near for Rodney looks around.
As some dark cloud that spurns the rising gale,
Athwart it rolls and deepens in the vale,
Pours loud alarm upon the plains below;
Where, in midfield, stands the deserted plow,
And tall dread-breathing forests timid grow;
So seemed the surging courser as he trode,
With bois'trous hoof, to plunge along the road.
Now plodding near along the deep wood-side,
The expert of the wilds, Sir Maxey spied.
A brace of fowls and bleeding doe are strung
His rifle on and o'er his shoulder swung.
Homewards he strides anticipating toast,
Stewed fowl abundant, and savory roast.
"Here! Rodney! Here!" Sir Maxey urgent cries,
The expert pausing, lifts his downward eyes;
Alarm is flashing in his master's face,
With looks inquiring now he mends his pace,
When thus Sir Maxey loud begins to cry:
"Fly for your life! for God's sake, Rodney, fly!
A tribe of Sacs are swarming on my rear
Dreadful to see, but dreadful more to hear!
They'll scalp us all and burn the town I fear."
Towards the town the Champion lifts his eyes,
And on his master fixing, thus replies:
"No! let us meet them; hold your further flight,
Retreat's in order ne'er before a fight.
To fly will but reduce our wonted strength,
And make resistance feebler, and at length
Expose our village to the storming foe;
Who, if repulsed, will reinforcements show.
Lead not an enemy our helpless homes to know."
As some loud boar who hears his baying foes,
Upon his sedgy realms begin to close,
With groaning rage flies from his hidings dense,
And throws his lordly strength on the defense;
So Rodney, from his cov'ring in the wood,
Flew to the breach, and waiting, firmly stood.
Straight he beheld the warriors close at hand,
Him they behold, his movements understand,
Wheel from his rifle, and their flight renew,
All, save two mightiest, to their man pursue.
These now dismounted, turn their ponies loose
And in the woods their vantage places choose,
Peer thro' the thick boughs with a stealthy eye,
Till at his mark one lets an arrow fly.
Thro' flinching branches rings the feathered harm,
And strikes its painful barb into his arm.
E'en as some bear whom crouching hunters wound,
Tears at the pain, and rages o'er the ground,
Till in the copse the hidden foe he spies,
And on his covert fierce as fury flies;
So Rodney, when the flinty stroke he feels,
The shaft plucks out, and from his cover wheels;
Rages defiant thro' the sounding wood,
Till near the wary foe his steps intrude.
Quick as some stag, when horns and hounds assail
His secret lair within the leafy vale;
The pluming champion springs upon his feet;
His and bold Rodney's eyes defiant meet.
Loud as two bulls that roar upon the plain,
Plunge on each others frothy sides amain,
Till wasted strength their foaming rage prevent,
The dread combatants groan with dire intent.
Each dreads the onset for the glare of death
Warms his foe's eyes, and fury wings his breath.
The chief's arm ne'er by wilds nor dangers swerved,
And Rodney's by successive hardships nerved,
With nervous haste their leathern girdles feel,
And on the gaze unsheath their deadly steel.
Each lifted hand its ghastly freight displays,
Each hurried glance the narrow field surveys;
With each, defiance can no farther go,
Unless it walk beyond a prostrate foe.
As two tall beeches shaken by the wind
Approach each other; now with heads inclined,
Now rush away with quick impetuous roar,
And now approach, inclining as before;
So bending to and fro the champions stand,
Till loud they rush together, hand-to-hand,
Rough as the surge when sounding billows meet
Between the schooners of an anchored fleet.
Each in his left hand holds the other's right,
And struggles o'er the ground in horrid plight,
Now on their knees, now bounding in the air,
And now half-stooped to earth, and groaning there.
Their lips all death-like on their teeth they clench
And grate defiance harsh at each long wrench,
That vainly strives the grasp to disengage,
And in the foe's heart plunge the steely edge.
The savage champion feels his waning strength
Give away, and yielding to his fears, at length
Pours forth three dreadful whoops of wild distress,
That start the lone ear of the wilderness.
An answer in the distance soon was heard,
And parting a dense thicket now appeared
A warrior fell, with cautious step and slow,
As when some cougar scents a covered foe.
New life to Rodney! Gracious Heaven save!
A doubled danger doubly nerves the brave!
He frees his knife with desp'rateness of strength,
And in the savage sheaths its deadly length;
And as he lifeless sinks with a loud groan,
Bold Rodney at the other heaves a stone.
Firm on his head the shrieking fragment flies,
The dying warrior rolls his painful eyes,
Sinks on the turf, that whitens with his brains,
And hugs the clod that drinks his flowing veins.
The dauntless hero of the woody waste,
To leave the scene of blood directs his haste;
With gun in hand, surveys his passage well,
And strides along the stream-divided dell;
Arrives in Saville ere the sun goes down;
Explains his wounds, and makes his combat known.
With tongues of praise the village meets her slave,
The women soothing, cheering him, the brave.
No strength has courage, to the fears disguise
In downcast glances of his serious eyes.
The horrid brake conceals the skulky foe,
And o'er him darkness falleth like a mantle low.
"Ah! Sad mistake!" the fathers of the town
In painful concert mutter up and down
The mournful streets; "Ah me! a fatal freak!
When wisdom yields to folly, valor's weak.
Ah, indiscretion! parent of all woe,
That causeth peace to rouse a crouching foe!
The sober blacksmith threw his hammer down,
And wiped the great drops from a sooty frown,
His anvil mounted, and with words of steel
Went on to utter what his heart did feel.
And as the sun sank in the hills' embrace,
His sad rays streaming in old Joseph's face,
That vacant looked, a picture made of dread,
That many strong hearts trembled as they read.
And Gabriel Grimes, the 'Squire, 'mong his books
Sat drown'd, assaying in his serious looks,
To trace a legal thicket on his gaze,
That showed no exit and no ent'ring ways.
"What? Ho!" Sir Maxey shouts with martial air,
"Before a struggle yield not to despair.
For these discretions valor makes amends,
We hold the means, but Providence the ends.
Fly to your arms, and set a heavy guard,
And coolness keep for strategy prepared.
Have wives and children shut in doors till morn,
And then will danger of his locks be shorn."
The honest cotters hear him with a sigh,
And glance around them with a doubtful eye;
Proceed toward the village church and stand
In dread suspense, a hopeless little band.
Now darkness lowers like a gloomy pall,
The muffled drum proclaims a solemn call,
And lights blown out reposeless courage waits
The signal of the sentry at the gates.
In converse low, the fathers watch in arms,
For night's familiar sounds now seem alarms.
The deep low baying of unusual curs,
Discloses restlessness not wholly theirs,
For honest dogs that stealthiness abhor,
Which doth conceal the steps of savage war.
Hark! List! a war-whoop starts the dismal fen!
A moment lingers, and is heard again.
Hope stops her flight, conjectures disappear,
Attack is certain, and is crouching near.
With noiseless tread the sylvan warrior steals,
(Him darkness in her mantle's folds conceals,)
Beneath the very cabin's walls, unseen,
And yet may pass the peering watch between.
When Heav'n responsive to his sally cries,
Will hideous grow, and shut her sickened eyes,
And from the pitchy womb of darkness born,
Red massacre behold the mournful morn.
Ah! now must Courage meet the unsheathed test
That makes stern manhood tremble in his breast.
Escape hath shut her paths upon his eye
And leaves him doomed to conquer or to die.
In age's low'ring look and muffled speech,
The young see trouble, and with sobs beseech
An explanation at the lips which hold
The dreadful secret that cannot be told.
Childhood avoids the wand of magic sleep;
Forgetfulness assays in vain to steep
His wakeful senses in her drowsy dews;
Close on composure's heels alarm pursues.
In solemn council lean the village sires,
Where hope's last smold'ring ember-glow expires;
Sir Maxey's indiscretions yet deplore,
And thus in concert sad their minds explore:
"Our ammunition most in hunting spent,
Our numbers scattered and resistance bent,
To send to Dearborn yet for aid remains
The only prospect that our reason gains,
That rises hopeful from disaster's plains.
The troops perhaps, by timely warning may,
In mounted march, rescue the sinking day.
But, who will go? Who'll dare these twenty miles,
Of forest peril, night and savage wiles?
Who'll bear the news, when he on foot must go,
For not a horse can 'scape the wary foe!"
The young and valiant called upon to choose
The way to glory or her hights refuse,
In vacant looks this truth leave manifest,
The glory-fires warm another's breast.
Then, as a hunter calls his faithful dog,
To dare the treach'rous sands and cross some bog,
Sir Maxey to his bleeding servant cries:
"Say, Rodney, can't you fly to Dearborn? Rise,
Your rifle take, be quick! look sharp! be gone!
Let what you do be well and quickly done."
As some firm rock that brawling floods oppose,
In all their wanton rage, Rodney arose,
Disgust red kindling in his manly face,
Looked on the lords of his unhappy race,
And spoke: "My masters, such your titles are,
Let all irreverence from my thoughts be far;
But I've till now a silent list'ner been,
And have your timid operations seen.
And now I ask, with but a servant's claim
To audience, and in a servant's name,
I ask, with what do brave men guard their wives,
And homes, and children, but with their own lives?
With all your bosoms cherish as their own,
With all they know, and all they've ever known,
Exposed to danger, sueing you for aid,
I ask, why have you this evasion made?
If I, an alien to your house and hearth,
The ignoble sharer of a slavish birth,
Am called to take your parts, be well apprised,
Your conduct is but cowardice disguised.
Had I a single treasure to me dear,
A single home joy bright, or, even were
I owner of my life, my arm I'd bare,
And thrust my fingers into peril's hair.
But none of these, and not a cheer within
My darkened breast, what may I hope to win?
Naught but the praise of mere obedience,
The fame of dogs! Nay! ere I journey hence,
Bring down command to tent with kind request,
Own me a man, and trust a manly breast.
For be assured, although your slave am I,
He will not cower, who will dare to die;
He sees no terror in menace's eye.
The gaping wounds I for my master wear,
Already warn me that I unrewarded bear."
Now, Rodney ended, and a mute despair
Fell on his hearers, for he breathed an air,
So foreign to their knowledge of a slave,
With liberty so audaciously brave;
That with the tameness of stupidity,
They on their bosoms leaned their chins, to see
Weak folly tamper with a lion; when
Sir Maxey turned away, and never spoke again.
In hope's wide fields there was no further day,
And now their only star had passed away.
As when beseiging cloud surround the hills,
Whose troubled bosom night with terror fills,
Rude shepherds tremble, in their darkened tent,
To hear the mountains wail and woods lament;
Till lo! upon the brim of vision far
Appears the joyous-beaming morning star;
So quaked these townsmen of St. Vincennes' wood,
Till in their midst fair Dora Maxey stood,
A ray of hope to all their bosoms dear,
A day-break in their cloud-gloom'd land of fear.
So young and gentle, so serenely wild,
At once a heroine and a lovely child!
The band dispersing with her conqu'ring eyes,
In daring tones to Rodney she replies:
"Brave servant, thou hast nobly said and true,
Let valor wear his scars and glory too,
But know that woman by her jealous lords
Unhindered, in her great heart e'er awards
To stalwart manhood, love, esteem and praise,
And glories most in his most daring ways.
By caste's frail grants let those win hearts who can,
What woman loves is manliness in man.
Now she is here, for her thy life expose,
And nobler years will her rewards disclose.
The time now wings this way, when Gratitude
Shall clasp thee to her bosom, and the good
And great, and brave of all the valiant earth
Will own, nay more, delight to own thy worth.
To Dearborn then and spread the dreadful news,
While danger's hights more timid souls refuse."
Now Rodney bow'd his face towards the ground,
Until his bosom this expression found:
"The humble subject of thy will I stand,
For thy request to me is a command,
The which to disobey's the coward's task,
Mine is to do, fair one, and yours to ask.
Now Dora's lilly-touch with sweetest haste,
Her father's weapons on his servant placed,
And thus the fortunes of the hour decides;
For he, with gun in hand and nimble strides,
The speechless groups of villagers divides,
With cougar caution slowly out proceeds,
But faster goes as further he recedes,
Till sent'nels past, deep in the howling night
His footsteps sink, and he is out of sight.
While still suspense with throbbing int'rest waits,
And slow-speeched dolour instances relates
Of grisly dangers conquered by the fates;
Of savage bands, when border strength was small,
Beat back from many a forest-cabin's wall,
Of women moulding as their husbands fired,
And children watching where the foe retired;
Fair Dora leaning on her elbow, sate
Within her window, o'er the village gate
That eastward looked towards Dearborn, and prayed
That Rodney's flight in no mishap be stayed.
THE FAIR CAPTIVE.
The idle winds at dawn that strayed
Thro' wavy depths of joyous shade,
The early chirp of breeze-swung boughs,
The carol of the mountain brows,
The far off brawl of farms that broke
The drowsy silence of the morn,
And eager baying which awoke
Responsive to the flying horn,
In covert near, or echoing dell,
On Rodney's ear like omens fell;
For troubled Dearborn he had found
In need of all his garrison;
And now for Saville sadly bound
His pensive footsteps wander'd on.
Wild, strangely broken landscapes lay
Along his solitary way.
Soft gazing thro' the morning gray,
To right and left against the sky,
The border hills were stacked on high;
And as upon his eye they rose,
And shook their forests from repose,
Their brighter aspect on they drew,
A sober wear of filmy blue,
Like time's remotest visionary hue.
But Courage can no longer lie
With folded arms, when on his eye
There springs an opportunity.
Tho' beaten oft upon his walls,
And often tho' his banner falls,
Whene'er the day a breach supplies,
True Courage from defeat will rise,
And to renew the conflict flies.
Now in the lonely glen, or far
Amid the rocks whose shoulders bar
The toiling footsteps of young light,
Wild Rodney turns a nimbler flight.
No mountain stag, when clam'rous horns,
Him of the rousing danger warns,
Hath ever quicker brushed the dew,
Or fleeter leapt the deep shades thro',
Than Rodney fled with his sad tale
To 'larm the cotters in the vale.
His face with apprehension pale,
To many a woodman's open door,
The signal of disaster bore.
With gestures wild, to arms he called,
With words of war their hearts appalled,
And as the stout bands gathered;
He, warning others, flew ahead.
The settler on the doorsill rude
Of his poor forest-home, firm stood,
And as the news more wild would run,
He felt the triggers of his gun.
And glancing thro' the forests wide
To some near neighbor's 'gan to stride.
Thus Rodney from the forests drew
To meet the battle—not a few.
And as the corn-fields raised a shout,
And hills and valleys emptied out,
Bold hearts, that would the rescue try,
The hurried glance of many an eye;
The ceaseless pacing to and fro
Of those who waited; and the slow
And guarded accent of each tongue
That marked the speakers, them among,
Disclosed how thick that Peril hung
Her storm-swelled billows in the sky,
And troubled Peace's canopy.
The vale fermenting, Rodney left,
As lion-wild of young bereft;
And tho' the wasty forests wheeled
A speed that would have shamed the steeled
And wildest travel of the horse,
That snuffs up strength and leads the course.
By distant lodge and lone abode,
Where not a rudest fence, nor road,
A mark of civilization made
Within the vast primeval shade,
Untiring as the wind he strode.
Miles off a weary hill upon,
His early footsteps met the sun.
His eyes as earnest as the streaks
Of light that dashed along the peaks
In living crimson; far away
The nook sequestered did survey,
'Mid which his fated Saville lay.
A faint smoke rose, and slowly curled
In pensive wreaths against the sky,
And drifting farther off on high,
Like visions of the glory-world;
Hung sadly on the distant shore
Of indistinctness; then passed o'er,
Now dimly seen, now seen no more.
What apprehensions thrilled him now!
What dread conjectures clenched his brow
Had Saville just from calm repose
Awakened? Or had pluming foes
Her cheerful homes in ashes lain,
And heaped her sacred hearths with slain?
The dilatory smoke seem'd born
Of blazing plenty's stirring morn,
Or rolling from a famished fire,
That had in its devouring ire
Licked up all life that near it lay,
And turned to eat itself away.
Down from the hights his way along,
From rock to rock, till lost among
The lofty woods that bowed and sighed,
He turned with yet untiring stride;
And from the intervening vale,
Emerged and stood aghast and pale.
Lo! all his hopes had crumbled to the dust;
Saville had fallen in the direful fight;
And from devouring Ruin's fire-jaws thrust
Her poor remains, disgorged by sickened night
In morning's lap, yet steamed an ember-smould'ring sight.
Coal heaps where homes once stood, and bodies charred,
Of innocence and beauty in the heaps;
Scalped heads from love's keen knowledge even barred,
By savage battle's hands; and little steeps,
Where wound the village paths to field or wood,
Made red and slippery with kindred blood,
Were sights that filled the hero's saddened eyes;
The tributes gathered by hostilities.
Ah! how destruction's devastating hand
There fell upon delights! How his eyes scanned
With gorgon glee, the ghastly path he made
Thro' Peace's bow'rs within the western shade!
And like a jackal at the lion's side,
There Folly laughed to see her fallen pride.
Lo! now the Champion bends his daring brow,
And thro' the ruins plods pond'ringly slow;
A sob suppresses, sighing, "Me! ah, me!
O, Dora! fairest Dora! where is she?"
A low'ring cloud encamps around his soul,
And sorrow's big rain down his troubled cheek doth roll.
A tiny heel-print leaving, lo! he spies,
In which there here and there a torn spray lies;
A flash of joy light'nings in his eyes.
The way it moves, with breathing hushed he views,
And eager as a rolling flood, pursues.
Thro' dense shades leaning, now he threads along,
He gains commanding hills, high woods among.
With fearless steps, divides the lowly vale,
And like a mountain hart, the rocks beyond doth scale.
Of how he sped for eager miles away;
How strange scenes filled the melancholy day,
Of how the rustle of some waste-fed herd,
How plantive woods that piped and chirped and stirred;
Or how the distant cat'ract's pensive moan
Alarmed or moved him, cannot here be shown;
But on in wild pursuit he ponders still,
And stands at sundown, on an oak-brow'd hill,
When solemn night comes on with noiseless tread,
And o'er the landscape doth her rayless mantle spread.
Not many paces had the night come on
Blund'ring with sable steps, when still, upon
A log sat Rodney in despondent mood;
When, lo! a light approached him in the wood.
"What!" arising, cries he, in an undertone,
"Is this which haunts me in these wilds alone?"
And quick aside he noiselessly steals,
To where a denser shade his halt conceals;
When two old women of the skulky bands,
Mope by with pots of water in their hands.
Torches they bear, upon their way to shine,
In oil steeped, and riven from the pine.
He marks their movements with an eager eye,
Their way pursues, and waits discovery.
So when some mastiff thro' the sleeping folds,
A stranger passing, loiteringly, beholds,
He waiting lies, or follows crouching low,
The errand of the visitor to know;
When, if in thieving he his hands invest,
A roaring chastisement will him arrest.
Now where beyond the vale a cliff ascends,
Around whose base an unknown river bends,
A smoking camp the peering watcher spies,
And warlike satisfaction lights his eyes.
Beneath the stooping boughs he can behold
The busy squaws swarm'd round by warriors bold.
Then in the rocks, a score of yards away,
He like a crouching lion eyes his prey.
"Oh, Heav'n!" he gasps, and turns his painful eyes
From where in hideous hands his Dora lies,
To raving lusts a fair and tender prize,
Fair as a moon that o'er the night's face steals,
And gaping rocks and grizly wastes reveals,
The sweet and patient face of Dora shone
Upon these scourges of the wilds unknown.
The rabble now in high confusion runs,
Their knives the warriors grapple, now their guns.
Claim the fair triumph ere the game decides,
While shouting might the opposing voice derides.
Soon other methods they to conquest choose,
This one or that the tiny captive woos
With wild expressions of languishing love,
Like demons longing for the light above.
With heated eyes they stare into her face,
Drag her soft bosom in a rough embrace;
Their beads display, their painted head-gear show;
Like satyrs gibber, and like monsters blow.
Sweet as the vespers of some plaintive stream,
Or as the sounds in a mid-summer's dream,
Dora lisps something with her fair hands clasped,
When, "Ah, my God, she prays!" wild Rodney gasped.
The camp-fires glare upon her lifted hands,
And on her wrists disclose the bloody bands.
When, in the night, the hero thrusts his form,
Fierce as the lightning-arm that strikes the storm.
A stalwart warrior hands the pleading maid,
And drags her roughly thro' the darkling shade,
While to her tender remonstrance replies
A monster's scowl, and laughter mocks her cries.
The fiery watcher scans the dark field o'er,
And finds a smooth way straight his feet before.
Now all his strength he in his poised arm flings,
The impatient moment checks its onward wings;
Till like an eagle dropping from the skies,
Right on the howling band the swift avenger flies.
A flash of steely lightning from his hand,
Strikes down the groaning leader of the band;
Divides his startled comrades, and again
Descending, leaves poor Dora's captor slain.
Her, seizing then within a strong embrace,
Out in the dark he wheels his flying face;
His victims leaves to struggle with surprise,
And like a phantom thro' the forest flies.
She, brave as steel, against his bosom lies;
Gasps, "Rodney, is it you, or but a dream!
Oh, have you come! Oh, are things what they seem?"
He speaks not, but, with stalwart tenderness
Her swelling bosom firm on his doth press.
Leaps like a stag that flees the coming hound,
And like a whirlwind rustles o'er the ground.
Her locks swim in dishevelled wildness o'er
His shoulders, streaming to his waist or more;
While on and on, strong as a rolling flood,
His sweeping footsteps part the silent wood.
Now low beneath the list'ning boughs he leant,
Now thro' the tow'ring upland swifter bent,
And on a hill, where in her gentler sway,
The open sky lent vision one dim ray,
He pausing stood, to cast a look around,
And catch, if possible, some warning sound.
But all was still; the wide world was asleep,
Save that a waking night-wind there did creep.
Then Dora, like a heroine fair and true,
Cried, "Rodney! Rodney! Ah, I know 'tis you."
"Yes, Dora," lisps the Champion, and applies
His bloody knife to loose her painful ties;
When, like a bird that mounts on airy wing,
To dash into the light of joyous spring,
She rose, she fluttered to his strong embrace,
With streams of joy pouring down her upturned face.
Heaven might envy such a scene as this,
Since angels ken no more of perfect bliss
Than, when disaster and a direful day
Conspire to lead a fair young life away
In captive chains, to red-eyed lusts a prey,
Is felt by him whose fearless hand rescues,
Tho' howling danger on his devious path pursues.
Miles further on the twain in converse stand,
Where depth on depth of rayless wastes expand;
Together lean, and on their lone way peer,
Listen, to catch night's voices; but hear
Their hearts leap only, and the footfalls weird,
That round the anxious lonely heart are always beating heard.
From gaping wounds much Rodney's strength has flown;
Against a tree he sets his rifle down,
Submits to Nature's soft compelling sway,
And there concludes to bide returning day.
His blanket winds his manly form around,
And spreads his weary length along the ground.
"Here, Dora," then he speaks, "rest on my arm,
My life shall stretch between you and all harm;
Your frail and much worn strength some rest must have,
Or you'll escape the foe to find a grave."
No word speaks Dora, but her timid eyes
Survey the spot where her defender lies;
Then as a lamb when prowling wolves appear,
The horned defender of the folds will near,
She 'proaches Rodney; stands in trustful mood
And looks around her in the dismal wood.
Reluctant now, and innocently shy,
She kneels upon her turfy couch close by,
Her hands extend, so delicately white,
In earnest prayer unto the God of Night,
In grace Divine upon her to descend,
And o'er her guardian to in gentle mercy bend.
Then in his bosom nestles with deep sighs
That bring great drops of sadness to his eyes.
"Oh sleep, descend, and seal thy lovely sight!"
Said Rodney in his heart; "no harm this night
Can thee befall. And when the op'ning day
Shall spread her gentler guidance on our way,
My life shall guard the way before thy feet;
Tho' dangers thronging thick, await us there to meet."
The bending heavens drop a tear and sigh,
Old forest sent'nels spread their shelter nigh,
And night winds burthened with their heavy dews,
Strip off their chillness, and their soft sounds use,
While in deep musings sits the pensive hour
And fills composure's urn in slumber's quiet bower.
Robing the hills in light and beauty, now
A late moon hangs upon yon mountain's brow,
Looks stilly on the world's round sleeping face,
Then veiled in silver clouds withdraws with queenly grace.
Now Dora wakes from strange and fitful dreams,
The brightest rival of the bright moon's beams.
Soft light between the parting branches steals,
And Rodney's stern, still, manly brow reveals.
In him who slumbers, one can better read
The master passions and the thoughts which lead;
For, then the face, obedient to no call
Of shrewd deceit, shows nothing false at all;
But on the features silent truth doth write
Her plainest letters, in their plainest light.
Thus, sighing, looked the fair young frontier maid
Into the sleeper's open face, and said:
"What deep marks there hath hardship's plow-share laid?
Reserve how manly there! What self-control!
What resolution! Ah a man of soul!"
Then, as some bird that hails the bloom-crowned spring,
O'er sunny meadows spreads her wayward wing,
And joyous flits where all the woodlands sing;
Dora, as wayward, lifts her lovely mouth,
Sweet as the dewy blossoms of the South;
On Rodney's forehead parts the tangled hair,
And gently leaves affection's impress there.
He wakes; and straightway Dora whispers: "Look
How yonder moon lights up this lonely nook
With silver glory! Could I but forget
Dear Saville, and the scenes that haunt me yet,
Rapt fancy here would build a wild retreat,
And gladly linger in her forest seat."
Then Rodney, rising: "Day is almost here,
For now the Seven Stars do disappear;
So, think not, Dora, o'er the past to brood,
For loneliness abhors a theme of blood;
The day may o'er your sorrows brightness fling;
The saddest Winter hath a joyous Spring.
Hope on, for this sweet dream I had to-night:
I stood high on a farm-surrounded hight,
Where fruitful hills rose round the even view,
Not indistinct, but robed in charming blue.
There, sober herds in peaceful order strayed,
And tinkling folds enliven'd the evening shade.
Love's pensive reed wound the fair vales along,
Or sauntered leisurely his flocks among.
Now I reclining on my elbow leant,
To sweet winds list'ning as they came and went,
And tuned their many stringed pleasurement;
When, o'er me bending, ere I saw from where,
An angel stood in golden waves of hair
Half drowned. Regarding me with care, she drew
Nearer, kissed my forehead, and upward flew."
Then spake the angel of the hero's dream:
"Surely some happy token that doth seem,
And, could we but unveil the mystery,
And now discover the vast yet to be,
Some future bliss we both in it might see."
And with evasive sweetness now she turns
To where the mournful waste, her Saville's ashes urns.
Much she relates, and Rodney sorrowing hears,
Sometimes with groans responsive, sometimes tears.
The waiting town in deep suspense she shows,
While brake and fen are howling with her foes.
With heavy countenance and long drawn sighs,
Danger asserts her reign in valor's eyes;
The women weep, and pray, and tear their hair,
And raise a storm of turbulent despair.
Children and women now are barred in doors,
Without, the heavy footed tumult roars,
And loud is heard the bloody-handed fray.
The townsmen struggle, but are swept away.
Out in the storm the screaming children fly,
And frantic mothers follow where they fly,
But this on Rodney's soul doth saddest stay
Dora is dragged a captive in the wilds away.
Fair Dora ended here, and Rodney rose,
Walked from the boughs that did their rest enclose,
And said: "Let's journey, yonder comes the morn;
See! how the mountains laugh the vanquished night to scorn!
And hand in hand they meet the bright-eyed day,
As on to Dearborn Rodney leads his lovely prize away.
FORT DEARBORN.
Fort Dearborn is a strong and goodly place,
And o'er the frontier looks with valiant face
To greet the hostile tread of savage harm,
With tongue of thunder and an iron arm.
Far up he stands, on a commanding ground,
With grizly turrets rising high around:
Block houses rude protect the outer posts,
Where pass the sentries quick before the camping hosts.
Here, erst, as eagle drives the trembling dove
O'er meadows broad, to shelt'ring cliffs above;
Proud Black Hawk rose, stern monarch of the wood,
The red Napoleon of Solitude,
And drove young civilization from the West,
To fly and hover in loud Dearborn's breast;
Till peace returning, with a gentle hand,
Beckoned her forth again to plant the flow'ry land.
Long since the Nation's battle-arm had cleared
Her skirts of border outrages; and reared
By daring hands, the settler's cabin stood,
By every stream and in the mighty wood;
Since labor found in ease's arms repose—
This strong avenger of his race arose;
And vindicating, or for woe or weal
The red-man's homes, unsheathed the battle steel,
And made the border throat, alas! his bloody logic feel.
He saw neath mammon's desecrating tread,
The turf-green dwellings of the sacred dead.
The forest sachem, and the honored sire,
No more, within their lofty homes, awoke the fire
Of burning council in the patriot breast;
His sun sunk now forever on the wigwam-smoking West.
His leaping streams with cascade sadness mourned,
His fleet canoe was from its moorings turned,
His squaws and children bade their fields adieu,
To starving on their tearful way pursue;
And bloody-armed aggression followed where they flew.
Oh! who can then approach the chieftain's shade,
With ought but honor, e'en tho' he was made
To tear his heart from ev'ry tend'rer tie,
And to his loved ones with an arm of hostile succor fly?
Great hero, peace! Thou and thy thousand braves,
Too weak to stand, too proud to e'er be slaves,
On valor's lips, shall to the list'ning years
Be told: and urned in woman's love and tears,
Thy name to Time's remote end carried down,
Shall treasured be and claimed, by high Renown.
As some fierce comet rises in the West,
With locks of flame—and in deep crimson drest—
Swims ominously up a troubled sky,
With fury stationed in his fiery eye;
While panting superstition drops a tear,
Prophetic looks, and thinks Time's end is near;
So, in Migration's pathway thou didst rise,
The flaming terror of the border skies,
And so aggression looked on thee with fearful eyes.
Young morn descending from her Eastern tour,
Now on the mountains chased a panting show'r;
The vap'rous slumbers of the valleys broke,
And to the waking fields a sweet breath'd greeting spoke.
On wings of song, enliv'ning cheer went round,
O'er sad-voiced woods by Autumn suns embrowned,
And o'er farm-studded vales, with here and there
An orchard neat, that crowned some rustic's care,
And friendly cot, beside the hillside stream,
The rude ideal of his glory dream.
Then, in a gate that looked from Dearborn West,
Sir Maxey stood, and thus his soul exprest:
"My Dora! Oh, my Dora! Where is she?
Torn from my care, oh, saints, how can it be!
To pine away in desert wastes and die,
Or feed the savage lusts that on her breast may lie.
My only Dora! Would I ne'er had been;
Or that I never had my angel seen!
Oh, my life's flower, doomed to droop and faint,
Where ling'ring exile mocks thy lone complaint!
Bereavement's hand poured out my grief to full,
And gave me sorrow from a ghastly skull;
When from my side, that one who shared my cares,
The burden-bearer of my weighty years—
Was borne away, my home to light no more!
E'en then Hope whispered of a sainted shore.
But tongueless sits Despair, dark-plumed with dole,
And strikes her painful beak into my soul!
When something to my sad heart seems to say,
"'Thy Dora pines in desert wilds away.'"
Two captains who upon their steeds had sate,
And heard him thus lamenting in the gate;
Now putting spurs, together eager cry:
"Withhold thy woeful 'plaint, where chivalry
Will test his strength. Say to us, aye, oh Sire,
And we will rescue Dora ere the day expires."
"Aye," cries Sir Maxey, "hear a father's vows;
Who rescues Dora, hath her for a spouse,
And purse of gold besides. Now, Westward fly,
And haste thy search, for we have this surety,
Of him, the only one who scaped the foe,
Her captors on a Westward way did go."
Swift as the shadows of a flying cloud,
From Dearborn forth now rode the soldiers proud;
But ere their morn of glory had begun,
High in their brightest sky, appeared a brighter sun.
Rodney came leading Dora from a wood,
And in their presence like a vision stood.
Their steeds they reined, they made a martial bow;
On Rodney gazed, awed by his valiant brow;
Glanced then at Dora, and together sighed:
"Whose she shall be, the future must decide!"
But ere their admiration found a tongue,
She passed them by the village trees among.
"My life no more embraces pure delight,"
Sighs one, "With that fair maiden out of sight!"
The other echoes. "My life's shine is o'er,
If I must see that beauty rare no more!"
" But," then the other mourns, "her father vows,
That who rescues her hath her for a spouse!
When, if the valiant task hath now been done
By yon stern slave, our prospects darken neath an eclipsed sun."
"A slave contend," his friend indignant spoke,
"In love's fair lists, and wear a master's yoke!
A servant dog, a stalwart negro clown,
Unhorse a knight, the queen of love to crown?
Nay, thanks to Jove, the negro's proper sphere,
Is by him wilfully abandoned ne'er,
His longings suited to his station are;
For faithfulness he craves a master's care,
And craves no more; he stoops a bashful face
From azure looks, and love's white-arm'd embrace.
Born to be ruled, kind nature seals his breast
'Gainst Cupid's darts and Hymen's visions blest.
In him ambition's merest insolence,
And chivalry is brazen impudence."
"Between us then," the other aptly cries,
"The open list, of flow'ry conquest lies,
And let the god's to excellence award the prize."
Now, Dora turning from the perilous wild,
Ran to a waiting father's long embrace,
And kissed the streams of joy from his face.
Brave Dearborn shouted o'er the rescued child,
Till loud rejoicings from his iron throat,
Rolled o'er the wastes and shook the hills remote.
Round after round the cheering cannon rung,
Old Solitude for once had found a tongue,
And spoke responsive, her deep lone retreats among.
All day the eyes of pleasure sparkled bright,
Around the evening hearth the circling news gave light;
The hand of valor, beauty's fair hand shook,
And joy beamed forth in age's sober look.
The tragic fate of Saville hindered not,
So much was sorrow in their mirth forgot.
Lo! where yon gloomy walls ascend on high;
Whose dismal windows meet the passing eye,
Where Memphis rises in her steepled pride,
And gazes on fair Mississippi's tide,
Where Memphis, robed in glitt'ring wealth doth rise,
The boast of Tennessee, the pride of Southern skies.
Turn there thy foot, thou who hast wandered long
Thro' life's sad ways, and by the haunts of wrong;
Thou who hast heard of mammon hardened souls,
Who drank iniquity from brimming bowls,
Or who hast dreampt of Slavery's grinding car,
Mounted by Crime, and dragged by dogs of war;
Followed by Famine, whose skeleton hand
Compels submission from a trembling land;
While empty Ignorance's idiot smile,
The hard-gleaned tribute is, to custom vile:
Turn there thy foot, thou who hast heard or read
Of virtue, chained to lust's infamous bed;
Pause at the door! The keeper comes! I hear
His footsteps on the stony floor anear!
The slow key grates, bolts move, oppressed I feel,
The sullen prison opes its jaws of steel;
And in the Hell of Slavery aghast I reel.
Among the sable inmates now I wend
My way, and they in fervent aspect bend
Their faces in the dust, cry, "Massa!" "Lord!"
But their bright tearful eyes speak more than cry or word.
They kiss their haughty keeper's iron hand,
Pursue his way, or round him suppliant stand.
Ah! Christian, canst thou bear it? Turn thine eyes
To where yon sorrow burdened mother lies!
She upward looks, and wrings her anguish, see!
Say to her, "Woman, oh, what aileth thee?"
And thou shalt hear the tearful answer sad,
"Two children, once to cheer my life I had;
The one was three years old, a little girl,
Her brow was clustered o'er with many a curl,
Her eyes were bright, and blue as Summer's skies!
But oh, my sweet faced darling!" loud she cries,
"My babe! Dear Willie! Oh, my two-month's old!
Was from my bosom snatched away, by cold
And cruel hands—methinks I hear his cry—
To pine without a mother's care and die!
Behold that mother, Christian, she is hushed
By yon stern keeper's glance, e'en though her soul is crushed.
And yonder see hoar age from friendship torn,
And from the goodly scenes where he was born!
Burdened with grief, he leans toward the grave,
And drags his chains, a poor unpitied slave.
This is the slave pen, reader, this the place
Where boasting Slav'ry drives the sable race,
To wait, as trembling sheep the slaughter wait,
Their buyer's entrance at yon iron gate.
Here tender hands of tearful remonstrance,
Entreating age's humble upward glance,
The sudden out-bursts of the grief torn heart,
The infant's 'plaint, from parent arms apart,
The maniac's wail and gaunt-eyed hunger's sigh,
That e'en doth bring a tear in Heaven's eye,
Cannot in man's cold heart, awake dead sympathy.
Ah, Tennessee, hast thou a Hermitage,
Where dwel'st a laurelled hero and a sage?
Great sage! Proud leader of the daring band,
Who loosed red havoc from the battle hand
On Blount's poor fort, till hardy sea-worn tars,
With crime acquainted, and athirst for wars,
Withdrew, their heads hung, from the scenes of blood,
Or o'er the mangled inmates weeping stood!
Let Silence rest her hand upon thy mouth,
And cease thy boasts, Oh, vain Chivalric South!
Say to thy mem'ry, "Ah, lead me not back
In yon deep ghostly past, with visions black!"
Thou may'st forget that from their brake-bound seat,
As free, true hearts, as e'er to freedom beat,
Were dragged in chains, fastened by Slavery's laws,
Or chased by bloodhounds, from whose gaping jaws,
Dropped human gore, to stain the sacred soil
That bloomed and grew beneath the hand of toil.
'Thou may'st forget, in a repentant soul,
The wigwams of the wasted Seminole;
And in the world's great temple, at the shrine
Of patriotism, kneel neath hands divine.
Lo! where yon whirling to and fro
Of men in business tide; doth so
Intoxicate with eagerness;
And in the eddy of voices hear,
The shrill cry of the auctioneer!
"Agoing! going!" rises clear.
While crowds of anxious list'ners press,
And doubt and gaze, and sigh and guess;
Shrewd speculation, in the face
Of business looks: his quick eyes trace
The way of vantage, till he make
A fortune, or a fortune break.
Suspense's trembling speech is heard,
For now the crier, word by word,
Sinks lower, lower, "going, gone,"
The bargain 's clasped, the work is done;
And now he calls another one.
There, rising as the wave-dashed rock,
Firm in his tow'ring scorn;
There, standing on the buyer's block,
See that sad form, but not forlorn.
In other climes was he not born?
Yes, where yon Western bowers spread
Their green luxuriance o'er the head
Of bare-armed labor, and the sound
of rural sports, the long year round,
Is heard on care's enlivened way;
He once hath known a brighter day.
There where young industry's strong arms
Hath in the forests hewn down farms,
And in the vale his pastures spread,
And by the waters clean flocks fed;
Full harvests reaped upon the hills,
And in the valleys built his mills;
There, once he mingled, true and brave,
A home-guard loved, and faithful slave.
'Tis Saville's Rodney, Dora's friend,
A faithful servant to the end.
And do you ask why he is sold?
I answer, then you shall behold.
There is a famous spring by Dearborn's walls,
Whose rush bound wand'ring to the heart recalls,
Of frontier daring, olden memories,
That oft bring brightness, oft tears to the eyes.
Here erst the Sachem, in his plumy pride,
Beheld his clans reposing at his side,
When on the tongue of forest councils burned
The words of war, or, when, in peace returned
From weary hunting grounds, they cheerful lay,
To watch the painted face of dying day.
Here civilization met his savage foe,
And with an arm of lightning laid him low,
And on the open hights of triumph stood,
Clasping this lucent treasure of the wood.
Here now the peaceful villagers repair,
To soothe the burdened ear of cumb'rous care.
Lo! yonder lab'rer, from his field comes by,
And nears with quick'ning steps and brightened eye.
Here trysting whispers linger in the shade,
Where rustic courtship clasps his bashful maid,
And sober converse, to the scene endeared,
Tarries till vespers soft are in the village heard.
Hail thou best blessing of the varied train,
That cheers life's journey thro' earth's weary plain!
Nectar for gods, and bright wines for the king,
But draughts for lab'rers from the running spring.
Now Dora stood at this ancestral spot,
And list'ning to the waters sing, forgot
That she was waiting for her running over pot.
Loud jovial labor in the field was done,
And sounds of mellow night-fall had begun,
The swallow told her stories in the eaves,
The groaning wain creaked home beneath its sheaves,
The swain garrulous in his empty weal,
Debated with the hills, till sudden wheel
Of rooky clamor from the elms, made
His hair stand up, till he had crossed the shade.
The shrill cock blew, the hillside barn behind;
And crow belated, asks the sent'nel wind,
Which way was nearest to his roosting mates.
The reaper homeward sang thro' slamming gates,
2
And o'er the sheep-cote woods a moon hung pale,
Like some lone shepherdess that hears a lover's tale.
Now Dora wond'ring what the waters said,
Leaned o'er the rocks and lingered in the shade,
Till Rodney, standing at her elbow, spake:
"You to obey, this only chance I take,
Now to my aching heart the secret ope;
May I to hear some pleasant tidings hope?"
Then Dora answered, "Oh! my faithful slave,
In my distresses well didst thou behave.
The life of me, and of my father too,
Are to thy manly, brave exertions due;
But thou hast kindled, by thy interest,
The fires of jealousy in many a breast.
Hence, thou art sold. The two commanders here
Have followed thee with bitterness severe,
Till for thy safety, father has thee sold,
Away to Memphis, Tennessee, I'm told.
But Rodney, bear it! In God's strength be bold!"
IN THE HOUSE OF THE AYLORS.
Where Summer crowns with orange blooms
The land of pines and cypress glooms;
We wander forth by field and lane,
In woody shades with plaintive strain.
Ye lonely bayous catch the sound!
Ye languid fen-brakes pass it round;
Ye pensive hills your silence break,
And let the mournful echo wake!
Of errant Pride's chivalric deeds,
Of frowning Caste's unholy creeds,
And their worse, sin-begotten heir,
Black Slavery, a lay I bring,
And of her painted crimes dare sing.
When Satan, hurled down from the skies,
O'er this terrene his fallen eyes
In search of ruin hotly cast,
Hell-bound, but harm-bent to the last;
Those shores of ours, where Mexic's Sea
Holds watch with the Atlantic, he
Touched not in his tremendous flight;
For, stooping there, the sons of light
He spied encamped in battle form
Around a captive ocean storm,
From which his equinoctial bent,
Wheeled short, and further northward went.
Sweet land! conceived in chivalry,
Brought forth in wild adventure, reared
In conquest's arm, to rivalry
And old ambitions long endeared!
The fairest of thy sister train
And fairer than thy mother Spain,
Thou art of all the world a lone,
Lone beauty of the fragrant zone.
Thy sisters in their lurid North
Surpass in wealth but not in worth;
More native grace hast thou than they,
Less wrathful winds and winters gray.
Thou hast no somber-low'ring skies,
In which the white-winged tempest flies;
Where shiv'ring woods aloud bewail,
All riven by the angry gale,
Their cheerless, torn, and chilly state,
Like empty beggars at your gate.
But such thy distant sisters know,
Within their wintry wastes of snow,
And hills as speechless as the tomb,
And sullen plains of voiceless gloom.
But girdled in thy summer zone,
As a maid who waits her lover,
Or to meet him walks alone
Under twilight's dewy cover,
Thou dost come to meet each year,
Always smiling, never drear.
And can it be, that thou, this goodly land,
Could foster slavery with a jealous hand?
Yea, when less comely States had seen the stain,
Of crimson guilt upon their skirts too plain,
They shook the galling traffic from the clutch
Of commerce, and forbade her further such.
But thou, when banished Slavery left the North,
In wretchedness and shame, to wander forth,
A heartless strumpet, seeking e'en a shed;
Thou then did'st take her in and share thy bed!
And can'st thou wonder that thy hardened heart
Should make humanity's shoulders smart,
When to errantic crime thou wast a bride,
When Pagan barbarism wedded Roman pride?
Of him whose valor first inspired our strain,
A slave to Aylor bound we sing again.
The shady woodlands of his native West,
To him are not: in richer verdure drest,
A fairer aspect Florida presents,
But not more pleasure; that which most contents
A noble mind, the liberty to dare
And do, the man, he now no more can share.
To him what are luxurious verdure's sweets,
And cypress shades, and orange-bloom'd retreats;
When for once dear delights his heart now hopeless beats?
Lo! where yon hedge-bound fields beyond the way,
Wave on the view exuberently gay,
Exulting in their flow'ry excellence,
And clasping in their green embrace, a dense
Deep grove of sturdy pines whose solemn shade,
Has o'er delicious seats a curtain made;
There stood the Aylor house, when in its prime,
A brave old structure of that princely time,
When rank and title held unquestioned sway,
And humble worth to fam'ly pride gave way.
How often have I, turning to its bowers,
In dreams sat down and wasted pleasant hours.
How often traced its various changing scenes
Of blossom'd fields, bright lanes, and rolling greens!
This goodly mansion hath an olden fame,
And memories that urn full many a name
In honors bright and not a few in shame.
Here hoary tenants, who in turn await
Their scanty pensions at a master's gate;
These, and full many an ebon patriarch,
Of Afric's humble tribe, who wear the mark
Of bondage, tell in tales of cabin lore,
Sad things that run the eye with pity o'er.
Thus of the Aylor line we are informed:
"When erst colonial patriotism stormed
New England's early hights, and stretched the hand
Of burning eloquence o'er all the land;
And Puritanic piety, allured
By Siren Freedom to the wilds, endured
The long privations of the wilderness,
With all the unction of true holiness,
The Aylors mingled with the daring few,
Who in the tyrant's face the blade of battle drew.
With vict'ry flushed on fortune's swelling tide,
Young Aylor soon had won a lovely bride,
The fairest flower of New England's pride.
Ere long, embarked in love's light craft, they join
With oars of labor, and their hopes incline
To stem life's tide; to fortune's source explore,
And in the future near touch happiness' shore.
Soft are the winds that swell their first short sail,
And mild their skies, ne'er angered by a gale.
Glad waves arise to kiss their peaceful keel,
And from their prow bright silv'ry ripples steal,
New ambient hills their ravished vision thread,
New argent fields and tinkling valleys spread;
Love lends new relish as new scenes invite;
Hope points to others not yet on their sight,
And gently heaves the deep beneath their dove-like flight.
To them the world is one ovation grand,
Where fortune show'rs bright favors from her hand,
And fancy beckons to a blissful land.
Florida the inviting aspect shows,
And here full soon the Aylor mansion rose.
There, husbandry soon stooped to till the soil,
And ripened plenty filled the lap of toil.
Bright Spring on Winter's parting steps pursued,
With buds and flowers his ling'ring footprints strewed,
Her cornfields spread, and orchards in the dell,
And waited till the big rain's benediction fell.
Full, blue-eyed Summer, stately coming on,
With shouting harvests stood the hills upon;
The breath of wasting juices did inhale,
With bloomy cotton whitened in the vale,
Spread out the ripened cane along the steep,
And waving rice fields in the swamp did reap.
Then Autumn came, with sickle keen in hand,
And yellow sheaves beneath her arm; to stand
And with her mellow voice to fill the land.
The waning fields sank on the saddened view,
And melancholy hills were robed in blue.
Brown Autumn came, and at her solemn close,
The swarthy hands of labor found repose.
Then sports set in, and harmless games began,
And through the livelong snowless winter ran.
What cares had slaves to mar their peace with dole,
And shut the light of mirth out from the soul,
When life-long labor made them richer none—
When nothing earned was theirs when work was done?
What reasons they to look back with remorse,
When careful conduct made their state the worse
Or better none? Their lives were not their own;
Hence past and future were to them unknown.
Hard labor's respite came, and as it neared,
Their burdens lightened and their hearts were cheered.
Religion, work and pastime, all in turn,
They had; but art and science must not learn.
And yet, contentment these vast wants supplied,
And loaned the pleasures caste had them denied.
The mind that never grasped hypotheses,
Nor wandered in the maze of theories;
Nor toil'd thro' demonstrations intricate,
Nor groaned beneath old histories' vast weight,
Can best afford in other paths well known,
To seek for pleasures not so over grown
The last day's labor was a day of feast,
And toil-earned freedom for both slave and beast.
The groaning barns were filled from floor to eaves,
And all the barnyard stacked around with sheaves.
Then, when the last full load of ripened corn
Was gathered in, the master took his horn,
And mounted high upon the rounded pile,
Rode homewards, sounding, followed by a file
Of empty wagons; while a lusty band
Of slaves came shouting on at either hand.
The shorn fields sank forsaken on their view,
And as they nearer to the barnyard drew,
Slave cabins emptied out a roaring crowd,
And gabbling hillsides answered them aloud.
When shouts of triumph closed the boist'rous scene,
The master king, and mistress crowned a queen.
This edict then, thro' all her milder reign
Of hut-bound realms, awoke a glad refrain
In servitude's full heart. "Go waste the hours
As you may wish, good slaves; the time is yours
From now till blooming Spring shall come again,
And spread her painted sweets upon the plain."
They then set in with ev'ry setting sun,
And danced till they were tired of the fun.
Loud rang the fiddle on three strings or four,
But louder rang their feet upon the floor.
The music, started once, as well might cease,
For joy kept up the dance with lively ease.
Now all hands joined, their circling knew no bound,
Save that they paused to catch the music's sound;
And when caught, all hands joined around again,
They whirled away to overtake the strain.
Then, balanced all, they stood out pair and pair,
And trampled hugely down the flying air.
Thus on they strode till night's last watch had flown,
Or they had broke the smiling fiddler down;
Who, sweating like a hunter in the chase,
Dragged his bandanna o'er a hopeless face;
Sore puzzled, grinned, and chided, out of breath,
"Ah! darkies, will you dance a man to death?"
Long ran their joyance thro' the grateful years,
The slave as happy as his lord appears;
For then true guardian, the master deemed,
In all but rank his servants kindred seemed.
With him communing at the Paschal feast,
Where no distinctions met the humblest guest;
And with him at the nuptial altar kneeling,
His fervent prayer the holy union sealing;
He, round his dying couch, with sleepless care,
Life's comforts brought, and knew no pains to spare;
Leaned tearful o'er him till his latest breath,
And closed his faithful eyes to sleep the rest of death.
But Avarice, whose reign is rife with woe,
To earthly bliss the deepest venom'd foe,
In this proud mansion found a lurking place,
At first discovered as a youthful grace,
At last unveiling all her frightful face.
The air grew tainted from her baleful lungs,
And Discord there unloosed her howling tongues.
There Anger's raging thirst was slaked with blood
Drawn from the back of groaning Servitude.
From bad to worse the Aylor house went down;
In phrenzy's bowl adversities they drown,
Thro' halls of revel banished joys pursue,
Exhaust old pleasures, madly pine for new;
Chase wanton transports thro' the mazy dance,
And seek their wasted fortunes at the hand of chance.
Then feuds and murder hurry to the scene,
And fam'ly pride's dear bowers are there no longer green.
An orphan heir to violence and shame,
Now one lone Aylor, Mosher is his name,
Holds undisputed all his lawful claim.
The hand of love and beauty both he scorns,
With broken vows, his wanton rites adorns,
And in his mansion's every nook and hall,
With open lewdness holds high carnival.
This brief narration, with its changes fraught,
Hath us once more to meet with Rodney brought.
The cabin dance, the banjo and the song,
Are courted yet by Afric's humble throng.
They drown their sorrows in a sea of mirth,
And crush young griefs as soon as they find birth
Neath dance's heel; and on the banjo string
A theme of hope, that forces woe to sing.
But one is there, to them a stranger born,
Whose manly brow the marks of thought adorn.
The low inventions of poor darkened mind,
Can never in the threads of nonsense bind
This mental Sampson; tho' by Slav'ry shorn
Of rightful manhood, weakness he doth scorn.
The abject sons of Afric's injured race,
With cabin sports assay to cheer his face,
But all in vain; their silly means repel,
Instead of please, the comrade they love well.
He's with them, but not of them; for the light
Of freedom flashing on him once, his sight
Has trained beyond low Slav'ry's bounds to ken
The hights, that he who treads will long to tread again.
All day he labors, speaking scarce a word;
All night lamenting in yon groves is heard.
His ear no more the torrent's voice shall woo,
In deep shades musing long, or wand'ring thro'.
His winding horn no more shall urge the chase,
Where the proud Wabash doth his woods embrace!
No more the flying stag shall dash the spray,
And bend the hawthorn from his mountain way;
And in the blossom'd fields of yellow sedge,
In thickets brown, or in the briery hedge,
His wary spaniel shall no longer spring,
Nor whirring grouse, nor partridge swift to wing!
His fields are gone! Farewell, ye sports of yore!
Ye goodly seats on Mississippi's shore!
And home is gone! All that makes labor sweet—
His hearth is darkened, where he once did meet
Bright chirping mirth around hoar comfort's feet.
No loving eye shall on his threshold wait,
No little footfalls meet him in the gate!
No faithful yard dog to the fence shall come,
To leap, and wag, and tongue his welcome home!
Dear Western home, a tender, last farewell!!
No more shall Rodney in thy bowers dwell.
Lo, in the cane and cotton, far away,
He bends to toil thro' all the sultry day!
Now on his life a weary journey takes
Thro' regions where no day beam ever breaks.
"Oh, God!" he mourns along the pensive hills,
"The rayless gloom that now my bosom fills.
My life ends here! existence tho', may creep
Some further on, but now ambitions sleep!"
Thus, all night once, alone he sighed,
In lanes and fields and forests wide,
And strolling on, was lost from view,
A deep dense pine shade wand'ring thro'.
There, where a bright stream leaping downward,
Moaned o'er falls and rambled onward,
Like a waywardness of childhood,
Or a wild dream; thro' the wildwood,
And within a farthest recess
Of the forest's leafy stillness,
Where the damp boughs stoop'd and listened,
And the waters flashed and glistened,
Formed a fountain clear, still, blue, deep,
In whose breast heaved Beauty asleep;
There, while morn was just awaking,
Slumbers from her eye-lids shaking,
And her mountain stillness breaking,
With her first sweet music making;
There, with eyes upon the ground bent,
Yet he onward mourning slow went.
All the waking woods were merry,
But his heavy heart was dreary.
So in deepening shades he wandered,
Where this wild strange stream meandered;
Knowing not, in his sad musing
Where he went, blindly not choosing
This or that path, as he went on
With his eyes the ground still bent on.
In his heavy soul he muttered—
These words pensively he uttered:
"Ah! bleak Norway's churl may feel not
To complain against his cold lot,
When he never knew a better;
And the naked son of Afric,
Led about from youth to manhood,
In his desert haunt and wildwood;
By the bloody hand of Traffic,
May not groan to wear a fetter;
But to him whose soul doth cherish
Longings that can never perish,
Who his arms in fetters galling
Feels, while liberty is calling
To her citadel before him,
With her bright skies bending o'er him;
But to him, how hard the fate is!
Ah, to him how dark the state is!
Earth her every pleasure looses
To his eyes, and hope refuses
All attempts to mount on high,
To her dwelling in the sky."
While thus he mourned in this sad plight,
Hard by his way, deep out of sight,
A sudden mighty stir he heard,
Of many a flapping bough and bird.
He upward glanced a hurried eye,
When thro' the parting branches nigh,
Upon the brooklet's other side,
A living beauty, lo he spied!
In native sweetness clothed, she stood
And all her fair proportions viewed
With fawn-like timidness. She deemed
Herself unseen, but watchful seemed.
Alone within her soft retreat,
The liquid mirror at her feet
Returned her beauty to her eyes,
Till, warmed with innocent surprise,
She stood admiring. Now her hand,
As graceful as a fairy's wand,
She waved above the prattling stream;
Then gentle as a reaper's dream,
She shook down raven locks of hair,
Upon the morning's dew-sweet air.
In deeper shades she now withdrew,
But Rodney's eyes as fast pursue.
There, half concealed, she looks more fair,
And seems abashed, at e'en the air,
That scarcely breathes upon her there.
* * * * * * *
A stolen glance at her fair parts,
Stripped Rodney's bosom to the darts
That Cupid's cunning strength let fly,
Till, wounded thro' his dazzled eye,
He sighed for breath, his bosom held,
To hush its leapings as it swelled.
He shut his eyes to look no more,
But looked, worse wounded than before.
Then thought to turn and steal away,
And thought, and thought, but yet did stay.
Her beauty like a full round moon,
Uncovered in the branches, soon
Appeared as fair as e'er was seen
That lovely orb, green hills between.
Then, step by step on tip-toe poise
She stole, and ev'ry little noise
To her had eyes. Back she withdrew
Within the shade, and now in view
Again in all her beauty rose,
And full and clear stood list'ning, close
Upon the marge, where grasses sweet
And blushing flow'rets kissed her feet.
The wanton waves that played below,
With am'rous descant ceased their flow,
And with a strangely pensive speech,
The maid to tarry did beseech.
A moment gazing on the flood
With Eve-like innocence she stood,
And watched her perfect image there;
While lost within her flowing hair
Her small hand rambled. She had now
Plunged in the panting stream below;
Had not the sudden thickets stirred.
The breathless maiden, shrinking heard
Some farmer's lad, on errand soon,
Towards her pipe his morning tune,
Quick as the lark, that, song-hushed darts,
When her still brush some footstep parts,
She, hasty dressed, deep out of sight
Within the thick boughs took her flight.
Rodney pursued, not knowing why,
Tho' oft to turn back he would try.
A power in his feet that drew
Resistless as the wind that blew,
Kept him a going, fast or slow,
And where, or how, he did not know.
Glance after glance his dazzled view,
Worse dazzled as the maiden flew
Beyond him, and as on he bent,
He knew not what his bosom meant,
In drinking breath on breath so fast,
And being out of breath at last.
But now his secret pleasure turned;
Ah! in the distance he discerned
His master skipping onward too,
To keep the coy sight on his view.
Then, Rodney turned and stole away,
And toiling, mourned the live long day;
But Mosher Aylor, stern as fate,
Pursued, till thro' the Brentfords' gate
He saw the beauty pass from sight,
Like some sweet vision of the night.
Now Aylor passed a wretched day,
And night's hours went their wingless way.
On all his house he closed his door,
And in a phrenzy paced the floor.
With hands behind him clasped, he stood,
Or leaning, sat, in sullen mood,
And sighed, and groaned, and raved with pain,
And rose and paced the floor again.
Till midnight's silence reigned around,
His discontent had reached no bound;
From his vexed sea he saw no shore,
He never had thus felt before.
His wonted bowl, for him had lost
Its deep oblivion, and crost
By broken dreams, his fevered breast,
Refused the arms of balmy Rest.
In this sad plight, a hideous cheer
Before him stood! The haggard seer
Of Aylor's shrine of wickedness,
Has heard the accents of distress,
That broke night's stillness, and has come,
To move the trouble burdensome.
Now Aylor spoke, when him he saw,
On whom he long had looked with awe;
"Here Micah! Micah! Micah! here!
To my complaint, oh lend an ear.
This morning as I strolled the wood,
Deep thro' yon cypress solitude;
Where shores of sweetest green ascend,
And thick boughs in the waters bend;
Fair as the light, I saw a maid
Unclothe her beauty in the shade.
I never felt a sting so bright;
I ne'er saw such an earthly sight.
Not radiant May with her perfumes,
And songs, and show'rs, and painted blooms,
And streams of crystal cheerfulness,
Could vie with her in loveliness.
But, like a bird of gorgeous hue,
She vanished on my starving view!"
"Aye," cries the seer, "no doubt have I,
That the same bird which you saw fly,
Is the fair Creole visiting
At neighbor Brentford's watering.
She is a slave, a waiting maid,
Brought down from New Orleans, 'tis said,"
"A slave! a waiting maid! a queen
Why don't you say; for ne'er was seen
A fairer cheek of Saxon hue
Nor prouder eye of brilliant blue.
Phoo, pshaw! a slave! a waiting maid!
That light-beam sweet from Heaven strayed?"
Loud cries the Seer, "A slave I know!
And can be bought as I shall show,
Dispel the phantoms of thy brain,
And turn to thy right mind again;
You must be sick!" "No," Aylor cries,
"I'm dead in love!" The seer replies,
Go pass in rest this far spent night,
And by the time young morn's in sight,
I'll bring the news to set thee right."
Now, Aylor, half consoled, adjourned
His thoughts till morn, and then returned
With Micah, to the Brentford seat,
The owners of the maid to meet.
The room was darkened where they met,
And all was quiet, save the fret
Of restless boughs, and whisp'ring leaves,
That mingle o'er the ancient eaves.
Now Aylor speaks, "For gold! for gold!
Aye, you but say she will be sold,
And you shall have your price all told."
Awed by the speaker's fiery eye,
The strangers whisper this reply:
"If her we sell, of this beware
She must receive your special care,
Not as a slave of low degree,
But as a ward, descended free.
And this day's doings, ever keep
From earth a secret hidden deep;
For should the news, by any means,
Escape your lips to New Orleans,
And reach our aged father's ears,
'Twill grieve away his few frail years..
Know this, he loves Leeona more
Than all his children ten times o'er.
His frailty has a passion grown,
And each day more his love has shown,
Till she has to us all become
The bane of pleasure, hope and home—
The idol of his feeble days,
The object ever of his praise.
Here to this wat'ring near your home,
He with reluctance let her come.
Now from her keep the fact concealed,
That she is sold: for if revealed,
She'll pine away, and droop and die,
Or from your house attempt to fly.
By wary speech, the truth we'll mask,
If our aged father ask;
"What hath befallen me? Where's my dear?
Why hast thou left my Ona there?"
This said, they drew aside and spake,
Concerning what price they should take;
And when agreed, they answered bold:
"Two thousand dollars down in gold!"
And Aylor with triumphant eyes,
Threw them their gold, and seized his prize.
With trembling hands they count their gains,
In haste divide with heartfelt pains;
For well they know a sister's tears,
And sweat, and blood, their purses fill.
Ah! well they know a sister's years,
Must now float onward at the will
Of him, who with a shameless [ shamless ] cheek,
To buy the hand of love would seek.
The offspring of a father's crimes,
The bitter fruit of broken vows,
The charming bloom of hapless climes,
The growth of unprotected boughs;
Within the grasp of blighting lust,
A lovely ruin now is thrust.
What tho' a father's heart shall break,
In spite of race Caste, taught to ache,
And yearn thro' age's kinder years,
For those to whom Nature endears;
What tho' he wakes with deepest groans,
What tho' his sleep with anguish moans?
When his first sorrow's bitter blast,
By soothing words is guided past,
His law-owned brood, will run at last
Their race in peace; tho' doomed by spite,
A sister thro' the stormy night
Of bondage mourn, a sad, sad sight.
What tho' his grief shall bow his head,
And while from view all pleasures sink;
He of a Quadroon's injured bed,
In age's twilight stand to think,
And often weep beside her grave?
Society will whisper "Slave!"
His love was wayward, and his wing,
Waved wand'ringly in life's warm Spring.
He saw the Quadroon, and they loved—
He and Leeona's mother, moved
Liked sounds of some wild instrument
Touched by the wind, and sweetly blent
Their lives in lasting pleasurement.
But Dame Caste turned her iron face,
And coldly frowned upon their course;
And drove sad love from faith's embrace,
With all the heartlessness of force.
'Twas thus by social interest's sullen voice,
Another's hands was made to be his choice.
And thus it is that many a love has grown,
Where even Christians dare make it known.
Where Hymen oft in gorgeous aspect shows,
From true love blossoms not a single rose;
While out in fenceless wastes of Nature spring,
Discovered only in wild wandering,
The purest blooms of love, whose fragrant breath,
Live thro' all life and linger after death.
A sister's life is signed away,
Her brethren can no longer stay
To see her drink the bitter cup,
Which they with sorrows have filled up.
Leeona kisses them good-bye,
Regards them with a tearful eye,
And long entreats them to make known,
Why she must there be left alone.
And then sweet as the fair-eyed dawn,
When her light steps first brush the lawn,
She meekly looked in Aylor's face;
And artless as a timid fawn,
With all of innocence's grace,
She reached a trustful hand in his,
A hand as pure as lilly is,
And gently followed, till from view
Within the Aylor seat they slow withdrew.
Now twilight waned and evening still,
Darkened the vales, while from each hill
Around came soft and lulling sounds.
From just beyond the vision's bounds,
One voice was heard sweetest of all,
And pensive as a late rain's fall
Through Autumn leaves sad and lone
The fading forests make their moan.
This was Leeona's, poor girl, torn
Away from childhood's hopes to mourn.
Aylor, meanwhile in sullen mood,
On his piazza list'ning, stood
Roving thro' mental solitude.
Full well he knew what Ona meant,
By her sad walks, and loud lament,
For he had caused it all.
His overtures of stark deceit,
She'd spurned and fled to this retreat,
To whisper in her Father's ear,
Complaints He ever stoops to hear.
So Aylor in Remorse's thrall,
Walked sullen thro' his ghostly hall,
Within a nook of vine shades went,
And o'er his thoughts in silence bent.
In Ona's heart though sad, there burned
A hatred deep, for all his aims;
And his entreaties, he discerned,
Were wind, and fanned the angry flames.
To her what were the Brazil's spicy breath,
Or India's sweet pride,
If life were fettered with a ghastly death,
That pained but never died?
This night too, Rodney wand'red forth to stroll,
And to the list'ning groves impart his soul.
The vision bright, that charmed his wayward dream,
Within this wood, beside the peaceful stream;
Returned when here he lingered. Now her home
To make at Aylor's she a slave had come,
And Rodney knew it not; for by caste barred,
He could not pass where wrong was standing guard.
But love hath ways that are past finding out,
And secret triumphs, that how brought about,
No one can tell. Love hath an open eye,
And watches little signs that others would pass by.
"I saw her here," thought Rodney to himself,
"'Twas here she flitted by coy as an elf,
And in yon boughs her disappearance made,
When wanton sounds disturbed the morning shade.
Could I but tell her. Ah! but fate forbids!
Poor Hope can't open there her dazzled lids.
Yet I did see her, oh, I saw her here!
And in my dreams she still doth bright appear.
Thank Heav'n there's none too crushed by wrong to see,
And beauty's the beholder's property."
But now his hope thro' darker clouds declines,
And thus within the sounding shade he pines:
"No more to me ere life's short race be run,
Shall e'er arise another happy sun.
How shall I break the vision that me wounds,
And drive it from my recollection's bounds!
A poor seafarer, and his star gone down,
From tempest-arms while clouds of heaven are thrown,
And wave-tossed danger wails to seize his bark;
Am I, now drifting thro' a wreck strewn dark.
Oh, why kind Heaven, plant within my breast,
A blooming sorrow—love begot unrest?
Content to bear tho' let me journey on,
Light yet may break life's dismal waste upon!
Now in the cypress gloom, he hushed his strain,
And homeward turned his mournful face again.
Eavesdropper winds, on errands from the South,
In sandals tripping, and with dewy mouth,
To Rodney turned, and whispered in his ear,
The broken murmurs of a sweet voice near.
A maiden sat within the fragrant shade,
And to the night this lamentation made:
"This life is all unreal as a dream,
Here woes chase woes, like waves upon a stream.
Back yonder, just within the past I see
A bow'ry home, where hands do becon me,
To join the buoyant hearts of childhood's train,
And tread the blossom'd paths of hope again.
But here I am, away from home and friends,
While o'er my head a cliff of sorrow bends,
Strange bodings haunt my pillow in the night,
And day uncovers terror to my sight.
But, whom I saw last eve within this shade,
Methought had by this time another advent made.
A strong companion of a troubled heart,
He seemed; oh, that to him I could impart
My woes; oh, that I could but see him once!"—here
She raised her eyes, and lo! the man was near.
Away she started at a frightened pace,
With red abashment kindling in her face.
Oh, was it real, could all this be true?
Was that the nymph, O what must Rodney do?
"Stay, maid!" he cries, "my wounded soul implores,
Stay, fair one, stay! until my tongue explores
The hidden longings of a leaping heart;
Hear what a wounded spirit would impart."
Beyond the fence, and near the spring lawn gate,
Leeona paused, the speaker's steps to wait.
With timid mein, and from the other side,
Now Rodney leans, where blossomed vines divide,
And gathers words with anxious haste to tell,
The blushing beauty that he loves her well.
She answers with a sigh, and turns away,
And with her straggling locks begins to play,
Looks up again to speak, and only sighs,
But dazzles with the language of her eyes.
Then Rodney sighs, and leans, her hand to reach
And press, that he may aid his falt'ring speech.
Her fingers touch him with a conquering thrill,
Her eyes could wound, her timid touch can kill.
He murmured something, what, no mortal knew,
And pressed the gate ajar, and stumbled thro';
And as Leeona sauntered slow away,
He whispered, but unheard, "Oh! angel, stay!"
"Oh, moon, speed on thy coming," then he said,
As blushing light beheld the tall slow maid,
Walk from the boughs, towards the mansion rise,
And flash around her over-pow'ring eyes.
Now Rodney's soul fair realms of pleasure knew,
And Time's face brightened as he onward flew.
All sights to him from sadness now awake,
For him the forests into music break,
Thoughts of Leeona speed the moments by,
And they with pleasure lighten as they fly.
His life was now a dream, in which care lay
Like labor's slumb'rous body, when the day
To night, and rest and lulling sounds gives way.
Thus many a day his burden down he threw,
And half the pangs of slav'ry never knew.
And thus it is, love hath a charm for life,
Whate'er the station, and whate'er the strife.
Where'er we roam, where'er our lot be cast,
In home's sweet shine, or in the raving blast,
Love to the soul a ray of light doth bring,
And scatter pleasures from his hopeful wing.
His advent lights up e'en the slave's poor shed,
And sweetens humble labor's daily bread.
Without thee, Love, what were the shepherd's reed?
Without thy blessings what the flow'ry mead?
From thy rapt fountain patriotism flows,
In thy fair province tall ambition grows,
Proud aspirations lean toward the skies,
And hight on hight great emulations rise.
Tho' fortune smile in some voluptous land,
Tho' fame weave laurels with a lavish hand,
The homely swain of Scotia's thatch-built shed,
Pines for his frugal meal of milk and bread,
Longs for his oaten tune and herded vales,
His shouting harvests and echoing flails.
And why? because sweet love can make him yearn
For early friendships, and his native bourne.
Some Sylvia charms the rustic's lowly dell,
The water sweetens from his native well,
The hills ennobles on his happy view,
His even plains with fresh delights doth strew;
The rough face brightens of his daily care,
With satisfaction crowns his scanty fare,
Pours pleasures in the lap of lusty toil,
And forces plenty from the stubborn soil.
To him, no hills above his own arise,
No vales so pleasant meet his ravished eyes,
And clouds so peaceful soften no serener skies.
To him no waters like the faithful rill,
That murmurs by his cot beneath the hill,
No tune so charming as his highland air,
No flocks so even, and no lambs so fair.
To him no land at all, no world besides
The world of love, that in his heart abides.
See where yon hero drives his way to war,
With Feast or Famine harnessed to his car.
O'er crumbled thrones, his flaming prowess lead,
And at his wheels imploring Commerce bleeds!
Some Cleopatra names the war-doomed lands,
And thrusts the torch of battle in his hand.
Night after night our lovers met and parted;
Night after night they grew more aching hearted,
Took moonlight rambles in the secret shade,
Wider and wider their excursions made,
And ev'ry night longer and longer stayed.
Oft arm-in-arm, with childlike dalliance, they,
And devious eyes, pursue their lonely way,
Or turn aside beneath the arching groves,
In scented nooks to prattle o'er their loves;
Till smiling thro' the drowsy branches bright
And peaceful, a late moon bids them "good night."
Again the shades of night were falling round,
And every hilltop now a speech had found,
When lost in bliss, the lovers met the moon,
Beyond their wonted rambles; but there soon
A crouching fury, who had scanned their walks
And drunk the whispers of their secret talks,
A master who can dare forbid their loves—
Flies on them like a hawk on thoughtless doves.
Leeona, clasping Rodney, starts and cries,
And Aylor hard to tear her from him tries;
Till Rodney's hand with warning aspect laid
Upon his shoulder, his hot rage allayed.
The shud'ring winds bore Aylor's threats around,
The groves their bosoms hushed to catch the sound,
But Rodney led his gentle Ona on,
And with her stood the threshold safe upon.
Now to her room, Leeona sauntered slowly,
A dim light on her table flick'ring lowly—
And sat awhile to ponder her sad heart;
A locket, gift from Rodney, took apart,
Looked on his picture, held it to her breast,
And with a sad, sad heart, assayed to rest.
Her light gone out, the room was dark, except
That thro' her lattice a shy moon beam crept
And looked into her troubled face, but fair,
That now upturned was still in fervent prayer.
She knew not that her faithful Rodney, near
The wall beneath, her lightest word could hear,
As thus she prayed: "Out of the storm, Oh, Lord!
Thou wilt bring shine to those who trust Thy word!
If draughts of bitter grief must first be ta'en,
Oh! Thou dost fill with brimming joys again!
Now in whatever land my Rodney mourn,
Or 'mid whatever trials he sojourn,
Like walls of strength around him, Oh, Thou King
Of Saints Thy mighty arms of succor fling!"
Lo! Rodney answers: "O, my Ona, dear,
If thou dost pray, I know the Lord will hear!"
Now to her feet the Creole bounds,
On tip-toe to the window steals,
Where blossomed vines her form conceals;
But clank of chains, and bay of hounds,
Stentorian oaths, and raving sounds,
Burst on her ear, and freeze her speech,
Ere yet her words can Rodney reach.
Now thronged about by twenty men,
And savage bloodhounds, nine or ten,
That howl with rage, and gnaw and bay,
Like demons that from Tophet stray,
Thro' nether worlds to wing their way.
Rodney, with irons loaded, she
Must turn away, or bear to see.
But as she turns, the hounds appear,
And in their deep jaws Rodney tear.
Unarmed he falls, with pain he groans,
gust of loud oaths mocks his moans,
While human monsters gather round,
And fierce dogs drag him o'er the ground,
Till he in cords of hemp is bound.
"Oh, save!" gasped Ona, as she, poor
Sweet child, sank swooning on the floor.
A moment there, a fair corpse seemed,
As in her face the sad moon beamed;
Then frantic rose, and down stairs flew,
And on her lover's bosom threw
Her wild sweet form, his stout neck drew
In her soft arms, and her cheeks fair
Nestled on his, and with her streaming hair,
Covered his bleeding shoulders that lay bare.
And this is Slav'ry! the wise faced creed,
That stretched a helping hand to Afric's need.
The holy Institution that was bound
To raise the heathen, tho' the Heavens frowned!
Ah! this was what a righteous Nation heard
Pray in her temples, and expound the Word.
This was Creation's good Samaritan,
And poor old Afric was the thief-torn man.
Oh, who has not the dear good shepherd seen,
Stand Moses-like, God and His hosts between,
Bless Slavery as a child from Heaven born,
Since Joseph was from poor old Jacob torn;
Watch ever sleepless, o'er his peaceful fold,
Unawed by dangers, uninduced by gold,
And weep if one poor lamb from shelter cries?
That is, one white lamb; if black, shut his eyes.
Ah! Young America, for God's sake, pause,
Hast thou such preachers, and hast thou such laws?
With ruffian hands, the maid was to her room
Forced hurriedly, and shut within its gloom.
Sad as the evening star's last glim'ring ray,
Now from a swoon, pale Ona crept and lay
Half conscious, till the night had far away
Towards the morning sped.
Wild phantoms wandered thro' her fevered brain,
Sweet slumber from her eyes its flight had ta'en,
And fainting hope had fled;
When in night's silent depths she heard a sound,
As of shy footfalls, that on tip-toe, wound
Along the mansion's stairs, now quick and low,
And now hesitatingly slow.
Then all was still, save that she heard
Upon the roof, light boughs that stirred,
And clasp'd at winds, that with them played,
And off in outer stillness strayed.
Again the cautious sounds revived,
And stood there motionless as death,
Till borne upon a husky breath,
This sentence thro' the key hole blew:
"Git up, my child, Ise cum fur you!"
'Twas "Aunt Ameriky,"—she knew—
She bounded up, she followed fast
Her sable guide, who hurried past
Her master's door with breathless ease,
And stood beneath the silent trees.
Then thus, low spake the good old guide,
"In yonder room is Rodney tied,
Where stands a locust on dis side.
De white folks sell him in de morn,
An he'll be left yer, shore's yer born,
Go see him gal, bid him farwell,
An' tell him what yers got to tell.
An' I'll stand here de outside by,
An' keep watchout wid open eye."
Now near this room—a prison made
In which to keep slaves till conveyed
Into their buyer's custody—
Leeona stole on cautiously.
Where thro' a crevice in the wall,
A late moon lighted up his thrall,
The pale maid saw her lover lie,
And called him with a burning sigh.
He answers: "Ah! is that my dove?"
And she, "Oh, have they bound you, love?"
The ebon angel of the night,
Now flew away and out of sight,
But soon returned with keys in hand,
And knife, and giving this command:
"Cum wid me, chile!" unlocked the room,
And entering its sepulchral gloom,
Stooped to her knees upon the floor,
The knotty fast'nings to explore
Of Rodney's arms; her knife apply,
And loosing him, let Ona fly
With outstretched arms to his embrace,
Lean on his breast and look into his face.
A moment passed, and drinking Ona's sighs,
The proud slave stood, while with his downward eyes
He caught the azure of her tender gaze,
And felt his kindling manhood all ablaze.
"Naught have I borne!" he cries, "love, but for thee,
These bloody tokens of the truth, oh, see!
Would I could Northward fly and now be free!
But where thou art not, all is bondage dire.
I'm free in chains, if I but in the fire
Of thy sweet eyes, may feel my heart inspire.
I now could arm, and would at once assay,
The vile destroyer of my joys to slay;
But then the law would drive me from thy sight,
Then day were darkness in my soul's long night."
Now thus Leeona, gazing in the moon,
"Haste, Rodney, lo, the day will open soon!
Hie to the cave, on yonder side extreme
Of that vast wood, where not the staunchest beam
Of potent noon can thy dark seat invade;
Keep hid by day, by night explore the shade.
There we shall meet. I'll there late rambles take,
And come to thee. The signal I will make
Is a low song, when there's no danger nigh,
Then we will walk; but hark, a footstep, fly!
Nay, come now dearest to this further shade,
Where our light converse may not be betrayed.
Tread lightly, ah! speak low, for now I fear
Suspicion walks abroad, with open ear
On night's still lips. Haste, Rodney, come away!
Still! there, thy heart unburden, make no delay.
List! hush! a hoof, 'tis—no—my beating heart;
That night bird, hark how lonely! Oh, I start!
For now methinks his note doth omens bring
Of sadness, all my poor heart saddening."
No evening shepherd ever tuned a lay,
Of sweeter accent, down his mountain way
Homeward returning at the close of day,
Than Rodney's speech was in Leeona's ears,
Till in the hall a certain step she hears.
His arms once more round 'Ona Rodney flings,
And sudden freedom to his flight lends wings,
Towards the cave he turns his flying face,
This way and that, and leaps at every pace,
To keep up with imagination's feet,
That brush by him in noiseless retreat.
The cave is reached, and wide apartments found,
With easy access, hollowed in the ground.
And ent'ring slow, now Rodney feels around,
Finds shelves of stone, and seats and beds of stone,
But windows, attics, and piazzas, none.
Meanwhile Leeona, noiseless as a sprite,
Flies thro' the halls, and up the ancient flight
Back to her room, and softly sinks to rest,
Till morn shall chase the darkness towards the West.
'Mid all the jars that shook the Aylor seat,
And hot suspicions, Rodney's dark retreat
Was ne'er discovered; and Leeona true
As only woman can be, 'scaping thro'
The darkness, met him oft, and took him food,
And gave him comfort in the dismal wood.
Of how she met him, cheered him; noble slave!
And lighted up the dungeon of his cave,
And with him walked thro' moonlight rambles long,
Cannot be painted in our faithful song.
Elijah, fed by ravens, it would seem,
Might have thought all the world a monstrous dream;
And Peter seeing wild beasts in a sheet
Tied up, and angel's crying "slay and eat,"
May have been awed at his supply of meat.
But what must he have thought, who chased by men
And hounds, from human sight into a den,
The angel of his love found stooping there,
Him to refresh, and his abode to share?
2
FLIGHT OF LEEONA.
In bloom gemm'd depths, where Sylvan branches meet
Above dim paths, that thread a still retreat;
Where light on tip-toe shy, steals o'er your path,
Like some chaste maid unrobing at the bath;
There where old warrior pines on high doth tower,
In fashion quaint is built the Aylor bower.
Here 'Ona now a noon excursion made,
And wandered peaceful thro' the silent shade.
There, as she went, and could not turn nor stay,
But ling'ringly pursued her lonely way,
And gazed into the song-stirred woods beyond,
She stooped to raise a wayside flow'r with fond
And gentle touch, and with a sweet look try
To coax the timid azure from its eye.
And now she turns upon a mossy seat,
Where sings a fern-bound stream beneath her feet,
And breathes the orange on the swooning air;
Where in her queenly pride the rose blooms fair,
And sweet geranium waves her scented hair;
There, gazing in the bright face of the stream;
Her thoughts swim onward in a gentle dream.
Now, restless Aylor parts this dense retreat,
And 'Ona finds reclining, fast asleep;
While, save that one lone bird doth chirping peep,
Where's not a sound to raise its little feet
Within the stooping boughs—the very air
Seems half afraid to breathe upon her there!
And water lilies, prattling in the stream,
With speech subdued, enchanted list'ners seem.
Leeona's long locks round her slim waist meet,
The bright waves leap and sigh to kiss her feet,
While her reluctant breasts to view disclose
The lovely hues of life's serenest rose;
And timid rising, like twin moons do seem,
Just o'er the woody marge of some still stream.
Low Aylor peers the arching boughs beneath,
Lust heaves his bosom and compels his breath,
While thus he ponders, on his raving breast,
His hand in trembling indecision prest:
"I'll nearer steal, but then she might awake!
Oh, in these boughs I'll stand, till mine eyes take
Their feast of gaze! Ah! what a beauty she!
My soul is drowning in a boundless sea
Of what I can't express! And she is mine!
My own slave! No, Leeona, no, I'm thine!
I'll be thy slave, and thou my wife—my—no!
There's negro in her veins! 'Twould never do!
What Saxon hand a negro wench would woo,
And let disgrace frown on him? But she's fair!
Her cheeks, how radiant: ah! what eyes—what hair!
Thou angel slave! and mine! I'll nearer steal,
And make her while these boughs shall us conceal.
I'll proffer her a master's secret love,
Protection, freedom or her heart I'll move
To confidence and yielding secrecy,
By signs of stooped superiority."
Then, as some rough-armed hurricane that finds
The hiding places of the little winds,
Where insect horns their day long music keep,
And starts zephyrus in her noontide sleep;
So, filled with blasty lusts, now Aylor goes,
Till on the sleeper fair his footsteps close.
And as the fingers of a dream have caught
The waving pinions of her free young thought,
She hears his steps, sleep blends them with her dream,
Till touch'd, she wakes and bounds up with a scream.
Her master's low entreaties make her worse,
She screams for aid, till screaming makes her hoarse.
He grows more furious as she him defies;
The helpless lamb to flee the lion tries,
But fear o'ertakes her strength, and daunts her soul,
Her senses reel, and reason yields control
To blank unconsciousness, and what ensues,
Refrain to ask, Oh! man, withhold my muse!
The bower's deepest bosom saddened seemed,
As innocence's big libations streamed
Fast down Leeona's pity-suing cheeks,
And her poor breaking heart gave vent to shrieks;
And up to sympathizing Heaven she turned
Her tear-dimmed eyes, that with entreaty burned.
Oh, loveliness thou radiant visaged sprite,
Thou lute-voiced warbler wooing to delight!
By prince alike, and homely swain adored,
By every gentleness of soul implored!
When unprotected, howe'er cherished much;
To thee how blighting is the lewd hand's touch,
E'en as the woodside flow'ret plucked away—
Torn from the bosom of enliv'ning May—
Dost droop within the rough grasp of the swain,
Thou witherest to ne'er revive again!
And Slavery, thou worst of all the host
Of human ills, I loathe, and like thee most!
Thy name I spurn, thy grov'ling aims I hate,
And all thy bitter creeds abominate;
But like thee for the daughters thou hast borne,
The jewels that doth thy vile neck adorn,
The tender out-growth of unholy deeds,
The rich-hued blossoms of offensive weeds.
Here, reader, lies a lab'rynth on our way,
Thro' which perchance 'twould weary you to stray;
Or yet perhaps with some unwonted sight,
Or sound, mar all thy bosom's visions bright.
Our steps, therefore, around it now proceed,
Where to remoter realms our lovers lead.
But as we pass, there lingers on the ear,
A strong man's mournings for his lover dear.
For Rodney hears that his fair 'Ona's dead,
And sleepless anguish bows his manly head,
The nightly forests hear his wand'ring cries,
And with her stony speech his cave replies.
'Twas eve in Florida serene and bright,
And gently sighed the wind as sighs a maid
When watching in an early moon's round light,
Her lover's footsteps in the trysting shade.
The woods breathed softly, and their even breath
Was sweet with blossoms of the neighb'ring heath.
And, save the lonely note of nightingale,
The churlish out-bursts of the farm boy's vale,
The horn owl's shout, and swamp bird's lone reply,
No evening sound disturbed the sleepy sky.
Now near a dark and solemn wood,
Close by the Aylor house I stood.
The evening star, without a peer,
Was sinking in his mild career,
As sinks the warrior on his shield,
When vict'ry holds a silent field,
And no alarum breaks his rest,
To build her watch fires in his breast.
Soon, as a maid will half conceal
To show her beauty, then with sighs,
Languishing looks, and yielding eyes,
Will arm her sex with that appeal,
Which conquers him who dares to feel;
So, bursting from the wood's embrace,
A moon in soft clouds dipped her face,
Ascended then her peaceful throne
Of green hills, and supremely shone.
I heard a wail of woman's woe;
Now loud it bursted, and now low,
Suppressed, as if in sudden flow,
A hand had checked its bitter gush;
Then followed an expressive hush,
When, in the mansion's silent hall
I saw a female proud and tall,
Half covered in the myrtle's shade,
Thro' which the moonlight faintly strayed.
Her long hair stream'd below her waist
In wild waves; and her bosom chaste
Arose in pensive sweetness, bare,
Beneath a face that pale with care,
Some monster trouble seemed to dare.
Her eyes with sullen lustre blazed,
As up in Heav'n's still face she gazed,
And clasped an infant to her breast,
To gently hush its sweet unrest.
I nearer to the woman stole,
And lo! she was the fair Creole!
For unobserved, I reached the hall,
And leaned against the shadowed wall,
Just as the moon was fairly seen,
Breaking white banks of clouds from 'tween.
I heard the Creole's softest sighs,
And saw her flash her restless eyes
Upon her rear; I now did know
There was concealed some dreadful foe.
I looked upon her lovely form,
And felt my hurried blood run warm.
Ah! she was beautiful, tho' not
So fair as lovesick rhymers plot,
Or whining prose mongers array,
Among the novel's little way,
Through which good sense doth never pass,
But where the intellectual ass
Delights to roam, or fast or slow,
To see the strange white lilies grow,
Or hear a big black giant blow!
Ah! not so fair, but a rich rose,
And brilliant as the stream that flows
From Summer hills, with meadows sweet,
And dewy corn-fields at their feet;
While bleating pastures peaceful lie,
Beneath an azure canopy.
But hovered o'er by raven-winged fears,
Assailing wrongs had dried her tears
In their bright home; tho', as the rill,
When Winter from his cheerless hill,
Freezes the surface with his breath,
But cannot stop the flow beneath;
So her proud look of beauty showed
That sorrow's stream beneath it flowed.
Oh! how I wished I knew wherefore
Her wrongs, and her distresses sore!
How then I could have met her foe,
And brought her weal, or shared her woe!
I raised my hands, I strove to speak,
But long suspense had made me weak;
I could but lisp a single word,
And that too faintly to be heard.
Then, ere I caught my reeling sense,
I would have sprung to her defense,
But horror froze my sluggish blood,
And I aghast in silence stood.
A whisper low breathed thro' the hall,
And then there came a quick footfall.
Leeona flashed a hurried eye,
And "Oh, my Rodney!" then did cry,
And to his brave arms weeping fly.
A moment clasped in love they stood;
Then he looked round in sullen mood,
As calm as night, but stern as death,
Resentment warming every breath,
And "fly, Leeona!" quickly gasped,
And to his lips her small hand clasp'd.
"They're on us now, and soon we'll be
Beyond the reach of Liberty."'
"Hush! there they come! can't you hear
Their angry footsteps hurrying near?
Wait not a moment to be gone,
By Heaven aided fly alone!
I'll meet, and hold them here at bay,
Or stain with blood their fiendish way."
I strove now but could not withdraw,
Nor look, nor shut my eyes for awe.
A hurried sigh, a sob suppressed,
Escaped Leeona's noble breast.
All earth to her was in her arms,
And she could tread on Scorpion harms,
While this firm purpose swelled her heart—
To live not from her babe apart.
Now wild as the wild cat'ract moans,
Thro' deep shades and replying stones,
The murmur from her bosom rose:
"God save my Etta from her foes!"
Then on her shoulder swinging straight,
The thoughtless infant's little weight,
Forth from the mansion' s hall she stole,
Like hope's last vision from the soul.
Her lips were clenched, her dark eyes staid,
Her brow was knit and arched with shade,
To Heaven's arms she looked for help,
And fearless as the lion's whelp,
Was winding thro' the silent grove,
With no cheer but the moon above.
Now fast and faster onward flew,
Till indistinct upon the view,
She seemed a shadow, then was seen
No more the darkling trees between.
Now in the dismal mansion roared
A storm of heavy steps that poured
From aisle to aisle, and hall to hall,
As if loud tongues in every wall
Were loosed upon the night to call.
The current foamed towards the door,
From which had fled the Creole poor,
And o'er the voices of the crowd
One great grum throat was heard aloud,
Like a crack'd trumpet madly blown,
Or like a fierce boar's sally groan.
"Let loose the hounds upon her track,
Go, villains [ villians ]! Speed and bring her back!
Or leave her torn upon your way,
And on her flesh let vultures prey!"
Now Aylor ceased, and his dread form,
Peerless in terror, issued forth,
As wrathful as the dark browed storm
That shuts the doorway of the North,
And drapes the eagle's palace bright,
In curtains of the misty night,
Then grum as some old Indian king,
He strode among the gaping throng
Till like a Champion of the ring
Of loud Olympus, stern and strong,
Of matchless port, and manner proud,
He rose above the gaping crowd
Of men and dogs, and shook his hair.
Dread silence seized the trembling air,
Dumb terror made his minions quake,
Their knees to smite, their fingers shake,
And dogs beneath his nod and scowl,
Began to gnaw their chains and howl.
The chains are loosed, and at a smack,
Away fierce yelping fly the pack.
Their deep, loud throats in full chase break,
The darkling woods responsive speak,
And far off hills from slumbers wake.
The very night shades seem to fly,
And dance and flutter on the eye;
For dreadful sight is it to see,
A woman from swift bloodhounds flee.
Then like some lion, when loud dogs invade,
That flies ferocious from his roaring shade,
His bristling kindred scatters from his path,
And shakes the forests in his lordly wrath;
So now brave Rodney from his cover springs,
And right and left her loud pursuers flings.
These at him stare with trembling fears opprest,
He plucks a dagger from his heaving breast,
Displays the ghastly warning to their eyes,
And in pursuit of hounds and Creole flies.
Ah! ye whose eyes with pity doth run o'er,
When mournful tales come from a heathen shore,
Of babes by mothers thrown to crocodile;
The scaly terror of the languid Nile;
Of Brahma's car and Islam's wanton rites,
And bloody raids on Zion's sacred hights!
Ye who hear these and pray for God to come,
Behold yon mother fleeing from her home!
A master's child upon her frantic breast,
And by a master's savage bloodhounds prest;
And this, too, where in every steepled town,
The crucifix on human wrong looks down!
Think then no more of heathen lands to rave,
While in America there breathes a slave!
Rodney pursues, and where the sickened moon
Looks thro' the woods, comes on the Creole soon.
The angry hounds have overta'en their prey,
And round Leeona, madly mingling, bay.
Deep thro' the wastes their fiendish voices ring,
Fierce with their tongues, wood, plain and hillock sing;
And now they close upon her, thick around;
Ah! God, they seize and drag her to the ground!
Lo! Rodney nears, he hears his 'Ona's cries,
Right on the hounds with flashing steel he flies;
They on him furious turn, with eyes that glare
Like furies' fell, jaws gaping, and teeth bare;
This one and that he seizes as they lunge
Upon him, and their dread fangs in him plunge.
Deep thro' their reeking sides his blade he drives,
They reel away and empty out their lives;
Till with their warm blood dropping from his hands,
He master of the situation stands!
Ah! ye whose hearts with swifter currents beat,
When fabled gods in equal combat meet,
Shout loud the challenge, swing their shields immense,
While armies hang around in dread suspense,
Lift their vast lances, like the lightnings driven,
Jar all the plain and shake the vault of heaven;
Behold this hero of the real fight,
This man who dares the wiles of swampy night;
Whose fearless bosom, lit with valor's fire,
Withstands the monster bloodhound in his ire;
Whose faithful heart to love's first impulse true
Will dare to suffer and is brave to do.
Now Rodney listens, his surrounding views,
And thro' the pines his dismal way pursues.
Leeona follows on his journey dark,
Where night-owls laugh and wary foxes bark;
Till thro' the branches op'ning day's in sight,
With rosy smiles and locks of streaming light.
We wander now in grasses long and damp,
O'er oozy mosses of a dismal swamp,
Thro' languid brakes, and under monster trees,
Thro' whose vine loaded boughs noon never sees.
Here nature sleeps her long, long torpid nap
In silence, on the Tropic's tangled lap;
Here yellow streams with lazy murmurs creep
On slowly, talking in their sluggish sleep;
Here hideous reptiles in their slimy reign
Crawl aimless ever, and an apish train
Of forest hoodlums day long orgies hold;
And birds, although their plumage gleam with gold,
And divers colors, sing not; in this wood,
This habitation of dark solitude,
Our lovers, for their lives escaping, fly
Into the arms of dismal safety.
The scaly venom of the pathless brakes
About them here a sure protection makes,
For who will dare the danger of the bogs?
And here is crocodile a match for dogs.
Here hope our lovers found,
And love about them wound
Her silver cords the tighter;
As fears vanish'd away,
And they from day to day
Felt life's burdens grow lighter.
Ona saw Rodney's manhood, he
Her fortitude and constancy;
Thus, each could in the other see
Enough to keep the loving eye
With pleasures running over.
As Eve and Adam, innocent
Within the charms of Eden went,
And nothing of the wide world knew,
Save what lay just betwixt the two;
So wandered these, the wild shade thro',
Lover absorbed in lover.
Far from their home within the wood,
Once Rodney went to search for food,
And ready make, for he next day
Must toward the North Star take his way.
Leeona biding, sandals knit
Of fibres from the cypress split,
A basket rude of willows wove,
And gathered fruits within the grove.
Thus wand'ring round, she missed her track,
And lost, could not her way find back.
At last despairing, sad she stood,
Then on her devious way pursued,
The sun upon his western way,
Had nearly reached the verge of day,
Baptizing in his orange sheen
The lofty groves of cypress green;
When in the swamp grass, long and dank,
Leeona reached some bayou's bank.
Lo! all around was strange and lone,
And silence on her dismal throne
Held her dark sway in every nook;
Save that one swamp bird yonder, shook
A mournful noise from his throat,
That sounded something like a note;
And that one tiny wren did say
Some feeble things anear her way,
Scarce able when it flew to shake a spray.
Leeona turned to scan the wood,
When lo! beyond her scarce a rood,
A horrid human form she viewed!
A tall old man in skins half guized,
Half savage and half civilized,
With a great cudgel in his hand,
Towards her gazing still did stand.
About his waist a leathern thong
Bound his long locks, they were so long.
Uncombed and matted close they lay,
And age's touch had made them gray.
His gaunt arms were of monstrous length,
The ghastly signs of wasted strength.
"Ah!" Ona sighed, "What shall I do?"
And, as she thought, unseen, withdrew;
But slow the ghostly hermit stalked
Around her hiding-place, then walked
Straight in the bush to where she lay
Breathless, stood squarely in the way,
Swung his great cudgel round and round,
Chattered and gnashed, and stamped the ground,
Rolled his wild eyes, growled like a bear,
And thrust his fingers in his hair.
A true heroine of the cypress gloom,
Now there to lie, the Creole saw her doom—
A reckless madman had her in his hand—
She sprang up, and did at his elbow stand,
And cried out, "Look sir, see my pretty child!"
At this, the raving specter grimly smiled,
Let fall his cudgel, muttered some strange speech,
And for the babe his dreadful claws did reach.
"Have you seen Nanawauea?" then he cried,
"She died long time ago, and then I died;
Who wrongs the red man, wrongs the race of man;
You hurt my wigwam now, sir, if you can!"
Leeona answered, pointing him away,
For no auspicious moment long will stay:
"Your Nanawawa lives in yonder glen,
Make haste and find her— come and tell me then."
Now both hands in his hair the madman threw,
Dashed off and laughed, and gibbered as he flew.
"Dark mystery," Leeona leaving, said,
"Hath in that human waste her mansion made!
Ah! now within his once love-lighted breast,
The owly phantom builds her broody nest.
And that high seat where wisdom once did dwell,
Is now inhabited by visions fell,
And recollections harrassing, among
Which, a dreadful secret holds her tongue!
And 'Nanawawa;' love-balmed name survives—
Above that heap of mental ruins lies!
Poor wretch, unconscious of existence save
With the loved dead, thinks he's beyond the grave!
'Who wrongs the red man.' Why he speaks of wrongs,
To that the secret of his words belongs;
Wrong! wrong! Yea wrong! We all that monster know,
The blight and bane of earth, and source of woe!
Now Rodney's voice and heavy footsteps broke
Upon the Creole's ear, as thus he spoke:
"Leeona, here am I! What were those sounds?
And what went by me with such dreadful bounds?"
Leeona told him; list'ning still he stood,
Then talking low they slowly left the wood,
Began their steps toward a Northern clime,
And looked on Florida for their last time.
THE RUNAWAY.
Awake, my muse, ye goodly sights among,
The land of Boone and Kenton claims my song.
Thro' other scenes our lovers take their flight,
See where their wand'ring footsteps pass in sight.
Lo! where yon pleasant valleys meet the eyes,
And goodly hills their forests lifting rise!
Here, as we pass, along our cheerful way,
Small farms adjoining, stretch in green array.
And small farm houses, looking great trees thro,'
And neat dressed orchards, dot th' enlivened view;
And their quaint roofs by Autumn suns embrowned,
With wind-mills rude, and bird-box turrets crowned,
Look thro' the branchy elms and locusts high,
And send a rustic welcome to the eye.
See where yon flocks their even pastures browse,
And lowing homeward, hear the sober cows,
And hear yon plowman whistling as he plows.
Here circling plenty meets returning suns,
And lucid cheer in ev'ry valley runs,
Loud satisfaction fills the evening air,
And jovial comfort soothes the ear of care.
Thrice hail! proud land, whose genius boasts a Clay!
The Cicero of slavery's palmy day,
The gifted champion of Compromise,
Whose mien majestic filled a nation's eyes;
And on the eloquence of whose wise tongue
A learned Senate in rapt silence hung;
A Senate, too, whose fame no one impugns,
Of Websters, Randolphs, Marshals and Calhouns.
And could a land that boasts a mind like this—
That bord'ring on the clime of freedom is—
Suffer a harlot with her whorings vile
To peacefully pollute her gen'rous soil?
Yes, green Kentucky with her native pride,
Proclaiming trust in the great Crucified,
Flaunting her prestige in the world's wide face,
Boasting descent and precedence of race,
And by the greatest of all statesmen led,
Shared the pollutions of a slavish bed.
All o'er her fields, the blood-hound's savage bay
Pressed the poor sable trembling runaway,
And sometimes by the home of Henry Clay!
In all her woods, the wail of wild distress
Was heard, as tattered starving wretchedness
Fled in the shrieking wrath of wintry storm;
Wrapping her babe in rags to keep it warm!
Can I forget the tears a parent shed
When her dear hand she placed upon my head,
And me embracing, tremulously said:
"My heart is sick whene'er the sad winds blow,
And all the ground is buried deep in snow,
For I remember, when I was a child,
The night was dark, the raving winds were wild,
The earth was still, the snow lay deep and white,
When at our door there came a footstep light.
We opened, and a strange black woman's face.
Looked in; she held a child in her embrace
And said: "Ize nearly froz to deaf', oh wont
You let me in? Oh! don't say no! Oh don't!"
She came in, but before we said a word,
Her master's voice was in the quarters heard!
She knew the sound, her babe close to her drew,
And back into the wintry tempest flew.
The morning came, and chilly miles away,
In snow half hid the lifeless mother lay!
But in her arms the babe alive did sleep,
And when discovered, woke, but did not weep!
And lo! uncovered to the mournful light,
'The mother's face was black—the babe's was white!"
I love Kentucky; tho' she merit scorn
I can't despise the land where I was born.
Her name I cherish, and expect to see
The day when all her sons will cherish me.
Her many sins have all in common been
With other sisters' who their sins have seen.
Yes, I will pray for that good time to come
When I can say: Kentucky is my home.
And this I now ask at my country's hand,
If I must die in some far distant land,
Then let my countrymen, when I am dead,
Where I was born, make my eternal bed.
But here our lovers are again;
Awake, my muse, thy wonted strain!
The hounds at day-break struck a trail
In deep Green River's lonely vale,
And thro' the dusk of dewy morn,
Echoed the hunter's rousing horn.
"What is it?" flew from tongue to tongue,
As to his horse each rider sprung.
A moment in their saddles still,
They heard the baying on the hill
Not far away, and full well knew
A runaway before them flew,
The chase began, the horses dashed
Away, and thro' the bushes crashed,
Like birds that flutter on the wing
All thro' the wild copse scattering.
Each horseman pressing for the lead
Bore on and on, with champing speed.
On, on and on, and on, o'er hills,
And winding valleys, leaping rills
And fallen trunks like startled hinds,
Wild as a flood, as swift as winds.
The hounds' loud clamor rolled and broke
Morn's drowsy stillness, and awoke
The sleepy hills, that answered back
The lusty tonguing of the pack.
Within his quiet farmhouse wood,
The early rustic list'ning stood,
The plowman whistling in his lane,
Paused, listened, paused and paused again,
Surmised, went on, went on, surmised,
And at their loud speed stood surprised;
As o'er his fences passing near,
He heard them in their mad career.
Their loud tongues on the morning breeze
Now Rodney heard, as if the trees
Were yearning in their sympathy,
And stretched, and sighed and whispered "fly."
And fly he did, and as away he sped,
Soon of the pack a length'ning space ahead;
His nimble limbs grown strong by punishment,
Bore manly up as on and on he went.
O'er fences high, and gullies wide he leapt,
Skimmed level fields and thro' the briars crept,
Now pricked by these, now by the wanton thorn,
And now by knotty bamboos hung and torn.
His footsteps now had gained a wooded hight,
Now fields and houses all were out of sight;
He paused to listen, heard his heart's quick beat,
And thought. it was the sound of coming feet.
Another instant and the flying slave,
Was trying if his legs could well behave.
Thro' pond'rous woods and darkling shades he ran,
Three miles or more from where his flight began,
Sometimes along the wild boar's narrow way,
Sometimes where hunted wolves in cover lay.
He soon could hear the fierce hound on his rear,
Baying out inbred hate, and drawing near.
Loud in the distance angry signals wound,
And furious yells urged on the flying hound.
Dread oaths were muttering on the morn's still air,
Enough to hush the jungle's roaring lair.
Now Rodney, bursting from the wood,
An instant on the high bluffs stood
And gazed upon Green River's flood,
That tossed and growled and rolled beneath,
Like torments in the vaults of death.
The rocks look'd down with angry awe,
And feeble shrubs leant back and saw.
Few moments more the worst must bring,
For now the worst had poised its wing!
The hounds are on him! "Save! oh save!"
Right downward leaping cries the slave,
But not into a watery grave!
With arms of steel he mounts the wave,
He grapples with the dizzy tide,
Turns downward, where the cliffs doth hide,
And then with strokes manful to see,
He pulls for life and liberty.
Meanwhile the hounds have ceased to bay,
The hunters look and turn away,
And "Ah! he's drowned!" all seem to say.
Three nights or more curtain the skies,
And now we turn our weary eyes
To where the Creole mother flies.
Thro' dangers led by friends at night,
By day concealed from mortal sight,
Thus far, secure has been her flight.
A storm was low'ring, and the sun was low,
The Creole's weary steps were short and slow,
The air grew sightless, and the fields were still,
The woods were restless on the solemn hill,
The earth seems shrinking from the threat'ning skies,
As night on rayless wings athwart the sun's path flies.
All nature trembles! Lo! the cloud-folds break,
The mountains with their thunder-tongues awake,
While livid lightnings glare on every peak,
And with their arms of flame, their warring lances take.
The startled clouds flee out into the deep
Of troubled night; and headlong down each steep
Rush dizzy torrents from the flood-drenched hills,
And foam along the overflowing rills.
But hark! in all this storm a woman's wail!
A mother's anguish doth the ear assail!
Beneath yon beetling rocks, oh raise thine eyes,
To where Leeona lifts her tender cries!
See now she sinks into the cliff's embrace,
And turns to heaven her entreating face
In tearful beauty! Hark! for help she cries!
And thunders answer from the wrathful skies!
Between the surges of tumultous winds,
Her cry a passage thro' the tempest finds.
"Oh God! my child! my child!" she wails distrest,
And clasps the tender sorrow to her breast.
But like the vaulty whispers of the tomb,
Her words come back from hollow-throated night's deep gloom.
Oh! Heaven, can'st thou thus be pitiless,
And hear, unmoved, the cry of loveliness?
Cause thy rebellious winds to war no more,
The loud disturbers of a nightly shore!
Ah! how the torrents now are pouring down,
They seem as if the whole earth they would drown;
But this last flood descending, hope creates,
For when it slackens, then the storm abates.
The rain has ceased; but the belabored wood
Yet waves and trembles in a troubled mood.
The frantic Creole lifts a piercing cry,
Hoping to rouse some woodsman dwelling nigh;
But in the bluffs above her wolves reply.
"Oh! Heaven," shrinking in the rock she gasps,
And in her arms her infant tighter clasps,
"The wolves are howling, Ah! What shall I do?
Beset by beasts and human monsters too!"
Then like some doe when dogs and horns surround,
That starts, stops, listens, starts with sudden bound,
Flies from her covert, leaps rock, fence and hedge,
And leaves the baying dangers of the sedge.
Right so Leeona stops, and starts, and leaps,
And bounding onward leaves the howling steeps.
The flashing heavens make her footing good
In darksome paths, through the abodeless wood,
As on she flies, a spirit of the night,
But knows not where her heaven assisted flight.
Day came—an ugly, wet and sluggish day—
When in the woods, far on Leeona's way,
A band of sun-browned cleavers she beheld,
That near their lonely homes their forests felled.
Their great rough arms, as rough as oak limbs are,
Dropt on their knees, and to their elbows bare;
Held up their chins, as from their logs they gazed
Upon the fleeing woman, sore amazed.
And when she came to them with tales of woe,
They pressed around her eagerly to know
From whence she was, and whither she would go.
And then they grouped and muttered to themselves,
Smote on their breasts, and seized their pond'rous helves,
And breathing out a gale of oaths and threats,
They led her to their humble forest seats.
Of how the Creole, by these woodsmen's [ woodsmens' ] aid,
Her further flight toward Ohio made;
Of how she wandered two long months, beset
By shrewd suspicions, and by mistrust met,
By day concealed, by night hurried along,
Cannot be uttered on the tongue of song,
But raise your eyes to where the verging land
Of Bondage touches Freedom's holier strand.
Low in the cheerless West, deceitful rays
Kindle their fires to a feeble blaze.
The leafless woods send up a ceaseless howl,
As looking down upon them with a scowl,
From voiceless hills, the wintry blasts doth stand,
And shake their shrieking tops from hand to hand.
The hoarse Ohio chafes his bleak shores gray,
And sullen, rolls to warmer climes away.
But list! is that the moaning of a gale
Disconsolate, within yon leafless vale?
Draw nearer, listen, now it rises high,
Now lower sinks, recedes, and now comes nigh.
Is it the blast of all its mildness shorn?
Ah! no, 'tis poor Leeona that dost mourn!
See where on yonder rising rock she stands,
And holds her tattered garments in her hands;
Scarce able to rescue them from the wind,
That flings them, with her streaming locks behind;
Unwraps her perfect limbs, that white and bare,
Empurple in the bitter Northern air.
From her bare feet blood trickles down the stone!
Ah, God! Why is she here? Why thus alone?
Oh, what hath driven her from home away,
And Comfort's hearth, upon this ruthless day?
Ah! see her driven from warm Care's embrace
A lone sweet exile of the Creole race!
By heaven forsaken, and denied by earth,
As if too crime-stained to deserve a birth.
By native streams no more in peace to rove,
And hear the sylvan music of the grove.
No more to pluck the fruits of gen'rous growth,
And gather flowers of the fragrant South,
How can she meet the fierce wrath of the North,
Houseless and clotheless, thus to wander forth?
Ah! Ask you? Turn to where yon hounds pursue,
And circle swift the clam'ring forests thro.'
Hark! how loud horns resound upon her rear,
Oh! heaven save her! Is no helper near?
Must she beneath the angry tide be borne,
Or by the savage hounds be seized and torn?
Beyond the river is a fisher's hut,
Close in a cove beneath tall forests shut;
Beyond the hut a narrow path climbs o'er
The crescent bluffs, and winds along the shore.
Within this hut Ben Guildern sate all day,
Mending his nets and lines, and smoked away.
He dreamed of this wide world and all its cares,
Its hopes and doubts, its pleasures, pains and snares,
Of man's pilgrimage to a better bourne,
Where toil shall rest, and man shall cease to mourn;
And of the days and other faces gone,
Ere he was left to pass thro' life alone;
Of pleasant tasks his manly arms had wrought,
Of slumbers sweet that toil remitting brought;
And of the many times he climbed that hill,
And found a wife and children waiting still;
And supper smoking, and a ready plate,
When all day's luckless toil had made him late.
"All gone!" within his wave-tossed soul he sighs,
And o'er the waters lifts his tear-dimmed eyes,
"A cold and blustry night the boat went down,
And my poor wife and babes were left to drown!"
He sees a signal from the other shore—
A woman beckons him to set her o'er;
He hears the hounds, and not a word is said,
A fugitive he sees imploring aid;
His boat is launched, and from her moorings thrown,
The tide awaits her, rolling up and down,
A moment near the shore she slow doth move,
And waits another and another shove;
This way and that the eddy smooth she tries,
Ventures and darts, and with the current flies.
So when the speedy roe is brought to bay,
Where rising cliffs oppose her woody way,
Within some nook embraced by rocks and logs,
She turns her head upon the bristling dogs,
Bends here and there until her way is clear,
Flies through her foes and leaves them on the rear.
Seized by the heaving tide, the feath'ry boat,
Midway the river down begins to float,
But Guildern with his strong arms grasps the oars,
Plies all his strength, and up the current soars.
The angry billows clamor at his keel,
And on his prow in sudden fury wheel,
Till, at an angle of a good degree
Above the hound-pressed Creole pausing, he
Wheels short his flight, athwart the current shaves,
And shoreward glides before the rolling waves.
So when the untiring mistress of the winds
Discovers in the covert feeding hinds,
Midway she meets the current of the skies,
And by its adverse strength succeeds to rise,
Till high above the destined point she swings,
Drops from the clouds and shaves on level wings.
The shore is touched, the Creole boards the boat
With child in arms, and all are now afloat.
Old Guildern speaks not, but plies all his skill,
And looks the firm monition, "now be still,"
Leeona's heart with hope and awe is swelled,
She meets an eye that danger never quelled,
A face as rough as wintry hills, but bland,
An arm of massive strength, but gentle hand,
And mien of dreadful soberness, that braves
The sullen fury of the wind and waves.
The boat is now far out into the stream,
And as her quick oars in the low sun gleam,
Rides up and down the wave, and o'er and o'er,
And level swims towards the other shore.
Ah! nobly bearing up her precious freight,
How steadily she rocks beneath the weight!
Her keel has touched, it cleaves the yellow sand,
Thank God! thank God! they land, they land! they land!
Within a fisher's hut all night,
And leaving by the early light
Of bleak December's lurid morn,
Leeona passes into sight,
Cast down and faint, and travel-worn.
From naked hills loud shrieking flew the blast,
And out of hearing moaned along the waste,
Like some torn beggar all disconsolate,
That mutters from harsh Opulence's gate;
As 'Ona trudged along her lonly way,
Beneath a nightly vault of starless gray.
Her murmuring infant shivered in the blast,
As houses by her way she hurried past,
Where rustic comfort sat with smiling pride,
At honest labor's genial fireside.
Thus thro' the hoary landscape's wintry scorn,
She forced her mind's consent to journey on till morn.
The clouds dispersed as night wore slowly on,
And stars from their high glist'ring fields looked down,
Till late the moon-top'd hills in white arose,
And peerless night unveiled her shivering realms of snows.
Ah! bent and trembling, see that gentle form,
Where shelt'ring rocks oppose the wrathful storm,
Chased like some beast, that hovers with her young
In yawning caves, and desert rocks among.
Her tender infant in her arms is prest,
Hushed are its cries—it gently seems to rest.
Where vagrant swine their wintry beds have made
Of leaves and branches from the forest shade,
Now 'Ona stoops to rest her darling's head,
When lo! she starts, she shrieks—her child is dead!
Her wounded bosom feels a nameless dart,
A ghastly sorrow clutches at her heart—
Nor fear assails, tho' now to leave she tries,
But trying stays, her babe embraces, cries,
The cold cliffs groan, and hollow night replies.
The dismal gorges murmur at the sound,
And empty fields spread echoless around.
Beside her babe the weeping mother kneels,
With anguish dumb its pulseless hands she feels;
Its placid cheek against her face is prest,
Her ear is leant upon its silent breast;
Her hopes are gone! and Heaven's pure ear hears
Deep grief entreating thro' a flood of tears.
Above the cliffs where winds a country way,
A voice is heard in cautious tones to say:
"Leeona! Oh Leeona! Oh my dear!
Is it my 'Ona's mournful voice I hear?"
The Creole hushed, afraid to trust her soul,
That felt a mighty burden sudden roll;
Quick claspt her bosom in aching suspense,
But now distincter heard the voice commence:
"Leeona! Oh, my 'Ona! are you near?"
The Creole answers, "Rodney, I am here!"
Rodney had heard along Leeona's way,
Of her wild flight, and her pursued all day.
Now down the cliffs in breathless haste he flies,
And clasps his life, as thus to him she cries:
"Oh! see, my Rodney; see where baby lies!"
The bosom that had life-long sorrow borne,
The heart which had so long been taught to mourn,
With real manly sympathetic heaves,
Bent o'er the little corpse and raised it from the leaves.
"Poor harmless comer!" then he gently said,
"Better for thee that thy pure soul has fled
With angel watches to the waiting skies,
Where peace e'er flows, and happier climes arise.
Conceived in trouble and in sorrow born,
Thy life rose clouded in its very morn,
And wore along with unpropitious suns;
But to a happy close at last it runs!
Sweet be thy rest upon this lonely shore,
Rocked in the cradle of the winds no more,
And ne'er awakened by the tempest's roar."
This said, to roll the stone away he stoops,
And in its bed a hasty resting scoops,
Commits his tender burden to the ground,
In poor Leeona's last torn apron wound.
She from a mother's anguish pours out cries,
Bends o'er her infant where entombed it lies,
Its calm cheek moistens from her tender eyes,
Its pale lips kisses o'er and o'er and o'er,
And deeper sobs with each long last once more,
Till Rodney's kindly touch she feels implore;
Then murmurs "good-bye, good-bye, mamma's May!"
And with a loud wail tears her wounded heart away.
Here sadness ends,
A new sun lends
His beams to light our way,
And pleasant sights,
And fair delights
Unite to raise our lay.
Where Freedom is what Freedom means,
Our lovers pass to other scenes.
SUSSEX VALE, CANADA.
Sweet vale of the Sussex! the pride of the Queen,
Whose life has a reign of beneficence been;
The flow'r of Britana's possessions afar
In the cold land, that lies beneath the North star.
No slaveholder's foot e'er polluted thy soil,
No slave in thy fields ever bended to toil.
As Bunyan's poor Christian who, fleeing for life,
Left the land of Destruction, and children and wife,
And saw as the shadow of Calv'ry he crost,
His burden rolled down and forever was lost;
So, when the poor fugitive, foot-sore and wan,
From the land of oppressors for liberty ran;
He found that his shackles would crumble and fall,
As he stood in the shadow of proud Montreal.
Asylum, fair Sussex, art thou of the free,
And of all the oppressed, that to thy arms flee
From "the land of the free, and home of the brave"—
Ah! land of the bound and the hell of the slave.
O, Sussex! dear Sussex! the scenes I remember,
As down thee I wander'd in yellow September!
The gay tinted woods in the sunset's gold gleaming,
The creek down thy midst like a sheet of light streaming,
The busy mill near it, and brown barns above,
And blithe childhood shouting in the deep still grove;
The lowing of herds, and the milkmaid calling;
And the tinkling of folds thro' the twilight falling.
And lo! a neat cottage with windows of green,
Scarce thro' the thick boughs of yon elms is seen!
There now the free lovers, that once were the slave,
The maid of the rice swamp and Rodney the brave,
Are dwelling in wedlock's dear holiest ties,
The objects of comment and pride for all eyes.
The stranger who passes thro' Sussex must hear
On the lips of the cottager, far and near,
The love of these new comers pointedly told,
And telling it over, it never grows old.
THE LITTLE GREEN COTTAGE.
Canadian farmers came oft to the little green cottage,
To see their new neighbors and hear them tell over their troubles.
The tales of their pilgrimage e'er to their hearers had new charms;
And instances, once told, cloyed not in repeating them over.
Thus it was that farmers, as rough as the oaks in their forests,
But open, and clever, and frank as the brooks in their meadows,
Came oft in the twilight and sat in the door of the cottage,
And said: "We would hear of the land of the poor sable bondman."
And forward they leant, and sat mute as they heard the dark stories
That sully the brow of America's proudest endeavors.
And regarding Leeona with pity, they sighed: " Lord have mercy;"
As her words, soft and tender, fell on their great hearts with sweet pathos.
With wonder they look'd as they heard of the bayou and cane-brake;
Their breasts smote and murmured to hear of poor fugitive mothers
Chased down by fell bloodhounds, and dragged from the cypress swamps bleeding.
And their faces flamed red, and they plucked their long beard for resentment,
To hear of slave-holders who bought pure beauty and defiled it;
Blighting the hopes of the sweetest, the fairest, and youngest;
Adorning their harems with flowers all ruined but lovely!
And wringing from hoar age's heart submission to these vile abuses.
But they raised their broad hats, and shouted and stamped with boist'rous gladness,
To hear of Leeona escaping with Rodney her lover.
Thus it was that many an evening Rodney's friends came around him,
And far went the fame of the heroine of the savannas.
The same brave Rodney whose blows were too hard for the savage;
Whose feet were too swift, and whose arms were too strong for the bloodhound,
In his secret heart felt his whole life's fairest triumph
When he saw his Leeona the pride of all the great farmers.
Certain was he in his poverty and humble endeavors;
His little green cottage, tho' lowly, had its attractions—
Leeona, the womanly model of gentleness lived there.
Not young was she now, and radiant as she was aforetime,
Not thoughtlessly shy and blushing with reluctance so fawnlike,
Her arms were not smooth and round as they once were; her cheeks not so ruddy;
Her eyes were not so brilliant, and playful, and winning;
But softened by love, they beamed steadier and overcame more.
They were not the first stars that peep shyly thro' the whisp'ring twilight,
But the last sober-beaming ones that patiently linger
Above the familiar wood that watches the homes of our childhood.
She was not the bright light that once dazzled and charmed with its brilliance;
But settled and modest, the amiable light of the hearth-stone,
That draws all close about it, and sets all near hearts a chirping.
The wife of a good man, content to be his and to love him,
Ambitious to rival herself in his strong affections,
And ready always to lay hold with her hands and be happy.
A good wife was she, and loved all who loved her good husband;
And ever was ready to set him in the eyes of her friends
By kindness. Thus was she the idol of Rodney and his friends.
Not least among those who frequented the little green cottage
Was Father Eppinck, the good priest of the parish of Sussex.
A great and good man was he, and a true shepherd to all of his fold.
Were any by poverty shorn of the comforts of this life,
His mantle of care he threw around them, with love warmed.
Were the young gone astray in the dangerous wastes of transgression,
He followed their way, and returned with them prest to his bosom,
Were the old with woes pregnant, and burdened with great tribulations,
He led them, and gently pointed them to a more blessed future.
Thus it was that he came to the home of Leeona and Rodney,
With treasures of kind words. He called them his two loving children,
And always on leaving, he left them his best benediction.
He too loved Leeona, and came to hear of her pilgrimage.
'Twas a balmy afternoon in the joyous vale of the Sussex,
And the voices of Autumn were heard in all of the north land.
The fields were shorn of their harvests, and the golden sheaves were gathered in,
And stacked in the barn-yards. The mill complained in the valley,
The distant glen echoed and sang with the music of axes,
And the wain came down from the deep woods groaning beneath its logs.
The forests wore gay colors, but sighed and were melancholy.
Then Father Eppinck, as he sate in the door of the cottage,
Lifted up his eyes and beheld the fair vale of the Sussex.
He saw the sweet tokens of peace that appeared in the heavens;
And he heard the voice of contentment that went up from the earth beneath;
The sweet words of plenty he heard, and the loud shouts of strong health;
And then he raised his voice and said: "O my God, I bless Thee!
For the rolling seasons and the full year, I magnify thee!
I thank thee for the hills and the high rock, and the great forests.
I thank thee for the pleasant valleys and their full fields of grain,
For their flowing streams, and the burdened orchards on their green banks.
I thank thee for plenty, for health, and for homes; but, oh my God!
I extol thee for freedom, the hope of the church of the Savior.
Here peace spreads her white wings, and sun never looks on a bondman.
Here earth yields her increase, and no slave's sweat ever falls upon it.
Oh God I bless thee for Canada and the Crown of England!"
When Father Eppinck had finished this saying, with kind words
He turned to Leeona and Rodney and said: "Now I leave you.
I go up to Montreal by the first coach to-morrow.
If the morning be fair, I hope to be off before cock crow.
A month shall I be gone, and now that the Autumn is far spent,
My coming to Sussex again will be in the Winter.
What time I am in Montreal, I will be in the house of a merchant,
A good man, whose wealth has kept pace with his increasing goodness;
A Christian, whose devotion to Christ and his holy Apostles
In alms deeds is shown. Samaritan-like he goes forward
Into the highways of this life, and gathers up the wounded
Spirit, and bears him in the arms of his wealth to the inn of comfort;
And when nakedness cries in the street, he hears her, and lends her help,
And asks not; 'But why are you naked? Why did you not save in harvest?'
And his lovely wife, the center of Montreal circles,
A brave hearted, noble, merciful and fair life consort,
Throws around him the arms of encouragement in all his good deeds.
She is happiest always among those that her hands have made happy.
Her heart is a fountain of kind words, and like Aquila of old,
She delights in the church of God, in Christ and his holy Apostles.
Her accomplishments drag after her a train of admirers;
Her beauty a train of worshippers, her charity a host
Of grateful lovers; while her affectionate fidelity
Lights up her home so that her husband says: 'A star is Dora.'"
Now Rodney hung his head when this last word, Dora, fell on his ears;
And as he bade Father Eppinck adieu, he looked up and sighed;
And the light of recollections flashed across his manly face
Like a burst of sun that thro' white clouds lights waving harvests.
ONE SNOWY NIGHT.
The laughter of sleigh bells was heard on the lips of the snow storm
All day long, and passers were scarcely seen thro' the falling flakes
Hurriedly going, wrapped close, and one not speaking to another.
'Twas bitter cold, and the stiffened forests tossed in the northern blast;
And the great old pines, as the gale smote their snowy heads, grumbled,
And seemed in their anguish to mutter: "Let loose our hair and our whiskers!"
The slow wreathes of smoke curled dreamily thro' the still branches
That burdened with snow, stooped down and were sad-hearted and silent.
All sounds of the barn-yard were hushed in the chill breath of Winter.
The cottage was still, and within doors the cotter kept quiet.
The nightfall came, and still the flakes were coming thickly down.
"How it snows," said Leeona, as she shut the neat door of her cottage.
Then she drew her chair near Rodney, and sat before a a warm fire of logs.
This night the little green cottage was unusually cozy;
The cat on the rug sung low to the slumbering puppy,
Who yelped in a dream, and nipped at the heels of a rabbit.
The light of the fire-place, streaming across the clean hearth,
Glared on the walls, and flashed from the chairs and the tables,
Like the recollections of childhood flinging their cheer across life's path.
Now thus to her lord spoke the heroine of the Savannas:
"The approaching Christmas throws the shadows of mirth into Sussex.
Never before was there such buying of presents among us;
Never before such love without dissimulation."
Of a sudden Leeona hushed and fixed her eyes upon Rodney.
"Whoa!" cried a voice at the door, as rough as the oaths of a seaman,
"Still, Sorrel!" and a sleigh had stopped at the door of the cottage.
Leeona rose up quickly, but Rodney sat still and listened
Till she had opened the door and looked out in the darkness.
A dim lamp in the driver's hand streamed thro' the falling flakes
And discovered two men in the sleigh and one woman.
The men in their great coats wrapped dismounted, and then the woman,
Muffled in heavy furs, and veiled, stepped down between them;
When the driver reined his horses and dashed away in the silence.
The strangers entered the door and Father Eppinck before them,
And bowing, he said: "These are my friends of whom I spoke aforetime."
Rodney arose and stood erect in speechless wonder and silence,
As the tall and lovely form of Dora, the heroine of Saville,
Stood in the midst of the floor of his humble dwelling, and reached
The white hand of recognition, saying, with the sweetness of other days
"Do mine eyes behold thee, oh Rodney, my dearest benefactor!
I have heard of you here and have come to remove you to Montreal.
My home is a home for you, and the days of your toil are ended."
0
For the tears of gladness and gratitude the manly hero
Of a thousand trials hard could not speak, but he seized the small hand
Extended, and wept a benediction of tears upon it, and kissed it.
His great stern face of simple fidelity and manhood brave,
Was now lighted up with a glow exceeding portrayal,
And in its effulgence approaching those who stand in white robes
Ever, within the tidal glory of the Throne Eternal.
There were greetings then, and the joy of all hearts was running over;
And there countenances all shone with the light of the Kingdom of Heaven.
1
THE END OF THE WHOLE MATTER.
A tall brave man of gray three score,
The sable columns rode before,
The knightliest of the knightly throng,
The bravest of the brave and strong
Who on the field of Nashville stood
Against the hosts of gallant Hood;
When noble Thomas, mild and brave,
Against the armed master, threw the former slave.
Rodney had left his home in foreign lands,
And laid his life into our country's hands,
His struggling kindred's conquests proud to share,
For he beheld acknowledged manhood there.
And this the grandest day that ever rose
Upon his life, at its eventful close
Was bringing with it recollections sweet,
That made his old heroic heart with youth's emotions beat
His country's banner, soiled and battle-torn,
In sable hands before the columns borne,
Streamed in the setting sun's deep golden light,
And rivaled Heaven in her blazon bright.
The drums of victory clamored on his ear;
The bugle's wail of rest was ringing clear,
Thunder of wheels was in the distance roaring,
2
And into camp the weary victors pouring.
He saw that Slav'ry's days were numbered now,
Far death's cold damp hung on her pallid brow.
And looking now upon his left and right,
Two proud sons who had ridden thro' the fight
With him, rode there with martial mien and brave,
The off'rings which Leeona's bosom gave
The country that had chased her as a slave.
He saw his sons, and prouder felt than he
Who took Rebellion's sword from famous Lee.
This was the day when Southern chivalry
Beheld black manhood clothed in liberty,
Step from the shadow of his centuries
Of bondage, shake dejection from his eyes,
And to the awful verge of valor rise.
The day that heard the negro, scarred and maimed,
On sovereign battle's lips a man proclaimed.
The hosts of Sherman marching to the sea,
Beneath Rebellion's trembling canopy
Swept like a thunder storm, whose lightnings catch
The shaking hills with hands of flame, and snatch
Their mighty forests down. The Nation then
Lifted her hands to Heaven and praised the men
Who cleaved their way by hard incessant blows,
From where the hills of Cumberland arose,
And at the Northern door of Slavedom held
3
Their watch, to where the Mexic Ocean swelled;
Wrenching fair victory from brave hands and true
As e'er on foe the steel of battle drew,
The Alpine strength of strongholds sweeping down,
And treading under foot each hostile town.
Then fair applause warmed her white hands with claps,
And bright-faced greetings at all doors gave raps,
Gray bearded gratitude bowed on his knees,
And cheering cities flamed with jubilees.
But soon a change came o'er the Nation's face,
The light of mirth to clouds of fear gave place.
The chiming bells that jubilantic rung,
Now hushed their throats or spoke with doleful tongue.
The mazy dance held her light-booted feet,
And music soft suppressed her murmurs sweet.
Sad-faced religion sought the church once more,
And faith went back to do her first works o'er.
The gallant Hood, intrepid Sherman knew
Would cleave the Slaveholder's domains in two,
So, as that military comet went
To Southward, he his swift flight Northward bent.
The Union struck at proud Rebellion's heart;
Rebellion aimed at her same vital part,
And doubtless had a wound most painful made,
Had not the Union's negro arm displayed
Such valiant strength in warding off the blow,
And striking down the strong and gallant foe.
4
As Rodney rode to camp this glorious day,
He heard a dying soldier by his way,
Half hidden 'mong his mangled comrades pray.
His tortured soul of ruin conscious cried,
Raved thro' its mansion dark from side to side,
Rose to the eyes. and stood with dreadful glare,
Ran to the heart, and fluttered, groaning there,
And shuddering in the awful shades of woe,
Sank down in mortal dread and pleaded not to go.
As hope forever bade her host farewell,
Now mem'ry came into the soul's dark cell,
And with the wrongs of unrepented yore,
Manacled her, and chained her to the floor.
Remorse then followed with the criminal's scourge,
Her pris'ner seized, and dragged towards the verge
Of mis'ry bottomless, and 'mid the smoke
Of black torment, that rolled and spread and broke,
Laid on her lash of scorpions with heavy stroke.
"Oh, Lord!" the sufferer cries, "have mercy now!
I would pray right, Lord Jesus, teach me how!
Ah! I've insulted thee, I know, I own,
But Savior, make thy boundless mercies known;
Oh, life misspent, could I but now recall!
Leeona, Rodney, ah! forgive me all.
Help! water! water! water, or I die!"
"Who's here?" cries Rodney, quickly turning by,
The dying man stares on the speaker brave,
5
In ghastly silence, as the whisper "save!"
Falls from his lips; then like a madman yells,
And rolls his painful balls within their fevered cells.
Rodney forgets the wrongs of other years,
As wretchedness' bitter cry he hears;
The red wounds that with parched lips appeal
To heav'n he sees, and can't his tears conceal.
He kneels upon the ground where Aylor lies,
His canteen to his quiv'ring lips applies,
The sinking body in his arms doth rest,
And leans his throbing head against his breast.
Now stooping o'er, the hero hears the cry:
"Rodney, I know, forgive me ere I die!
Leeona tell"—he fixes here his eyes,
And still in death, on Rodney's bosom lies.
And now my country let us bury all
Our blunders sad beneath grim battle's pall.
Gathered beneath the storm's heroic folds,
While our dear land an aching bosom holds,
Let us forget the wrongs of blue and grey,
In gazing on the grandeur of the fray.
Now let the vanquished his repentant face,
Lean in the victor's merciful embrace,
And let the victor, with his strong arm heal
The bleeding wounds that gape beneath his steel.
And may no partial hand attempt a lay
6
Of praise, as due alone to blue or grey.
The warrior's wreath may well by both be worn,
For braver man than either ne'er was born.
They both have marched to death and victory,
They both have shown heroic misery,
And won the soldier's immortality.
But scars of honor that they both yet wear,
The proudest testimonials of their valor are.
And where our sons their battle lances drew,
Fought not their sable comrades bravely too?
Let Wagner answer 'mid the reeking storm,
That mingles with black dead proud Shaw's fair form.
Ask it of Fisher, and a thousand more
Brave fields that answer with their lips of gore.
And while America's escutcheon bright,
Is bathed in war-won Freedom's glorious light,
Forget it not, the colored man will fight.
More patriotism Sparta never knew,
A lance more knightly Norman never threw,
More courage never armed the Roman coasts,
With blinder zeal ne'er rode the Moslem hosts,
And ne'er more stubborn stood the Muscovite,
Than stood the hated negro in the fight.
The war was God-sent, for the battle blade,
Around the seething gangrene, Slavery, laid,
By Heaven's arm, this side and that was prest,
7
Until the galling shame dropt from the Nation's breast.
War was inevitable, for the crimes
That stained our hands (and in the olden times
Engendered) now were Constitutional,
And spreading thro' the Nation's body all.
Deep rooted where the vital currents meet
Around the heart of government, their seat
Evaded Legislation's keenest skill,
Or bent the stoutest edge of human will.
'Twas then that God the raving Nation threw
Upon her own war lance and from her drew,
By accidental providence, a flood
Of old diseases that lurked in her blood.
Whom Moses witnessed 'mid old Sinai's smoke,
Whose arm from Judah's neck had torn the yoke,
And with it broken Egypt's bones of pride,
And with his chariots strown the Red Sea tide;
Who stripped the golden crimes from Babel's throne,
And made his pow'r to Baal's adorers known;
He stood among us and His right arm bared
To show His ways by seers of old declared.
While millions trembled at Oppression's nod,
Oppression sank beneath the finger touch of God.
Line upon line the centuries had wrought,
And precept upon precept vainly taught,
The prophets had of old been heard to cry,
While signs and wonders figured in the sky,
8
And then the Incarnation of all good,
By Jordan's wave and in the Mount had stood,
And with His hand of gentleness and love
Transcendent, that a heart of stone could move,
Had touched the ties of every human woe,
And loosing fettered mind, said: "Let him go."
And His great heart to patience ever moved,
And always gentle e'en if He reproved,
Bore this sweet sentence from his sinless Home:
"To preach deliv'rance to the bound I'm come."
But even then, our country shook her head,
Her eagle wings of independence spread,
One tipped with fires of the Tropic's glow,
The other lashing in the realms of snow,
And in her pride declared that God's own Son
Had licensed Slavery's dark crimes, every one.
And tho' we shackled Afric's sable hands,
And scourged her where the smoking altar stands,
And tho' we loaded down her captive feet
With iron chains, right by the mercy seat,
And tho' we laid her virgin bosom bare,
And forced her where the fires of off'ring glare;
We smote our conscience with a palm of ease,
And thanked God that his pure eye ever sees!
Who then can wonder that the Lord would smite
The haughty neck that did Him thus despite?
Now let us in the light of future years,
9
Forget our loss and sacrificial tears,
And thank kind heav'n that tho' we erred and strayed,
We to the good path our return have made.
Hail dawning Peace! Speed on thy glorious rise!
And with thy beams unseal the nation's eyes.
Let Islam in the blaze of scimitar
Proclaim his rites, and gorge the fangs of war,
But peace be unto thee, land of our sires,
Whose sacred altar flames with holier fires!
Let lawlessness no longer stagger forth
With his destructive torch, nor South nor North;
And let the humblest tenant of the fields,
Secured of what his honest labor yields,
Pursue his calling, ply his daily care,
His home adorn and helpless children rear,
Assured that while our flag above him flies,
No lawless hand can dare molest his joys.
Lo! from yon hights, land of the rising star,
The hands of Freedom beckon from afar,
And mid the glad acclaims of roused mankind
Fling her immortal standard to the wind;
Speed there thy flight, and lead the glorious train
That swell the lofty tributes of her reign.
Thy hands are wrested from the tyrant's hold,
0
Thy name on Time's illustrious page enrolled,
And thy escutcheon bright, embossed with gold.
From Erie's rock-watched shores to Mexic's sands,
No more the bondman wrings his fettered hands;
No more entreaty's sable face thro' tears,
Looks on for succor thro' the weary years;
For Freedom's holy dawn is now begun,
And earth rejoices 'neath her rising sun.
Requited toil content pursues his care,
Walks with bold strides as free as heaven's air;
The gen'rous fields put on their aspect sweet,
And forests blithe their hymns of God repeat.
Dear western woods! thou harbors of the free,
With youthful hearts we wander back to thee,
And ere these numbers hush, once more would lie
Beneath thee stretched and gaze upon the sky.
Thou art more proud than Windsor's lofty shade,
By poet sung, or by the sage portrayed.
No lordly despot o'er thy ample grounds,
Sways ancient titles and proclaims his bounds;
But each poor tenant owns his humble plot,
Tills his neat farm and rears his friendly cot.
The weary trav'ler 'long thy roads may lie,
As peaceful as the brook that rambles by,
From boughs that drop with plenty gather food,
And o'er his dear ones rear a shelter rude.
Thou noble seats! fit theme of bard or sage,
1
Beneath thy bow'rs leans venerable age,
While from the summit of his stalwart years,
His life's calm twilight slowly disappears,
And hope's sweet sunrise in the future nears.
And where smooth paths thy solemn shades divide,
Walks buoyant toil with young love at his side,
And charmed by songs that ev'ry zephyr shakes
From boughs around, his hopeful journey takes.
And flaxen childhood there the live-long day,
In blithe sports whirls and wanders far away.
Oh comrade freemen strike your hands to stand
Like walls of rock and guard our father-land!
Oh guard our homes and institutions free,
The price of blood and valor's legacy.
Awake to watch, ye sovereign sons of toil!
If despot feet e're touch our country's soil,
Fly to the standard that by freemen born,
The glory of a hundred years has worn,
Blood-stained, yet bright, streaming, but battle-torn,
And rally till the last drop from the veins
Of free America flows on our plains.
Eternal vigilance must light the tower,
Whose granite strength can bide the evil hour,
Whose wave-dashed base defies the tempest's shock,
Builded upon the everlasting rock.
At last, proud land, let potent wisdom write
Her name above thy brow in glorious light,
2
And suffer ne'er thy hands to idle rest
Till learning lights thy humblest subject's breast.
In cities tall, and in the hamlet rude,
Suffer no partial hand to e'er exclude
A single poor from fair instruction's halls,
But write EQUALITY on all her walls.
An equal chance in life, and even start,
Give every one and let him play his part.
But who could, with complacence on his face,
First bind one's feet, then challenge for a race?
I would not own I was a thing so small,
I'd rather own I was no man at all,
Than show that I must some advantage take,
The race of life respectably to make.
Say my facilities must all be best,
Then write excelsior upon my crest?
Nay, rather let me weed the hardest row,
And rise above by toiling from below.
Free schools, free press, free speech and equal laws,
A common country and a common cause,
Are only worthy of a freeman's boasts—
Are Freedom's real and intrinsic costs.
Without these, Freedom is an empty name,
And war-worn glory is a glaring shame.
Soon where yon happy future now appears,
Where learning now her glorious temple rears,
Our country's hosts shall round one interest meet,
3
And her free heart with one proud impulse beat,
One common blood thro' her life's channels flow,
While one great speech her loyal tongue shall know.
And soon, whoever to our bourne shall come,
Jew, Greek or Goth, he here shall be at home.
Then Ign'rance shall forsake her crooked ways,
And poor old Caste there end her feeble days.
THE END.
POEMS ON MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS.
PEACE.
As the raindrop on a flower
When the bow 's behind a shower,
As the breeze that fans the forehead
Of the sunset, when his cheeks red
Nestle on his mountain pillow,
Or a sea without a billow;
So is Peace's sweet libations,
To the bosom of the Nations.
While the Shepherd's lone were tending
Flocks by night on Judah's plain;
Angels bright above them bending,
Trumpeted their sweet refrain:
"Glory be to God in Heaven,
Peace on earth, good will to men,
To the world a Savior's given,
Lo! he comes in Bethlehem.
Then a door in Heaven opened,
And a milk-white spirit flew
7
From the golden portals earthward—
And the Nation's journeying thro',
She touched the Conqu'ror's Sword, that thrust
Thro' thousand hearts red honors wore;
The glitt'ring terror fell before
His eyes and crumbled into dust.
She breathed upon the warrior's wreath,
And while applauses filled his ears,
And earth her tribute paid of tears,
His glory withered in her breath.
She stood behind the tyrant's throne;
His sceptre vanished from his hand;
And lo! he saw on sea and land,
His gloomy power was gone.
She fanned the lab'rer's care-worn brow,
And sunshine falling from her wing
Into his heart, forced him to sing
While leaning on his plow.
Then by his cot she turned her flight,
And blithe health to the doorway ran,
Contentment's sweetest songs began,
And all within was light.
HYMN TO THE NATION.
When Science, trembling in the lengthened shade
Of monster superstitions, and menaced
By raving Bigotry, a dream embraced
Of prosperous worlds by mortal unsurveyed,
Genoa's seaman and a daring few;
Wide Ocean's stormy perils rent and brought her bounds to view.
Who then had thought that with the Eternal mind,
That in vast Future's covered bosom bound—
Shut up—by these sea-roamers to be found,
Was this green home of poor, abused mankind,
This land of exiles, and the peaceful borne,
Where Babel's scattered tongues shall yet to one great speech return.
Fair Freedom travailed 'neath an unknown sky,
And tho' the tyrant shook his envious chain,
And tho' the bigot reared a gloomy fane,
She bore our darling of the azure eye;
Baptized its childhood in brave blood and tears,
But trumpted her independence in Great Britian's ears.
Astonished kingdoms heard of the new birth,
And royal vengeance drew her warring blade,
And bloody strokes upon Columbia laid,
To smite the young offender to the earth;
Colonial hardships shivered where she went,
And border horrors thro' the years a thrill of sadness sent.
But patriotism bold, sustained the blow,
Returning deeper wounds with daring might—
For Freedom ever steels the stroke of right—
And cool determined Valor's proud arm so
Dismayed the imperial hosts, that baffled George
Saw he could ne'er enslave the men who withstood Valley Forge.
A century has spun around the wheel
Of ages, and the years in noiseless flight
Have heaped their golden tributes to the right;
Till now religion in her heavenly zeal,
To mend life's ills walks hand in hand with lore,
Where clank the chains of slaves in Law's offended ears no more.
Here honest labor trembles at the nod
Of no despot; and penury no more
Must with her gaunt and withered arm implore
Scant life, at Charity's closed hands; but God
Doth lead the bounteous thousands as a flock,
And Peace's happy voices echo from the Nation's Rock.
Tho' at the name Republic tyrants mocked,
Columbia has lived a hundred years
Thro' trials, triumphs, hopes, and doubts and fears,
And still she lives, tho' often tempest-rocked,
Republic yet, united, one and free,
And may she live; her name the synonyme of Liberty!
Go forth ye children of the valiant land,
Go, sound the timbrel of her praises loud!
Ye Alleghenies, in your ascent proud
Thro' cloud-surrounded realms, the winds command
That revel in your soaring locks, to raise
One harmony, and mingle all their hoarsest notes in praise!
Ye Rocky mountains, as with awful glee,
Or icy scorn, ye stare against the sun
Whose shafts glance harmless your strong front upon,
And splintered fall, awake the Western Sea
To join the thunders of your snowy reign,
And speak responsive to your neighbors tow'ring o'er the plain!
Stride on, thou dread Niagara, stride on!
Thou lord of waters, in thy mighty wrath,
And thy earth rocking leap into the bath
Of thunders, stride on! Omnipotent, alone!
And from thy stony lungs her praises sound,
Till Mexic's potent Sea reply and Oceans shout around!
THE LUTE OF AFRIC'S TRIBE.
To the memory of Dr. J. McSimpson, a colored Author of Anti-Slavery Ballads. Written for the Zanesville, O., Courier.
When Israel sate by Babel's stream and wept,
The heathen said, "Sing one of Zion's songs;"
But tuneless lay the lyre of those who slept
Where Sharon bloomed and Oreb vigil kept;
For holy song to holy ears belongs.
So, when her iron clutch the Slave power reached,
And sable generations captive held;
When Wrong the gospel of endurance preached;
The lute of Afric's tribe, tho' oft beseeched,
In all its wild, sweet warblings never swelled.
And yet when Freedom's lispings o'er it stole,
Soft as the breath of undefiled morn,
A wand'ring accent from its strings would stroll—
Thus was our Simpson, man of song and soul,
And stalwart energies, to bless us born.
When all our nation's sky was overcast
With rayless clouds of deepening misery,
His soaring vision mounted thro' the blast,
And from behind its gloom approaching fast,
Beheld the glorious Sun of Liberty.
He sang exultant: "Let her banner wave!"
And cheering senates, fired by his zeal,
Helped snatch their country from rebellion's grave
Looked through brave tears upon the injured slave,
And raised the battle-arm to break his gyves of steel.
But hushed the bard, his harp no longer sings
The woes and longings of a shackled mind;
For death's cold fingers swept its trembling strings,
And shut the bosom of its murmurings
Forever on the hearing of mankind.
The bird that dips his flight in noonday sun,
May fall, and spread his plumage on the plain;
But when immortal mind its work hath done
On earth, in heaven a nobler work 's begun,
And it can never downward turn again.
Of him, whose harp then, lies by death unstrung—
A harp that long his lowly brethren cheered,
May'nt we now say, that, sainted choirs among,
An everlasting theme inspires his tongue,
Where slaves ne'er groan, and death is never feared?
Yes, he is harping on the "Sea of glass,"
Where saints begin, and angels join the strain;
While Spheres in one profound, eternal bass,
Sing thro' their orbs, illumined as they pass,
And constellations catch the long refrain.
TO THE STUDENT.
Who flees the regions of the lower mind,
Where these distempers breathe on every wind:
Infectious dogmatisms, noxious hate,
Old snarly spleen, and troublesome debate,
Dull bigotry, and stupid ignorance,
Proud egotism, empty arrogance,
And famous hollowness, and brilliant woe—
And would to knowledge's high places go,
Must first in humble prayer approach the Throne
Of the Almighty Mind, and there make known
The purposes that swell an honest heart;
Then on the path before him, meekly start:
Asking of others who have been that way,
What of the country, and what of the day?
Being certain ever to give earnest heed
To where the steps of hoar experience lead.
Mark him who ventures these means to despise,
And tho' his works in gloomy grandeur rise,
Awe strike all earth, and threaten e'en the skies;
Yea, "tho' he flourish like a green bay tree,"
His life will a stupendous [ stupeduous ] failure be.
Tis vain to soar aloft on borrowed wing,
Or drink success from favor's flowing spring.
Let him who journeys upward, learn the way,
By toiling step by step, and day by day.
Each hardship mounted, easier makes the next,
And leaves his pathway by one less perplext.
Lo! where yon dreamer looks on glory's hill,
Hopes to ascend without the manly will,
Bends round and round some open pass to try
With easy access, and ascend on high;
Waits for some helper till the day is past,
And night o'ertakes a sycophant at last.
But honest courage, see with manful strides,
Walks on and enters at the steepest sides,
Climbs long and slowly up his rugged path,
Awaits no aid, relies on what he hath,
Grows independent as his way proceeds,
As progress roughens, less the distance heeds,
Till lo! the utmost hights his footsteps meet,
With fames and fortunes lying at his feet.
Then Kings delight to honor Glory's son,
And loud applauses in his footsteps run.
Then mankind crave the favor of his eyes,
And heap his lasting tributes to the skies.
Written for the Zanesville (O.,) Courier.
CUSTAR'S LAST RIDE.
Forth on the fatal morn,
Proud as the waves of Horn
Rode the cavalier;
Followed by gallant men,
Far in a rocky glen
To disappear.
"Halt!" bands of Sioux are seen
O'er all the dark raine,
Crouched in numbers vast;
"Halt!" and a hush, "Prepare!"
"Charge!" and the very air
Starts at the blast.
Long waves of horsemen break,
And hoofy thunders wake
On the steep glen sides.
Back roll the columns brave,
Back in a smoky grave,
Each hero rides.
"Ready!" their chieftain cries,
Steady his eagle eyes
Sweep the dark ground o'er.
Slowly the lines re-form,
6
Slowly returns the storm,
Yet dreadful more.
"Charge!" is the proud command,
Onward the daring band
Like a torrent dash;
On heaving gorges long,
On groaning rocks among,
With tempest crash.
Up from their ferny beds
Dart fields of pluming heads,
As if hideous earth,
Out of her rocky womb,
Out of an army's tomb,
Doth give them birth.
"Rally!" but once is heard,
"Rally!" and not a word,
The brave boys rallying, speak.
Lightnings of valiant steel
Flash fast; the columns reel,
Bend—reel and break!
"Stand!" cries their Custar proud,
"Stand!" in the battle cloud
Echoes high around.
Answers the sabre's stroke,
Tho' in black waves of smoke
His fair form 's drown'd.
7
Firece hordes of painted braves
Melt down, for well behave
Horse and cavalier:
As round their chief they fall,
Cheered by his clarion call,
From front to rear.
No more their leader calls,
Pierced 'mid his men he falls,
But sinks breathing, "Stand!"
And where the hero lies,
Each soldier till he dies,
Fights hand to hand.
SONNET.—THE MONTENEGRIN.
Undaunted watcher of the mountain track,
Tho' surging cohorts like a sea below,
Against thy cliff-walled homes their thunders throw;
Proud, whilst thy rocky fastness answers back
The fierce, long menace of the Turk's attack,
Thy eagle ken above the tumult flies,
8
The hostile plain spurns, and its prowess black,
And lights on strongholds terraced in the skies;
There thou wilt quicker than the roe-buck bound,
If bolder dangers mount to force thy pass;
But not till thou a signal brave hast wound,
That hears responses from each peak around,
And calls thy comrade clans-in-arms, to mass
In high defence, when battle stern begins—
Then who can conquer the Montenegrins?
SOLON STILES. Humorous.
To town one day rode Solon Stiles,
O'er weary roads and rocky miles,
And thro' long lanes, whose dusty breath,
Did nearly smother him to death;
By ragged fences, old and brown,
And thro' great tall woods up and down.
Wide orchards robed in red and white,
Were singing on his left and right;
The forests carroled by his way,
The grass was chirping, green and gay,
And wild flow'rs, sweetest of their race,
9
Like country maids of bashful face,
Peeped thro' the briery fences nigh,
With bright hues in each timid eye.
The farm cows whisked in their cool nook,
And splashed within their peaceful brook;
And on his fence, beneath the shade,
The plow boy's pipe shrill music made.
Stiles saw all this, but what cared he,
When he was going the town to see?
The country he had always seen,
But into town had never been.
So on he rode, with head on high,
And great thoughts roaming thro' the sky,
Not caring what he trotted by.
A little mule he sat astride,
With ropes for stirrups o'er him tied,
In which huge boots, as red as clay—
Red as a fox, some folks would say—
Swung loosely down, and dangled round,
As if in hopeless search of ground.
At first, when from the woods he rode,
And high in sight his small mule trode,
Rough seas of smoke rolled on his eye,
Great dizzy houses reared on high,
With steeples banging in the sky,
Then Solon stopped and said, "Umph, my!"
0
And next, a river deep and wide,
With houses floating up its tide
He met, and paused again to look,
And then to move on undertook.
And spurred and spurred, but looked around,
And lo! in deep amazement found
His small mule stuck, and as he spurred
The more, the thing's ears only stirred.
"Hullo!" a swarm of blubbies cried,
"Whip on the critter's hairy side!"
At this the mule insulted grew,
Took up its ears, and fairly flew,
Till near a great white bride it drew.
Across the bridge rode Solon Stiles,
By dusty shops and lumber piles,
And where tall houses o'er him stood,
Like cliffs within his native wood.
And furnaces with firey tongues,
And smoky throats and iron lungs,
Like demons coughed, and howled, and roared,
And fire from out their bowels poured.
Now on and on, up Sailor street,
The donkey whirled his rattling feet,
While either sidewalk loud upon
A swarm of oaths were chorused on.
One tall boy, in this surging sea
1
Of rags and young profanity,
High o'er the rest, on awkward shanks,
Like stilts, led on the swelling ranks.
His deep throat like a fog horn blew,
Till lesser blasts their aid withdrew.
Then Stiles communed thus with his mule:
"My! listen what a cussin' school
This town lets out to fill the ears
Of God with! My! them babies swears!"
Meanwhile there came a light brigade,
To at the donkey's heels parade,
Till up before and then behind,
His honor flew and then combined,
An old Dutch waltz and new quick-step,
That half a square of urchins swept,
As fast as leaves were ever seen,
Brushed by a whirlwind from the green.
The tall commander now in front,
Led oathing, as his pride was wont,
The new assault, when stock still stood
The mule away not half a rood;
For lo! with tomahawk in hand,
Before a neighb'ring cigar stand,
He saw a savage; to describe
A chieftain of some bloody tribe.
At Solon straight he raised a blow
2
And strained with all his might to throw,
But stayed his rage, for he beheld,
That with hot rage the donkey swelled.
Ah! Solon felt his blood run cold,
For oft his gran'dad him had told
Of Indians in an early day,
Beside the bockwoods cotter's way,
Skulking to on some settler fly,
And scalp him ere he'd time to die.
"Throw if you dare!" aloud he cried,
And slid down at his donkey's side.
At this he saw the savage stare,
And forthwith threw his coat off there.
With club in hand, the first he found,
Then on the foe at one great bound
He flew, and hard began to pound;
When thus abroad-brimmed vender fat,
Began to interview the spat:
"Vat vas-yer dun, yer grazy ding;
Schoost schtop, yer petter don't py jing!
Schoost vat yer broke my zine mit, aye,
Eh! petter yer don't, yer go avay!"
"Well!" Solon thought, "If this is town,
I'll give you leave to knock me down
If I ain't lost; no, this ain't me,
3
No, town ain't what it seems to be,
Yes, here I am, and this is me,
But town 's not what it seems to be!"
THE THUNDER STORM.
Lo! how the Heavens ponder now,
They look so still and moody!
And every leaf, and every bough,
Are in a dark deep study.
The very air has hushed its breath,
And pauses in its hushing,
To hear the clouds that still as death,
Are out of darkness rushing.
The lightnings in their vivid wrath,
The waving hills a starting,
Deep thro' the cloud-sea cleave a path,
From shore to shore a darting,
Loud thunders roll within the flood,
And night peers on with wonder,
And seems to sigh, in pensive mood,
And whisper, "hear it thunder!"
Again the thunders shriek aloud,
Far o'er the distance roaring,
And now from every breaking cloud,
The sluicy floods are pouring.
Upon the roof, the dancing drops
Come down with splash and clatter,
The lightnings glare, their music stops—
Now louder 'gins to patter;
As if to catch its breath, the rain
Were, when it thundered, pausing,
Then rushing on to make again
The time it had been losing.
TO BABY'S CANARY, ACCIDENTALLY KILLED.
Thou tiny cheer,
So welcome wast thou here,
Coming to our home with baby bright,
To make our hearts glad, and our burdens light;
We hoped that thou and he
Would merry playmates be.
Thy voice, sweet bird,
And baby's chirp we heard,
But only knew that both must happy be,
But how much happier were both, thought we,
If thou wast older grown,
And baby thee had known!
Now baby sweet,
Looks at thy little feet,
And holds thy fallen plume in his wee hands;
Thy mournful fate, it seems he understands.
Oh! we are sad to see
Him gaze at us—then thee!
THE DESERTED ROAD.
Away thro' the blue distant hills,
Thou windest, deserted old Road;
By farm houses brown and gray mills
And log huts, the woodman's abode.
Since enterprise with iron speed,
Steams on over mountain and plain,
Industry of thee hath no need,
And leaves thee washed red by the rain.
But such was not always the case,
For yonder where wanes the ago,
Loud Travel with bright, hopeful face,
Rolled over thee proudly but slow.
Then rudeness with plenty was blest,
And health was the consort of toil;
Then "far as the East from the West,"
Was business from panic's turmoil.
But fast times have lured with great shows,
The simple from certainty's shore,
To where wealth into wealth only flows,
And scorns the bare hands of the poor.
Alas! since we all can't be rich,
Allow the poor poverty's ways;
Contentment will bring all that which
Wealth finds in her wasteful displays.
The orbit too great for the sphere,
Speeds motion too fast or too slow;
Let poverty learn to dwell where
Fair Plentitude's hilltops are low.
Ambition deceives with a smile,
Those who in the gust of the times,
Instead of the sure calm of toil,
Would rush into wealth-blooming climes.
To speed on thro' life's a mistake,
To reach our desires too soon;
The charm of expecting will break,
And bring on our night before noon.
Our pleasures reaped singly are best,
More lasting by far gathered slow;
The fields in sweet flowers are drest,
That come in their seasons—then grow.
The many old pleasures that die,
Make but the sparse new that remain,
Which none but proud fortune can buy,
While nothing the poor can retain.
We want on the wasting old Road,
To wake dusty travel once more,
To people each wayside abode,
And drive business up to each door.

OLD ABE, THE WAR EAGLE OF WISCONSIN.
Heard ye of "Old Abe," the war eagle who went
From his home by the Lakes to the far sunny coasts,
To share the brave fortunes of that regiment
Which numbered the Eighth in Wisconsin's proud hosts?
When army clouds mingled in that civil storm
Which hung o'er the Nation in deep low'ring gloom,
Above a horizon of breastworks his form,
The emblem of Liberty, proudly did plume.
Away in the dimness of uncertain strife
He spread his bold flight towards Victory's sky—
Tho' treason smote hard at the National life—
And soared to her parapets looking on high.
From whence mangled Slavery, low at the feet
Of proud stamping battle, he stooped then to spurn,
And homeward flew back with the brave boys to meet
The loved ones who waited? wanted? [ wainted ] to hail their return.
Written for the Zanesville (O.,) Courier.
PROSPERITY AND ADVERSITY.
When first the young year inhales the sweetened air,
And painted landscapes kiss her tender feet,
The constant throat of music everywhere
Is burdened with her meed of praises sweet.
The clear brook panting from the ivied steep,
A crystal tribute sings within the dell;
And in the branchy wood secluded deep
Soft echo marks the sounds that please her well.
Till blooming Summer drops her latest charms,
Contentment tunes her reed in labor's ear;
Till russet plenty crowns the joyous farms,
The tongue of greetings hails the jovial year.
But when the sullen North begins to wail,
Old friends forsake her, leaving one by one;
Till all untended in her leafless vale,
The naked year is left to die alone.
Then saddened blasts convey her snowy bier,
And only blustry storm above her weeps,
While mournful woods attempt a feeble cheer,
And cold drear suns but glance at where she sleeps.
Written for the Zanesville (O.,) Courier.
A DREAM OF GLORY.
True glory on the earth is seldom seen,
Tho' sought by many with a jealous eye;
For where the heavenly birth has ever been,
The heedless footsteps of the world pass by.
The fairest blooms are born of humble weeds,
That faint and perish in the pathless wood;
And out of bitter life grow noble deeds,
To pass unnoticed in the multitude.
But reared by care, within the garden neat,
Luxuriant chances beautify the whole;
While poison lurks beneath each painted sweet,
And shoots a sorrow thro' the admiring soul.
Poor homeless hearts, unpitied by mankind,
And fortunes shattered in the adverse blast,
Are signals that have marked the march of mind,
Through boasted civ'lization's glorious past.
The dauntless will that scorns threat'ning defeat,
And breaks thro' penury's strong prison bars;
Can plant on triumphs proud his tow'ring feet,
And walk a shining highway to the stars.
MORTON.
Freedom, thy son is dead!
Once more the solemn tread
Of the long, slow cortege echoes to throbs
Of a nation's heart, and a great people's sobs
Around their leader's bier,
Burst on the sorrowing ear.
The lips of mirth are still,
And the eyes of beauty fill
With big tears;
The voice of love is low,
The hands of trade move slow,
And toil wears
A deep grief on his brow.
The tongues of sad bells cleaving
To the roofs of their mouths speak not;
And music's bosom heaving
Beneath its burden is silent.
Fair Indiana weeps,
The central mourner of a group of States,
That come with tears to shed
Around the mighty dead.
Alas! poor Indiana!
Too late in him who sleeps,
Thou see'st a noble son,
So soon "worn out" and done!
His voice is hushed forever in thy gates.
Alas! poor Indiana!
Now is a time for memory and tears,
And lessons that fall from the lips of years.
Sit down in the shadow that like a dark pall
From this sad event doth over thee fall,
With a hand on thy heart, and a hand on thy head,
And mourn the great loss in the glorious dead.
Thou hast sisters who may withthee mourn,
But none for thee, for none thy loss have borne.
Now is a time for reflection.
A star has gone down.
But the light that shone,
Yet lingers on our sight;
And we turn in the direction
In which we last saw it going,
And pensively pause, scarce knowing
That all around is night.
Weep for Indiana!
Ye her sisters who gave
Our flag an arm of help in peril's hour:
And raised the injured slave
From iron heeled oppression's galling power.
Weep, States, for Indiana!
Her Morton saved her, when she strove the awful leap
Into Rebellion's vortex dread to take.
The rocky jaws of ruin gaping deep
Beneath, began her head to dizzy make;
And wild hallucinations that did rise
From slavery's hell of wrongs had sealed her eyes
To danger; on the brink a moment, lost
To Freedom's sweet entreating voice, she tossed
Her tresses back, and in fair frenzy gazed
Upon our glorious flag; a mad cry raised,
And sprang for death; but seized by her great son,
Who to the awful rescue swift had run,
And forced in herculean arms away,
She mourns him, clothed in her right mind to-day.
Toll the bells for a nation's sorrow,
Toll slow, toll slow!
Chant songs of a people's sorrow,
Chant low, chant low.
Behold the great man borne
Towards the waiting tomb!
Open earth! Give him room!
Environed in the gloom
That lowers, mourn, people! mourn!
And with the solemn boom
Of cannon, and the knells
Of sad sorrowing bells,
Proclaim, proclaim his doom!
His glory was to serve his State—
She gave him none;—he was born great.
In his country's woe he found his own,
His weal in his country's weal,
Self in his great works never was known—
A patriot true as steel.
Born to rule, he knew the reins,
And knew the rod, and spared no pains
In using either, when they need be.
As restless as the uncontented sea,
He knew no stand still.
Stronger forever growing he
Was in man will.
He was the lion who could awe the weak
By lying still in massive dread reserve,
Or fly upon the strong opposer's neck
With scornful glare, and blows of iron nerve.
And sun ne'er looked upon a day,
Since our Republic tore away
Her arms from Britain's clutch,
That would not have seen him in front,
As in our times his life was wont;
The elements were such
In him, and so combined
Were all the powers of his vast mind.
His was no warrior's wreath—
He not on cannon's breath
O'er red fields rode to death
And immortality;
But strong for liberty
He rose in dreadful might—
Dreadful because of right—
And with the weapons bright
That genius gave her favorite son,
He dealt dismay and death to foes
Far mightier than those
Who dare the flash of steel and reeking gun.
When human slav'ry struggled to extend
Its snaky coil round California's coasts,
And thro' our trembling land from end to end,
Flaunting Secession made his open boasts,
He met the hissing wrong,
And cool, and brave, and strong,
Drove back its forked tongue.
When loyal heads hung down,
'Neath mad opinion's frown,
And tongues more fearful froze;
His was to oppose
With clearest words of stone,
Hewn from the loyal block,
Whose meaning always known,
With true energy thrown,
Smote like the rock.
When freedom's columns waved,
And friends of the enslaved
Aghast fell back,
His courage knew no lack—
He hurried to the van,
The thickest dangers braved,
And e'er the battle saved;
So nobly he behaved—
The cause lived in the man.
He could endure, rebuke, compel, entreat,
Forbear, defy, but could not know defeat.
First always in the right,
Doing with all his might,
And last to yield the fight,
His friends learned to depend upon him,
And his foes feared to rush upon him,
And both joined to wonder at him,
And slander ceased to thunder at him,
And envy ceased to sneak behind him,
And everywhere applause would find him,
Till rumor held her speech before him;
And now he's gone, we all adore him.
Two there were who fought
Our struggles dire;
One in the battle's hell,
Met by destruction's yell,
And the death rain of shot and shell,
For his country strove;
One the great work of love
With his mind's arms wrought.
While war in the far-off South
Mowed fields of death at the cannon's mouth;
His breath of fire and hail
Was not more dreadful than [ that ] the wail
Of want in the North, whose shiv'ring blast,
To mothers' hearts, and children's homes laid waste.
When the disconsolate East was blowing,
And not a spray nor leaf of cheer was flowing
With life's heavy stream;
And when the harsh skies hissing, snowing,
And low and dark and sullen growing,
Extinguished sun's last gleam.
When little bare foot want was going
From door to door;
Her withered empty hands a showing,
Her eyes running o'er—
Telling of a father dead,
Who for his country had bled;
And of a sick mother's bed,
Begging a crumb of bread;
When wretchedness her bare arms throwing
Around her children, looked thro' tears
And murmured in her country's ears
To help her in her sore distress
Feed those the war left fatherless;
When this hour came, the darkest hour
That e'er upon our flag did lower,
God called His man, as best He knows,
God called His man, and Morton rose.
Like some vast cliff whose tow'ring form
Awe, strikes but shelters from the storm,
He rose, to us a strong defense,
A tow'r of help, and good immense.
With Indiana on his back,
Her Legislature off the track,
And half the members pulling back,
He rose, the awful advocate,
And on the right road dragged his State.
Tho' wealth hugged his Secession gold,
And with a nod the weak controlled,
Things had to move when he took hold,
And shook to life the feeble souled.
Statesman, patriot, sire, bear him away;
Inter him with a nation's honors to-day!
He has seized slavery with fearless hands,
And thrown her gloomy castle from the sands,
His blows of massive wisdom strong,
Have hurled to earth the tow'ring wrong,
But 'neath its falling columns crushed,
His matchless voice in death is hushed.
Beauty, cover him with flowers of his native shore.
Valor, with unfading laurels cover him o'er.
Freedmen, bring your tears,
And till life's last years
Reach the echoless shore,
Tell his great deeds o'er.
And soldiers, wherever our standard flies;
Or where thou goest neath foreign skies,
Behold thy friend in death low lies!
Friend when you fronted the battle,
Friend when the cannon's rattle
Mowed a harvest of death,
Friend when "worn out" you reeled
Home from the bloody field
To rest beneath
An humble shed,
Scanty of comfort, scanty of bread—
Weep for him soldiers! Weep for your friend!
And forget not till your lives shall end,
To honor the noble dead.
YE BARDS OF ENGLAND.
England, cannot thy shores boast bards as great,
And hearts as good as ever blest a State?
When arts were rude and literature was young,
And language faltered with an uncouth tongue;
When science trembled on her little hight,
And poor religion blundered on in night;
When song on Rome's vast tomb, or carved in Greek,
Like epitaphs with marble lips did speak,
Thy Chaucer singing with the Nightingales,
Poured forth his heart in Canterbury tales,
With rude shell scooped from English pure, and led
The age that raised the muses from the dead.
And gentle Thompson, to thy mem'ry dear,
Awake his lyre and sang the rolling year.
The dropping shower the wild flower scented mead,
The sober herds that in the noon shade feed,
The fragrant field, the green and shady wood,
The winding glen, and rocky solitude,
The smiles of Spring and frowns of Winter gray,
Alike employed his pure and gentle lay.
The wrath of gods, and armies dread suspense,
Celestial shouts and shock of arms immense,
In all his song ne'er move us to alarm,
But earth's pure sounds and sights allure and charm.
To Missolonghi's chief of singers too,
Unhappy Byron is a tribute due.
A wounded spirit, mournful and yet mad,
A genius proud, defiant, gentle, sad.
'Twas he whose Harold won his Nation's heart,
And whose Reviewers made her fair cheeks smart;
Whose uncurbed Juan hung her head for shame,
And whose Mazzeppa won unrivaled fame.
Earth had no bound for him. Where'er he strode
His restless genius found no fit abode.
The wing'd storm and the lightning tongued Jungfrau,
Unfathomable Ocean, and the awe
Of Alpine shades, the avalanche's groan,
The war-rocked empire and the falling throne,
Were toys his genius played with. Britain, then
Urn Byron's dust—a prodigy of men.
But Shakspeare, the inimitable boast
Of everybody and of every coast;
The man, whose universal fitness meets
Response in every heart of flesh that beats,
No tongue can tell him. One must feel his hand
And see him in his plays, to understand.
All thought to him intuitively's known,
The prate of clowns, and wisdoms of the throne,
The sophist's puzzles and the doctor's rules,
The skill of warriors and the cant of fools.
When Shakespeare wrote, the tragic muse saw heights,
Before nor since ne'er tempted in her flights.
THE GREAT STRIKE.
"Strike! Strike! Stop! Stop!" What mean these shouts that rise—
This great commotion throughout all the land,
That chills the circling life of enterprise,
While lawlessness stalks forth with torch in hand?
The hands of Industry have to the head
(Aweary grown of swinging to and fro)
Without discretion's sober forethought said:
"We ought to be above, and you below."
Whenever Communism's snaky head
Is raised against the heel of Capital,
I want it crushed 'neath Law's majestic tread,
And yet would heed poor honest labor's call.
The cold long Winter fast is coming on,
His near approach makes sad the leafless year,
And deep snows soon the naked fields upon,
Will hush the voice of Autumn's latest cheer.
The burdened year will soon her treasures yield,
And pile our spacious barns from eaves to floor,
Then vagrant want in lanes and open field,
Can gather scanty sustenance no more.
The howling winds will drive before them then,
This drifting dust of Fortune's feet in clouds;
And hither thither into ditch and den
Mis'ry and crime will rush in babbling crowds.
But while the desp'rate curse, while lewdness cries,
And shiftlessness ought justly to go bare,
Forget it not, full many a Lazarus lies
Before thy gate and needs a crumb of care.
While Wealth across his lordly arm will cast
The warmth of scores of God Almighty's poor,
Still houseless want must shiver in the blast,
And childhood's feet go bare from door to door.
While pride upon her easy finger wears
The bread of thousands in a brilliant stone,
The eyes of Wretchedness must stream with tears,
And groaning labor be content to groan.
Let heaven's light upon our nature shine,
Till ev'ry opaque spot with glory beams,
And want no longer at our feet can pine,
But happiness will flow in living streams.
THE TRAMP'S SOLILOQUY.
Had I an envied name and purse of gold,
My friends were more than all my wants twice told;
Reduced to rags and born of title small,
Vast tho' my wants I have no friends at all.
Anxiety consumes away my years
And failure melts my manhood down in tears.
My down-cast eyes some guilt seem to disclose
And I'm shut in a lazar house of woes.
I am not what I was, my drooping form
Partakes of what is loathsome in the worm.
Pittiedbut not respected I may be,
I shun myself, and e'en the dogs shun me.
The rich to chide the poor may adulate
The few torn pleasures of a scanty state;
But cold experience tells her story plain,
Want breeds with bitterness and brings forth pain.
A HINT.
Who seeks to show another's fault will find
In self a greater shown,
But he that is to faults of others blind,
But covers thus his own.

A Golden House on golden columns raised,
In redly tinted skies bespangled blazed;
With opening doors diffused a gladsome light,
And glorious gleams refreshed the Freedman's sight.
This was the Almighty's work; no fictitious sky,
That held this burnished Temple flaming high
Like precious jewels in their glittering ray
On beauty's bosom dazzling in the day;
Outvieing e'en the great Ephesian dome,
In lofty rearing the emancipated home,
“To wake the soul and living fire impart,
To raise the mind and mend the heart,
To make our people in conscious virtue bold”
Remember well the past, and know what they behold.
This is my aim to move by Heaven above,
The Freedman's pride, the Freedman's love.
Some angel guide me now while I write,
That which an angel only can indite;
Of liberty's celestial fire, sinking ne'er in vain,
“Truth crushed to earth shall rise again;”
For phœnix like she mounts on wings of flame,
And soars and shines another yet, the same.
When the swelling tide had sunk the Freedmen down,
When Heaven was darkened by a dreadful frown,
When thunderbolts had pierced with fearful flare,
When earth's foundations trembled everywhere
When we were wont, to whom the boon was given.
E'en we the free who in prayer had striven,
To quail before the cruel, sanguinary strife;
Then lo! there flashed into a rosy life,
An arch celestial o'er the storm strewn skies,
Traced there in love before our shrinking eyes.
Should not this wipe away all tears,
And banish all our doubts as well as fears?
“O, ne'er did mariner long lost at sea,
With no benignant star to point his course,
Hail with more rapture the first gleam of land,
Than I from War's seamed visage and wild glance,
Turn to the blue eyes of maternal Peace.”
So sang our own New England muse,
In strains so sweet they did diffuse,
The spirit of our new born life;
New born amid the carnage and the strife.
Our paths were rough and all unknown,
The rising mists had strangely strown,
And wound about our darksome way,
Their hideous wreaths of clammy spray.
But oh, the blessed truth; our toils were past,
The gathered clouds dissolved; behold at last
The zephyrs whisper and the pale stars shine,
With home lights streaming through the vine.
Before the gentle breeze the silver lilies bend,
Faint with sweet odors the night winds ascend,
Heavy with fragrance, with the honeydews wet,
From beds of violets and mignonnette.
At home, in rest, in soft, mellifluous notes,
On the still air, the plaintive melody floats.
A sweet voice rises through the starlight dim,
The song we love, the Freedman's Evening Hymn,
For by the rustic cottage, e'en at the cottage door,
We'll listen to the story, till we hear it o'er and o'er.
And thus the tale, the maiden did recite,
Unceasingly of freedom, from morn till dead of night.
“We all believed that God did know,
About the freedom that we longed for so;
I knew he'd find some way to show
Which path in triumph we should go.

We were living in our cabin, down by a little rill;
With our father and our mother,
Our sister and our brother,
And anxious for each other,
In that cabin by the rill.

But mark the dreadful time, our family came to know;
While we our tasks were plying,
Our mother she was sighing
And the news along was flying,
From the valleys down below.

We heard the tramp of men marching to and fro;
And the ringing of the bells,
With the whistling of the shells,
And the deafening shrieks and yells,
Were the sounds of coming woe.

Down went our cabin now, like chaff before the wind,
And my father and my mother,
With my sister and my brother,
In the smoke they all did smother,
As I was left behind.

Ah! how I cried for mercy, as I was struggling there;
Their cruelty unrelenting,
And no hand then preventing,
While I was sore lamenting,
My danger and despair.

Then the soldiers of the Union rushed quickly in to save,
And amid the dreadful clashing,
With the rushing and the dashing,
In the fire's fitful flashing
I was rescued by the brave.

They bore me o'er the river, across to freedom's shore
My senses they were reeling,
Yet the truth it was revealing,
Unto my wounded feeling;
That I was slave no more.

II.

This is an of't told tale, such as thousands tell,
Of the war's most painful story, in which so many fell.
But these are notes that ne'er will dull with rust,
The sweetest chords are often clogged with dust.
We pipe and pipe again the self-same strains,
While sounds of desolation come in sad refrains.
On through the world we go, with listening ears,
Each longing for the music, which he never hears;
Each sighing for a word of tender praise,
A word of love to cheer our busy days;
Thus on we tread and thus each one his fate fulfils,
Waiting for heavenly music, from the heavenly hills.
But is the Summer o'er?—the Summer gone?
And have our hopes become forlorn?
All the long bright days have they fled?
Leaving no crown for Liberty's head?
The sky is covered with a smoky veil,
The winds of Autumn begin to wail.
Nil Desperandum;—never despair nor faint;
But treasure up the wisdom of the poet saint.
There's life within our life, a secret spring,
Wide from our action and a separate thing.
Man mixes with his kind;—but who shall tell
His thoughts that sadden or his hopes that swell?
Know thou, that all mankind are children all
Of one Almighty parent whom they call
By divers names;—whose essence varies not:
Nor is his care confined to any spot.
Though scattered far and wide by evil fate,
The common heritors of one estate,
We should with one united effort strive
In the same household all once more to hive.
Our faith in him, 'tis ours to evince thus,
And love our brethren as he loved us.
Thus loving God the Father for Christ's sake,
Unto our hearts as equal brethren take,
His erring children, men of every land,
All joined in one fraternal band.
Now the country groans and travaileth in pain;
Was the War not ended and reconstruction vain?
But then our God will hear the Freedman's groan,
Of man and all Creation thou art the Lord alone.
The same “ethereal firmament on high,”
The same great constellations in the sky,
The stellar wonders in that wondrous frame,
God's great original truths proclaim.
Year succeeds year in one unceasing round;
Summer and winter and each season's found
Following each other from day to day,
And so shall be, till all shall pass away.
But the struggle comes and strides apace,
The strife's renewed against the Freedman's race.
Hark! from the mountains down to the sea,
There's a deep portentous murmuring, 'tis among the free,
Like the roar of mighty waters o'er the troubled earth,
Or the crashing of the tempest as it rushes into birth.
'Tis the voice of the Freedmen in their agonizing cry,
They're striking for their rights, for to conquer or to die.
Hark! 'tis like an earthquake! and pallid now with fear,
Onward charge the ranks of the sable musketeer.
Onward they come and each foot print impressed,
On the grass of the plain, or the masquerader's breast,
Is a drain for the life blood of the Freedman or his foe;
On! On! To the breach!—what care we more to know?
Who falls in this last struggle, for every man that fights,
He is a warrior for the Freedman's civil rights.
A fallen martyr to those civil rights,—his name,
Will be graven 'mong the highest on the temple of fame.

“Ask not the Freedman how he feels,
Left in that dreadful hour alone;
Perchance his courage stoops and reels,
Perchance a courage not his own
Braces his mind to desperate tone.”

Such were the shouts from Trenton's reddened field
The White men's leagues cry,—Black men, will ye yield?
As down to the valley the rattling platoon
Went plunging and prancing.—But soon
Sound the groans of the dying men's breath;
They grappled the foe, with the grapple of death.

'Tis true they were vanquished, they bent to the hail;
But still shall the boast of the Southerner fail.
How dare they to crush the brave sons of the free?
Lo!—they're coming again!—Now brothers, we
Can see their lines gleaming like rebel array,
The Klans and the Leaguers all eager for prey.

Yes!—now from Coushatta sways the sulphurous cloud;
Sweeps o'er the land with the gloom of the shroud.
The Freedman is dying 'mid carnage and gore
God of our fathers!—hast thou given us o'er
In this bloody embrace, to these tigers a prey?
Let vengeance be thine!—thou wilt repay.
Away with the thought!—for this is no dream;
They war against civil rights!—that is their theme.
But soon will they cringe, as we know full well
The crisis has come and the tolling bells tell
We will not yield, not in fear of the grave,
The rights that belong to the free and the brave.

III.

Heaven decrees no more, than what is just,
In that it has decreed its love for us.
Our trials and our sufferings, were ne'er decreed amiss
They seal the bond of years, long years of waking bliss.
Oh cast thine eyes of mercy on the misery of the land;
Destroying angel,—hold! enough! stay thy smiting hand!
Grant the supplications. Lord, like grateful incense borne,
Towards thy seat of Mercy, from all our hearts forlorn.
Father! thy sacred word, revives our hopes anew;
For steadfast faith and trust doth confirm it true.

“Be not dismay'd if evil sometimes seem
To overcome the good;—God will redeem
The right at last. His justice never fails
To make an even balance in his scales.”

Emancipation's temple, on golden pillars cast,
Memorial of God's goodness in the past,
Memorial of our champion and chief friend,
And far as our great brotherhood shall extend
Remembrance of his great love is given,
Eternally by fame, by every breath from Heaven.
Upon that temple's dome is Sumner's name enshrined,
On every Freedman's heart, on the tablet of his mind.

“The sweet remembrance of the just
Shall flourish when he sleeps in dust.”

Yes!—Sumner's gone!—he's veiled from mortal sight,
He ne'er was wrong whose life was in the right.
In truth he was a man!—a legacy he leaves to all,
Oh say!—on whom shall Sumner's mantle fall?
Serene he lifts to heaven those closing eyes,
Then for the Freedman lisps a prayer and dies.
'Twas then the Freedman trembling, wept, “Farewell!”
For Freedom shrieked!—Great Sumner's knell!
“Oh ever hallowed be his verdant grave!
There let the laurel spread the cypress wave
Thou lovely Spring!—bestow to grace his tomb,
Thy sweetest fragrance, and thy earliest bloom;
There let the tears of heaven descend in balm!
There let the poet consecrate his palm!
Let honor ever bless the holy ground,
And shades of sainted heroes watch around.”
Fear not; for time unfolds an era new and bright
The day already brightens with a calm and joyous light.
Hear the voice of the people uniting in one cry,
And the shouts of the Freedman ringing out on high.
Freedom! Freedom! They're struggling for their rights,
The people are in tears from the saddening sights;
Without their rights, their freedom's but a name,
Naught but pariahs, branded with ill fame.
With tardy steps Celestial Justice comes;—but sure,
Unerring is her bolt; there's none that can endure
Where it falls, there will the ruin be.
The guilty shrink, but no cunning ne'er shall free
Them from eternal pain. The ascending glory of a happier day,
Bends despotism down and drags it to decay.
Oh! had a seraph from some distant sphere,
Some few years since have made a sojourn here,
He would have seen proscription in our southern lands,
And thronging slaves in droves and bands;
Human chattels! To be bartered and be sold,
God's image in exchange for filthy lucre;—gold!
Or sold on auction blocks within the crowded marts,
Piercing groans, streaming eyes, and rended, broken hearts.
Augmented by a conscious fact; his unrequited toil,
As 'fore the drivers cracking lash his blood bedewed the soil.

He would have seen the region bowing beneath its crimes,
And back to heaven flown. But now upon these times
The seraph might exclaim,—“Oh! what a change is this!
Methinks, I see a semblance here, of e'en supernal bliss
The vassals of the land from galling chains released;
And all the groans, the cries, and misery have ceased.
The earth is now resounding with their jocund glee
In strains of sweetest melody, the music of the free.
I see them marching on with bold, aspiring tread
In strides of civil progress. There is no fear or dread;
But all secure, they lift their banners and declare
Their rapturous joy. Let them now the way prepare
For equality and honor, for the boon of human rights,
For each and every privilege, and for those heavenly lights
To lead them in the way of truth.” He would say no more.
But should he come to-day, in sorrowing plight he'd soar;
And as Moses dashed the tables down upon Mt. Sinai's brow
When he beheld the Hebrew race, and saw them how
They worshiped the molten calf, their hands alone had cast.
So might the seraph, with a pealing trumpet blast
Proclaim!—“There is none whatever of inferior birth
That breathes or creeps upon this dust of earth,

IV.

No wretched creature of no wretched kind
Than man more weak, calamitous and blind.
There's revolution here!—there's a funeral pall!
There's a gloom o'ershadowing Freedom's hall!
Marks on the floor!—Life drops spilt!
A conflict rages!—There's war to the hilt!
O blind security! He in whose dread hand,
The lightnings vibrate, will not withstand
This trampling on his people. All, all, their rights
Must be to them extended;—or he will not fail
With fearful oracles to make more pale
Their white oppressors.”—With such words of love
He'd speed on his mission to the realms above.
With proud exultant voice, by no means premature,
We next unfold the scroll and behold the embrazure
Of the coming time.—We see the black man higher still,
With manly stride and gallant tread he climbs the hill
Of fame—He writes his name on honor's roll,
And dignifies his skin,—He stamps his deeds from pole
To pole upon liberty's smitten rock.—His praises sung
As he saves his sire's honor from defamation's tongue.
With scholastic polish in the ages future blaze,
He'll pour entrancing eloquence in the world's astonished gaze.
His flattened nose, his thickened lips, and even his kinky hair
Beneath a rude exterior, be admired everywhere.
While undeniable traits of his moral worth and truth
And an intellect none shall question, will forsooth
Shoot forth with grander evidence yet. The burnt cork face
With wild gesticulation and most risible grimace,
Under the wisdom of the day, will be banished from the stage,
And stand the prima facie proof, the justice of the age.
Black sons of freedom!—these halcyon days will soon have sway;
The beacon lights on the golden shore, the meridian sun of day
Will shed their splendors.—The chrysalis emancipates and frees
The butterfly—He will spread his wings upon the breeze,
And drinking nectar from the sweetest flowers,
Give God the praise for his unfolded powers.
His deeds shall be the subject of historian's praise
His heroism the theme of inspiration's lays.
For him the electric spark shall flash from shore to shore
And breathe his massive thoughts as they never breathed before
The sunlit and star paved sky;—the green clad earth
Shall his Alma Mater be,—The rippling river with bubbling mirth,
And the limpid springs by gentle zephyrs driven;
The babbling brooklets, roses bloom, and oaks by thunder riven,
Winter's frost, the glittering ice, and hoary moss-bound rocks,
Each shall his inspiration be. His knowledge then unlocks
Deep mysteries profound and teaches him to honor and adore
That great Eternal One, whose glory is forever more.
How many then will hang their heads in shame
When they behold the zenith of the black man's fame
To think they are the offsprings of the sires who did deny
To these same men their common civil rights.—They will decry
The truth, and swear their fathers anti-righters never were;
Repel the crushing charge;—the odium not incur.
Let every son and daughter of our chosen race,
Now raise their pæans high.—May redeeming grace
In sweetest accents swell; the welkin tuneful ring;
And all with one accord in thrilling concert sing:

“Bright is the beautiful land of our birth,
The home of the homeless all over the earth;
Oh!—let us ever with fondest devotion,
The freedom our fathers bequeathed us watch o'er;
'Till the Angel shall stand on the earth and the ocean,
And shout 'mid earth's ruins that Time is no more.”

HISTORICAL SKETCH 
--OF THE-- 
LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.
    MRS. JOSIE D.(HENDERSON) HEARD was born in Salisbury, North Carolina, October 11th, 1861. Her parents, Lafayette and Annie M. Henderson, though slaves, were nominally free, being permitted to hire their time and live in another City, Charlotte, North Carolina.
    At an early age, Josephine displayed her literary taste, and aptness to perform upon almost any musical instrument. As early as five years of age she could read, and was a source of general comfort to the aged neighbors, delighting to read the Scriptures to them.
    She received her education in the schools at Charlotte, and having passed through them with credit, was sent to the Scotia Seminary at Concord, North Carolina, spending several years there. Her desire was to reach even a higher plain, and she was next sent to Bethany Institute, New York, Passing with honors from its walls. She commenced teaching in the State which gave her birth; then in the State of South Carolina, at Maysville, Orangeburg and finally in Tennessee, at Covington, near Memphis.
    In October, 1881, she became acquainted with the Rev. W.H. Heard , (now Presiding Elder of the Lancaster District, Philadelphia Conference,) who was then in the U.S.R. Mail Service; and they were happily united in the Bonds of Matrimony in the year 1882. 
    Mrs. Heard evinced a fondness for poetry, and during her school days contributed to several leading evangelical periodicals. After her marriage she was encouraged by the Rt. Rev. Benj. Tucker Tanner, Rt. Rev. B. W. Arnett, and many other friends to give more time to it. At their solicitations she has ventured to bring to light these verses. She has some musical talent, having composed and written a piece of music which was played at the New Orleans Exposition, and which elicited much comment from the Democratic Press of the South.
                                                              W. H. H.
INTRODUCTION. 
Bishop Benj. Tucker Tanner, D.D.
    That he somewhat influenced the publication of " Morning Glories," gives the writer real pleasure; which is enhanced by the thought that he gladly accepted the invitation to write the Introduction.
    For quite a quarter of a century, he has had much to do with the literary life of the people with whom he is especially identified; as that life manifested itself in the production of papers, of monthly or quarterly magazines, of pamphlets and of books. He rejoices in the great progress made, both in quantity and quality. When he may be said to have begun his public literary career in 1868, there was scarcely more than two or three papers published by colored men. There are now quite as many hundred. Of magazines, there was none, now there are four. Of pamplets, upon very rare occasions, one was now and then issued. Now they appear, as do the leaves of autumn. And the same is true of books. A quarter of a century ago, a colored author was indeed a rara avis. Not so now, however, such individuals are fairly numerous.
    What is true of the colored literature of the country, as to quantity, is equally true as to quality. On this score the most rapid advancement has also been made. Incipient scholarship everywhere appearing upon the pages offered the public.
    On the line of Poetry, we as a people, give sufficient evidence to show that the Muse is indeed no respecter of persons. That he is equally an admirer of shade; and although at times compelled in his approaches to us, to walk in unbeaten paths, yet he condescendingly comes, and inspires a music as sweet as is the wild honey of unkept hives. If any doubt, let him read, " Morning Glories," to which these lines are to serve as an introduction. In rigid versification, the lines herein given, may here and there come short, but for brightness of imagination, for readiness of expression, and now and then for delicateness of touch, they are genuinely poetical; clearly evincing a talent of no mean order.
   We would wish that "Morning Glories" might be received in the houses of our millions; showing thereby the party of the second part among us, stands ready to support the party of the first part, in all that tends to redeem the good name of the Race.
RETROSPECT.
I SAT alone at my window,
   While the pattering raindrops brought
Along with their music upon the roof,
   A lengthy train of thought.
I stepped aboard of it quickly,
  And rapidly on I sped,
Away to the scenes of my childhood days.
  I followed where fancy led.
I roamed the fragrant meadow,
  And through the silent wood;
At last I came to the babbling brook,
  And sadly there I stood.
Into its clear water gazing
  I felt a strange, sweet spell
Enthral my being slowly
  As o'er my life it fell.
I saw in the waters merry,
  Dear faces of long ago,
That had drifted away on the sea of life,
  As the winds blew loud or low.
My brain grew dazed with horror,
  And my heart was wrung with pain;
Some barks were dashed on a rock-bound coast.
  They could not return again.
I saw the same old mill-pond,
  And beside it the noisy mill,
And once again I heard the bell
  Of the old Church on the hill.
There was the dear old School-House,
  The scene of my childhood joys,
And in the yard I romped among
  The happy girls and boys.
And once again came "May Day,"
  When the fields were dressed in green,
And roses shed their rich perfume,
  The children crowned me Queen.
I saw again our own sweet home
  Half hidden 'mong the trees,
My parents, brothers, sisters and I,
  As happy and busy as been.
Around the door of the homestead,
  The sweet Wistaria vines,
And on the old oak in the yard
  The clinging ivy twines.
There stands the grim old court-house,
  And the Jail with dingy cells,
And on the Church the old town-clock
  The fleeting moment tells.
Next I came to the old town Graveyard
  And entered with silent tread,
And dropped a tear o'er the grassy grave
  Of the peacefully sleeping dead.
TO WHITTER.
IN childhood's sunny day my heart was taught to love
Thy name, all other poet's names above,
And when to womanhood at last I came,
Behold the spark was fanned into a flame,
Nor did I dare presume that I should live,
And to the honored, white-haired poet give
My sentiment in rude constructed rhyme;
O, wondrous change wrought by the hand of time!
When he who came the slaves among to dwell,
From frigid Idaho (we loved him well),
Athirst for knowledge I stood at his side,
With quickening thought and eyes astonished, wide.
He nightly read, and held me on his knee,
From Whittier's "Snowbound" filling me with glee,
The seed sown by his hand in infant heart,
Has lived and grown, and cannot now depart.
Now to the sunset thou hast set thy face,
And silvery crown thy head doth grace;
The mind of fertile thought doth not decline
Preserved yet from the ravages of time
Since I can never hope my first desire,
To shake thy hand, which would my soul inspire,
Now e're yet "the cord is loosed or pitcher broken,
Grant me with thine own hand this little token:
Ere yet that hand by feebleness grows lame,
With condescension write for me they name.
WELCOME TO HON. FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 
Mt. Zion Church, March 5th. 1888. 
OUR hearts are filled with pride to-day— 
  We hail thee, Noble Sire, 
Stern prejudice is swept away 
  By Freedom's cleansing fire. 
And o'er this Southland you may roam, 
  With ne'er a cause to fear— 
We bid thee Welcome to our home, 
  Welcome, and right good cheer! 
From rugged Blue Ridge mountain peak, 
  To ocean's white crest wave: 
Even infant lips thy praises speak, 
  And boast thy deeds so brave. 
The bondsman's fetters long since broke 
  And tossed aside by thee, 
Thou hurledst off the cursed yoke, 
  And panted to be free. 
We see thee in thy cradle-bed, 
  Thy mother's pride and joy; 
When from oppression's hand you fled, 
  When but a strippling boy. 
Thou, Moses of the negro race, 
  This day we hail with pride; 
The day that brings us face to face, 
  And Douglass by our side. 
We note thy locks have turned to grey, 
  But note with swelling pride, 
For thou hast come a weary way 
  O'er troubles deep and wide. 
 
God led thee then, and leads thee now, 
  No longer art thou sad— 
And may many years yet crown thy brow, 
  To make thy people glad. 
THE PARTING KISS. 
WE were waiting at the station, 
  Soon the cars would surely start, 
Hearts beat high with love's emotion, 
  For we knew we soon must part. 
On dark lashes seemed to glisten 
  Tiny crystal tear drops shine; 
To the fond voice glad I listen, 
  While dear eyes look into mine. 
And the last words quickly spoken, 
  Darling still to me be true, 
Let your promise be unbroken, 
  For I will be true to you. 
Once I felt the soft hand tremble, 
  And my heart throbbed with its bliss; 
Lips that rose-buds did resemble, 
  Met in one last loving kiss. 
Sweet good-bye, do not forget me, 
  Spoken in the softest tone, 
In your mem'ry, precious keep me, 
  For my love is all your own. 
I will ever be brave-hearted—  
  Nothing shall your love efface; 
One last kiss and then we parted, 
  One last loving, long embrace. 
THE QUESTION. 
DOES he think of me in the merry throng 
  Which surrounds his board to-night? 
Is his love as true, and his faith as strong, 
  As it was at this morning's light? 
Am I first in his thought: is he still as fond; 
  And is his heart longing to flee 
From its weary thraldom, and burst its bond, 
  To spend but a moment with me? 
Can he look on the faces of women fair, 
  And turn from them all to me? 
From halls where sweet music is filling the air, 
  Would he come and be happy with me? 
From the feast of reason and flow of soul, 
  And walls resounding with glee; 
From the crimson goblet and flowing bowl, 
  Is he giving one thought to me? 
Ah! yes. on the wings of the night breeze come 
  Such tidings of comfort to me. 
Rest well, little Queen I his heart is thy throne, 
  Who sends this message to thee: 
"Thou need'st not fear, though in gilded halls, 
  Of pleasure and chivalry, 
Thy lover would'st fly from the mirthful walls, 
  To spend one sweet moment with thee." 
Yes, he thinks of me in the crowded mart, 
  And the thought cheers him on his way; 
I read in his eyes the desire of his heart, 
  As he passes me day by day. 
What more could I ask, what wish while I live, 
  Than the love he has lavished so free? 
This world has no worthier boon to give, 
  Than my handsome young lover to me. 
FAREWELL TO ALLEN UNIVERSITY.

WE leave thy courts to-day, 
  Joyful has been our stay, 
       Within thy walls. 
Hence lie our paths apart, 
  Tears will unbidden start, 
While we with aching heart 
  Shall leave thy halls. 
'Twas here our wont to meet, 
  Fondly each other greet, 
        Each rising day. 
United prayers ascend 
  For Teacher, Parent, Friend, 
And joyful notes would blend 
  In tuneful lay. 
Bright may thy glories shine, 
  On all who at thy shrine, 
        Will meekly stay. 
Loudly, thy praises tell! 
  Loud Hallelujahs swell! 
While we on earth shall dwell, 
        We homage pay. 
Dear "Allen," now to you, 
  Classmates and Teachers, too. 
        Farewell is said. 
Still on that brighter shore, 
  When all life's cares are o'er, 
We'll meet and part no more, 
       With Christ our head. 
NIGHT. 
THE shades of eve are quickly closing in, 
  And streaks of silver gild the eastern sky, 
Belated songsters have their vespers sung 
  With happy hearts and silvery noted tongue, 
The busy world has ceased its toil and din, 
  And guardian angels now their watch begin. 
All nature quiet save the sighing wind, 
  And distant murmur of the ocean wave, 
Which seem engaged a requiem to sing 
  O'er blighted hopes and expectations grave. 
The drooping heart its lonely vigil keeps, 
  Beside the tomb where proud ambition sleeps.
But memory bids defiance unto sleep, 
  And from her quiet chamber, see her creep, 
Away she flies o'er hill, and dale, and mead, 
  To find the Sacred City of the dead; 
Faint not, nor stops to seek a rest,          
  Till pillowed on some loved and lost one's breast.
THE PARTING. 
THE die is cast, and we must part, 
  Forgive me if I say we must; 
Must make again exchange of heart, 
  But never more exchange of trust. 
With faces cold and stern must meet, 
  While inward fires consume our souls, 
Must pass as strangers in the street, 
  While o'er our hope the death bell tolls. 
We met but a short while ago, 
  And all my sky was clouded o'er;
You loved, and scattered all my woe, 
  Loved as I ne'er was loved before. 
You taught my hungry heart to hope, 
  And filled love's chaliee to the brim, 
But hope must now in darkness grope, 
  And love's sweet sunshine e'er be dim. 
When eventide has wrapped the world, 
  In garments of a silvery sheen, 
And diamond studded skies unfurled 
  Their beauty fair to deck the Queen. 
Of night, as she shall joyous ride 
  In magic splendor on her way, 
Like modest sweet and haypy bride, 
  All glorious in her perfect sway. 
My thoughts unfettered fly to thee, 
  Untramelled by my heart's deep woe.
Though all our actions guarded be, 
  Love's tender voice still murmurs low.
And fans the embers into flame, 
  My heart thrills with its ecstacy 
At any mention of thy name 
  Forgets, and longs to be with thee. 
Yet we must smile and kiss the rod, 
  That strikes the blow and severs us, 
Must fix our hope on heaven and God, 
  Earth's joys are ever severed thus. 
Farewell, and though we parted be, 
  And parting brings us bitter pain, 
Someday we shall united be, 
  For we must hope to live again. 
When all our wrongs have righted been, 
  And crooked paths have been made straight, 
When from our joy shall drop the screen, 
  Which now is hung by cruel fate,
Then the full craving of each heart, 
  Is granted, we shall happy be 
When meeting we shall no more part, 
  In the blissful realm eternity. 
ASSURANCE. 
I KNOW that his eyes look into mine, 
  With a joy tongue cannot tell, 
And I drink of the cup of love's sweet wine, 
  And my heart says, "All is Well." 
I know my heart is all my own, 
  Enchained by love's sweet spell, 
That I reign as a Queen on a golden throne, 
  And my heart says all is well. 
HOPE 
HOPE! Thou vain, delusive maiden, 
  Every moment cometh laden, 
With some fresher, newer fancies, 
  Which before our vision glances, 
Filling hearts already burning 
  With a deeper, stronger yearning; 
Adding fuel to the fires, 
  Waking all the soul's desires. 
Nectar holdeth to our lip, 
  Yet forbiddeth us a sip. 
O, thou lovely, fickle jade, 
  Fools of men hast ever made. 
We thy fleeting footsteps follow, 
  O'er the mountain in the hollow; 
In the glade or through the dell 
  Captives bound by thy sweet spell. 
Tyrant Queen, what power is thine! 
  Prince and Peasant at thy shrine, 
For thy favor each imploring 
  Through thy coquettish alluring. 
Pointing with thy finger gentle 
  To fair Fame's or Croesus' temple, 
On thou leadest ever smiling 
  Over rugged roads beguiling. 
Youth and maiden, sire and sage, 
  All in thy mad flight engage; 
There's a better name for thee— 
  Disappointment it should be. 
FAME. 
THAT'S in a name? What's in a name? 
  Some Ancient writers ask. 
In truth to tell what's in a name, 
  We find no easy task; 
Yet each and every noble deed 
  Helps build the house of fame; 
And upon every block of stone, 
  We carve some Hero's name. 
So let us live, while life is spared, 
  In duty's sunshine fair, 
Our names shall be like temples reared; 
  Not "Castles in the Air."
TRUTH. 
For T. M. D. W. 
LOOK up, dear one, nor be cast down, 
   For bright again will shine thy sun, 
God's smiles are hid behind his frown— 
   Trust Him, He will dispel thy gloom. 
SUNSHINE AFTER CLOUD. 
COME, "Will," let's be good friends again, 
   Our wrongs let's be forgetting, 
For words bring only useless pain, 
   So wherefore then be fretting. 
Let's lay aside imagined wrongs, 
   And ne'er give way to grieving, 
Life should be filled with joyous songs, 
   No time left for deceiving. 
I'll try and not give way to wrath, 
   Nor be so often crying; 
There must some thorns be in our path, 
   Let's move them now by trying. 
How, like a foolish pair were we, 
   To fume about a letter; 
Time is so precious, you and me; 
   Must spend ours doing better. 
SLUMBERING PASSION. 
CAN it be true, that we can meet, 
   As other strangers in the street; 
No deep emotions quickly rise, 
   No hidden language in our eyes, 
No sudden crimson-mantled cheek, 
   No thrilling word of pleasure speak ? 
Yes! Thine was love of yesterday; 
   This morning found it far away, 
In search of newer conquests gone, 
   Leaving me desolate and lone, 
In vain I sought to break the spell, 
   My strenuous efforts fruitless fell. 
The cloud o'erspread my sunny sky, 
   And settled slowly like a pall, 
And clad my life in misery, 
   And swept it clear of pleasures all, 
Remembrance brings me only pain, 
   My love, my truest love lies slain. 
Henceforth in loneliness I grope 
   My way, until my life shall end; 
Among the hopeful, without hope, 
   Among the friendly without friend— 
My heart unto its depth is shaken, 
   My love, untiring love forsaken. 
THE ADVANCE OF EDUCATION. 
WHAT means this host advancing, 
   With such melodious strain: 
These men on steeds a prancing, 
   This mighty marshaled train?
They come while drum and fife resound, 
   And steeds with foam aflecked, 
Whose restless feet do spurn the ground, 
   Their riders gaily decked. 
With banners proudly waving, 
   Fearless in Freedom's land, 
All opposition braving, 
   With courage bold they stand. 
Come join the raging battle, 
   Come join the glorious fray; 
Come spite of bullets' rattle, 
   This is enlistment day. 
Hark! hear the Proclamation 
   Extend o'er all the land; 
Come every Tribe and Nation 
   Join education's band. 
Now the command is given — 
   Strike! strike grim ignorance low; 
Strike till her power is riven; 
   Strike a decisive blow. 
MOTHER. 
WHO was it who held me on her knee? 
When I was helpless as could be, 
And hoped such noble things of me? 
                     My Mother. 
Who taught my infant lips to prat, 
And understood my childish chat, 
And who in patience calmly sat ? 
                     My Mother. 
Who watched me grow from day to day, 
Taught me "Our Father's prayer" to say, 
And keep me out of evil's way. 
                     My Mother. 
Who shared my sorrow and my grief, 
And always brought me sweet relief; 
Of all my friends who is the chief? 
                     My Mother. 
Who always wisest council gave, 
And taught me how life's storm to brave, 
That I might safely ride each wave? 
                     My Mother. 
Who guarded me from tempter's snare 
Made me the burden of her prayer, 
And watched with zealous tender care? 
                     My Mother. 
And when the sun sinks in the west, 
And birds fly homeward to their nest, 
On whose fond bosom would I rest ? 
                     My Mothers. 
THE OUTCAST. 
WITH pinched cheeks hollow and wan, 
   With feet all travel sore, 
A form so fragile, that one might span 
   Her waist. There she peers in each door. 
A dress, that is scarcely a dress at all— 
   No hat to protect her head; 
The matted brown hair speaks woe and despair, 
   As daily she begs for bread. 
No shoes to cover her feet, 
   No table with bounties spread, 
No home but a stoop in a wretched street, 
   And naught but rags for a bed. 
One glance at the hungry face, 
   One look at the shattered frame 
Would prove that her life has been but a race 
   With poverty, hunger and shame. 
The hurrying crowd swept by, 
   On business or pleasure intend— 
No time to give heed to a cry of need, 
   No help to the beggar lent. 
Oh! Men with purse-string tight, 
   And women of comfort and ease, 
Have you no pity this bitter night, 
   Her hunger and want to appease? 
She knelt on the flagstones in prayer, 
   With uplifted heart unto heaven; 
A pitying angel discovered her there, 
   And whispered so kindly: "Forgiven!" 
The morning's sun looked on the face, 
   Of her who had known naught but pain, 
So peaceful in death, not even a trace 
   Of hunger and suffering remain. 
THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1886. 
WITH angry brow and stately tread, 
   This mighty Warrior came; 
With thundering throat his forces led, 
   With breath almost flame. 
And eyes of penetrating glance, 
   That pierce through every vein, 
As soldier pierced by soldier's lance, 
   Earth groaned and writhed in pain. 
The fearless eagle in his nest 
   Upon the mountain's height, 
Arose with wonder in his breast, 
   And quivered with affright. 
Old ocean troubled in his bed, 
   At first the shores forsook— 
Returning, all his furies led, 
   And crept into each nook. 
Brave-hearted men like statues stood 
   Powerless to strike a blow; 
Their homes became as kindling wood, 
   Their city's walls laid low. 
While mothers clasped their babes in arms 
   And sped with panting breath; 
With faces full of dread alarm, 
   They sought to fly from death. 
Husband and wife in long embrace 
   In mutest wonder stood; 
Each horror read in other's face, 
   And knelt and prayed to God. 
Death reaped a harvest as he rode 
   On wings of every wind; 
He slew the young, the brave and good, 
   And some grown old in sin. 
The very stars their light refused 
   To witness scene like this; 
Fair Lunar hid away confused, 
   And veiled herself in mist. 
Roar after roar, peal after peal, 
   The fierce bombardment went, 
'Till nature like a drunkard reeled, 
   Her strongest breastworks rent. 
"Surrender!" comes from every lip; 
   "We yield," from every breast; 
Ourselves of selfishness now stript, 
   We are humbled in the dust. 
In meek humility we bowed 
   And smiling kissed the rod, 
That while it smote us, bore us up 
   Near to the throne of God. 
TO YOUTH 
HOW shall your name go down in History, 
In letters of gold, or enveloped in mystery; 
In deeds of love, on pages of white, 
In defense of the wrong in lieu of right— 
In a selfish way will you carve your name? 
Time surely will answer: What's in a name? 
The leaves of your life each day are unfolding 
Your deeds of to-day; to-morrow, beholding, 
May tint your cheek with the blush of shame, 
While your heart will question: What's in a name? 
Will you gather the jewels spread out at your feet, 
Or still with the idle ones find a seat? 
No definite cause in the world pursuing— 
In the idle brain mischief is ever brewing— 
Can you find no work in the market-place, 
Can you not with the horsemen contend in the race; 
If the footmen outstrip you who is to blame? 
Be careful in youth how you carve your name. 
"ON GENESSARETT." 
OUT, upon the deep old ocean, 
   Out, upon the trackless wave, 
Tossed by winds in fierce commotion— 
   Men with hearts no longer brave— 
Drifted a poor helpless vessel, 
   Driven by the winds at will; 
Struggling sailors with her wrestle, 
   Lest they watery graves should fill. 
All night long they toiled in rowing, 
   Striving their frail bark to guide— 
Morning's streaks were longer growing, 
   Still she tossed from side to side. 
Some were on the oars hard bending, 
   Others strove to man the sail, 
But each moment strength seemed lending, 
   To the e'er increasing gale.
Silently each weary seaman, 
   Did the task to him assigned; 
Helpless starboard watch, and leamen 
   Scanned the trackless waste behind. 
Fainter grew their hearts within them, 
   For the billows threatened death, 
Furious breakers fought to win them, 
   Prayers were uttered with each breath.
Denser grew the clouds above them, 
   And the tempest wildly raged, 
Weary Captain, hopeless seamen, 
   Each in silent prayer engaged. 
Sudden on the wave appearing 
   Breaks a strange mysterious light 
Toward their little bark 'tis nearing, 
   And they tremble with affright. 
"'Tis a spirit," said they lowly, 
   Terror on their faces spread, 
But he neared them, speaking slowly— 
   "It is I!" be not afraid. 
Peter spake, (the all-impulsive) 
   Jesus come Thy people save, 
If indeed thou art our Jesus, 
   "Bid me walk upon the wave!" 
"Come unto me!" said the Saviour; 
   Peter made a noble start, 
But ere long his strength forsook him— 
   Doubting filled his faithless heart. 
In his own strength he was thinking 
   He would walk upon the wave— 
Soon he found that he was sinking, 
   Then he cried "Lord Jesus Save!" 
Then the loving Saviour caught him, 
   And unto the vessel came; 
Peace now reigned, and Jesus taught him, 
   Not thy power, but Jesus' name. 
Sinner you are on the ocean, 
   Sinking now beneath the wave, 
Stretch Thine arms with faith's devotion— 
   Jesus Christ is quick to save! 
HE COMES NOT TO-NIGHT. 
MY eager waiting heart can bear no more— 
Hark ! was that not his knock upon the door, 
Or, that his footstep on the casement floor? 
No, the clock rings out the hour, 'tis nine, 
'Tis past his hour and dreary waiting's thine 
   Sad heart, he will not come to-night. 
With anxious eyes, the gloom I strive to pierce, 
The stars are hid and winds are howling fierce; 
Only the ticking of the clock I hear, 
No welcome footsteps greet my eager ear. 
'Tis past his hour and hopeless waiting thine 
   Sad heart! He will not come to-night. 
From nature's fount the crystal tear drops flow, 
They soothe the throbbing heart's cry low, 
O, heart thine is the common, common fate, 
Thou yet must learn to hope and wait, 
Tis long since past his hour, vain waiting thine 
   Sad heart. He will not come to-night. 
WELCOME HOME. 
To Mrs. Fannie Jackson Coppin, returning from England. 
THY weary feet have pressed once more thy native soil, 
A After the weeks and days of care and toil, 
And loyal hearts whose friendship ever is true, 
Have come to bid a Welcome Home to you. 
Our bosoms swelling with an honest pride, 
As swells the lover's heait who claims his bride, 
With pleasure and with joy, we grasp thy hand 
And bid thee welcome to thy native land. 
Like silvery star that glint and gleams at night, 
Gladdening the wanderer's heart who seeks the light, 
Like France who turned to her Joan of Arc, 
We follow thee to victory from the dark. 
Even though the call was made from distant land, 
"Come join us sisters of the Missionary Band." 
The bugle sound fell on thy willing ear, 
And to thy faithful bosom came no fear. 
And waiting not to rate the fearful cost, 
In duty's call absorbed, all else is lost; 
Through heat or cold, where'er thy path hath led, 
Thine energies were bent, thy footsteps sped.
 
Thy fearless heart that knew not how to falter, 
Laid quick thine all on sacrificial altar, 
The dear ones of thy heart, thy friends and home, 
And dared to brave old ocean's turbid foam. 
For thee, the much oppressed Hammitic race 
May justly claim a worthy heroine's place, 
With those whose courage ne'er was known to flank, 
Place Fanny Jackson Coppin in the foremost rank. 
And may thy noble deeds be told in verse and song, 
To those unborn who shall our places throng, 
When o'er our dust the weeping willow waves, 
And we shall calmly sleep within our graves. 
SABBATH BELLS. 
(Tune, "What a Friend we have in Jesus.") 
SWEET and calm the breezes stealing 
   O'er the quiet Sabbath day; 
Loud and long the church bells pealing, 
   Haste to worship, haste away. 
List their notes of music swelling, 
   Hark, what tones of melody! 
Man's redemption they are telling; 
   Haste to worship, haste away. 
Now the six days' labor ended— 
   Temporal duties laid aside, 
With our hearts and voices blended, 
   In his courts to-day abide. 
Since the holy law was broken 
   From his fold, we've gone astray, 
But the pardoning word was spoken; 
   Erring one retrace thy way. 
With the Father interceding 
   For a sin-accursed race, 
Hands and feet and side all pleading, 
   Jesus saves us by his grace. 
Sinners list the bells are ringing, 
   'Tis the gospel's precious sound; 
Infant tongues his praises singing, 
   Come, and in his courts be found. 
In his promise trusting, never, 
   Backward cast thy longing eyes; 
Upward, onward pressing ever, 
   Till the final morn arise. 
List, the bells are loudly calling, 
   Will you heed the call to-day? 
On whose ear the sound is falling, 
   Haste to worship, haste away. 
THE DAY AFTER CONFERENCE. 
HOW quiet and how still to-day old Bethel's corners 'round, 
No boisterous clash of voices, no noisy gravel sound; 
And those who came from Territory, Island or from State, 
Who for the glorious cause of Christ came here to legislate, 
Are gone—and over Bethel hangs a quiet-like a pall, 
And yet there seems to linger strange whisperings in her wall. 
Perhaps it's but the echo of the meeting that is o'er, 
Or may be it's a gathering come from the heavenly shore; 
Yet they are here and on each face there rests a saddened look, 
As with their index finger they keep tally in a book. 
They are gathering up the doings of the Conference that is past, 
They are making up reports that through eternity shall last. 
And upon their heavenly faces comes anon a look of shame 
As with terrible precision they record each member's name. 
O! ministers of Jesus, have your deeds been foul or fair? 
If the roll were called in glory, could you guiltless answer there! 
Could your soul in Jesus' presence, pure and clean and white appear, 
Or should some foul stain on it condemn you to despair?
 
Shall your tongue shout glad hosannahs at the gathering in of sheaves, 
Or shall you empty-handed go, no fruit, but only leaves? 
Shall the Master's loving smile assign you to a mansion bright, 
Or shall his angry voice appoint you to the realms of night? 
Look well! for these committees shall report all by and by, 
Before the Great Archbishop in the Conference in the sky. 
THE QUARREL. 
   I SAW him yesterday, 
As he passed upon his way, 
         To and fro. 
Not a single word he spake, 
Though his heart seemed fit to break ; 
         With its woe. 
I understand his look, 
Like the pages of a book; 
         Which I've read. 
Oh! however the heart may ache, 
Back the words we cannot take; 
         Now they're said. 
How willingly I'd share 
Half the burden of his care; 
         If I might. 
A word's a cruel thing, 
And how long we feel the sting; 
         Of a slight, 
But I love him just the same; 
May be he's not all to blame; 
         Perhaps 'twas me. 
And I've just received a note, 
Which with his own hand he wrote; 
         Let me see. 
THOU LOVEST ME. 
GRACIOUS Saviour let me make, 
Neither error or mistake— 
Let me in Thy love abide,
Ever near Thy riven side. 
Let me, counting all things dross, 
Find my glory in the cross; 
Let me daily with Thee talk, 
In Thy footsteps daily walk. 
I would gladly follow Thee, 
For Thou gently leadest me, 
Where the pastures green doth grow, 
Where the waters stillest flow. 
For me is Thy table spread, 
And Thou doth anoint my head, 
And my cup of joy o'erflows 
In the presence of my foes. 
GENERAL ROBERT SMALLS. 
BEAUFORT, fair Beaufort, thou art a favored spot, 
For fate saw fit to cast in thee a noble hero's lot; 
And we congratulate ourselves as in his house we stand, 
As welcome guests to one of the most noted in the land. 
Whose heart is warm as Southern sun, and noble, true and brave, 
With patriotic fire full and restless as the wave; 
Whose zeal and candor unconcealed, constrained us to admire; 
Infused new zeal within our hearts and led us to aspire. 
And 'mid these grand and gothic walls quite leasurely we saunter, 
We ask him to rehearse to us the story of the "Planter"— 
How when the fighting hottest grew, and strong hearts were dismayed, 
Up to the pilot-house he flew and quick the fears allayed. 
And though the whistling shot and shell fell thick on every side, 
His deeds of valor we will tell to Nations yet with pride, 
To Afric's sons and daughters we'll leave it as no mystery, 
But hand them down on blocks of stone, and they shall live in history. 
With Touissant L' Ouverture and Crispus Attuck brave, 
John Brown and Abram Lincoln, who died to free the slave— 
They, the nation's martyrs, and each loyal negro's walls 
Should be adorned with portraits of these and Robert Smalls. 
ADMIRATION. 
IN the wondrous light of a pair of brown eyes, 
What language I read in the distance; 
My soul is suddenly lost in surprise, 
And can offer therefore no resistance. 
An easy prey to the magic spell 
I fall, and am helpless to rise; 
No subtler power in fairy dell, 
Than that in those thrilling brown eyes. 
One moment they quietly rested on me; 
The next they were wantonly straying; 
And now they're swimming in ecstacy, 
Unaware of the havoc they're playing. 
Just now they are looking quite innocently— 
A moment before wondrous wise. 
I would I could fathom the depth of that sea, 
In those thrilling mysterious dark eyes. 
MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY. 
SO you've reached your thirty-eighth birthday, 
And by many a varied road— 
I see that your hair is a trifle gray, 
But you've toiled with a heavy load— 
Of life's care, and pain, and sorrow, 
Upon your shoulders broad; 
You have striven that each to-morrow, 
Found you nearer to heaven and God. 
What matter if age creepeth o'er you, 
Your spirit is young, still and bold; 
The path of duty before you 
Is paved with the purest of gold. 
Not such as the brow of a monarch would grace, 
Eclipsing the costliest gem, 
That is torn from that bosom of earth's embrace, 
More precious than diadem. 
Though many the changes your eyes have seen; 
In these few fast fleeting years, 
O'er the graves of loved ones (now grown green,) 
You've shed many bitter tears. 
On life's great sea your bark has tossed, 
And adverse winds have blown, 
And threatening clouds your skies have crossed, 
Yet still the sun has shone. 
Now down the stream of life you glide, 
And steer toward setting sun— 
May each day's close bring sweet repose, 
As you think on the good you have done. 
DECORATION DAY. 
WE gather where the weeping willow waves; 
   With flowers we will strew the grassy graves— 
Who enter here must come with softest tread, 
   In presence of the brave and valiant dead. 
Come, noble sons of Union, daughters fair;
   A dirge is floating on the summer air;
O'er the city freedom's ensign proudly waves, 
   Come, shed a tear above the fallen braves! 
Strains of weird music freight the noonday air, 
   And veterans tread the highways here and there. 
Where peacefully repose the fallen braves, 
   The birds are chanting requiems o'er the graves. 
No more is heard the cannon's crash and roar, 
   Peace spreads her joyful wings from shore to shore.
No more is heard the musket's shower like hail, 
   And hushed and still the mother's piteous wail. 
Loud let the drum and fife with music sound, 
   Loud let their praise be echoed all around; 
Let loyal heart and voice join in the sound; 
   Let infant hands with roses strew the ground. 
WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR? 
WE had gathered for the love-feast on the time appointed night, 
And many came with hearts aflame and swords all burnished bright; 
And other heavy laden ones who, toiling on life's road, 
Forgot that Christ had promised to bear their heavy load, 
Came struggling in the open door and dropped into a seat; 
But failed to lay their burdens at the blessed Saviour's feet. 
We sang the hymn “Redeeming Love," and then we knelt in prayer, 
Not knowing that one steeped in sin had gathered with us there; 
Then we arose and each in turn began of Christ to talk, 
And some rejoiced and others moaned o'er life's intricate walk; 
And when the Holy Spirit had pervaded every heart, 
The weak grew strong, for all their doubts were bidden to depart. 
We felt that faithful, earnest prayer would unlock heaven's door, 
Lo, in our very midst, there stood a drunkard on the floor; 
He'd wandered down the narrow street and stopped and made his bed 
Upon the steps that to the very mercy-seat had led— 
Where the thrilling songs of Zion and the atmosphere of prayer, 
And the host of the invisibles floated on the evening air. 
They roused him from his stupor, smote his conscience and his heart, 
For he saw that with "the chosen" even here he had no part; 
And struggling to control himself and decently appear— 
He laid aside his tattered hat and to the desk drew near. 
The muttered words stuck in his throat as hard he strove to speak: 
"My friends, I’ve been a drinking," were uttered low and weak. 
"Put the man out," they quickly cried, "how dare he interfere? 
This is no place for drunkards, only the good are here." 
And as the men advanced to take the poor intruder out, 
He placed his hands behind him and despairing gazed about. 
There rested such a look upon his now quite sobered face 
Of hopelessness: it seemed to say they thrust me from this place. 
Where prayers are made for erring ones, Christ says to all mankind: 
"That whosoe'r believing comes shall full salvation find." 
Strong hands were laid upon him and they led him to the door, 
And from the church steps down he went perhaps to rise 
no more— 
Who knows but a hasty step his lasting doom may seal, 
Though sense of his unworthiness he yet may keenly feel. 
Perhaps we, too, are erring, let us turn our eyes within; 
Perhaps we'll have no trouble in discovering secret sin. 
If the question were but answered how our cases stood 
The echo of the answer would be: no, not one is good. 
Let us be like Samaritans, and stoop when passing by, 
To raise a fallen brother and to hear the needy's cry. 
ETERNITY. 
WAY from earth and its cares set free, 
The soul in its blissful liberty 
Shall soar to portals fair and bright; 
Where sweet-voiced angels clad in white, 
Are tuning their harps in heavenly glee: 
   We hope to spend Eternity. 
Over the crystal sea of glass, 
And through the golden streets we'll pass, 
Floating along on the placid streams; 
Or roaming through fields of eternal green, 
A glorious awakening there will be: 
When we land on the banks of Eternity. 
In that beautiful home so far away, 
There come no nights of dark dismay; 
The Saviour's love shall round us shine, 
And light our steps through heavenly clime; 
And while we join the sweet melody— 
We'll rest throughout Eternity. 
With faltering steps here, up and down, 
With bleeding wounds from sole to crown, 
We'll cast aside life's troubles here; 
When, like the Saviour, we appear, 
Sorrow and tears shall cease to be: 
In our promised home in Eternity. 
THE QUARTO CENTENNIAL. 
O, THAT the Holy Angels would indite 
Fit words of praise that I might write; 
Or to my timid faltering heart reveal, 
Some secret hidden spring, some new found seal, 
That guards a casket rich and rare and old, 
Of gems as rich and pure as finest gold— 
Or, to some unknown depth might I descend, 
Or, would some fairy sprite its wings me lend, 
That I might soar aloft and pierce the azure sky— 
Might penetrate earth's bosom with discerning eye; 
Or would the touch of heavenly hands inspire 
My soul, then filled with pure and holy fire, 
Might wake the cords that now lie dormant here, 
And catch some rich vibrations from celestial sphere. 
Year after year is born and glides away, 
And generations rise and flourish and decay; 
Flowers bud and blossom, fade and fall, 
But the eternal truth outlives them all. 
As in the forest stands the sturdy oak, 
Where the young ravens scream and groan and croak, 
Stand like monuments of the unhappy past, 
Those who have brav'd the summer's heat, and winter's blast. 
On mountain height where hungry eagles slept, 
In deep ravine where poisonous reptiles crept, 
Undaunted to the Master's call take they heed, 
And proved themselves his followers indeed. 
On, on, though often dark and chill the night, 
In the vineyard gleaning with cycle bright, 
In the rank marshes, or whereso'er He led, 
The sky their only covering, the earth their only bed. 
O, welcome day, when peace broods o'er the land; 
Free and untrammeled roams the Christian band, 
No guillotine is reared, no furious crackling stake; 
No flames leap high the Christian's life to take. 
How swift the flight of five and twenty years, 
Freighted with hope and grief, with joy and tears; 
To duty came the call that sacred day— 
Strong in the Master's strength, Paul like they did obey.
 
But free to tread his own or foreign sod, 
His voice upraised to the eternal God— 
No bodies torn asunder fill untimely graves, 
And o'er the world Salvation's Banner waves. 
Oh ! Allen, you are with us here to-day, 
Noting these services, this grand array; 
Those sightless eyes methinks look into mine. 
With holy happiness divine. 
With gratitude we gather here and now— 
Our praises render while we meekly bow 
To heaven, who gave us such as thee, 
And God's own Son who died to set us free. 
HEART-HUNGRY. 
O, HUNGRY heart, 
   Contend not with thy fate; 
Lonely thou art, 
   But yet must hope and wait. 
For all thy craving, 
   Thou shalt be rilled; 
Why this mad raving? 
   Why so self-willed? 
Longing, art thou, 
   For that which comes not? 
Submissive bow, 
   Sad is thy lot, 
What must the end be? 
   Lest thou relent, 
Love will consume thee, 
   Thy power be spent. 
Dost thy cold mate, 
   That thou hast chosen 
Smile at thy fate, 
   With glances frozen. 
O, hungry heart, 
   In shadow groping 
Still act thy part, 
   And go on hoping? 
Thy fate invites thee, 
   Kind or unkindly; 
Thou art not free, 
   Love loves e'er bindly. 
As thirsty meadow 
   Welcomes the dew, 
And as the shadow 
   Follows the true. 
All the emotion 
   Thou dost impart, 
Will find devotion, 
   O, hungry heart. 
O, hungry heart, 
   It is not in vain 
Somewhere, somehow! 
   For all thy pain. 
For all thy sorrow, 
   Thy bitter tears, 
Happiness borrow 
   From coming years. 
O, hungry heart, 
   Hope is all beauty, 
Disappointment's dart 
   Points thee to duty. 
I WILL LOOK UP. 
I WILL look up to Thee 
   With faith's ne'er-failing sight, 
My trust repose in Thee, 
   Though dark and chill earth's night. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   Though rough and long the way, 
Still sure Thou leadest me 
   Unto the perfect day. 
I will look up to Thee 
   When lone and faint and weak. 
"My grace sufficeth Thee;" 
   I hear Thy soft voice speak. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   For if Thou, Lord, art near, 
Temptations quickly flee, 
   And clouds soon disappear. 
I will look up to Thee 
   With feeble voice I cry. 
Lord, pity helpless me— 
   Without Thy aid I die. 
I will look up to Him 
   Who died my soul to save; 
Who boar my load of sin— 
   His blood a ransom gave. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   The all-anointed one, 
Who opes the gate for me, 
   To the eternal throne. 
I will look up to Thee; 
   I feel my sins forgiven— 
Thy footprints Lord I see, 
   They mark the way to heaven. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   When doubt and fear arise; 
Though dangers compass me, 
   Upward I lift mine eyes. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   Who knoweth all my needs; 
Thy spirit Lord grant me, 
   My soul in anguish pleads. 
I will look up to Thee! 
   Though all I have below, 
Thou takest Lord from me, 
   Thou canst the more bestow. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   Thou bright and morning star; 
With eyes of faith I see, 
   Thy glory from afar. 
I will look up to Thee, 
   My hand shall rest in thine; 
Where e'er thou wilt lead me, 
   Thy will, O Lord, not mine! 
I will look up to Thee, 
   When death's relentless hand, 
Has laid it's weight on me, 
   Save—Thou atoning Lamb! 
I will look up to Thee, 
   When crossing Jordan's wave; 
Then Lord, I look to Thee — 
   Whose power alone can save ! 
HOPE THOU IN GOD, 
O. SOUL, why shouldst thou downcast be,
   Or mourn thy temporal lot; 
Where'er 'tis cast, what's that to thee— 
   Doth not God choose the spot? 
Rouse thee, and labor for success! 
   And be thou well assured; 
The shadows near the end grow less, 
   And pain must be endured. 
Although I meet with conflicts here, 
   And storms beset my path, 
Though devils shoot their fiery darts 
   Of disappointed wrath, 
My feet upon the blood-marked way, 
   Shall ever onward press, 
And looking to the "perfect day," 
   My faith shall not grow less. 
What if the ungodly spread a snare, 
   And wicked councils meet— 
Lord, guard with loving, watchful care, 
   My timid, faltering feet. 
Soul, thou must daily suppliance make, 
   If thou wouldst well be fed— 
The righteous He will not forsake, 
   Nor shall his seed beg bread. 
The cloudy pillar day by day, 
   The fiery cloud by night, 
Shall mark the straight and narrow path, 
   That leads to lasting light. 
Where trembling hope receives her sight, 
   Where flowers eternal grow— 
God's presence beams forever bright, 
   And living waters flow. 
TO CLEMENTS' FERRY. 
ONE lovely summer afternoon when balmy breezes blew, 
A charming little buggy, scarce large enough for two, 
Dashed down the narrow little street and stopped beside a gate, 
Where a charming little woman dwelt whom he had met of late. 
Out stepped a little body, looking like a happy bride; 
He gently stood and placed her in a safe seat at his side: 
“I'm going to show you now," said he, (with eyes that twinkle merry,) 
"The very prettiest of drives, it leads to Clements' Ferry."
 
"If you have never heard of it, my darling little treasure, 
I'll tell you all about the place, it will afford me pleasure." 
And on they sped, mile after mile, with chat and laughter merry— 
He watched her dimpled, roguish smile and drove toward the ferry. 
Through lovely groves, where birds sang sweet their notes of joy so merry, 
Or partridge, hid in ripened wheat, whistled his "Bob White" cherry. 
Up the shell road and o'er the fields and by the moss-hung oaks, 
Where marshy land its rich grain yields or sad-voiced raven croaks. 
Then turning off the highway and past the gate of toll, 
Then up into a by-way which led straight to the knoll, 
"'Tis here, said he "the loveliest spot in all the world so 
wide, 
Swept by the breezes from the sea, and kissed by every tide. 
Come down beside the river's brink, where the water ripples merry— 
A lovely place to rest and think, down here beside the ferry.” 
So taking his uplifted hands she gave a little bound, 
And very soon they sat them down upon the grassy ground. 
In days that are forever fled, when slavery cursed this nation— 
This land was owned by "Clements" and on his great plantation 
Were many slaves who daily tilled this soil, tho' oft in pain— 
Their master's coffers must be filled from the fields of golden grain. 
They knew no rest who labored there, but worked from early light— 
They ploughed and hoed and reaped and sowed, till the sun went down at night; 
Then to the river they would come all foot-sore, worn and weary, 
Hungry and faint to reach their home they crossed here at the ferry. 
One day they heard a strange sweet voice, not such as won't to lead them; 
It made their burdened hearts rejoice, for 'twas the voice that freed them. 
And when the sun went down that night their shouts rose loud and merry— 
They crossed with footsteps swift and light the last time o'er this ferry. 
“So here besides this river we have found a rustic seat, 
And still the water rippled on and winds blew soft and sweet— 
"I've something else to tell you," and his laughing eyes were merry, 
He whispered something in her ear, but not about the ferry. 
* * * 
The sun was shining in the west and back toward home they drove; 
Soft twilight had its shadows cast o'er field and "knoll" and grove— 
The "ferry has another name, which lovers oft repeat, 
Instead of "Clements' Ferry," it is now "Sunset Retreat.'' 
THE BIRTH OF TIME. 
HAPPY moments tell me, pray, 
Where were you on yesterday? 
While I sit, bowed low with sorrow, 
Tell me where you'll be to-morrow. 
Come you from a heavenly clime, 
Linger with me all the time; 
Every day will then be bright, 
Every burden then seem light. 
Are you slumbering with the flowers, 
While I have my darkest hours? 
I am sure it would be pleasant 
If I found you ever present. 
Happy moments seemed to say: 
"I am busy all the day; 
Every hour I well must fill, 
So I never can be still. 
You, my friend, would happier be, 
If you busy kept like me; 
Then your joys would seem the sweeter, 
And your dark hours would seem fleeter. 
More of joy and less of grief, 
All your days of labor brief, 
If the moments you improve, 
By some little deed of love. 
All the earth is full of beauty, 
Where we live and do our duty; 
Then your sun will seem the brighter, 
And your heavy heart grow lighter. 
May I ask you, idle one, 
To recount the good you've done, 
To deserve the joys you've tasted — 
Now account for time you've wasted!" 
Then I felt a sudden start, 
And the impulse of my heart 
Was, that I must work to-day; 
For the moments haste away. 
Little moments, will you wait 
While your wings with prayer I freight: 
So when I drop out of time, 
I may see God's smile divine? 
I could not a moment borrow, 
For to-day is gone to-morrow; 
And to-morrow is "to-day," 
So the debt I could not pay. 
Tell me moments: whence your birth, 
Whence your coming to the earth? 
Was your birthplace 'mid the flowers, 
Or in cloudless, fleece-like bowers? 
Then the answer quickly came 
Like a chipped-off lightning flame: 
"When the great Creator flung 
Out the world, on nothing hung, 
Then was I destined to be, 
Time until Eternity." 
TENNYSON'S POEMS. 
On receiving Tennyson's Poems from Mrs. M, H. Dunton, of Brattleboro', Vt. 
DEAR Friend, since you have chosen to associate 
My humble thoughts with England's poet laureate, 
I trust that he will bear me pleasant company, 
And soon we shall far more than mere acquaintance be. 
Since childhood's days his name I have revered, 
And more and more it has become to me endeared; 
I blush not for the truth, I but confess, 
I very wealthy feel since I his " works" possess. 
I've found in the immortal Shakespeare much delight, 
Yet, oft his vulgar language shocked me quite; 
And I twice grateful am, that I no more shall be 
Dependent in spare moments on his company. 
But I shall roam o'er England's proud domain, 
Shall meet her lords and ladies, and her peasants plain, 
Attend her royal spreads, and figure at her courts, 
On prancing steed with nodding plume, I join their hunting sports. 
THINE OWN.
 
O live and not to be Thine Own,  
Like Springtime is when birds are flown; 
Or liberty in prison bars, 
Or evening skies without the stars; 
Like diamonds that are lustreless, 
Or rest when there's no weariness; 
Like lovely flowers that have no scent, 
Or music when the sound is spent. 
LOVE LETTERS. 
DEAR Letters, Fond Letters, 
   Must I with you part ? 
You are such a source of joy 
   To my lonely heart. 
Sweet Letters, Dear Letters, 
   What a tale you tell; 
O, no power on earth can break 
   This strange mystic spell! 
Dear Letters, Fond Letters, 
   You my secret know— 
Don't you tell it, any one— 
   Let it live and grow. 
MATIN HYMN. 
IS this the way my Father, 
That Thou wouldst have me go — 
Scaling the rugged mountain steep, 
Or through the valley low? 
Walking alone the path of life, 
With timid, faltering feet, 
Fighting with weak and failing heart, 
Each conflict that I meet? 
“Nay! nay! my child,” the Father saith, 
“Thou dost not walk alone— 
Gird up the loins of thy weak faith, 
And cease thy plaintive tone. 
Look thou with unbeclouded eyes 
To Calvary's gory scene.”
Canst thou forget the Saviour's cries ? 
Go thou, on His mercy, lean.
My Father, brighter grows the way, 
Less toilsome is the road; 
If Thou Thy countenance display, 
O, lighter seems my load! 
And trustingly I struggle on, 
Not murmuring o'er my task; 
The mists that gather soon are gone, 
When in Thy smile I bask. 
Turn not from me Thy smiling face, 
Lest I shall surely stray, 
But in Thy loving arms' embrace, 
I cannot lose my way. 
My Father when my faith is small, 
And doubting fills my heart, 
Thy tender mercy I recall. 
O, let it ne'er depart! 
I LOVE THEE. 
THOU art not near me, but I see Thine eyes, 
Shine through the gloom like stars in winter skies— 
Pointing the way my longing steps would go, 
To come to Thee because I love Thee so. 
Thou art not near me, but I feel Thine arm, 
Soft folded round me, shielding me from harm, 
Guiding me on as in the days of old— 
Sometimes life seems so dark, so dreary and so cold. 
Thou art not near me, but I hear Thee speak, 
Sweet as the breath of June upon my cheek, 
And as Thou speakest I forget my fears, 
And all the darkness, and my lonely tears. 
O love, my love, whatever our fate may be, 
Close to Thy side, or never more with Thee, 
Absent or present, near or far apart, 
Thou hast my love and fillest all my heart. 
MY CANARY. 
LITTLE bird with tuneful throat, 
   Happy heart and silvery note— 
Dainty beak and feathers yellow, 
   Thou art such a charming fellow. 
Always merry, full of glee, 
   Seeming happy as can be— 
All the house with music thrilling, 
   And my heart with pleasure filling. 
Could I sing I'd vie with thee: 
   In sweet strains of melody 
We would raise our voices high, 
   To praise our Maker in the sky. 
MY MOCKING BIRD. 
NO gorgeous coat has he, 
   He is plain as he can be; 
Singing all the live-long day, 
   Imitating what I say. 
Mocking ev'ry bird in bush, 
   Sparrow, wren, or hawk or thrush, 
Parrot, robin, finch or crow, 
   Owl, oriole, bird of snow, 
With cuteness quite astounding, 
   Bird and man alike confounding. 
MORN. 
FRESH and fair the morn awaketh, 
   From her couch of down; 
Parting kiss her lover taketh, 
   Ere his daily journey maketh 
   Of the world around. 
For a jolly-hearted rover, 
   Ever full of fun, 
Making calls the wide world over, 
   Flower and leaf, and blade and clover, 
   Welcome him, the sun. 
Gloom from weary hearts dispelleth, 
   Shedding joy and light 
O'er the homes where sorrow dwelleth, 
   Of eternal sunshine telleth, 
   And the mansions bright. 
Evening's gentle voice is pleading, 
   But he will not stay; 
Her entreaties all unheeding, 
   Morning's tender smile succeeding, 
   Beckons him away. 
Now while just a halo lingers, 
   Note his roguish smile; 
With the tip ends of his ringers, 
   Sweet good day he gently flings her, 
   But retreats the while. 
DO YOU THINK? 
DO you think, when you plan for to-morrow, 
   That the morrow you may not see, 
That long ere the dawn of the morrow's morn, 
   You may be in eternity. 
Do you tread in the foot-steps of Jesus, 
   In the darkness as well as the light ? 
Should the death angel come, to summons you home— 
   Say, would it be glory, or night? 
MUSIC. 
O WONDROUS depth to which my soul is stirr'd,
   By some low tone, some softly breathed word— 
Some thrill or cadence sweet which fills my heart, 
   My inmost powers wake, and thrill and start. 
My bosom seems too narrow a confine, 
   For such a power, dear music as thine.
O, that my heavy, heavy fait' ring tongue, 
   Could warble forth thy ev'ry prompted song, 
The world should join the gladsome song I'd raise, 
   And to the King shout lofty notes of praise. 
E'en when my heart is wrapt in sorrow's night, 
   Mine eyes of clay are clos'd, but heavenly light 
Doth shine into the desert of my soul, 
   And billows of sweet music o'er me roll. 
A MOTHER'S LOVE. 
WHAT sacrifice so great! 
   No hour too early, or too late, 
No isle too distant, no shore or strand, 
   She may not reach with earnest heart, and willing hand. 
What love so strong! 
   It is her child, or right or wrong, 
In crowded court of justice, if condemn'd, 
   Her love and tearful eyes doth still defend. 
What love so pure! 
   Friendship oft is false, but one is sure 
That mother's love clings to us to the last, 
   Wherever in life our varied lot is cast. 
MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT. 
IS thy sun obscured to-day, 
   By a cloud of sorrow? 
It cannot be thus alway, 
   Bright may be the morrow. 
Hast thou left of hope a spark ? 
   Sit not down repining— 
Never was there cloud so dark, 
   Had not silver lining. 
Adverse currents strong and swift 
   Sweep across thy soul— 
Courage, heart, the cloud must rift, 
   It will backward roll. 
Is thy bark far from the land, 
   On a tempestuous ocean? 
Stretch to God thy helpless hand, 
   He can stay commotion. 
Sits thy soul in grief to-day 
   'Neath the weeping willow? 
On the Son thy burden lay, 
   Soft will seem thy pillow. 
Doth amidst thy course arise 
   Difficulty's, mountain; 
Sweetest draught his love supplies 
   From the crimson fountain. 
Dost thou wander weak and faint, 
   Through life's desert lonely? 
God regards the feeblest plaint, 
   He can aid thee only. 
Without His all-seeing eye, 
   Not a sparrow falleth; 
More He heeds the humble cry, 
   That for mercy calleth. 
Raise to God thy streaming eyes, 
   Contrite heart's petition— 
Let no waves of doubt arise, 
   For thy sad condition. 
WHERE DO SCHOOL DAYS END? 
A LITTLE child sat on the floor, 
Turning the pages o'er and o'er, 
Of Mother Goose's nursery book; 
He raised his eyes with puzzled look, 
And said, "Mamma, attention lend, 
And tell me: Where do school days end?" 
My boy, that is no easy task— 
A weighty question 'tis you ask; 
For every day adds to our store 
Of knowledge gained the day before; 
So you must ask some wiser friend 
To tell you, where school days will end. 
The parson came that very day, 
His usual pastoral call to pay; 
The child stole in with cunning look, 
And on a stool his seat he took. 
Sir, will you information lend, 
And tell me, where school days will end? 
The parson with astonished air, 
Pushed his fingers through his hair:
Little child I am much afraid
That I can give but little aid; 
But my best efforts I will lend, 
To tell you, where school days will end.
 
There is a land of light you know, 
Where all good people are to go— 
Where little children rob'd in white
Are ever happy in God's sight,
And when you die He'll angels send, 
To take you where school days shall end. 
THE BIRTH OF JESUS. 
QUIETLY the world lay sleeping, 
Save on fair Judean plain; 
Faithful Shepherds watch were keeping, 
Lest their tender flocks be slain. 
Silently the snowy mantle 
O'er the hill and vale was spread—
Emblem of seraphic pureness— 
Carpet fit for angels' tread. 
Lo, in eastern skies appearing, 
Backward seems the night to roll; 
The prophetic star is nearing, 
Heaven opened as a scroll. 
Then the heralds gladly singing, 
Came to announce the Prince of Peace, 
All the heavenly harps were ringing—
Praises chaunt and never cease. 
Then a cloud of golden glory 
Filled the air with heavenly mirth, 
Angels sang the wondrous story, 
When the Christ-child came to earth. 
A HAPPY HEART. 
GIVE me a Happy Heart and suasive tongue, 
   That I may cheer the aged and the young; 
That I may charm the little child, 
   And make the winds of age seem mild. 
Give me the willing hand and ready feet, 
   To raise the brother lying in the street; 
Give me the honest heart that has no fear, 
   That with the humble I may shed a tear. 
Give me the eye of faith that I may see 
   Some good accomplished daily Lord for Thee — 
Give me a heart full of Thy holy zeal, 
   That I my neighbors’ joy or woe may feel. 
Give me the feet that eagerly will run 
About the Master's work, until the sun 
Has faded in its glory in the west, 
And all the busy world has sought its rest. 
WHEN I WOULD DIE! 
NOT when leaves are brown and sere, 
Not when days are cold and drear; 
Not when roses faded lie, 
-Not when clouds o'ercast the sky. 
But when spring-time breezes blow, 
And make sweet music, soft and low; 
When birds their happy carols sing, 
When flowers their lovely odors bring— 
When woods their richest verdure yield, 
When lambs frisk in the clover-field; 
When bee and butterfly fill the air, 
When morn awaketh bright and fair; 
When love upon the breeze is born— 
Oh, I would die on Easter morn! 
When the morn with lovely grace 
Greets the world in soft embrace; 
When the lily's rich perfume  
Woos the minstrel's harp to tune, 
And the lark his song of praises 
To the Great Creator raises. 
Upward soars in happy mood, 
Loud his notes of gratitude, 
For security and rest, 
For the birdlings in his nest. 
When the daisies dot the lawn, 
I would die at Easter dawn! 
When the year is blithe and young, 
Happiness on every tongue— 
After winter's icy chains 
Lose their hold upon the plains; 
When the waters, rippling on, 
Tell the power of winter gone— 
Spring leads him her willing slave, 
Then lay me in the quiet grave; 
Loved ones do not come and weep, 
For I shall only be asleep; 
Roses heap upon the mound, 
And I shall rest both sweet and sound. 
Let no heart for me be aching, 
Christ will see to my awaking. 
DECEMBER. 
THE skies o'ercast and fierce winds blow, 
Their chilling breath thro' leafless trees, 
Streams fetter-bound in icy chains, 
And frosty net-work on the panes. 
The birds have sought a summer clime, 
Each tender floweret, bud and vine, 
Has hid away with timid fear, 
For lo, December days are here! 
The blazing logs are heard to crack, 
And all the grain is garnered now. 
JUDGE NOT. 
PERCHANCE, the friend who cheered thy early years, 
   Has yielded to the tempter's power; 
Yet, why shrink back and draw away thy skirt, 
As though her very touch would do thee hurt? 
   Wilt thou prove stronger in temptation's hour? 
Perchance the one thou trusteth more than life, 
   Has broken love's most sacred vow: 
Yet judge him not—the victor in life's strife, 
Is he who beareth best the burden of life, 
   And leaveth God to judge, nor questions how. 
Sing the great song of love to all, and not 
   The wailing anthems of thy woes; 
So live thy life that thou may'st never feel 
Afraid to say, as at His throne you kneel, 
   "Forgive me God, as I forgive my foes!" 
UNUTTERED PRAYER. 
MY God, sometimes I cannot pray, 
   Nor can I tell why thus I weep; 
The words my heart has framed I cannot say, 
   Behold me prostrate at Thy feet. 
Thou understandest all my woe; 
   Thou knows't the craving of my soul— 
Thine eye beholdeth whereso'er I go; 
   Thou can'st this wounded heart make whole. 
And oh ! while prostrate here I lie, 
   And groan the words I fain would speak: 
Unworthy though I be, pass not me by, 
   But let Thy love in showers break. 
And deluge all my thirsty soul, 
   And lay my proud ambition low; 
So while time's billows o'er me roll.
   I shall be washed as white as snow. 
Thou wilt not quench the smoking flax, 
   Nor wilt thou break the bruised reed; 
Like potter's clay, or molten wax, 
   Mould me to suit Thy will indeed. 
WHOSO GIVES FREELY, SHALL FREELY RECEIVE!
WHEN Jesus was leaving this sin-accursed land, 
These words full of comfort he left with his band 
"Ye are not forsaken, my peace I will leave, 
And whoso gives freely, shall freely receive!" 
"Your Father in heaven, so righteous and just, 
Will comfort your hearts, if in Him ye trust; 
If only on Jesus, his Son, ye believe; 
Then ye who give freely, shall freely receive!" 
"On the just and the unjust descendeth the rain— 
The fields all revived bring abundance of grain; 
Give honor and glory and firmly believe, 
That whoso gives freely, shall freely receive." 
Step out from your door on a bleak winter day— 
Half-clad and half-starving, you meet on your way, 
Some one who is begging for alms to relieve. 
Think! whoso gives freely, shall freely receive! 
Perhaps but a penny dropped into a hat— 
Yet the angel recording will take note of that. 
Like the mite of the widow, whatever you give, 
Much or little — give freely, you'll freely receive! 
There are often around us dear souls in distress, 
Who are needing not money, but kind words to bless— 
Their lives seem so weary—a word will relieve; 
Let's give to them freely, they'll gladly receive! 
When finished our course in this vale here below, 
When Christ shall the robe and the crown bestow 
On those, who were faithful and quick to believe, 
Who gave him their service shall freely receive! 
WILBERFORCE. 
Read at the 25th Anniversary of Wilberforce, Ohio, June, 1887. 
A QUARTER century ago, 
A March morning, bleak and wild, 
The joyful news spread to and fro: 
To Afro Methodist is born a child; 
Begotten in the time of strife, 
And born in adverse circumstances.
All trembled for the young child's life, 
It seemed to have so poor a chance. 
But, nursed' by every care, 
It stronger grew, until at last 
Our hearts no longer feel a fear, 
The danger is forever past. 
The feeble childhood's days are flown, 
How swiftly speed the years away; 
We hail thee now a woman grown 
In regal robes and Queen's array. 
Thou dark-browed beauty of the west, 
Thy matchless grace is widely known; 
Rich jewels sparkle on thy breast, 
Thy head supports a royal crown. 
And through thy veins pure Afric's blood 
Flows fearlessly along its course; 
Thy cheeks are mantled by the flood; 
We hail thee, lovely Wilberforce! 
Thy palace gates are open wide— 
All are invited to the feast; 
From frigid North or Southern side, 
From every point, from West to East. 
Thou holdest in thine outstretched hand 
The richest, rarest gifts to youth; 
From snow-capped peak to ocean strand, 
Thou offerest all the words of truth. 
They come! their burning thirst, quench, 
For wisdom, honor, knowledge, power; 
From hidden depths rich jewels wrench— 
Successful effort crowns each hour. 
But foul incendiary's cruel hand, 
Thy Territory did invade; 
By ruthless and destructive brand,
Thy lonely walls were lowly laid. 
When night had hushed the birds to sleep, 
Out of his covert see him creep; 
The crackling flame and lurid glare, 
Burst out upon the midnight air. 
And what had seemed so strong and fair, 
Now lay a mass of ruins there; 
Triumphantly look'd all our foes, 
And gloated o'er our many woes. 
But men of iron nerve and will
Looked up to God, with courage still: 
Believing He their cries would heed, 
And prove a friend in time of need. 
The tiny seeds of kindness sown, 
Into a mighty tree has grown, 
And youth and maiden side by side, 
Sit 'neath its spreading branches wide. 
And though the seed be sown in Payne, 
The trite old saying we maintain: 
That whosoe'er in Payne we sow, 
By faith's tears watered it shall grow. 
Our trust untarnished by alloy, 
We sow in tears but reap in joy; 
And may thy praises never cease, 
And all thy paths be those of peace. 
EASTER MORN. 
LO! the glorious dawn is breaking, 
   And the night of gloom is gone, 
All the earth from slumber waking, 
   Hails with joy the Easter Morn! 
Lo! the sun's bright rays are peeping 
   Over Calvary's crimson height, 
Soldier guards who watch were keeping, 
   Saw Him rise in power and might! 
Mary ran with footsteps fleeter, 
   Than the other two who went— 
Where an angel sat to greet her, 
   And the grave a glory lent. 
With their spices they were going, 
   To the tomb where Jesus lay— 
Faithful ones, without the knowing. 
   Who should roll the stone away? 
To the rich man's new sepulchre, 
   Mary's eager feet drew near; 
Lo, she saw the tomb was open, 
   And her heart was filled with fear! 
At the grave she stooped, and peeping, 
   Angels saw in white arrayed, 
Where her Lord was lately sleeping,
   "And the clothes aside were laid!" 
Back she drew with fear and quaking, 
   But the angel watcher said: 
"Jesus is among the living, 
   Seek Him not among the dead." 
"He is risen, He is risen," 
   Now dispel thy gloom and fear 
From the grave's embrace and prison; 
   Rose triumphant, He is not here! 
Then awake the song of gladness, 
   Let it float upon the air; 
Joy dispels the gloom and sadness, 
   Past the night of dark despair. 
Shout with gladdest acclamation, 
   Raise with joy the gladsome sound, 
And with great acceleration, 
   Spread to earth's remotest bound. 
He is risen! great in glory; 
   Death is vanquished, lost its sting! 
Vain the grave can boast of victory, 
   He is risen, Christ the King! 
THE CITY BY THE SEA. 
LOVE thee? Yes, I'm sure I love thee, 
Dear old city by the sea; 
Love thy grandly towering spires, 
Love thy matrons and thy sires; 
Love thy gallant sons so true, 
Love thy genial skies of blue; 
Love thy gentle fair-haired daughters; 
And the music of thy waters 
Flowing gently all around thee. 
All are ever dear to me! 
Hark! I think I hear the echo, 
Of the notes of melody; 
And the chimes ecstatic pealing 
From St. Michael's o'er me stealing, 
Woos me back to pleasant hours 
Spent among the fragrant flowers; 
And the ocean's distant roar, 
Bursts in music on the shore— 
And the snowy white-capped waves, 
Every nook and cranny laves, 
As they break in sportive glee, 
On the "battery" by the sea! 
Of thy fame and vanished glory, 
Dear old city by the sea— 
All too well I know the story, 
When thy deeds where dark and gory. 
But the Inchcape bell's low moaning, 
Echoes not the sad slave's groaning, 
As from Afric's torrid sands, 
He was brought in iron bands, 
Writhing in his agony, 
To the city by the sea! 
Through the evening's mellow haze, 
Dear old city by the sea, 
What a picture meets my gaze, 
Relic of departed days! 
Standing yet the wave-washed Fort,* 
From whose walls the loud report 
Echoed all around the world— 
(Now with stars and stripes unfurled) 
Echoed like a bolt of thunder, 
Burst the iron bands asunder, 
Set the slave at liberty, 
In the city by the sea! 
*Sumpter 
O'er thee broods the calm of peace, 
Dear old city by the sea— 
"Monitor," and "Ironsides," 
At thy port no longer ride. 
But I would forget the past, 
Lest a shadow it should cast 
O'er my musing sweet of thee, 
Dear old city by the sea! 
And I love thee, still I love thee, 
Ever dear art thou to me! 
FORGETFULNESS! 
“DARLING," he said, " I never meant 
   To hurt you. "And his eyes were wet— 
"I would not hurt you for the world; 
   Am I to blame, if I forget?" 
"Forgive my selfish tears," she cried: 
   "Forgive ! I knew that it was not 
Because you meant to hurt me, sweet, 
   I knew it was that you FORGOT!" 
But all the same, deep in her heart, 
   Rankled this thought, and rankles yet—
When love is at its best, one loves 
   So much, that one CANNOT FORGET! 
THE NEW ORGAN. 
Read at the Dedication of the New Organ at Mt. Zion Church, Charleston, S.C. 
THOU monstrous gilt and rainbow-tinted thing, 
With many a thousand mouthed tuneful throat, 
Helps us God's praises here to-day to sing, 
With happy hearts we raise our joyful note. 
What charms thou show'st to our uplifted gaze, 
Some mystic hand seems now to lend thee power, 
That fillest us with wonder and praise, 
And mute we stand and tremble and adore. 
Thou seems't almost human in thy tones; 
Even he who built thee did not understand— 
Sometimes low, plaintive, then so mirthful, 
That thou wert peopled by an angel band. 
O, tell us in thy strong, yet sweetest strain, 
That He who died, now liveth evermore; 
Yea thunder forth the sweet, ah! sweet refrain, 
That Christ has left for men ajar the door. 
And tell, forevermore, "Salvation's free," 
And pardon come to whosoever will, 
Turn quick away from guilt and misery; 
This pardon comes the hungry soul to fill. 
And on the very air shall praises float, 
While cherubim and seraphim shall sing; 
And earth shall raise her very highest note, 
While heaven, with loudest note, Alleluias ring! 
When earth is wrecked and matter all consumed, 
And all our labor here hath found an end, 
Our happy souls shall strike harps, heavenly tuned— 
Our voices with angelic voices blend. 
So we shall praise Him while He lends us breath, 
On viol, timbrel, lute, and harp and strings, 
And when our mortal tongues are still in death, 
Our praise shall mount on high on music's wings. 
DECEPTION. 
LIFE we find is nevermore 
   What at first we thought; 
When deceit beclouds it o'er, 
   Sad the change that's wrought. 
Confidence with drooping heart 
   Sadly takes its flight; 
Fondest love will sure depart— 
   Day seems dark as night. 
All the love of tender years 
   Turns to bitter hate; 
Though rfpentance comes with tears,. 
   It may be "too late"— 
Though the heart in anguish yearn, 
   Lay in sackcloth low; 
Confidence will not return, 
   Shattered by a blow. 
Then while you possess it whole, 
   Strive it to retain; 
Heart of truth and purpose, soul 
   Cannot cause you pain. 
May the tender power of love 
   Penetrate your life— 
True as are the stars above, 
   And as free from strife. 
What a tangled web we weave; 
   What a chain of sorrow! 
When we practice to deceive, 
   Gloom comes with the morrow. 
OUT IN THE DESERT. 
OUT in the desert afar, dost thou roam— 
Out on the waste bleak and wild; 
Why dost thou wander so far from thy home? 
Wolves will o'ertake thee dear child. 
   Jesus stands pleading, 
   With wounds afresh bleeding; 
O, come to his arms, meek and mild! 
Out on the mountain so bare and so cold, 
Hunger will blast thy fair cheek; 
Jesus, the shepherd, has left the dear fold, 
Now for thee lost one to seek. 
   Eventide falleth, 
   His tender voice calleth— 
Hear the sweet tones low and meek! 
Wander no longer across the wild moor; 
Back to the fold quickly flee! 
Jesus has kindly left open the door — 
Open, O, wanderer for thee! 
   The light is still burning, 
   He waits thy returning— 
O, prodigal wander no more! 
PART III. - The Race Problem. 
THE BLACK SAMPSON. 
HERE'S a Sampson lying, sleeping in the land, 
He shall soon awake, and with avenging hand, 
In an all unlocked for hour, 
He will rise in mighty power; 
   What dastard can his righteous rage withstand? 
E'er since the chains were riven at a stroke, 
E'er since the dawn of Freedom's morning broke, 
He has groaned, but scarcely uttered, 
While his patient tongue ne'r muttered, 
   Though in agony he bore the galling yoke. 
O, what cruelty and torture has he felt? 
Could his tears, the heart of his oppressor melt? 
In his gore they bathed their hands, 
Organized and lawless bands— 
   And the innocent was left in blood to welt. 
The mighty God of Nations doth not sleep, 
His piercing eye its faithful watch doth keep, 
And well nigh His mercy's spent, 
To the ungodly lent: 
   "They have sowed the wind, the whirlwind they shall reap." 
From His nostrils issues now the angry smoke, 
And asunder bursts the all-oppressive yoke; 
When the prejudicial heel 
Shall be lifted, we shall feel, 
   That the hellish spell surrounding us is broke. 
The mills are grinding slowly, slowly on, 
And till the very chaff itself is gone; 
Our cries for justice louder, 
'Till oppression's ground to powder— 
   God speed the day of retribution on! 
Fair Columbia's filmy garments all are stained; 
In her courts is blinded justice rudely chained; 
The black Sampson is awaking, 
And his fetters fiercely breaking; 
   By his mighty arm his rights shall be obtained!
“THEY ARE COMING." 
THEY are coming, coming slowly— 
They are coming, surely, surely— 
In each avenue you hear the steady tread. 
From the depths of foul oppression, 
Comes a swarthy-hued procession, 
And victory perches on their banners' head. 
They are coming, coming slowly— 
They are coming; yes, the lowly, 
No longer writhing in their servile bands. 
From the rice fields and plantation 
Comes a factor of the nation, 
And threatening, like Banquo's ghost, it stands. 
They are coming, coming proudly— 
They are crying, crying loudly: 
O, for justice from the rulers of the land! 
And that justice will be given, 
For the mighty God of heaven 
Holds the balances of power in his hand. 
Prayers have risen, risen, risen, 
From the cotton fields and prison; 
Though the overseer stood with lash in hand, 
Groaned the overburdened heart; 
Not a tear-drop dared to start— 
But the Slaves' petition reach'd the glory-land. 
They are coming, they are coming, 
From away in tangled swamp, 
Where the slimy reptile hid its poisonous head; 
Through the long night and the day, 
They have heard the bloodhounds' bey, 
While the morass furnished them an humble bed. 
They are coming, rising, rising, 
And their progress is surprising, 
By their brawny muscles earning daily bread; 
Though their wages be a pittance, 
Still each week a small remittance, 
Builds a shelter for the weary toiling head. 
They are coming, they are coming— 
Listen! You will hear the humming 
Of the thousands that are falling into line: 
There are Doctors, Lawyers, Preachers; 
There are Sculptors, Poets, Teachers— 
Men and women, who with honor yet shall shine. 
They are coming, coming boldly, 
Though the Nation greets them coldly; 
They are coming from the hillside and the plain. 
With their scars they tell the story 
Of the canebrakes wet and gory, 
Where their brothers' bones lie bleaching with the slain. 
They are coming, coming singing, 
Their Thanksgiving hymn is ringing. 
For the clouds are slowly breaking now away, 
And there comes a brighter dawning— 
It is liberty's fair morning, 
They are coming surely, coming, clear the way. 
Yes, they come, their stepping's steady, 
And their power is felt already— 
God has heard the lowly cry of the oppressed; 
And beneath his mighty frown, 
Every wrong shall crumble down, 
When the right shall triumph and the world be blest! 
RT. REV. RICHARD ALLEN. 
OUR Richard Allen in his early youth, 
Sought out and found the way of light and truth; 
His heart with holy impulse was stirred, 
And boldly forth he went to preach the word. 
Sometimes he had not even a resting-place — 
Footsore and weary, still he cried free grace; 
And yet in pastures green the shepherd fed, 
And by the cooling stream was often led. 
Year after year is born and glides away; 
Generations rise and flourish and decay; 
Flowers bud and blossom, fade and fall, 
But eternal truth outlives them all. 
And so a hundred years have passed away, 
Since the immortal Allen's natal day; 
And where he sleeps the sun's departing ray 
Long lingers, o'er that hallowed heap of clay. 
He came of humble parentage to earth; 
A slave was he of meek and lowly birth; 
A bondsman dared not even raise his voice, 
Nor o'er his young, his darling child rejoice. 
But God his promises, has ever kept, 
And the foul stigma from this land is swept — 
At last the slavish chains forever broke, 
And falls at last the bondman's galling yoke. 
As they march on you hear their steady tread, 
With Allen's banner waving overhead; 
The cause of Christ to distant islands borne — 
O, flourish till the resurrection morn! 
PART IV - Obituaries. 
HE HATH NEED OF REST! 
                              WHY stand aghast, 
This weeping, wondering throng? 
   The warrior hath his armor bright lain down, 
And now in rapturous song His Master's praise he sings, 
While angels sweep their harps of thousands' strings, 
      The strains prolong: 
               His fight is over! 
                           He hath need of rest. 
      His weary bleeding feet, 
That trod the field with ever patient tread, 
The dewy banks have pressed. They tread the streets of gold, 
His eyes the Saviour's face and smile behold. 
      Say not that he is dead, but 
                           He hath need of rest! 
                              A goodly fight; 
      A glorious victory won! 
At Jesus' feet the trophies are laid down, 
And on the warrior's brow is placed the crown, 
For which he bravely, boldly fought, 
And heaven's glorious plaudits sought. 
      Now, with the ransomed blest 
                           His soul finds rest! 
                              Weep ye no more, 
Nor stand with bated breath; 
Christ will his promise to the faithful keep, 
The mighty warrior is but fallen asleep. 
He feels no more earth's care and toil and pain, 
Our loss is but his everlasting gain. 
Arrayed in white, in realms of perfect bliss, 
      He finds a needed rest. 
                              Eternal joys are his, 
Who to the end proves true: 
Ye fellow-warriors in the gospel field! 
Fight on, nor dare the battle yield; 
Press hard the conflict to the gate, 
Walk in the narrow path and straight; 
Your upward way from morn to even press, 
At last ye too shall find 
                           Eternal rest! 
REV. ANDREW BROWN, OVER THE HILL TO REST. 
THE fight was at its hottest, 
The battle 'gainst the wrong; 
The valiant in the contest, 
Both vigorous and strong. 
Engaged in deadly conflict, 
A solid phalanx stood, 
A breastworks made of soldiers, 
Even soldiers unto God. 
Amidst the clang of armor, 
And crash of cannon's roar, 
There came a sound which echoed, 
And spread from shore to shore. 
Andrew Brown has fallen, 
No confiscate was he; 
A captain bold and fearless— 
No thought but victory. 
He's just received promotion, 
To the army in the sky; 
He's reached a higher station, 
We shall join him by and by. 
Then, comrades, do not mourn him, 
Drive sorrow from your breast, 
Our loss is his eternal gain, 
He's o'er the hill at rest. 
BISHOP JAMES A. SHORTER. 
Lines Suggested by the Death of our Beloved Bishop, James A. Shorter, who Died, July i, 1887. 
IT came upon the noontide air, 
   Like thunder-bolt from clearest skies; 
Stout hearts were clad in sore despair, 
   And floods of tears flowed from all eyes. 
Across the States and o'er the plain, 
   And to the distant Isles it sped; 
From mountain height to sea's domain, 
   Flashed the sad message, "Shorter's dead!" 
From lip to lip the sad news ran, 
   From every breast arose a sigh; 
Awestricken stood the stoutest man, 
   Till hope bade all look up on high. 
God still is just, allwise is He— 
   What He hath taken He can send; 
Bow down in meek humility 
   And own Him! Trust Him to the end! 
Our Shorter dies—do we say dead? 
   Nay, only sleeps to wake again! 
Though earth affords an humble bed, 
   With Kings and Princes he shall reign! 
He slept not at his duty's post, 
   Who was a mighty army's head— 
He led an ever conquering host— 
   He sleeps—say not that he is dead! 
Heaven stood in need of saint to fill 
   Some holy office on that day; 
And angels, at their sovereign's will, 
   Quickly to earth they sped away. 
They sought one pure and true and good; 
   They found in Shorter what they sought; 
Pure in his life and love he stood, 
   And to our sire this message brought: 
Thy God to-day hath need of thee, 
   They whispered gently in his ear; 
He looked the shining ones to see, 
   And smiled while they were hovering near. 
His ever-ready sword in hand, 
   Directed e'er towards evil's breast, 
Now laid he down at God's command, 
   And entered into peaceful rest. 
The startled millions paused in pain, 
   Tempted to ask the reason, why 
Their noble captain should be slain ? 
   Then out of heaven came this cry: 
"White is the harvest on the plain, 
   And ripe this shock of wheat has grown; 
Ye angels reap this perfect grain, 
   Which I, with mine own hand hath sown. 
A MESSAGE TO A LOVED ONE DEAD. 
To Bishop Jame A. Shorter
I SEND a message, my worthy Chief, 
   For I cannot come to thee now. 
Though my heart is o'erwhelmed with its weight of grief, 
   At God's stern decree I must bow. 
They tell me that thou hast fallen asleep, 
   That thou didst discharge thy whole duty; 
They say it is folly to sit here and weep, 
   For thy life was complete in its beauty. 
And purity crowned thy declining years, 
   And holiness circled thy head— 
'Tis folly they say to sit down here in tears, 
   And grieve o'er the tomb of the dead. 
I hear the soft tones of Thy fatherly voice, 
   Saying: " Cling to the cross, my dear child," 
If after life's labors your soul would rejoice, 
   In the sunshine of God's presence mild. 
No more shall Thy soft voice fall sweet on my ear, 
   No more in this life shall we meet— 
Till Christ in His heavenly Kingdom appear, 
   And our warfare on earth is complete. 
So I send thee this message to-night when I pray, 
   I'll give it to the angels for thee— 
They'll hasten to take it, they will not delay, 
   To bear it to heaven for me. 
I would not arouse thee, I would not awake, 
   From this thy merited rest; 
Sleep soundly thou loved one, thy comfort now take 
   Upon thy Redeemer's breast! 
BEREFT. 
I FROM my window looked at early dawning, 
The sweet breeze stirred and kissed my face; 
O, glad is every heart, I thought on this fair morning, 
Earth seemed so 'restful in the morn's embrace. 
In grateful attitude I stood imploring, 
Sufficient strength for daily care, 
My heart was pained at sight of badge of mourning, 
That from my neighbor's door, swayed on the air. 
It told me the  “unbidden guest" had entered, 
And claimed the darling of that fold, 
In whom their blasted hopes had once been centered, 
Life evermore within that home was drear and cold. 
I sought the mother in affliction's hour, 
My solace offered in her sore distress; 
I pointed to the Christ, the only power 
To cheer the heart bereft and comfortless. 
And in my heart's great deep I pitied her, 
Who, though bereft could sympathetic be: 
Our mutual tears were shed—I childless was— 
And in her inmost soul she pitied me! 
RESTING. 
In Memoriam of Mrs. Bishop Turner. 
WE moum to-day o'er our sister dead, 
But sweet seemed the rest to the weary head,
The hands were calmly laid to rest, 
O'er the pulseless bosom and painless breast. 
The lips are silent and closely sealed, 
The love of the Saviour, her smile revealed; 
The weary feet that so often trod 
Rough ways that led to the throne of God, 
They tire no more, but forever are still: 
They've reached the summit of Zion's hill! 
Thrice had she come to the river before— 
The boatman tarried to take her o'er, 
But the voice of loved ones raised in prayer, 
Prevailed with the Master her life to spare; 
Then through life's day she gladly gleaned, 
For the dear Saviour on whom she leaned— 
A cup of cold water, or binding a wound, 
Samaritan-like she was always found. 
Her labors are ended, her trials are o'er, 
Her soul has flown to the golden shore, 
Where saints are rejoicing in white robes dressed, 
And star-decked crowns on their brows are pressed. 
Yes, she has passed on to the glory-land, 
And bearing the sheaves she has gleaned in her hand; 
The conflict is ended, her victory complete, 
She casts her crown now at the Lord Christ's feet. 
IN MEMORY OF JAMES M. RATHEL. 
CAME a stranger late among us, 
   With us came and cast his lot ; 
In the Master's vineyard toiling, 
   In God's service chose a spot. 
Though upon his features ruddy 
   There was yet the smile of youth, 
In his manly bearing steady, 
   Deep impressed the light of Truth. 
He had come to lands far distant, 
   And with strangers made his home, 
But his feet from paths of duty 
   Never once was known to roam. 
Firm of purpose, pleasing manner, 
   Touched with fire from above, 
Holding up the blood stained banner, 
   Zealous, full of Christian love. 
Like the Master daily went he 
   Here and thither doing good 
In the haunts of vice and mis'ry, 
   On "the solid Rock" he stood. 
Young, but in the battle leading 
   Older souls who faint had grown; 
With the youthful daily pleading 
   That the Saviour they should own. 
Soon, alas, his work was ended, 
   By the monster stricken down, 
Yet on Christ his hopes depended, 
   And by faith he saw his crown. 
In his dying gained the victory 
   O'er the grave, and hell, and death; 
For his voice was raised in praises, 
   Even with his latest breath. 
Gazing on our fallen brother, 
   Gazing not with tearless eyes, 
Ah! we thought of his fond mother, 
   Could she in our midst arise 
See how loving hands and tender, 
   Wrought the wreaths of lilies fair, 
Stranger hearts groaning with anguish, 
   Stranger eyes wept many a tear. 
Though her heart is sad, but sadder, 
   For we know itmight have been, 
Had her boy in shame have fallen, 
   In iniquity and sin. 
But the congregation passing 
   Slowly by look to gain, 
For the last knew that before them 
   Lay a Christian free from pain. 
Pain of earth, and care and sorrow, 
   From the tempter's snare set free, 
Rest thou! In the bright to-morrow 
   We shall meet in heaven with thee! 
Fare thee well and fare thee sweetly, 
   With the saints in glad array, 
Time moves on, bears us fleetly 
   Towards the Resurrection Day! 
THE NATIONAL CEMETERY, BEAUFORT, SOUTH CAROLINA. 
I STAND to-day on this historic ground, 
   Where many thousand heroes now at rest, 
Lay in this sea-girt nook, while not a sound 
   Of life or drum disturbs each pulseless breast. 
But in the earth's embrace they calmly sleep, 
   While peace o'er trees and verdant shrubbery waves, 
God's white-robed sentinels doth keep 
   Their nightly vigil o'er their grassy graves. 
And here they lie as in their ranks they stood 
   Upon the field of carnage, where they fell; 
With noble purpose linked in brotherhood, 
   They broke the bondsman's fetters born of hell. 
I read the names engraven here on stone, 
   Yet some "unknown" appear who fought for right; 
But on the records kept on high, not one 
   "Unknown" is found. They're known there in God's sight. 
“Beguiescat in pace" until the bugle call, 
   Shall summon ye with us to meet our God, 
"Who taketh note of every sparrow's fall, 
   And chasteneth whom He loveth with the rod." 
SOLACE. 
To Minister and Mrs. Lincoln, on the death of their son A. Lincoln
. 
AS o'er thy loved one now in grief ye bendeth, 
   A Nation bows with thee, its sorrow lendeth, 
That ye, grief-stricken should's not weep alone, 
   Above the shrouded form of thy dear one. 
But, as we shed with thee our silent tears, 
   For him who bore himself beyond his years, 
Hope bids us cease and banisheth our pain, 
   And pleads your loss, his soul's eternal gain. 
The reaper cuts the grain and lovely flowers. 
   Transplants them in a fairer land than ours. 
The path to heaven rendered thus more plain, 
   Weep not, press on, ye all shall meet again. 
He nobly lived nor feared the shad'wy vale, 
   Defied the white horse with it's rider pale; 
The grave no terror hath, and death no sting, 
   For him who fully trusts in Christ the King. 
AN EPITAPH. 
WHEN I am gone, 
Above me raise no lofty stone 
Perfect in human handicraft, 
No upward pointing gleaming shaft. 
Say this of me, and I be content, 
That in the Master's work my life was spent ; 
Say not that I was either great or good, 
But Mary-like, "She hath done what she could."

AUNT CHLOE.
I REMEMBER, well remember,
     That dark and dreadful day,
When they whispered to me, "Chloe,
     Your children's sold away!"
It seemed as if a bullet
     Had shot me through and through,
And I felt as if my heart-strings
     Was breaking right in two.
And I says to cousin Milly,
     "There must be some mistake;
Where's Mistus?" "In the great house crying—
     Crying like her heart would break.
"And the lawyer's there with Mistus;
     Says he's come to 'ministrate,
'Cause when master died he just left
     Heap of debt on the estate.
"And I thought 'tweuld do you good
     To bid your boys good-bye—
To kiss them both and shake their hands,
     And have a hearty cry.
"Oh! Chloe, I knows how you feel,
     'Cause I'se been through it all;
I thought my poor old heart would break
     When master sold my Saul."
Just then I heard the footsteps
     Of my children at the door,
And I rose right up to meet them,
     But I fell upon the floor.
And I heard poor Jakey saying,
     "Oh, mammy, don't you cry!"
And I felt my children kiss me
     And bid me, both, good-bye.
Then I had a mighty sorrow,
     Though I nursed it all alone;
But I wasted to a shadow,
     And turned to skin and bone.
But one day dear uncle Jacob
     (In heaven he's now a saint)
Said, "You: poor heart is in the fire,
     But child you must not faint."
Then I said to uncle Jacob,
     If I was good like you,
When the heavy trouble dashed me
     I'd know just what to do.
Then he said to me, "Poor Chloe,
     The way is open wide:"
And he told me of the Saviour,
     And the fountain in His side.
Then he said "Just take your burden
     To the blessed Master's feet;
I takes all my troubles, Chloe,
     Right unto the mercy-seat."
His words waked up my courage,
     And I began to pray,
And I felt my heavy burden.
     Rolling like a stone away.
And a something seemed to tell me,
     You will see your boys again—
And that hope was like a poultice
     Spread upon a dreadful pain.
And it often seemed to whisper,
     Chloe, trust and never fear;
You'll get justice in the kingdom,
     If you do not get it here.
THE DELIVERANCE.
Master only left old Mistus
     One bright and handsome boy;
But she fairly doted on him,
     He was her pride and joy.
We all liked Mister Thomas,
     He was so kind at heart;
And when the young folkes got in scrape, 
     He always took their part.
He kept right on that very way
     Till he got big and tall,
And old Mistus used to chide him.
     And say he'd spile us all.
But somehow the farm did prosper
     When he took things in hand;
And though all the servants liked him,
     He made them understand.
One evening Mister Thomas said,
     "Just bring my easy shoes:
I am going to sit by mother,
     And read her up the news."
Soon I heard him tell old Mistus
     We're bound to have a fight;
But we'll whip the Yankees, mother,
     We'll whip them sure as night!"
Then I saw old Mistus tremble;
     She gasped and held her breath;
And she looked on Mister Thomas
     With a face as pale as death.
"They are firing on Fort Sumpter;
     Oh! I wish that I was there!—
Why, dear mother! what's the matter?
     You're the picture of despair."
"I was thinking, dearest Thomas,
     ‘Twould break my very heart
If a fierce and dreadful battle
     Should tear our lives apart."
"None but cowards, dearest mother,
     Would skulk unto the rear,
When the tyrant's hand is shaking.
     All the heart is holding dear."
I felt sorry for old Mistus;
     She got too full to speak;
But I saw the great big tear-drops
     A running down her cheek.
Mister Thomas too was troubled
     With choosing on that night,
Betwixt staying with his mother
     And joining in the fight.
Soon down into the village came
     A call for volunteers;
Mistus gave up Mister Thomas,
     With many sighs and tears.
His uniform was real handsome;
     He looked so brave and strong;
But somehow I could'nt help thinking
     His fighting must be wrong.
Though the house was very lonesome,
     I thought 'twould all come right,
For I felt somehow or other
     We was mixed up in that fight.
And I said to Uncle Jacob,
     "Now old Mistus feels the sting,
For this parting with your children
     Is a mighty dreadful thing."
"Never mind," said Uncle Jacch,
     "Just wait and watch and pray,
For I feel right sure and certain,
     Slavery's bound to pass away;
"Because I asked the Spirit,
     If God is good and just,
How it happened that the masters
     Did grind us to the dust.
"And something reasoned right inside,
     Such should not always be;
And you could not beat it out my head,
     The Spirit spoke to me."
And his dear old eyes would brighten,
     And his lips put on a smile,
Saying, "Pick up faith and courage,
     And just wait a little while."
Mistus prayed up in the parlor,
     That the Secesh all might win;
We were praying in the cabins,
     Wanting freedom to begin.
Mister Thomas wrote to Mistus,
     Telling 'bout the Bull's Run fight,
That his troops had whipped the Yankee
     And put them all to flight.
Mistus' eyes did fairly glisten;
     She laughed and praised the South,
But I thought some day she'd laugh
     On tother side her mouth.
I used to watch old Mistus' face,
     And when it looked quite long
I would say to Cousin Milly,
     The battle's going wrong;
Not for us, but for the Rebels.—
     My heart 'would fairly skip,
When Uncle Jacob used to say,
     "The North is bound to whip."
And let the fight go as it would—
     Let North or South prevail—
He always kept his courage up,
     And never let it fail.
And he often used to tell us,
     "Children, don't forget to pray;
For the darkest time of morning
     Is just 'fore the break of day."
Well, one morning bright and early
     We heard the fife and drum,
And the booming of the cannon—
     The Yankee troops had come.
When the word ran through the village,
     The colored folks are free—
In the kitchens and the cabins
     We held a jubilee.
When they told us Mister Lincoln
     Said that slavery was dead,
We just poured our prayers and blessings
     Upon his precious head.
We just laughed, and danced, and shouted,
     And prayed, and sang, and cried,
And we thought dear Uncle Jacob
     Would fairly crack his side.
But when old Mistus heard it,
     She groaned and hardly spoke;
When she had to lose her servants,
     Her heart was almost broke
‘Twas a sight to see our people
     Going out, the troops to meet,
Almost dancing to the music,
     And marching down the street.
After years of pain and parting,
     Our chains was broke in two,
And we was so mighty happy,
     We did'nt know what to do.
But we soon got used to freedom,
     Though the way at first was rough;
But we weathered through the tempest,
     For slavery made us tough.
But we had one awful sorrow,
     It almost turned my head,
When a mean and wicked creature 
     Shot Mister Lincoln dead.
'Twas a dreadful solemn morning,
     I just staggered on my feet;
And the women they were crying
     And screaming in the street.
But if many prayers and blessings
     Could bear him to the throne,
I should think when Mister Lincoln died,
     That heaven just got its own.
Then we had another President,—
     What do you call his name?
Well, if the colored folks forget him
     They would'nt be much to blame.
We thought he'd be the Moses
     Of all the colored race;
But when the Rebels pressed us hard,
     He never showed his face.
But something must have happened him,
     Right curi's I'll be bound,
'Cause I heard 'em talking 'bout a circle
     That he was swinging round.
But everything will pass away—
     He went like time and tide—
And when the next election canie
     They let poor Andy slide.
But now we have a President,
     And if I was a man
I'd vote for him for breaking up
     The wicked Ku-Klux Klan.
And if any man should ask me
     If I would sell my vote,
I'd tell him I was not the one
     To change and turn my coat;
If freedom seem'd a little rough
     I'd weather through the gale;
And as to buying up my vote,
     I hadn't it for sale.
I do not think I'd ever be
     As slack as Jonas Handy;
Because I heard he sold his vote
     For just three sticks of candy.
But when John Thomas Reeder brought
     His wife some flour and meat,
And told her he had sold his vote
     For something good to eat.
You ought to seen Aunt Kitty raise,
     And heard her blaze away;
She gave the meat and flour a toss,
     And said they should not stay.
And I should think he felt quite cheap
     For voting the wrong side;
And when Aunt Kitty scolded him,
     He just stood up and cried.
But the worst fooled man I ever saw,
     Was when poor David Kand
Sold out for flour and sugar;
     The sugar was mixed with sand.
I'll tell you how the thing got out;
     His wife had company,
And she thought the sand was sugar,
     And served it up for tea.
When David sipped and sipped the tea,
     Somehow it didn't taste right;
I guess when he found he was sipping sand,
     He was mad enough to fight.
The sugar looked so nice and white—
     It was spread some inches deep—
But underneath was a lot of sand;
     Such sugar is mighty cheap.
You'd laughed to seen Lucinda Grange
     Upon her husband's track;
When he sold his vote for rations
     She made him tako 'em back.
Day after day did Milly Green
     Just follow after Joe,
And told him if he voted wrong
     To take his rags and go.
I think that Curnel Johnson said
     His side had won the day,
Had not we women radicals
     Just got right in the way. 
And yet I would not have you
     That all our men are shabby;
But 'tis said in every flock of sheep
     There will be one that's scabby.
I've heard, before election came
     They tried to buy John Slade;
But he gave them all to understand
     That he wasn't in that trade.
And we've got lots of other men
     Who rally round the cause,
And go for holding up the hands
     That gave us equal laws.
Who know their freedom cost too much
     Of blood and pain and treasure,
For them to fool away their votes
     For profit or for pleasure.
AUNT CHLOE'S POLITICS
Of course, I don't know very much
     About these politics,
But I think that some who run 'em,
     Do mighty ugly tricks.
I've seen 'em honey-fugle round,
     And talk so awful sweet,
That you think them full of kindness,
     As an egg is full of meat.
Now I don't believe in looking
     Honest people in the face,
And saying when you're doing wrong,
     That "I haven't sold my race."
When we want to school our children,
     If the money isn't there,
Whether black or white have took it,
     The loes we all must share.
And this buying up each other
     Is something worse than mean,
Though I thinks a heap of voting,
     I go for voting clean.
LEARNING TO READ.
Very soon the Yankee teachers
     Came down and set up school;
But, oh! how the Rebs did hate it,
     It was agin' their rule.
Our masters always tried to hide
     Book learning from our eyes;
Knowledge did'nt agree with slavery—
     ‘Twould make us all too wise.
But some of us would try to steal
     A little from the book,
And put the words together,
     And learn by hook or crook.
I remember Uncle Caldwell,
     Who took pot liquor fat
And greased the pages of his book,
     And hid it in his hat.
And had his master ever seen
     The leaves upon his head,
He'd have thought them greasy papers,
     But nothing to be read.
And there was Mr. Turner's Ben,
     Who heard the children spell,
And picked the words right up by heart,
     And learned to read 'em well.
Well, the Northern folks kept sending
     The Yankee teachers down;
And they stood right up and helped us,
     Though Rebs did sneer and frown.
And, I longed to read my Bible,
     For precious words it said;
But when I begun to learn it,
     Folks just shook their heads,
And said there is no use trying,
     Oh! Chloe, you're too late;
But as I was rising sixty,
     I had no time to wait.
So I got a pair of glasses,
     And straight to work I went,
And never stopped till I could read
     The hymns and Testament.
Then I got a little cabin—
     A place to call my own—
And I felt as independent
     As the queen upon her throne.
CHURCH BUILDING.
Uncle Jacob often told us,
     Since freedom blessed our race
We ought all to come together
     And build a meeting place.
So we pinched, and scraped, and spared,
     A little here and there:
Though our wages was but scanty,
     The church did get a share.
And, when the house was finished,
     Uncle Jacob came to pray;
He was looking mighty feeble,
     And his head was awful gray.
But his voice rang like a trumpet;
     His eyes looked bright and young;
And it seemed a mighty power
     Was resting on his tongue.
And he gave us all his blessing–
     'Twas parting words he said,
For soon we got the messsage
     The dear old man was dead.
But I believe he's in the kingdom,
     For when we shook his hand
He said, "Children, you must meet me
     Right in the promised land;
"For when I'm done a moiling
     And toiling here below,
Through the gate into the city
     Straightway I hope to go.”
THE REUNION.
Well, one morning real early
     I was going down the street,
And I heard a stranger asking
     For Missis Chloe Fleet.
There was a something in his voice
     That made me feel quite shaky,
And when I looked right in his face,
     Who should it be but Jakey!
I grasped him tight, and took him home—
     What gladness filled my cup!
And I laughed, and just rolled over,
     And laughed, and just give up.
"Where have you been? O Jakey, dear!
     Why didn't you come before?
Oh! when you children went away
     My heart was awful sore."
"Why, mammy, I've been on your hunt
     Since ever I've been free,
And I have heard from brother Ben,—
     He's down in Tennessee.
"He wrote me that he had a wife."
     "And children?" "Yes, he's three."
"You married, too?" "Oh no, indeed,
     I thought I'd first get free."
"Then, Jakey, you will stay with me,
     And comfort my poor heart;
Old Mistus got no power now
     To tear us both apart.
"I'm richer now than Mistus,
     Because I have got my son;
And Mister Thomas he is dead,
     And she's got nary one.
"You must write to brother Benny
     That he must come this fall,
And we'll make the cabin bigger,
     And that will hold us all.
"Tell him I want to see 'em all
     Before my life do cease:
And then, like good old Simeon,
     I hope to die in peace."
"I THIRST."
FIRST VOICE.
I THIRST, but earth cannot allay
     The fever coursing through my veins,
The healing stream is far away-
     It flows through Salem's lovely plains.
The murmurs of its crystal flow
     Break ever o'er this world of strife;
My heart is weary, let me go,
     To bathe it in the stream of life;
For many worn and weary hearts
     Have bathed in this pure healing stream,
And felt their griefs and cares depart,
     E'en like some sad forgotten dream.
SECOND VOICE.
"The Word is nign thee, even in thy Acara.”
Bay not, within thy weary heart,
     Who shall ascend above,
To bring unto thy fever'd lips
     The fount of joy and love.
Nor do thou seek to vainly delve
     Where death's pale angels tread,
To hear the muur of its flow
     Around the silent dead.
Within, in thee is one living fount,
     Red from the springs above;
There quench thy thirst till thou shalt bathe
     In God's own sea of love.
THE DYING QUEEN.
"I would meet death awake."
THE strength that bore her on for years
     Was ebbing fast away,
And o'er the pale and life-worn face,
     Death's solemn shadows lay.
With tender love and gentle care,
     Friends gathered round her bed,
And for her sake each footfall hushed
     The echoes of its tread.
They knew the restlessness of death
     Through every nerve did creep,
And carefully they tried to lull
     The dying Queen to sleep.
In vain she felt Death's icy hand
     Her failing heart-strings shake;
And, rousing up, she firmly said,
     "I'd meet my God awake."
Awake, I've met the battle's shock,
     And born the cares of state;
Nor shall I take your lethean сир,
     And slumber at death's gate.
Did I not watch with eyes alert,
     The path where foes did tend;
And shall I veil my eyes with sleep
     To meet my God and friend?
Nay, rather from my weary lids.
     This heavy slumber shake,
That I may pass the mystic vale,
     And meet my God awake.

This is the endpoint of the 1872 edition. Poems below this line were added to later editions of the book. 
THE JEWISH GRANDFATHER'S STORY.
Come, gather around me, children,
     And a story I will tell.
How we builded the beautiful temple—
     The temple we love so well.
I must date my story backward
     To a distant age and land,
When God did break our fathers' chairs
     By his mighty outstretched hand
Our fathers were strangers and captives,
     Where the ancient Nile doth flow;
Smitten by cruel taskmasters,
     And burdened by toil and woe.
As a shepherd, to pastures green
     Doth lead with care his sheep,
So God divided the great Red Sea,
     And led them through the deep.
You've seen me plant a tender vine,
     And guard it with patient care,
Till its roots struck in the mellow earth,
     And it drank the light and air.
So God did plant our chosen race,
     As a vine in this fair land;
And we grew and spread a fruitful tree,
     The planting of his right hand.
The time would fail strove I to tell.
     All the story of our race—
Of our grand old leader, Moses,
     And Joshua in his place,
Of all our rulers and judges,
     From Joshua unto Saul,
Over whose doomed and guilty head
     Fell ruin and death's dark pall.
Of valiant Jepthath, whose brave heart
     With sudden grief did bow,
When his daughter came with dance and song
     Unconscious of his vow.
Of Gideon, lifting up his voice
     To him who rules the sky,
And wringing out his well drenched fleece,
     When all around was dry.
How Deborah, neath her spreading palms,
     A judge in Israel rose,
And wrested victory from the hands
     Of Jacob's heathen foes.
Of Samuel, an upright judge.
     The last who ruled our tribes,
Whose noble life and cleanly hands,
     Were pure and free from bribes.
Of David, with his checkered life
     Our tuneful minstrel king,
Who breathed in sadness and delight,
     The psalms we love to sing.
Of Solomon, whose wandering heart,
     From Jacob's God did stray,
And cast the richest gifts of life,
     In pleasure's cup away.
How aged men advised his son,
     But found him weak and vain,
Until the kingdom from his hands
     Was rudely rent in twain.
Oh! sin and strife are fearful things,
     They widen as they go,
And leave behind them shades of death,
     And open gates of woe.
A trail of guilt, a gloomy line,
     Ran through our nation's life,
And wicked kings provoked our God,
     And sin and woe were rife.
At length, there came a day of doom—
     A day of grief and dread;
When judgment like a fearful storm
     Swept o'er our country's head.
And we were captives many years,
     Where Babel's stream doth flow;
With harps unstrung, on willows hung,
     We wept in silent woe.
We could not sing the old, sweet songs,
     Our captors asked to hear;
Our hearts were full, how could we sing
     The songs to us so dear?
As one who dreams a mournful dream,
     Which fades, as wanes the night,
So God did change our gloomy lot
     From darkness into light.
Belshazzar in his regal halls,
     A sumptuous feast did hold;
He praised his gods and drank his wine
     From sacred cups of gold.
When dance and song and revelry
     Had filled with mirth each hall,
Belshazzar raised his eyes and saw
     A writing on the wall.
He saw, and horror blanched his cheek,
     His lips were white with fear;
To read the words he quickly called
     For wise men, far and near.
But baffled seers, with anxious doubt
     Stood silent in the room,
When Daniel came, a captive youth,
     And read the words of doom.
That night, within his regal hall,
     Belshazzar lifeless lay;
The Persians grasped his fallen crown,
     And with the Mede held sway.
Darius came, and Daniel rose
     A man of high renown;
But wicked courtiers schemed and planned
     To drag the prophet down.
They came as men who wished to place
     Great honors on their king—
With flattering lips and oily words,
     Desired a certain thing.
They knew that Daniel, day by day
     Towards Salem turned his face,
And asked the king to sign a law
     His hands might not erase.
That till one moon had waned
     No cherished wish or thing
Should any ask of men or Gods.
     Unless it were the king. 
But Daniel, full of holy trust,
     His windows opened wide,
Regardless of the king's command,
     Unto his God he cried.
They brought him forth that he might be
     The hungry lion's meat,
Awe struck, the lions turned away
     And crouched anear his feet.
The God he served was strong to save
     His servaut in the den;
The fate devised for Daniel's life
     O'er took those scheming men.
And Cyrus came, a gracious king,
     And gave the blost command,
That we, the scattered Jews, should build
     Anew our fallen land.
The men who hated Juda's weal
     Were filled with bitter rage,
And 'gainst the progress of our work
     Did evil men engage.
Sanballat tried to hinder us,
     And Gashmu uttered lies,
But like a thing of joy and light,
     We saw our temple rise.
And from the tower of Hananeel
     Unto the corner gate,
We built the wall and did restore
     The places desolate.
Some mocked us as we labored on
     And scoffingly did say,
"If but a fox climb on the wall,
     Their work will give away."
But Nehemiah wrought in hope,
     Though heathen foes did frown
"My work is great," he firmly said,
     "And I cannot come down."
And when Shemai counselled him
     The temple door to close,
To hide, lest he should fall a prey
     Unto his cruel foes.
Strong in his faith, he answered, "No,
     He would oppose the tide,
Should such as he from danger flee,
     And in the temple hide?"
We wrought in earnest faith and hope
     Until we built the wall,
And then, unto a joyful feast
     Did priest and people call.
We came to dedicate the wall
     With sacrifice and joy—
A happy throng, from aged sire
     Unto the fair-haired boy.
Our lips so used to mournful songs,
     Did joyous laughter fill,
And strong men wept with sacred joy
     To stand on Zion's hill.
Mid scoffing foes and evil men,
     We built our city blest,
And 'neath our sheltering vines and palms.
     To-day in peace we rest.
SHALMANEZER,
PRINCE OF COSMAN.
BY MRS. FRANCES E. W. HARPER.
     Shalmanezer, Prince of Cosman, stood on the threshold of manly life, having just received a rich inheritance which had been left him by his  father. 
     He was a magnificent-looking creature-the very incarnation of manly strength and beauty. The splendid poise of his limbs, the vigor and litheness of his motions, the glorious light that flashed from his splendid dark eyes, the bright joyous smiles that occasionally wreathed his fresh young tips, and the finely-erect carriage of his head, were enough to impress the beholder with the thought, "Here is an athlete armed for a glorious strife." 
     While Shalmanezer was thinking upon his rich inheritance and how he should use it, he suddenly lifted his, eyes and saw two strange-looking personages standing near him. They both advanced towards Shalmanezer when they saw their presence had attracted his attention.
     The first one that approached the young man and addressed him, was named Desire. He was a pleasant-looking youth, with a flushed face, and onger, restless eyes. He looked as if he had been pursuing a journey, or had been grasping at an object he had failed to obtain. There was  something in his manner that betrayed a want of rest-a look in his eyes which seemed to say, "I am not satisfied." But when he approached, he smiled in the most seductive manner, and, reaching out his hand to Shalmanezer said: 
     "I have come to welcome thee to man's estate, and for thy enjoyment, I have brought thee three friends who will lead thee into the brightest paths, and press to thy lips the sweetest elixirs.”
     Gladly the young man received the greeting of Desire, who immediately introduced his three companions, whose names were, Pleasure, Wealth, and Fame.—Pleasure was a most beautiful creature. Herlovely dark eyes flashed out a laughing light; upor her finely-carved lips hovered the brightest and sweet est smiles, which seemed ever ready to break into merry ripples of laughter; her robe was magnificent ly beautiful, as if it had imprisoned in its warp and woof the beauty of the rainbow and the glory of the setting sun; in her hand she held a richly wrough chalice in which sparkled and effervesced a ruby-colored liquid which was as beautiful to the eye as it was pleasant to the taste. When Pleasure was presented to Shalmanezer, she held out to him her cup and said in the sweetest tones: 
     "Come, drink of my cup. It is sparkling and bright
     As rubies distilled in the morning light;
     A truce to sorrow. and adieu to pain—
     Here's the cup to strengthen, soothe and sustain."
Just as Shalmanezer was about to grasp the cup, the other personage approached him. Her name was Peace, and she was attended by a mild, earnest-looking young man called Self Denial. In the calm depths of her dark-blue eyes was a tender, loving light, and on her brow a majestic serenity which seemed to say, "The cares of earth are at my feet; in vain its tempests sweep around my path." There was also a look of calm, grand patience on the brow or her attendant, which gave him the aspect of one who had passed through suffering unto Peace. Shalmanezer was gazing eagerly on the fair young face of Pleasure, and about to quaff the sparkling nectar, when Peace suddenly arrested his hand and exclaimed:
     "Beware of this cup! "Neath its ruddy glow,
     Is an undercurrent of shame and woe;
     'Neath its sparkling sheen so fair and bright,
     Are serpents that hiss, and adders that bite."
     The young man paused a moment, looked on the plain garb of Peace and then on the enchanting loveliness of Pleasure, and, pushing aside the hand of Peace with a scornful gesture, hè said proudly and defantly:
     "I will follow Pleasure!"
     Peace, thus repulsed, turned sadly away; and Self-Denial, wounded by Shalmanezer's rude rejection, bowed his head in silent sorrow and disappeared from the scene.
     As Peace departed, Shalmanezer eagerly grasped the cap of Pleasure and pressed it to his lips, while she clasped her hand in his and said in a most charming manner, "Follow me;" and then he went willingly to the place where she dwelt. As Shalmanezer approached the palace of Pleasure he heard the sweetest music rising on the air in magnificent swells or sinking in ravishing cadences; at his feet were springing the brightest and fairest flowers; the sweetest perfumes were bathing the air with the most exquisite fragrance; beautiful girls moved like visions of loveliness through the mazy dance; rare old wines sparkled on the festal board; the richest viands and most luscious fruits tempted the taste; and laughter, dance and song filled the air with varied delights. For a while Shalmanezer was enraptured with the palace of Pleasure, But soon he became weary of its gay confusion. The merry ripples of laughter lost their glad freshness; the once delightful music seemed to faint into strange monotones-whether the defect was in his car or in the music he could not tell, but somehow it had ceased to gratify him; the constant flow of merry talk grew strangely distasteful to him; the pleasant viands began to pall upon his taste; at times he thought he detected a bitterness in the rare old wines which Pleasure ever and anon presented to his lips, and he turned wearily away from everything that had pleased his taste or had charmed and entranced his senses. 
     Shalmanezer sat moodily wishing that Desire would return and bring with him another attendant to whom he had been introduced when he had first clasped hands with Pleasure, and whose name was Wealth. While he was musing, he lifted up his eyes and saw Wealth and Desire standing at the door of his Boudoir, and near them he saw the sweet loving face of Peace, who was attended by Self Denial. Peace was about to approach him, but he repulsed her with an impatient frown, and turning to Desire he said:
     "I have grown weary of Pleasure, and I wish to be introduced to the halls of Wealth."
     Taller, graver and less fair was Wealth, than her younger sister, Pleasure. If the beauty of Pleasure could be compared to the vernal freshness of Spring that of Wealth suggested the maturity of golden harvests, and ripe autumnal fruits. Like Pleasure, she was very richly attired; a magnificent velvet robe fell in graceful folds around her well-proportioned form; like prisms of captured light, the most beautiful jewels gleamed and flashed in her hair; a girdle of the finest and most exquisitely wrought gold was clasped around her waist; her necklace and bracelets were formed of the purest jewels and finest diamonds.— But there was something in her face which betokened a want which all her wealth could not supply. There was a mournful restlessness in her eye that at times seemed to border on the deepest sadness; and yet, there was something so alluring in her manner, so dazzling in her attire, and fascinating in her surroundings, that men would often sacrifice time, talent, energy, and even conscience and manhood, to secure her smiles and bask in her favor.
     "Shalmanezer," said Desire to Wealth, "has grown weary of thy sister, Pleasure, and would fain dwell in thy stately halls, Is there aught to hinder him from being one of thy favored guests?" 
     "Nothing at all," said Wealth, smiling. "The rich inheritance left him by his father has been increasing in value, and I am glad that he was too wise to throw in Pleasure's cup life's richest gifts away."
     With these words she reached out her jewelled hand to Shalmanezer and said, "Follow me!" 
     Weary of the halls of Pleasure, Shalmanezer gladly rose to follow Wealth. As he was leaving, he paused a moment to bid adieu to Pleasure. But she was so changed, that he did not recognize in the faded woman with the weary, listless manner, dull eyes and hollow cheeks, the enchanting girl, who, a few years before, had led him to her halls a welcome and delighted guest. All was so changed. It seemed more like a dream than a reality, that he had dwelt for years in what now seemed like a disenchanted palace. The banquet table was strewn with broken and tasteless fragments; the flowers had lost their fragrance and beauty, and lay in piles of seentless leaves; the soft sweet music had fainted into low breathed sighs, and silence reigned in the deserted halls where dance and revelry and song had wreathed with careless mirth the bright and fleeting hours.
     "Come," said Wealth, "my Chariot waits thee at the door."
     Without one pang of regret, Shalmanezer turned from the halls of Pleasure, to ride with Wealth in her magnificent chariot.
     As they drove along, Wealth showed Shalmanezer the smoke rising from a thousand factories. Pausing a moment, she said:-"I superintend these works and here are my subjects."
     Shalmanezer gazed on the colossal piles of brick and mortar, as those castles of industry met his eye. Just then the bell rang, and he saw issuing from amid the smoke and whir of machinery a sight that filled his soul with deep compassion. 
     There were pale, sad-looking women wending their way home to snatch some moment's rest, and an humble meal before returning to their tasks. There were weary-looking men, who seemed to degenerating in mental strength and physical vigor. There were young children who looked as if the warm fresh currents of life in their veins had been touched with premature decay. And saddest of all -he saw young girls who looked as if they were rapidly changing from unsophisticated girlhood into over-ripe womanhood.
     “Are these thy servants?" said Shalmanezer, sadly.
     "These," said Wealth, "are my servants, but not my favorites. In lark mines-close factories-beneath low roofed huts-they dig the glittering jewels,
and weave the webs of splendor and beauty with which I adorn my favorites. But I see that the sight pains thee. Let us pass on to fairer scenes."
     Bending down to her finely-liveried coachman, she whispered in his car, and in a few minutes the factories, with their smoke and din, were left behind. Beautiful lawns, lovely parks, and elegant residences rose before the pleased eyes of Shalmanezer; beautiful children sported on the lawns; lovely girls roamed in the parks; and the whole scene was a bright contrast to those he had left behind. 
     At length they rode up an avenue of stately trees, and stopped at the home of Wealth. "Here is my dwelling," she said, "enter and be my welcome guest."
     Shalmanezer accepted the invitation, and entering, gazed with delighted wonder on the splendor and beauty of the place. On the walls hung most beautiful pictures surrounded by the richest frames--rare creations of the grand old masters; lovely statues suggested the idea of life strangely imprisoned in marble; velvet carpets sank pleasantly beneath his tread; elegant book cases, inlaid with ivory and pearl, held on the shelves the grand and noble productions of the monarchs of mind who still rule from their graves in the wide realms of thought and imagination. In her halls were sumptuous halls for feasting; delightful alcoves for thought and meditation; lovely little boudoirs for cozy chats with cherished friends. Even religion found costly bibles and splendidly embossed prayer books in the chambers of repose, where beneath the softened light of golden lamps, the children of Wealth sank to rest on beds of down.
     "Surely," said Shalmanezer, "he must be a strangely restless creature, who cannot be satisfied in this home of beauty, grace and affluence." And yet, while he spake, he was conscious of a sense of unrest. He tried to shake it off, but still it would return. He would find himself sighing amid the fairest Scenes- ―oppressed with a sense of longing for something he could not define. His eye was not satisfied with seeing, nor his ear with hearing. It seemed as if life had been presented to him as a luscious fruit, and he had eagerly extracted its richest juices, and
was ready to throw away the bitter rind in hopeless disgust.
     While he sat gloomily surveying the past, and feeling within his soul a hunger which neither Wealth nor Pleasure could appease, he lifted his eyes towards a distant mountain whose summit was crowned with perpetual snows, although a thousand sunbeams warmed and cheered the vale below. As he gazed, he saw a youth with a proud gait, buoyant step and flashing eye, climbing the mount. In his hand he held a beautifully embossed card, on which was written an invitation from Fame to climb her almost inaccessible heights and hear the sweetest mu\sie that ever ravished mortal ear. As the vonth ascended the mount, Shalmanezer heard the shouts of applause which were wafted to the ears of the young man, who continued to climb with unabated ardor.
     "Here," said Shalmanezer, "is a task worthy of my powers. I have wasted much of my time in the hails of Pleasure; I have grown weary of the stately palaces of Wealth; I will go forth and climb the heights of Fame, and find a welcome in the suncrowned palaces of Renown. O, the sight of that young mon inspires my soul, and gives new tone and vigor to my life. I will not pause another moment to listen to the blandishments of Wealth. Instead of treading on these soft carpets, I will brace my soul to climb the rugged heights to gaze upon the fair face of Fame."
     Just as he was making this resolve, he saw Peace and her attendant gazing anxiously and silently upon him. His face flushed with sudden anger; a wrathful light flashed from his eyes; and turning his face coldly from Peace, he said: "I do wish Peace would come without her unwelcome companion — Self-Denial I do utterly and bitterly hate." Peace again repulsed, turned sadly away, followed by Self-Denial. With eager haste Shalmanezer rose up and left the bowers of Ease and halls of Pride, to tread the rugged heights of Fame, with patient, ready feet. As he passed upward, new vigor braced his nerves. He felt an exhilaration of spirits he had never enjoyed in the halls of Wealth or bowers of Pleasure. Onward and upward he proudly moved, as the multitude, who stood at the base, cheered him with rapturous applause, and no music was ever so sweet to his ear as the plaudits of the crowd; but, as he ascended higher and higher, the voices of the multitude grew fainter and fainter; some voices that cheered him at the beginning of his journey had melted into the stillness of death; others had harshened into the
rough tones of disapprobation; others were vocifer ously applauding a new aspirant who had since started to climb the summit of Renown; but, with his eye upon the palace of Fame, he still climbed on, while the air grew rarer, and the atmosphere colder. The old elasticity departed from his limbs, and the buoyancy from his spirits, and it-seemed as if the chills of death were slowly creeping around his heart. But still, with fainter step he kept climbing upward, until almost exhausted, he sank down at the palace-gate of Fame, exclaiming, "Is this all?”
     Very stately and grand was the cloud-capped palace of Fame. The pillars of her lofty abode were engraven with the names of successful generals, mighty conquerors, great leaders, grand poets, illustrious men and celebrated women. There wer statues on which the tooth of Time was slowk gnawing; the statues of men whose brows had one been surrounded by a halo of glory, but were now darkened by the shadow of their crimes. Those heights which had seemed so enchanting at a distance, now seemed more like barren mounds, around which the chills of Death were ever sweeping. 
     Fame heard the voice of her votary, and came out to place upon his brow her greenest bays and brightest laurels, and bid him welcome to her palace; but when she saw the deathly whiteness of his face, she shrank back in pity and fear. The light was fading from his eye; his limbs had lost their manly strength; and Fame feared that the torpor of Death would overtake him before she could crown him as her honored guest. She bent down her ear to the sufferer, and heard him whisper slowly, "Peace! Peace!"
     Then said Fame to her servants, "Descend to the vale, bring the best medical skill ye can find, and search for Peace, and entreat her to come; tell her that one of my votaries lies near to death, and longs for her presence." The servants descended to the vale, and soon returned, bringing with thom a celebrated physician-Peace had heard the ery of Shalmanezer, and had entered the room with her companion before the doctor had come. When the physician saw Shalmanezer, he gazed anxiously upon him, felt the fluttering pulse, and chafed the pale cold hands to restore the warmth and circulation. 
     In the meantime, Pleasure and Wealth having heard the story of Shalmanezer's illness, entered the "There is but one thing," said the physician, "can save Shaimanezer's life: some one must take the warm healthy blood from his veins and inject it into Shalmanezer's veins before he can be restored to health."
     Pleasure and Wealth looked aghast when they heard the doctor's prescription. Pleasure suddenly remembered that she had a pressing engagement; Wealth said "I am no longer young, nor even well, and am sure I have not one drop of blood to spare;"Fame pitied her faithful votary, but amid the cold blasts that swept around her home, was sure it would be very imprudent for her to attempt to part with so much blood. Just as Pleasure, Wealth and Fame had refused to give the needed aid, Desire entered the room, but when he heard the conditions for the restoration of Shalmanezer, shrank back in selfish dismay, and refused also.
     As Shalmanezer lay gasping for breath, and looking wistfully at his old companions, Peace, attended by Self-Denial, drew near the sick man's couch. Shalmanezer opened his eyes languidly, and closed them wearily; when life was like a joyous dream, he had repulsed Peace and utterly hated Self Denial, and what could he dare hope from either in his hour of dire extremity. While he lay with his eyes half-closed, Self-Denial approached the bedside, and baring his arm, said to the doctor:
     "Here is thy needed remedy. Take the blood from these veins, and with it restore Shalmanezer to health and strength."
     The doctor struck his lancet into Self-Denial's arm, and drawing from it the needed quanity of blood, injected it into Shalmanezer's veins. The remedy was effectual. Health flushed the cheeks of Shalmanezer, and braced each nerve with new vigor, and he soon recovered from his fearful exhaustion. Then his heart did cleave unto Self-Denial. He had won his heart by his lofty sacrifice. He had by the blood from his own veins. Clasping hands with Self-Denial, he trod with him the paths of Peace, and in so doing, received an amount of true happiness which neither Pleasure, Wealth nor Fame could give.
OUT IN THE COLD.
Out in the cold mid the dreary night,
Under the eaves of homes so bright;
Snowflakes falling o'er mother's grave
Will no one rescue, no one save?
A child left out in the dark and cold,
A lamb not sheltered in any fold,
Hearing the wolves of hunger bark,
Out in the cold! and out in the dark
Missing to-night the charming bliss,
That lies in the mother's good-night kiss;
And hearing no loving father's prayer,
For blessings his children all may share.
Creeping away to some wretched den,
To sleep mid the curses of drunken men
And women, not as God has made,
Wrecked and ruined, wronged and betrayed.
Church of the Lord reach out thy arm,
And shield the hapless one from harm;
Where the waves of sin are dashing wild
Rescue and save the drifting child.
Wash from her life guilt's turbid foam,
In the fair haven of a home;
Tenderly lead the motherless girl
Up to the gates of purest pearl.
The wandering feet which else had strayed,
From thorny paths may yet be stayed;
And a crimson track through the cold dark night
May exchange to a line of loving light.
SAVE THE BOYS.
Like Dives in the deeps of Hell
I cannot break this fearful spell,
Nor quench the fires I've madly nursed,
Nor cool this dreadful raging thirst.
Take back your pledge—ye come too late!
Ye cannot save me from my fate,
Nor bring me back departed joys;
But ye can try to save the boys.
Ye bid me break my fiery chain,
Arise and be a man again,
When every street with snares is spread,
And nets of sin where'er I tread.
No; I must reap as I did sow.
The seeds of sin bring crops of woe;
But with my latest breath I'll crave
That ye will try the boys to save.
These bloodshot eyes were once so bright;
This sn-crushed heart was glad and light;
But by the wine-cup's ruddy glow
I traced a path to shame and woe.
A captive to my galling chain,
I've tried to rise, but tried in vain—
The cup allures and then destroys.
Oh! from its thraldom save the boys.
Take from your streets those traps of hell
Into whose gilded snares I fell.
Oh! freemen, from these foul decoys
Arise, and vote to save the boys.
Oh ye who license men to trade
In draughts that charm and then degrade,
Before ye hear the cry, Too late,
Oh, save the boys from my sad fate.
NOTHING AND SOMETHING.
It is nothing to me, the beauty said,
With a careless toss of her pretty head;
The man is weak if he can't refrain
From the cup you say is fraught with pain.
It was something to her in after years,
When her eyes were drenched with burning tears
And she watched in lonely grief and dread,
And startled to hear a staggering tread.
It is nothing to me, the mother said;
I have no fear that my boy will tread
In the downward path of sin and shame,
And crush my heart and darken his name.
It was something to her when that only son
From the path of right was early won,
And madly cast in the flowing bowl
A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.
It is nothing to me, the young man cried:
In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride;
I heed not the dreadful things ye tell:
I can rule myself I know full well.
It was something to him when in prison he lay
The victim of drink, life ebbing away;
And thought of his wretched child and wife,
And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.
It is nothing to me, the merchant said,
As over his ledger he bent his head;
I'm busy to-day with tare and tret,
And I have no time to fume and fret.
It was something to him when over the wire
A message came from a funeral pyre—
A drunken conductor had wrecked a train,
And his wife and child were among the slain.
It is nothing to me, the voter said,
The party's loss is my greatest dread;
Then gave his vote for the liquor trade,
Though hearts were crushed and drunkards made.
It was something to him in after life,
When his daughter became a drunkard's wife
And her hungry children cried for bread,
And trembled to hear their father's tread.
Is it nothing for us to idly sleep
While the cohorts of death their vigils keep?
To gather the young and thoughtless in
And grind in our midst a grist of sin?
It is something, yes, all, for us to stand
Clasping by faith our Saviour's hand;
To learn to labor, live and fight
On the side of God and changeless light.
WANDERER'S RETURN.
My home is so glad, my heart is so light,
My wandering boy has returned to-night.
He is blighted and bruised, I know, by sin,
But I am so glad to welcome him in.
The child of my tenderest love and care
Has broken away from the tempter's snare ;
To-night my heart is o'erflowing with joy,
I have found again my wandering boy.
My heart has been wrung with a thousand fears,
Mine eyes been drenched with the bitterest tears;
Like shadows that fade are my past alarms,
My boy is enclasped in his mother's arms.
The streets were not safe for my darling child;
Where sin with its evil attractions smiled.
But his wandering feet have ceased to roam,
And to-night my wayward boy is at home—
At home with the mother that loves him best,
With the hearts that have ached with sad unrest,
With the hearts that are thrilling with untold joy
Because we have found our wandering boy.
In that wretched man so haggard and wild
I only behold my returning child,
And the blissful tears from my eyes that start
Are the overflow of a happy heart.
I have trodden the streets in lonely grief,
I have sought in prayer for my sole relief;
But the depths of my heart to-night are stirred,
I know that the mother's prayer has been heard.
If the mother-love be so strong and great
For her child, sin-weary and desolate,
Oh what must the love of the Father be
For souls who have wandered like you and me!
“FISHERS OF MEN."
I had a dream, a varied dream:
     Before my ravished sight
The city of my Lord arose,
     With all its love and light.
The music of a myriad harps
     Flowed out with sweet accord;
And saints were casting down their crowns
     In homage to our Lord.
My heart leaped up with untold joy;
     Life's toil and pain were o'er;'
My weary feet at last had found
     The bright and restful shore.
Just as I reached the gates of light,
     Ready to enter in,
From earth arose a fearful cry
     Of sorrow and of sin.
I turned, and saw behind me surge
     A wild and stormy sea;
And drowning men were reaching out
     Imploring hands to me.
And ev'ry lip was blanched with dread
     And moaning for relief';
The music of the golden harps
     Grew fainter for their grief.
Let me return, I quickly said,
     Close to the pearly gate;
My work is with these wretched ones,
     So wrecked and desolate.
An angel smiled and gently said:
     This is the gate of life,
Wilt thou return to earth's sad scenes,
     Its weariness and strife,
To comfort hearts that sigh and break,
     To dry the falling tear,
Wilt thou forego the music sweet
     Entrancing now thy ear?
I must return, I firmly said,
     The struggles in that sea
Shall not reach out beseeching hands
     In vain for help to me.
I turned to go; but as I turned
     The gloomy sea grew bright,
And from my heart there seemed to flow
     Ten thousand cords of light.
And sin-wrecked men, with eager hands.
     Did grasp each golden cord;
And with my heart I drew them on
     To see my gracious Lord.
Again I stood beside the gate.
     My heart was glad and free;
For with me stood a rescued throng
     The Lord had given me.
SIGNING THE PLEDGE.
Do you see this cup—this tempting cup—
     Its sparkle and its glow?
I tell you this cup has brought to me
     A world of shame and woe.
Do you see that woman sad and wan?
     One day with joy and pride,
With orange blossoms in her hair,
     I claimed her as my bride.
And vowed that I would faithful prove
     Will death our lives should part;
I've drenched her soul with floods of grief,
     And almost crushed her heart.
Do you see that gray-haired mother bend
     Beneath her weight of years?
I've filled that aged mother's eyes
     With many bitter tears.
Year after year for me she prays,
     And tries her child to save;
I've almost brought her gray hairs down
     In sorrow to the grave.
Do you see that boy whose wistful eyes
     Are gazing on my face?
I've overshadowed his young life
     With sorrow and disgrace.
He used to greet me with a smile,
     His heart was light and glad;
I've seen him tremble at my voice,
     I've made that heart so sad.
Do you see this pledge I've signed to-night?
     My mother, wife, and boy
Shall read my purpose on that pledge
     And smile through tears of joy.
To know this night, this very night,
     I cast the wine-cup down,
And from the dust of a sinful life
     Lift up my manhood's crown.
The faded face of my young wife
     With roses yet shall bloom,
And joy shall light my mother's eyes
     On the margin of the tomb.
I have vowed to-night my only boy,
     With brow so fair and mild,
Shalit be taunted on the streets,
     And called a drunkard's child.
Never again shall that young face
     Whiten with grief and dread,
Because I've madly staggered home
     And sold for drink his bread.
This strong right arm unnerved by rum
     Shall battle with my fate;
And comfort crown the home And peace
     By drink made desolate.
Like a drowning man, tempest-tossed,
     Clings to a rocky ledge,
With trembling hands I've learned to grasp
     The gospel and the pledge.
A captive bounding from my chain,
     I've rent each hateful band,
And by the help of grace divine
     A victor hope to stand.

Ode To Ethiopia
O Mother Race! to thee I bring
This pledge of faith unwavering,
This tribute to thy glory.
I know the pangs which thou didst feel,
When Slavery crushed thee with its heel,
With thy dear blood all gory.
Sad days were those—ah, sad indeed!
But through the land the fruitful seed
Of better times was growing.
The plant of freedom upward sprung,
And spread its leaves so fresh and young—
Its blossoms now are blowing.
On every hand in this fair land,
Proud Ethiope’s swarthy children stand
Beside their fairer neighbor;
The forests flee before their stroke,
Their hammers ring, their forges smoke, —
They stir in honest labor.
They tread the fields where honor calls;
Their voices sound through senate halls
In majesty and power.
To right they cling; the hymns they sing
Up to the skies in beauty ring,
And bolder grow each hour.
Be proud, my Race, in mind and soul;
Thy name is writ on Glory’s scroll
In characters of fire.
High ‘mid the clouds of Fame’s bright sky
Thy banner’s blazoned folds now fly,
And truth shall lift them higher.
Thou hast the right to noble pride,
Whose spotless robes were purified
By blood’s severe baptism.
Upon thy brow the cross was laid,
And labor’s painful sweat-beads made
A consecrating chrism.
No other race, or white or black,
When bound, as thou wert, to the rack,
So seldom stooped to grieving;
No other race, when free again,
Forgot the past and proved them men
So noble in forgiving.
Go on and up! Our souls and eyes
Shall follow thy continuous rise;
Our ears shall list thy story
From bards who from thy root shall spring,
And proudly tune their lyres to sing
Of Ethiopia’s glory.
A Drowsy Day
The air is dark, the sky is gray,
The misty shadows come and go,
And here within my dusky room
Each chair looks ghostly in the gloom.
Outside the rain falls cold and slow, —
Half-stinging drops, half-blinding spray.
Each slightest sound is magnified,
For drowsy quiet holds her reign;
The burnt stick on the fireplace breaks,
The nodding cat with start awakes,
And then to sleep drops off again,
Unheeding Towser at her side.
I look far out across the lawn,
Where huddled stand the silly sheep;
My work lies idle at my hands,
My thoughts fly out like scattered strands
Of thread, and on the verge of sleep—
Still half awake—I dream and yawn.
What spirits rise before my eyes!
How various of kind and form!
Sweet memories of days long past,
The dreams of youth that could not last,
Each smiling calm, each raging storm,
That swept across my early skies.
Half seen, the bare, gaunt-fingered boughs
Before my window sweep and sway,
And chafe in tortures of unrest.
My chin sinks down upon my breast;
I cannot work on such a day,
But only sit and dream and drowse.
Keep A-Pluggin’ Away
I’ve a humble little motto
That is homely, though it’s true, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
It’s a thing when I’ve an object
That I always try to do, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
When you’ve rising storms to quell,
When opposing waters swell,
It will never fail to tell, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
If the hills are high before
And the paths are hard to climb,
Keep a pluggin’ away.
And remember that success
Comes to him who bides his time, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
From the greatest to the least,
None are from the rule released.
Be thou toiler, poet, priest,
Keep a pluggin’ away.
Delve away beneath the surface,
There is treasure farther down, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
Let the rain come down in torrents,
Let the threat’ning heavens frown,
Keep a pluggin’ away.
When the clouds have rolled away,
There will come a brighter day
All your labor to repay, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
There’ll be lots of sneers to swallow,
There’ll be lots of pain to bear, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
If you’ve got your eye on heaven,
Some bright day you’ll wake up there, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
Perseverance still is king;
Time its sure reward will bring;
Work and wait unwearying, —
Keep a pluggin’ away.
The Sparrow
A little bird, with plumage brown,
Beside my window flutters down,
A moment chirps its little strain,
Then taps upon my window pane,
And chirps again, and hops along,
To call my notice to its song;
But I work on, nor heed its lay,
Till, in neglect, it flies away.
So birds of peace and hope and love
Come fluttering earthward from above,
To settle on life’s window sills,
And ease our load of earthly ills;
But we, in traffic’s rush and din
Too deep engaged to let them in,
With deadened heart and sense plod on,
Nor know our loss till they are gone.
An Easter Ode
To the cold, dark grave they go
Silently and sad and slow,
From the light of happy skies
And the glance of mortal eyes.
In their beds the violets spring,
And the brook flows murmuring;
But at eve the violets die,
And the brook in the sand runs dry.
In the rosy, blushing morn,
See, the smiling babe is born;
For a day it lives, and then
Breathes its short life out again.
And anon gaunt-visaged Death,
With his keen and icy breath,
Bloweth out the vital fire
In the hoary-headed sire.
Heeding not the children’s wail,
Fathers droop and mothers fail;
Sinking sadly from each other,
Sister parts from loving brother.
All the land is filled with wailing, —
Sounds of mourning garments trailing,
With their sad portent imbued,
Making melody subdued.
But in all this depth of woe
This consoling truth we know:
There will come a time of rain,
And the brook will flow again;
Where the violet fell, ‘twill grow,
When the sun has chased the snow.
See in this the lesson plain,
Mortal man shall rise again.
Well the prophecy was kept;
Christ—"first fruit of them that slept"—
Rose with vic’try-circled brow;
So, believing one, shalt thou.
Ah! but there shall come a day
When, unhampered by this clay,
Souls shall rise to life newborn
On that resurrection morn.
October
October is the treasurer of the year,
And all the months pay bounty to her store;
The fields and orchards still their tribute bear,
And fill her brimming coffers more and more.
But she, with youthful lavishness,
Spends all her wealth in gaudy dress,
And decks herself in garments bold
Of scarlet, purple, red, and gold.
She heedeth not how swift the hours fly,
But smiles and sings her happy life along;
She only sees above a shining sky;
She only hears the breezes’ voice in song.
Her garments trail the woodlands through,
And gather pearls of early dew
That sparkle, till the roguish Sun
Creeps up and steals them every one.
But what cares she that jewels should be lost,
When all of Nature's bounteous wealth is hers?
Though princely fortunes may have been their cost,
Not one regret her calm demeanor stirs.
Whole-hearted, happy, careless, free,
She lives her life out joyously,
Nor cares when Frost stalks o’er her way
And turns her auburn locks to gray.
Merry Autumn
It's all a farce, —these tales they tell
About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o’er field and dell,
Because the year is dying.
Such principles are most absurd, —
I care not who first taught ‘em;
There’s nothing known to beast or bird
To make a solemn autumn.
In solemn times, when grief holds sway
With countenance distressing,
You’ll note the more of black and gray
Will then be used in dressing.
Now purple tints are all around;
The sky is blue and mellow;
And e’en the grasses turn the ground
From modest green to yellow.
The seed burs all with laughter crack
On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
Are all decked out in crimson.
A butterfly goes winging by;
A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
Is bubbling o’er with laughter.
The ripples wimple on the rills,
Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
And laughs among the grasses.
The earth is just so full of fun
It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
The heavens seem to rain it.
Don’t talk to me of solemn days
In autumn’s time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
And these grow slant and slender.
Why, it’s the climax of the year, —
The highest time of living!—
Till naturally its bursting cheer
Just melts into thanksgiving.
To Dr. James Newton Matthews
All round about, the clouds encompassed me;
On every side I looked, my weary sight
Was met by terrors of Plutonian night;
And chilling surges of a cruel sea
That beat against my stronghold ceaselessly,
Roared rude derision at my hapless plight;
And hope, which I had thought to hold so tight,
Slipped from my weak’ning grasp and floated free.
But when I thought to flee the unequal strife,
As wearied out I could not bear it more,
Fate gave the choicest gem of all her store, —
And noble Matthews came into my life.
He warmed my being like a virile flame,
And with his coming, light and courage came!
A Summer Pastoral
It's hot to-day. The bees is buzzin’
Kinder don’t-keer-like aroun’,
An’ fur off the warm air dances
O’er the parchin’ roofs in town.
In the brook the cows is standin’;
Childern hidin’ in the hay;
Can’t keep none of ‘em a workin’,
‘Cause it’s hot to-day.
It’s hot to-day. The sun is blazin’
Like a great big ball o’ fire;
Seems as ef instead o’ settin’
It keeps mountin’ higher an’ higher.
I'm as triflin’ as the childern,
Though I blame them lots an’ scold;
I keep slippin’ to the spring house,
Where the milk is rich an’ cold.
The very air within its shadder
Smells o’ cool an’ restful things,
An’ a roguish little robin
Sits above the place an’ sings.
I don’t mean to be a shirkin’,
But I linger by the way
Longer, mebbe, than is needful,
‘Cause it’s hot to-day.
It’s hot to-day. The horses stumble
Half asleep across the fiel’s;
An’ a host o’ teasin’ fancies
O’er my burnin’ senses steals, —
Dreams o' cool rooms, curtains lowered,
An’ a sofy’s temptin’ look;
Patter o’ composin’ raindrops
Or the ripple of a brook.
I strike a stump! That wakes me sudden;
Dreams all vanish into air.
Lordy! how I chew my whiskers;
‘Twouldn’t do fur me to swear.
But I have to be so keerful
‘Bout my thoughts an’ what I say;
Somethin’ might slip out unheeded,
‘Cause it's hot to-day.
Git up, there, Suke! you, Sal, git over!
Sakes alive! how I do sweat.
Every stitch that I've got on me,
Bet a cent, is wringin’ wet.
If this keeps up, I’ll lose my temper.
Gee there, Sal, you lazy brute!
Wonder who on airth this weather
Could ‘a’ be’n got up to suit?
You, Sam, go bring a tin o’ water;
Dash it all, don't be so slow!
‘Pears as ef you tuk an hour
‘Tween each step to stop an’ blow.
Think I want to stand a meltin’
Out here in this b’ilin’ sun,
While you stop to think about it?
Lift them feet o’ your’n an’ run.
It ain’t no use; I’m plumb fetaggled.
Come an’ put this team away.
I won’t plow another furrer;
It’s too mortal hot to-day.
I ain’t weak, nor I ain’t lazy,
But I’ll stand this half day’s loss
‘Fore I let the devil make me
Lose my patience an’ git cross.
Songs
A bee that was searching for sweets one day
Through the gate of a rose garden happened to stray.
In the heart of a rose he hid away,
And forgot in his bliss the light of day,
As sipping his honey he buzzed in song;
Though day was waning, he lingered long,
For the rose was sweet, so sweet.
A robin sits pluming his ruddy breast,
And a madrigal sings to his love in her nest:
"Oh, the skies they are blue, the fields are green,
And the birds in your nest will soon be seen!"
She hangs on his words with a thrill of love,
And chirps to him as he sits above,
For the song is sweet, so sweet.
A maiden was out on a summer’s day
With the winds and the waves and the flowers at play;
And she met with a youth of gentle air,
With the light of the sunshine on his hair.
Together they wandered the flowers among;
They loved, and loving they lingered long,
For to love is sweet, so sweet.
Bird of my lady’s bow’r,
Sing her a song;
Tell her that ev’ry hour,
All the day long,
Thoughts of her come to me,
Filling my brain
With the warm ecstasy
Of love's refrain.
Little bird! happy bird!
Being so near,
Where e'en her slightest word
Thou mayest hear,
Seeing her glancing eyes,
Sheen of her hair,
Thou art in paradise, —
Would I were there.
I am so far away,
Thou art so near;
Plead with her, birdling gay,
Plead with my dear.
Rich be thy recompense,
Fine be thy fee,
If through thine eloquence
She hearken me.
Sunset
The river sleeps beneath the sky,
And clasps the shadows to its breast;
The crescent moon shines dim on high;
And in the lately radiant west
The gold is fading into gray.
Now stills the lark his festive lay
And mourns with me the dying day, —
While in the south the first faint star
Lifts to the night its silver face,
And twinkles to the moon afar
Across the heaven's graying space;
Low murmurs reach me from the town,
As Day puts on her sombre crown,
And shakes her mantle darkly down.
In Summer Time
When summer time has come, and all
The world is in the magic thrall
Of perfumed airs that lull each sense
To fits of drowsy indolence;
When skies are deepest blue above,
And flow’rs aflush, — then most I love
To start, while early dews are damp,
And wend my way in woodland tramp
Where forests rustle, tree on tree,
And sing their silent songs to me;
Where pathways meet and pathways part, —
To walk with Nature heart by heart,
Till wearied out at last I lie
Where some sweet stream steals singing by
A mossy bank; where violets vie
In color with the summer sky, —
Or take my rod and line and hook,
And wander to some darkling brook,
Where all day long the willows dream,
And idly droop to kiss the stream,
And there to loll from morn till night—
Unheeding nibble, run, or bite—
Just for the joy of being there
And drinking in the summer air,
The summer sounds, and summer sights,
That set a restless mind to rights
When grief and pain and raging doubt
Of men and creeds have worn it out;
The birds’ song and the water's drone,
The humming bees’ low monotone,
The murmur of the passing breeze,
And all the sounds akin to these,
That make a man in summer time
Feel only fit for rest and rhyme.
Joy springs all radiant in my breast;
Though pauper poor, than king more blest,
The tide beats in my soul so strong
That happiness breaks forth in song,
And rings aloud the welkin blue
With all the songs I ever knew.
O time of rapture! time of song!
How swiftly glide thy days along
Adown the current of the years,
Above the rocks of grief and tears!
‘Tis wealth enough of joy for me
In summer time to simply be.
Hymn
When storms arise
And darkening skies
About me threat’ning lower,
To thee, O Lord, I lift mine eyes;
To thee my tortured spirit flies
For solace in that hour.
Thy mighty arm
Will let no harm
Come near me nor befall me.
Thy voice shall quiet my alarm;
When life’s great battle waxeth warm,
No foeman shall appall me.
Upon thy breast
Secure I rest
From sorrow and vexation,
No more by sinful cares oppressed,
But in thy presence ever blest,
O God of my salvation!
A Banjo Song
Oh, dere’s lots o’ keer an’ trouble
In dis world to swaller down;
An’ ol’ Sorrer’s purty lively
In her way o’ gittin’ roun’.
Yet dere ‘s times when I furgit ‘em, —
Aches an’ pains an’ troubles all, —
An’ it’s when I tek at ebenin’
My ol’ banjo f’om de wall.
‘Bout de time dat night is fallin’
An’ my daily wu’k is done,
An’ above de shady hilltops
I kin see de settin’ sun;
When de quiet, restful shadders
Is beginnin’ jes’ to fall, —
Den I take de little banjo
F’om its place upon de wall.
Den my fam’ly gadders roun’ me
In de fadin’ o’ de light,
Ez I strike de stings to try ‘em
Ef dey all is tuned er-right.
An’ it seems we're so nigh heaben
We kin hyeah de angels sing
When de music o’ dat banjo
Sets my cabin all er-ring.
An’ my wife an’ all de othahs, —
Male an’ female, small an’ big, —
Even up to gray-haired granny,
Seem jes’ boun’ to do a jig;
Twell I change de style o’ music,
Change de movement an’ de time,
An’ de ringin’ little banjo
Plays an ol’ hea’t-feelin’ hime.
An’ somehow my th’oat gits choky,
An’ a lump keeps tryin’ to rise
Lak it wan’ed to ketch de water
Dat was flowin’ to my eyes;
An’ I feel dat I could sorter
Knock de socks clean off o’ sin
Ez I hyeah my po’ ol’ granny
Wif huh tremblin’ voice jine in.
Den we all th’ow in our voices
Fu’ to he’p de chune out too,
Lak a big camp-meetin’ choiry
Tryin’ to sing a mou’nah th’oo.
An’ our th’oahts let out de music,
Sweet an’ solemn, loud an’ free,
Twell de raftahs o’ my cabin
Echo wif de melody.
Oh, de music o’ de banjo,
Quick an’ deb’lish, solemn, slow,
Is de greates’ joy an’ solace
Dat a weary slave kin know!
So jes’ let me hyeah it ringin’,
Dough de chune be po’ an’ rough,
It’s a pleasure; an’ de pleasures
O’ dis life is few enough.
Now, de blessed little angels
Up in heaben, we are told,
Don’t do nothin’ all dere lifetime
‘Ceptin’ play on ha’ps o’ gold.
Now I think heaben’d be mo’ homelike
Ef we'd hyeah some music fall
F’om a real ol’-fashioned banjo,
Like dat one upon de wall.
The Ol’ Tunes
You kin talk about yer anthems
An’ yer arias an’ sich,
An’ yer modern choir-singin’
That you think so awful rich;
But you orter heerd us youngsters
In the times now far away,
A-singin’ o’ the ol’ tunes
In the ol’-fashioned way.
There was some of us sung treble
An’ a few of us growled bass,
An’ the tide o’ song flowed smoothly
With its ‘comp’niment o’ grace;
There was spirit in that music,
An’ a kind o’ solemn sway,
A-singin’ o’ the ol’ tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
I remember oft o’ standin’
In my homespun pantaloons—
On my face the bronze an’ freckles
O’ the suns o’ youthful Junes—
Thinkin’ that no mortal minstrel
Ever chanted sich a lay
As the ol’ tunes we was singin’
In the ol’-fashioned way.
The boys ‘ud always lead us,
An’ the girls ‘ud all chime in,
Till the sweetness o’ the singin’
Robbed the list’nin’ soul o’ sin;
An’ I used to tell the parson
‘T was as good to sing as pray,
When the people sung the ol’ tunes
In the ol’-fashioned way.
How I long ag’in to hear ‘em
Pourin’ forth from soul to soul,
With the treble high an’ meller,
An’ the bass’s mighty roll;
But the times is very diff’rent,
An’ the music heerd to-day
Ain’t the singin’ o’ the ol’ tunes
In the ol’-fashioned way.
Little screechin’ by a woman,
Little squawkin’ by a man,
Then the organ’s twiddle-twaddle,
Jest the empty space to span, —
An’ ef you should even think it,
‘T is n’t proper fur to say
That you want to hear the ol’ tunes
In the ol’-fashioned way.
But I think that some bright mornin’,
When the toils of life air o’er,
An’ the sun o’ heaven arisin’
Glads with light the happy shore,
I shall hear the angel chorus,
In the realms of endless day,
A-singin’ o’ the ol’ tunes
In the ol’-fashioned way.
Lullaby
Sing me, sweet, a soothing psalm,
Holy, tender, low, and calm.
Full of drowsy words and dreamy,
Sleep half seen where the sides are seamy;
Lay my head upon your breast;
Sing me to rest.
Christmas Carol
Ring out, ye bells!
All Nature swells
With gladness at the wondrous story, —
The world was lorn,
But Christ is born
To change our sadness into glory.
Sing, earthlings, sing!
To-night a King
Hath come from heaven's high throne to bless us.
The outstretched hand
O’er all the land
Is raised in pity to caress us.
Come at his call;
Be joyful all;
Away with mourning and with sadness!
The heavenly choir
With holy fire
Their voices raise in songs of gladness.
The darkness breaks,
And Dawn awakes,
Her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes.
The rocks and stones
In holy tones
Are singing sweeter than the thrushes.
Then why should we
In silence be,
When Nature lends her voice to praises;
When heaven and earth
Proclaim the truth
Of Him for whom that lone star blazes?
No, be not still,
But with a will
Strike all your harps and set them ringing;
On hill and heath
Let every breath
Throw all its power into singing!
Welcome Address
To the Western Association of Writers.
"Westward the course of empire takes its way,"—
So Berkeley said, and so to-day
The men who know the world still say.
The glowing West, with bounteous hand,
Bestows her gifts throughout the land,
And smiles to see at her command
Art, science, and the industries, —
New fruits of new Hesperides.
So, proud are you who claim the West
As home land; doubly are you blest
To live where liberty and health
Go hand in hand with brains and wealth.
So here’s a welcome to you all,
Whate’er the work your hands let fall, —
To you who trace on history’s page
The footprints of each passing age;
To you who tune the laureled Iyre
To songs of love or deeds of fire;
To you before whose well-wrought tale
The cheek doth flush or brow grow pale;
To you who bow the ready knee
And worship cold philosophy, —
A welcome warm as Western wine,
And free as Western hearts, be thine.
Do what the greatest joy insures, —
The city has no will but yours!
June 27, 1892
The Old Apple-Tree
There's a memory keeps a runnin’
Through my weary head to-night,
An’ I see a picture dancin’
In the fire flames’ ruddy light;
‘Tis the picture of an orchard
Wrapped in autumn’s purple haze,
With the tender light about it
That I loved in other days.
An’ a standin’ in a corner
Once again I seem to see
The verdant leaves an’ branches
Of an old apple tree.
You perhaps would call it ugly,
An’ I don't know but it’s so,
When you look the tree all over
Unadorned by memory’s glow;
For its boughs are gnarled an’ crooked,
An’ its leaves are getting’ thin,
An’ the apples of its bearin’
Wouldn’t fill so large a bin
As they used to. But I tell you,
When it comes to pleasin’ me,
It’s the dearest in the orchard, —
Is that old apple tree.
I would hide within its shelter,
Settlin’ in some cozy nook,
Where no calls nor threats could stir me
From the pages o’ my book.
Oh, that quiet, sweet seclusion
In its fulness passeth words!
It was deeper than the deepest
That my sanctum now affords.
Why, the jaybirds an’ the robins,
They was hand in glove with me,
As they winked at me an’ warbled
In that old apple tree.
It was on its sturdy branches
That in summers long ago
I would tie my swing, an’ dangle
In contentment to an’ fro,
Idly dreamin’ childish fancies,
Buildin’ castles in the air,
Makin’ o’ myself a hero
Of romances rich an’ rare.
I kin shet my eyes an’ see it
Jest as plain as plain kin be,
That same old swing a danglin’
To the old apple tree.
There’s a rustic seat beneath it
That I never kin forget.
It's the place where me an’ Hallie—
Little sweetheart—ust to set,
When we’d wander to the orchard
So's no listenin’ ones could hear
As I whispered sugared nonsense
Into her little willin’ ear.
Now my gray old wife is Hallie,
An’ I’m grayer still than she,
But I’ll not forget our courtin’
‘Neath the old apple tree.
Life for us ain’t all been summer,
But I guess we’ve had our share
Of its flittin’ joys an’ pleasures,
An’ a sprinklin’ of its care.
Oft the skies have smiled upon us;
Then again we've seen ‘em frown,
Though our load was ne’er so heavy
That we longed to lay it down.
But when death does come a callin’,
This my last request shall be, —
That they’ll bury me an’ Hallie
‘Neath the old apple tree.
James Whitcomb Riley
From a Westerner's point of view.
No matter what you call it,
Whether genius, gift, or art,
He sings the simple songs that come
The closest to your heart.
Fur trim an’ skillful phrases,
I do not keer a jot;
‘Tain’t the words alone, but feelin’s,
That tech the tender spot.
An’ that’s jest why I love him, —
Why, he’s got sech human feelin’,
An’ in ev’ry song he gives us,
You kin see it creepin’, stealin’.
Through the core the tears go tricklin’,
But the edge is bright an’ smiley;
I never saw a poet
Like that poet Whitcomb Riley.
His heart keeps beatin’ time with our’n
In measures fast or slow;
He tells us jest the same ol’ things
Our souls have learned to know.
He paints our joys an’ sorrers
In a way so stric’ly true,
That a body can’t help knowin’
That he has felt them too.
If there’s a lesson to be taught,
He never fears to teach it,
An’ he puts the food so good an’ low
That the humblest one kin reach it.
Now in our time, when poets rhyme
For money, fun, or fashion,
‘Tis good to hear one voice so clear
That thrills with honest passion.
So let the others build their songs,
An’ strive to polish highly, —
There’s none of them kin tech the heart
Like our own Whitcomb Riley.
A Thanksgiving Poem
The sun hath shed its kindly light,
Our harvesting is gladly o’er,
Our fields have felt no killing blight,
Our bins are filled with goodly store.
From pestilence, fire, flood, and sword
We have been spared by thy decree,
And now with humble hearts, O Lord,
We come to pay our thanks to thee.
We feel that had our merits been
The measure of thy gifts to us,
We erring children, born of sin,
Might not now be rejoicing thus.
No deed of ours hath brought us grace;
When thou wert nigh our sight was dull,
We hid in trembling from thy face,
But thou, O God, wert merciful.
Thy mighty hand o’er all the land
Hath still been open to bestow
Those blessings which our wants demand
From heaven, whence all blessings flow.
Thou hast, with ever watchful eye,
Looked down on us with holy care,
And from thy storehouse in the sky
Hast scattered plenty everywhere.
Then lift we up our songs of praise
To thee, O Father, good and kind;
To thee we consecrate our days;
Be thine the temple of each mind.
With incense sweet our thanks ascend;
Before thy works our powers pall;
Though we should strive years without end,
We could not thank thee for them all
To Miss Mary Britton
When the legislature of Kentucky was discussing the passage of a separate-coach
bill, Miss Mary Britton, a teacher in the schools of Lexington, Kentucky, went before
them, and in a ringing speech protested against the passage of the bill. Her action
was heroic, though it proved to be without avail.
God of the right, arise
And let thy pow’r prevail;
Too long thy children mourn
In labor and travail.
Oh, speed the happy day
When waiting ones may see
The glory-bringing birth
Of our real liberty!
Grant thou, O gracious God,
That not in word alone
Shall freedom's boon be ours,
While bondage-galled we moan!
But condescend to us
In our o’erwhelming need;
Break down the hind’ring bars,
And make us free indeed.
Give us to lead our cause
More noble souls like hers,
The memory of whose deed
Each feeling bosom stirs;
Whose fearless voice and strong
Rose to defend her race,
Roused Justice from her sleep,
Drove Prejudice from place.
Let not the mellow light
Of Learning’s brilliant ray
Be quenched, to turn to night
Our newly dawning day.
To that bright, shining star
Which thou didst set in place,
With universal voice
Thus speaks a grateful race:
"Not empty words shall be
Our offering to your fame;
The race you strove to serve
Shall consecrate your name
Speak on as fearless still;
Work on as tireless ever;
And your reward shall be
Due meed for your endeavor."
Whittier
Not o’er thy dust let there be spent
The gush of maudlin sentiment;
Such drift as that is not for thee,
Whose life and deeds and songs agree,
Sublime in their simplicity.
Nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed.
O singer sweet, thou art not dead!
In spite of time’s malignant chill,
With living fire thy songs shall thrill,
And men shall say, "He liveth still!"
Great poets never die, for Earth
Doth count their lives of too great worth
To lose them from her treasured store;
So shalt thou live for evermore—
Though far thy form from mortal ken—
Deep in the hearts and minds of men.
Nutting Song
The November sun invites me,
And although the chill wind smites me,
I will wander to the woodland
Where the laden trees await;
And with loud and joyful singing
I will set the forest ringing,
As if I were king of Autumn,
And Dame Nature were my mate, —
While the squirrel in his gambols
Fearless round about me ambles,
As if he were bent on showing
In my kingdom he’d a share;
While my warm blood leaps and dashes,
And my eye with freedom flashes,
As my soul drinks deep and deeper
Of the magic in the air.
There's a pleasure found in nutting,
All life’s cares and griefs outshutting,
That is fuller far and better
Than what prouder sports impart.
Who could help a carol trilling
As he sees the baskets filling?
Why, the flow of song keeps running
O’er the high walls of the heart
So when I am home returning,
When the sun is lowly burning,
I will once more wake the echoes
With a happy song of praise, —
For the golden sunlight blessing,
And the breezes’ soft caressing,
And the precious boon of living
In the sweet November days.
After While
A Poem of Faith
I think that though the clouds be dark,
That though the waves dash o’er the bark,
Yet after while the light will come,
And in calm waters safe at home
The bark will anchor.
Weep not, my sad-eyed, gray-robed maid,
Because your fairest blossoms fade,
That sorrow still o’erruns your cup,
And even though you root them up,
The weeds grow ranker.
For after while your tears shall cease,
And sorrow shall give way to peace;
The flow’rs shall bloom, the weeds shall die,
And in that faith seen, by and by
Thy woes shall perish.
Smile at old Fortune's adverse tide,
Smile when the scoffers sneer and chide.
Oh, not for you the gems that pale,
And not for you the flowers that fail;
Let this thought cherish:
That after while the clouds will part,
And then with joy the waiting heart
Shall feel the light come stealing in,
That drives away the cloud of sin
And breaks its power.
And you shall burst your chrysalis,
And wing away to realms of bliss,
Untrammelled, pure, divinely free,
Above all earth’s anxiety
From that same hour.
To The Miami
Kiss me, Miami, thou most constant one!
I love thee more for that thou changest not.
When Winter comes with frigid blast,
Or the blithesome Spring is past
And Summer's here with sunshine hot,
Or in sere Autumn, thou hast still the pow’r
To charm alike, whate’er the hour.
Kiss me, Miami, with thy dewy lips;
Throbs fast my heart e’en as thine own breast beats.
My soul doth rise as rise thy waves,
As each on each the dark shore laves
And breaks in ripples and retreats.
There is a poem in thine every phase;
Thou still has sung through all thy days.
Tell me, Miami, how it was with thee
When years ago Tecumseh in his prime
His birch boat o’er thy waters sent,
And pitched upon thy banks his tent.
In that long-gone, poetic time,
Did some bronze bard thy flowing stream sit by
And sing thy praises, e’en as I?
Did some bronze lover ‘neath this dark old tree
Whisper of love unto his Indian maid?
And didst thou list his murmurs deep,
And in thy bosom safely keep
The many raging vows they said?
Or didst thou tell to fish and frog and bird
The raptured scenes that there occurred?
But, O dear stream, what volumes thou couldst tell
To all who know thy language as I do,
Of life and love and jealous hate!
But now to tattle were too late, —
Thou who hast ever been so true
Tell not to every passing idler here
All those sweet tales that reached thine ear
But, silent stream, speak out and tell me this:
I say that men and things are still the same;
Were men as bold to do and dare?
Were women then as true and fair?
Did poets seek celestial flame,
The hero die to gain a laureled brow,
And women suffer, then as now?
Love’s Pictures
Like the blush upon the rose
When the wooing south wind speaks,
Kissing soft its petals,
Are thy cheeks.
Tender, soft, beseeching, true,
Like the stars that deck the skies
Through the ether sparkling,
Are thine eyes.
Like the song of happy birds,
When the woods with spring rejoice,
In their blithe awak’ning,
Is thy voice.
Like soft threads of clustered silk
O'er thy face so pure and fair,
Sweet in its profusion,
Is thy hair
Like a fair but fragile vase,
Triumph of the carver's art,
Graceful formed and slender, —
Thus thou art.
Ah, thy cheek, thine eyes, thy voice,
And thy hair’s delightful wave
Make me, I’ll confess it,
Thy poor slave!
The "Chronic-Kicker "
It was at the town convention
Fur to nominate a mayor,
An' things had been progressin’
In a way both cool an’ fair;
An' we thought that we had finished
In a manner mighty slick,
When up rose the chronic kicker
Fur to kick, kick, kick.
Then we felt our feathers fallin’,
Nor we didn’t laugh no more,
While some quite impatient fellers
Made a bee line fur the door;
An’ we listened, an’ we listened,
While the clock the hours ticked,
To that derned old chronic kicker
As he kicked, kicked, kicked.
Next we held a conf’rence meetin’
In our little mission church, —
Fur a cheap an’ worthy pastor
We were in an earnest search;
We had jest made our agreement
(An’ ‘twas come to very quick),
When up rose the chronic kicker
Fur to kick, kick, kick.
An’ we heard the birds a whistlin’
In the air so sweet an’ cool,
While we all sat there a list’nin’
To that flambergasted fool;
But I'm sure the Lord was min’ful,
Fur no thorn our conscience pricked,
When we nodded while that kicker
Stood an’ kicked, kicked, kicked.
Next ‘twas in a baseball battle,
Overlooked by boys in trees,
Where no act of bat or baseman
Could this chronic kicker please,
Until weary with his yellin’,
Some one hit him with a brick,
An’ he lay down in the diamond
Fur to kick, kick, kick.
But Death, that great policeman,
By no frowns or kicks defied,
At last came up an’ seized him,
An’ so, with a kick, he died;
But he, jest before the fun’ral,
Made the undertaker sick,
As the coffin couldn’t hold him
For that everlastin’ kick.
Songs
I love the dear old ballads best,
That tell of love and death,
Whose every line sings love’s unrest
Or mourns the parting breath.
I love those songs the heart can feel,
That make our pulses throb;
When lovers plead or contrites kneel
With choking sigh and sob.
God sings through songs that touch the heart,
And none are prized save these.
Though men may ply their gilded art
For fortune, fame, or fees,
The muse that sets the songster’s soul
Ablaze with lyric fire,
Holds nature up, an open scroll,
And builds art’s funeral pyre.
My Sort O’ Man
I don’t believe in ‘ristercrats
An’ never did, you see;
The plain ol’ homelike sorter folks
Is good enough fur me.
O’ course, I don't desire a man
To be too tarnal rough,
But then I think all folks should know
When they air nice enough.
Now, there is folks in this here world,
From peasant up to king,
Who want to be so awful nice
They overdo the thing.
That’s jest the thing that makes me sick,
An’ quicker than a wink
I set it down that them same folks
Ain't half so good's you think.
I like to see a man dress nice,
In clothes becomin’, too;
I like to see a woman fix
As women orter do;
An’ boys an’ gals I like to see
Look fresh an’ young an’ spry,
We all must have our vanity
An’ pride before we die.
But I jedge no man by his clothes, —
Nor gentleman nor tramp;
The man that wears the finest suit
May be the biggest scamp,
An’ he whose limbs are clad in rags
That make a mournful sight,
In life’s great battle may have proved
A hero in the fight.
I don’t believe in ‘ristercrats;
I like the honest tan
That lies upon the healthful cheek
An’ speaks the honest man;
I like to grasp the brawny hand
That labor’s lips have kissed,
For he who has not labored here
Life's greatest pride has missed, —
The pride to feel that yo’r own strength
Has cleaved fur you the way
To heights to which you were not born,
But struggled day by day.
What though the thousands sneer an’ scoff,
An’ scorn yo’r humble birth?
Kings are but subjects; you are king
By right o’ royal worth.
The man who simply sits an’ waits
Fur good to come along,
Ain’t worth the breath that one would take
To tell him he is wrong.
Fur good ain’t flowin’ round this world
Fur ev’ry fool to sup;
You’ve got to put yo’r see-ers on,
An’ go an’ hunt it up.
Good goes with honesty, I say,
To honor an’ to bless
To rich an’ poor alike it brings
A wealth o’ happiness.
The ‘ristercrats ain’t got it all,
Fur much to their su’prise,
That’s one of earth’s most blessed things
They can’t monopolize.
The Old Homestead
‘Tis an old deserted homestead
On the outskirts of the town,
Where the roof is all moss-covered,
And the walls are tumbling down;
But around that little cottage
Do my brightest mem’ries cling,
For ‘twas there I spent the moments
Of my youth, —life’s happy spring.
I remember how I used to
Swing upon the old front gate,
While the robin in the tree tops
Sung a night song to his mate;
And how later in the evening,
As the beaux were wont to do,
Mr. Perkins, in the parlor,
Sat and sparked my sister Sue.
There my mother—heaven bless her!—
Kissed or spanked as was our need,
And by smile or stroke implanted
In our hearts fair virtue’s seed;
While my father, man of wisdom,
Lawyer keen, and farmer stout,
Argued long with neighbor Dobbins
How the corn crops would turn out.
Then the quiltings and the dances—
How my feet were wont to fly,
While the moon peeped through the barn chinks
From her stately place on high.
Oh, those days, so sweet, so happy,
Ever backward o’er me roll;
Still the music of that farm life
Rings an echo in my soul.
Now the old place is deserted,
And the walls are falling down;
All who made the home life cheerful,
Now have died or moved to town.
But about that dear old cottage
Shall my mem’ries ever cling,
For ‘twas there I spent the moments
Of my youth, —life’s happy spring.
On The Death Of W. C.
Thou arrant robber, Death!
Couldst thou not find
Some lesser one than he
To rob of breath, —
Some poorer mind
Thy prey to be?
His mind was like the sky, —
As pure and free;
His heart was broad and open
As the sea.
His soul shone purely through his face,
And Love made him her dwelling place.
Not less the scholar than the friend,
Not less a friend than man;
The manly life did shorter end
Because so broad it ran.
Weep not for him, unhappy Muse!
His merits found a grander use
Some other-where. God wisely sees
The place that needs his qualities.
Weep not for him, for when Death lowers
O'er youth's ambrosia-scented bowers
He only plucks the choicest flowers.
An Old Memory
How sweet the music sounded
That summer long ago,
When you were by my side, love,
To list its gentle flow.
I saw your eyes ashining,
I felt your rippling hair,
I kissed your pearly cheek, love,
And had no thought of care.
And gay or sad the music,
With subtle charm replete;
I found in after years, love,
‘Twas you that made it sweet.
For standing where we heard it,
I hear again the strain;
It wakes my heart, but thrills it
With sad, mysterious pain.
It pulses not so joyous
As when you stood with me,
And hand in hand we listened
To that low melody.
Oh, could the years turn back, love!
Oh, could events be changed
To what they were that time, love,
Before we were estranged;
Wert thou once more a maiden
Whose smile was gold to me;
Were I once more the lover
Whose word was life to thee,--
O God! could all be altered,
The pain, the grief, the strife,
And wert thou—as thou shouldst be—
My true and loyal wife!
But all my tears are idle,
And all my wishes vain.
What once you were to me, love,
You may not be again.
For I, alas! like others,
Have missed my dearest aim.
I asked for love. Oh, mockery!
Fate comes to me with fame!
Memorial Day
Why deck with flow’rs these humble mounds?
Why gather round this fast decaying mold?
Why doth remembrance keep her solemn rounds
And wrap these sleepers in her loving fold?
Why kneel, ye silent mourners, here
To drop the reverential tear?
Flesh is but dust when parted from the breath.
Flesh is but dust, but worth of soul is gold!
‘Tis not the dust we honor, but the brave
And noble spirits that it once did hold.
So kneel we weeping at the grave,
As at the door through which have passed,
To enter into mansions vast,
The heroes who have gone to meet
A dearer destiny than dirgeful death.
Melancholia
Silently without my window,
Tapping gently at the pane,
Falls the rain.
Through the trees sighs the breeze
Like a soul in pain.
Here alone I sit and weep;
Thought hath banished sleep.
Wearily I sit and listen
To the water's ceaseless drip.
To my lip
Fate turns up the bitter cup,
Forcing me to sip;
‘Tis a bitter, bitter drink.
Thus I sit and think, —
Thinking things unknown and awful,
Thoughts on wild, uncanny themes,
Waking dreams.
Spectres dark, corpses stark,
Show the gaping seams
Whence the cold and cruel knife
Stole away their life.
Bloodshot eyes all strained and staring,
Gazing ghastly into mine;
Blood like wine
On the brow—clotted now—
Shows death's dreadful sign.
Lonely vigil still I keep;
Would that I might sleep!
Still, oh, still, my brain is whirling!
Still runs on my stream of thought;
I am caught
In the net fate hath set.
Mind and soul are brought
To destruction's very brink;
Yet I can but think!
Eyes that look into the future, —
Peeping forth from out my mind,
They will find
Some new weight, soon or late,
On my soul to bind,
Crushing all its courage out, —
Heavier than doubt.
Dawn, the Eastern monarch's daughter,
Rising from her dewy bed,
Lays her head
‘Gainst the clouds’ sombre shrouds
Now half fringed with red.
O'er the land she ‘gins to peep;
Come, O gentle Sleep!
Hark! the morning cock is crowing;
Dreams, like ghosts, must hie away;
‘Tis the day.
Rosy morn now is born;
Dark thoughts may not stay.
Day my brain from foes will keep;
Now, my soul, I sleep.
Life
A crust of bread and a corner to sleep in,
A minute to smile and an hour to weep in,
A pint of joy to a peck of trouble,
And never a laugh but the moans come double;
And that is life!
A crust and a corner that love makes precious,
With the smile to warm and the tears to refresh us;
And joy seems sweeter when cares come after,
And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter;
And that is life!
A Question
I wist not that I had the pow’r to sing,
But here of late they say my songs are sweet.
Is it because my timid numbers ring
With love's warm music that doth ever beat
Its melody within my throbbing heart?
If so, what else can roguish Cupid do?
I know him master of the archer’s art;
Is he a trained musician too?
Worn Out
You bid me hold my peace
And dry my fruitless tears,
Forgetting that I bear
A pain beyond my years.
You say that I should smile
And drive the gloom away;
I would, but sun and smiles
Have left my life's dark day.
All time seems cold and void,
And naught but tears remain;
Life's music beats for me
A melancholy strain.
I used at first to hope,
But hope is past and gone;
And now without a ray
My cheerless life drags on.
Like to an ash-stained hearth
When all its fires are spent;
Like to an autumn wood
By storm winds rudely shent, —
So sadly goes my heart,
Unclothed of hope and peace;
It asks not joy again,
But only seeks release.
A Career
"Break me my bounds, and let me fly
To regions vast of boundless sky;
Nor I, like piteous Daphne, be
Root-bound. Ah, no! I would be free
As yon same bird that in its flight
Outstrips the range of mortal sight;
Free as the mountain streams that gush
From bubbling springs, and downward rush
Across the serrate mountain's side, —
The rocks o’erwhelmed, their banks defied, —
And like the passions in the soul,
Swell into torrents as they roll.
Oh, circumscribe me not by rules
That serve to lead the minds of fools!
But give me pow’r to work my will,
And at my deeds the world shall thrill.
My words shall rouse the slumb’ring zest
That hardly stirs in manhood’s breast;
And as the sun feeds lesser lights,
As planets have their satellites,
So round about me will I bind
The men who prize a master mind!"
He lived a silent life alone,
And laid him down when it was done;
And at his head was placed a stone
On which was carved a name unknown!
On The River
The sun is low,
The waters flow,
My boat is dancing to and fro.
The eve is still,
Yet from the hill
The killdeer echoes loud and shrill.
The paddles plash,
The wavelets dash,
We see the summer lightning flash;
While now and then,
In marsh and fen
Too muddy for the feet of men,
Where neither bird
Nor beast has stirred,
The spotted bullfrog’s croak is heard.
The wind is high,
The grasses sigh,
The sluggish stream goes sobbing by.
And far away
The dying day
Has cast its last effulgent ray;
While on the land
The shadows stand
Proclaiming that the eve’s at hand.
The Light
Once when my soul was newly shriven,
When perfect peace to me was given,
Pervading all in all with currents bright,
I saw shine forth a mighty Light;
And myriad lesser lights to this were joined,
Each light with every other light entwined;
And as they shone a sound assailed my ears,
Alike the mighty music of the spheres.
The greater light was Love and Peace and Law,
And it had power toward it the rest to draw;
It was the Soul of souls, the greatest One,
The Life of lives, of suns the Sun.
And floating through it all, my soul could see
The Christ-light, shining for humanity;
And silently I heard soft murmurs fall,
"Look up, earth child; the light is all."
John Boyle O'Reilly
Of noble minds and noble hearts
Old Ireland has goodly store;
But thou wert still the noblest son
That e'er the Isle of Erin bore.
A generous race, and strong to dare,
With hearts as true as purest gold,
With hands to soothe as well as strike,
As generous as they are bold, —
This is the race thou lovedst so;
And knowing them, I can but know
The glory thy whole being felt
To think, to act, to be, the Celt!
Not Celt alone, America
Her arms about thee hath entwined;
The noblest traits of each grand race
In thee were happily combined.
As sweet of song as strong of speech,
Thy great heart beat in every line.
No narrow partisan wert thou;
The cause of all oppressed was thine!
The world is cruel still and cold,
But who can doubt thy life has told?
Though wrong and sorrow still are rife
Old Earth is better for thy life!
Columbian Ode
I
Four hundred years ago a tangled waste
Lay sleeping on the west Atlantic side;
Their devious ways the Old World’s millions traced
Content, and loved, and labored, dared and died,
While students still believed the charts they conned,
And wallowed in their thriftless ignorance,
Nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond
Old Ocean’s dense, indefinite expanse.
II
But deep within her heart old Nature knew
That she had once arrayed, at Earth's behest,
Another offspring, fine and fair to view, —
The chosen suckling of the mother's breast.
The child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine,
Each fold a work of Nature’s matchless art;
The mother looked on it with love divine,
And strained the loved one closely to her heart.
And there it lay, and with the warmth grew strong
And hearty, by the salt sea breezes fanned,
Till Time with mellowing touches passed along,
And changed the infant to a mighty land.
III
But men knew naught of this, till there arose
That mighty mariner, the Genoese,
Who dared to try, in spite of fears and foes,
The unknown fortunes of unsounded seas.
O noblest of Italia's sons, thy bark
Went not alone into that shrouding night.
O dauntless darer of the rayless dark,
The world sailed with thee to eternal light.
The deer-haunts that with game were crowded then
To-day are tilled and cultivated lands;
The schoolhouse tow’rs where bruin had his den,
And where the wigwam stood the chapel stands;
The place that nurtured men of savage mien
Now teems with men of Nature’s noblest types;
Where moved the forest-foliage banner green,
Now flutters in the breeze the stars and stripes!
October 21, 1892
The Meadow Lark
Though the winds be dank,
And the sky be sober,
And the grieving day
In a mantle gray
Hath let her waiting maiden robe her, —
All the fields along
I can hear the song
Of the meadow lark,
As she flits and flutters,
And laughs at the thunder when it mutters.
O happy bird, of heart most gay
To sing when skies are gray!
When the clouds are full,
And the tempest master
Lets the loud winds sweep
From his bosom deep
Like heralds of some dire disaster,
Then the heart, alone,
To itself makes moan;
And the songs come slow,
While the tears fall fleeter,
And silence than song by far seems sweeter.
Oh, few are they along the way
Who sing when skies are gray!
The Seedling
As a quiet little seedling
Lay within its darksome bed,
To itself it fell a talking,
And this is what it said:
"I am not so very robust,
But I ’ll do the best I can";
And the seedling from that moment
Its work of life began.
So it pushed a little leaflet
Up into the light of day,
To examine the surroundings
And show the rest the way.
The leaflet liked the prospect,
So it called its brother, Stem;
Then two other leaflets heard it,
And quickly followed them.
To be sure, the haste and hurry
Made the seedling sweat and pant;
But almost before it knew it
It found itself a plant.
The sunshine poured upon it,
And the clouds they gave a shower;
And the little plant kept growing
Till it found itself a flower.
Little folks, be like the seedling,
Always do the best you can;
Every child must share life's labor
Just as well as every man.
And the sun and showers will help you
Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
Till you raise to light and beauty
Virtue’s fair, unfading flowers.
Poor Withered Rose
A Song.
Poor withered rose, she gave it me,
Half in revenge and half in glee;
Its petals not so pink by half
As are her lips when curled to laugh,
As are her cheeks when dimples gay
In merry mischief o'er them play.
Chorus
Forgive, forgive, it seems unkind
To cast thy petals to the wind;
But it is right, and lest I err
So scatter I all thoughts of her.
Poor withered rose, so like my heart,
That wilts at sorrow’s cruel dart.
Who hath not felt the winter’s blight
When every hope seemed warm and bright?
Who doth not know love unreturned,
E’en when the heart most wildly burned?
Poor withered rose, thou liest dead;
Too soon thy beauty's bloom hath fled.
‘Tis not without a tearful ruth
I watch decay thy blushing youth;
And though thy life goes out in dole,
Thy perfume lingers in my soul.
Confirmation
He was a poet who wrote clever verses,
And folks said he had fine poetical taste;
But his father, a practical farmer, accused him
Of letting the strength of his arm go to waste.
He called on his sweetheart each Saturday evening,
As pretty a maiden as man ever faced,
And there he confirmed the old man's accusation
By letting the strength of his arm go to waist.
Nora: A Serenade
Ah, Nora, my Nora, the light fades away,
While Night like a spirit steals up o’er the hills;
The thrush from his tree where he chanted all day,
No longer his music in ecstasy trills.
Then, Nora, be near me; thy presence doth cheer me,
Thine eye hath a gleam that is truer than gold.
I cannot but love thee; so do not reprove me,
If the strength of my passion should make me too bold.
Chorus
Nora, pride of my heart, —
Rosy cheeks, cherry lips, sparkling with glee, —
Wake from thy slumbers, wherever thou art;
Wake from thy slumbers to me.
Ah, Nora, my Nora, there's love in the air, —
It stirs in the numbers that thrill in my brain;
Oh, sweet, sweet is love with its mingling of care,
Though joy travels only a step before pain.
Be roused from thy slumbers and list to my numbers;
My heart is poured out in this song unto thee.
Oh, be thou not cruel, thou treasure, thou jewel;
Turn thine ear to my pleading and hearken to me.
Evening
The moon begins her stately ride
Across the summer sky;
The happy wavelets lash the shore, —
The tide is rising high.
Beneath some friendly blade of grass
The lazy beetle cowers;
The coffers of the air are filled
With offerings from the flowers.
And slowly buzzing o’er my head
A swallow wings her flight;
I hear the weary plowman sing
As falls the restful night.
To Pfrimmer
Lines on reading "Driftwood."
Driftwood gathered here and there
Along the beach of time;
Now and then a chip of truth
‘Mid boards and boughs of rhyme;
Driftwood gathered day by day, —
The cypress and the oak, —
Twigs that in some former time
From sturdy home trees broke.
Did this wood come floating thick
All along down "Injin Crik"?
Or did kind tides bring it thee
From the past's receding sea
Down the stream of memory?
Sympathy
The tear another’s tears bring forth,
The sigh which answers sigh,
The pulse that beats at other’s woes,
E’en though our own be nigh,
A balm to bathe the wounded heart
Where sorrow’s hand hath lain,
The link divine from soul to soul
That makes us one in pain, —
Sweet sympathy, benignant ray,
Light of the soul doth shine;
In it is human nature giv’n
A touch of the divine.
My Love Irene
Farewell, farewell, my love Irene;
The pangs of sadness stir my breast;
Though many miles may intervene,
My soul’s with thine, in East or West.
Go where thou wilt, to wealth or fame;
Win for thyself or praise or blame, —
My love shall ever be the same,
My love Irene.
Farewell, farewell, my love Irene;
Oh, sad decree, that we must part!
The wound is deep, the pain is keen
That agitates mine aching heart.
My feverish eyes burn up their tears;
I cannot still my doubts and fears;
And this one sigh the night wind hears, —
My love Irene.
Farewell, farewell, my love Irene;
The morning's gray now floods the sky;
The sun peeps from his misty screen;
Mine only love, good-bye, good-bye.
All love must fade, all life must die,
The smile must turn into the sigh.
Alas! how hard to say good-bye,
My love Irene.
Common Things
I like to hear of wealth and gold,
And El Doradoes in their glory;
I like for silks and satins bold
To sweep and rustle through a story.
The nightingale is sweet of song;
The rare exotic smells divinely;
And knightly men who stride along,
The role heroic carry finely.
But then, upon the other hand,
Our minds have got a way of running
To things that aren't quite so grand,
Which, maybe, we were best in shunning.
For some of us still like to see
The poor man in his dwelling narrow,
The hollyhock, the bumblebee,
The meadow lark, and chirping sparrow.
We like the man who soars and sings
With high and lofty inspiration;
But he who sings of common things
Shall always share our admiration.
Goin’ Back
He stood beside the station rail,
A negro aged and bent and frail.
His palsied hands like the aspen shook,
And a mute appeal was in his look;
His every move was pained and slow,
And his matted hair was white as snow.
He noted our questioning looks, and said,
With a solemn shake of his hoary head:
"I reckon you’re wonderin’, an’ well you may,
Whar an ol’ man lak me’s a goin’ to-day.
I’ve lived in this town fur thirty years,
An’ known alike my joys an' tears,
An’ I’ve labored hard year out, year in;
But now I'm a goin’ back agin
To the blue grass medders an’ fiel’s o’ co’n
In the dear ol’ State whar I was bo’n.
It’s the same ol’ tale that I have to tell, —
An’ thar’s few o’ my race but knows it well, —
When fust the proclamation come
I felt too free to stay at home.
Freedom, it seemed, was a gift divine,
An’ I thought the whole wide world was mine.
Then I was spry, an’ my hair was black,
An’ this troublesome crook wasn’t in my back;
My soul was allus full o’ song,
Fur my heart was light, an’ my limbs was strong,
An’ I wasn’t afeared to show my face
To the sturdiest worker on the place.
Well, I caught the fever that ruled the day,
An’, finally, northward made my way.
They said that things were better North,
An’ a man was held at his honest worth.
Well, it may be so, but I have some doubt,
An’ thirty years ain’t wiped it out.
Thar was lots of things in the North to admire,
Though they hadn’t the warmth an’ passion an’ fire
That all my life I’d been ust to seein’
An’ thought belonged to a human bein’.
An’ a thing I could’nt help but miss
Was the real ol’ Southern heartiness.
But year after year I worried along,
While deep in my heart the yearnin’ strong
Grew stronger an’ fiercer to visit once more
The well loved scenes o’ my native shore.
But money was skeerce, an’ time went on,
Till now full thirty years have gone
Ere I turn my aged steps to roam
Back to my ol’ Kaintucky home,
Back to the ol’ Kaintucky sights,
Back to the scene o’ my youth’s delights,
Back whar my heart was full o’ glee,
Back whar I fust found liberty.
E'en now as I think the ol’ times o’er,
An’ o’ the joy they held in store, —
Yes, even now, on life’s dark side,
My heart swells out with honest pride.
Oh, praise the Lamb, that I shall see
Once more the land so dear to me.
Don't mind an ol’ man's tears, but say
It’s joy, he’s goin’ back to-day."
Justice
Enthroned upon the mighty truth,
Within the confines of the laws,
True Justice seeth not the man,
But only hears his cause.
Unconscious of his creed or race,
She cannot see, but only weighs;
For Justice with unbandaged eyes
Would be oppression in disguise.
Night Of Love
The moon has left the sky, love,
The stars are hiding now,
And frowning on the world, love,
Night bares her sable brow.
The snow is on the ground, love,
And cold and keen the air is.
I'm singing here to you, love;
You're dreaming there in Paris.
But this is Nature’s law, love,
Though just it may not seem,
That men should wake to sing, love,
While maidens sleep and dream.
Them care may not molest, love,
Nor stir them from their slumbers,
Though midnight find the swain, love,
Still halting o’er his numbers.
I watch the rosy dawn, love,
Come stealing up the east,
While all things round rejoice, love,
That Night her reign has ceased.
The lark will soon be heard, love,
And on his way be winging;
When Nature’s poets wake, love,
Why should a man be singing?

            TO MY MOTHER. 
            
            JANUARY I, 1891. 
            
            Sweet Mother! rare in gifts of tenderness! 
            Thou who didst nurse my child-life into bloom, 
            And for each native grace made ample room 
            To blossom in love's light, — how can we bless 
            The Power that gave thee to us ! In the stress 
            Of life's great conflict, what could e'er illume 
            Its mystic shadows and its deepest gloom, 
            Like smiles and loving words from thee ! No less 
            Than widest sunshine is thy sympathy. 
            O precious Heart ! so rich in sacrifice. 
            And — boon beyond compare — supremest love, 
            May Heaven's choicest blessings rest on thee. 
            Rarer than jewels of the costliest price ! 
            And Peace brood o'er thy path like calmest dove! 
            LIFE. 
            
            Life! Ay, what is it? E'en a moment spun 
            From cycles of eternity. And yet, 
            What wrestHng 'mid the fever and the fret 
            Of tangled purposes and hopes undone! 
            What affluence of love ! What vict'ries won 
            In agonies of silence, ere trust met 
            A manifold fulfillment, and the wet, 
            Beseeching eyes saw splendors past the sun! 
            What struggle in the web of circumstance, 
            And yearning in the winged music! All, 
            One restless strife from fetters to be free; 
            Till, gathered to eternity's expanse, 
            Is that brief moment at the Feather's call. 
            Life! Ay, at best, 'tis but a mystery! 
            ASPIRATION. 
            
            We climb the slopes of life with throbbing heart, 
            And eager pulse, like children toward a star. 
            Sweet siren music cometh from afar, 
            To lure us on meanwhile. Responsive start 
            The nightingales to richer song than Art 
            Can ever teach. No passing shadows mar 
            Awhile the dewy skies ; no inner jar 
            Of conflict bids us with our quest to part. 
            We see adown the distance, rainbow-arched, 
            What melting aisles of liquid light and bloom! 
            We hasten, tremulous, with lips all parched. 
            And eyes wide-stretched, nor dream of coming gloom. 
            Enough that something held almost divine 
            Within us ever stirs. Can we repine? 
            INCOMPLETENESS. 
            
            What soul hath struck Its meed of melody, 
            From life's strange instrument whereon it plays? 
            Are the aspiring strains of weary days 
            E'er gathered in their full intensity, 
            Swelling a psalm incomparable, free 
            To utter all their yearning ? Nay ! the lays 
            Moan on inadequately, for the ways 
            Of God in shaping souls we may not see. 
            Mid baffled hopes we cry out in our need, 
            And wrestle in the shadows, wond'ring when 
            Such dissonance can e'er be sweet, and how. 
            But soon the watching Father will have freed 
            Our earthly ears to catch the music : then 
            The chrism of perfect peace shall bathe each brow. 
            SELF-MASTERY. 
            
            To catch the spirit in its wayward flight 
            Through mazes manifold, what task supreme! 
            For when to floods has grown the quiet stream, 
            Much human skill must aid its rage to fight; 
            And when wild winds invade the solemn night, 
            Seems not man's vaunted power but a dream? 
            And still more futile, ay, we e'en must deem 
            This quest to tame the soul, and guide aright 
            Its restless wanderings, — to lure it back 
            To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh 
            Attend the strife: till, effort merged in prayer, 
            Oft uttered, clung to — when of strength the lack 
            Seems direst — brings the answer to our cry: 
            A gift from Him who lifts our ev'ry care. 
            NIOBE. 
            
            O Mother-Heart! when fast the arrows flew, 
            Like blinding lightning, smiting as they fell, 
            One after one, one after one, what knell 
            Could fitly voice thy anguish! Sorrow grew 
            To throes intensest, when thy sad soul knew 
            Thy youngest, too, must go. Was it not well, 
            Avengers wroth, just one to spare? Ay, tell 
            The ages of soul-struggle sterner? Through 
            The flinty stone, O image of despair, 
            Sad Niobe, thy maddened grief did flow 
            In bitt'rest tears, when all thy wailing prayer 
            Was so denied. Alas ! what weight of woe 
            Is prisoned in thy melancholy eyes! 
            What mother-love beneath the Stoic lies! 
            THE TWO MUSICIANS. 
            
            Love plays a lute, and Thought an organ grand 
            These tones are stately, those a restless strain, 
            Seeming by cadenced joy to measure pain, 
            And capture Fancy by the soft airs fanned. 
            Thought sends his paeans thrilling through the land; 
            The worshipers that bow before his fane 
            Find rest in contemplation, spirit-gain 
            In sweetest harmonies. Yon rapturous band, 
            Kneeling to catch the music of the lute, 
            Have yearning in their eyes, yet something there 
            That baffles all our reas'ning ; is it peace, 
            Or only glances with beseeching mute? 
            Sometimes it deepens into holy prayer. 
            Enchanted Love! thy music never cease! 
            THE POET'S MINISTRANTS. 
            
            The smiling Dawn, with diadem of dew, 
            Brings sunrise odors to perfume his shrine; 
            Blithe Zephyr fans him, and soft moonbeams twine 
            An aureole to crown him, of a hue 
            Surpassing fair. The stately stars renew 
            Majestic measures, that he may incline 
            His soul unto their sweetness ; whispers fine 
            From spirit-nymphs allure him ; not a few 
            The gifts chaste Fancy and her sisters bring. 
            Rare is the lyre the Muses for him wrought, 
            A different meaning thrills in ev'ry string, 
            With ev'ry changing mood of life so fraught. 
            Invoked by him, when such the strains that flow, 
            How can the poet eer his song forego! 
            MILTON. 
            
            O Poet gifted with the sight divine! 
            To thee 'twas given Eden's groves to pace 
            With that first pair, in whom the human race 
            Their kinship claim : and angels did incline — 
            Great Michael, holy Gabriel — to twine 
            Their heavenly logic, through which thou couldst trace  
            The rich outpourings of celestial grace 
            Mingled with argument, around the shrine 
            Where thou didst linger, vision-rapt, intent 
            To catch the sacred mystery of Heaven. 
            Nor was thy longing vain: a soul resolved 
            To ponder truth supreme to thee was lent; 
            For thy not sightless eyes the vail was riv'n. 
            Redemption's problem unto thee well solved. 
            SHAKESPEARE. 
            
            We wonder what the horoscope did show 
            When Shakespeare came to earth. Were planets there, 
            Grouped In unique arrangement ? Unaware 
            His age of aught so marvelous, when lo ! 
            He speaks! men listen ! what of joy or woe 
            Is not revealed! love, hatred, carking care, 
            All quiv'ring 'neath his magic touch. The air 
            Is thick with beauteous elves, a dainty row. 
            Anon, with droning witches, and e'en now 
            Stalks gloomy Hamlet, bent on vengeance dread. 
            One after one they come, smiling or scarred, 
            Wrought by that mind prismatic to which bow 
            All lesser minds. They by thee would be fed, 
            Poet incomparable! Avon's Bard! 
            RAPHAEL. 
            
            Great Painter! to thy soul aglow with thought, 
            Celestial forms their glory did reveal. 
            Not unrewarded wast thou left to kneel 
            At Beauty's sacred altar ; not for naught 
            Thy gift of consecration hadst thou brought. 
            We see thee pensive, radiant, and there steal 
            Soft shadows, mystic lights ; th' angelic seal 
            Is on thy dreamy brow ; thy soul hath caught 
            The essence of the harmony it craved. 
            Behold the Mother and the Child Divine! 
            What rapt repose! what majesty serene! 
            Thy spirit tuned to contemplation, laved 
            In founts of light. For thee we would entwine 
            The asphodel bright with celestial sheen. 
            BEETHOVEN. 
            
            O Great tone-master! low thy massive head 
            Droops, heavy with the thoughts that fain would weave 
            Themselves in interlacing chords, that leave 
            Sublimest music. Inspiration sped 
            On dainty pinions to thy natal bed, 
            And warbling notes did all the silence cleave 
            As for a benediction ; well believe 
            The votaries that hie where thou hast led, 
            In thy supreme endowment. Who as well 
            Can wake the Orphic echoes? Thou dost muse. 
            And harmony, the sweetest, is evolved. 
            In grave sonatas rich with surging swell. 
            In matchless symphonies — but thou couldst choose — 
            The mystery of music thou hast solved.

INTRODUCTION. 
     It is worthy of note as well as of congratulation that colored women are making great advancement in literary ventures.
     In the year 1892 three books were given the world by this class of writers, well worthy of high consideration: Mrs. A. J. Cooper, “A Voice from the South by a Black Woman of the South;” Mrs. F. E. W. Harper, “Iola; or, Shadows Uplifted;” and Mrs. W. A. Dove, “ The Life and Sermons of Rev. W. A. Dove."
     Mrs. Mossell has continued this interesting list with THE WORK OF THE AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN. When the women of any race become intelligent and active in literary pursuits, that race has acquired the greatest
guarantee of success. This book will not only have that influence upon the world which comes from the consideration mentioned above, but, being thoughtfully prepared with a view to impressing a growing race with the importance of a correct life and independent thought, it must add largely to the educative cause of that race.
     Mrs. Mossell has had large experience in the school room and in writing for the public press; hence has dealt largely with popular questions and studied closely the subjects treated in this book.
                                                                      BENJAMIN F. LEE, D.D.,
                                                                                Bishop of the A. M. E. Church.
DEDICATION.
     To my two little daughters, Mary Campbell and Florence Alma Mossell, praying that they may grow into a pure and noble womanhood, this little volume is lovingly dedicated.
PREFACE.
     In the belief that some note of inspiration might be found in these writings for the budding womanhood of the race, they have been gathered and placed before it in this form. The author thanks her many readers for the kindly reception given her occasional work in the past, and bespeaks for this little volume the same generous reception in the present. She also desires to express her gratitude for helpful suggestions (in the preparation of this little book) from Mrs. F. E. W. Harper, Mrs. Bishop B. F. Lee, Miss Frazelia Campbell, T. Thomas Fortune, and Dr. N.F. Mossell. The author would be grateful to her readers if, by personal communication, they would make any correction or suggestion looking toward a more extended and revised edition of this work in the near future.

THE WORK OF THE AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN. 
     “The value of any published work, especially if historical in character, must be largely inspirational; this fact grows out of the truth that race instinct, race experience lies behind it, national feeling, or race pride always having for its development a basis of self-respect.” The emancipation of the Negro race came about at the entrance to that which has been aptly termed the Woman's Century; co-education, higher education for women, had each gained a foothold. The “Woman's Suffrage” movement had passed the era of ridicule and entered upon that of critical study. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union had become a strong factor in the reform work of the nation. These facts made the uplifting of the womanhood of this race a more hopeful task than might otherwise have been, and gave to the individual woman of the race opportunities to reach a higher plane of development with less effort than would have been possible under a more unfavorable aspect of the woman question. Trammelled by their past condition and its consequent poverty, combined with the blasting influence of caste prejudice, they have yet made a fair showing.
     The men of the race, in most instances, have been generous, doing all in their power to allow the women of the race to rise with them. “Woman's Work in America,” by Anna Nathan Myer, garners up the grain from the harvest field of labor of our Anglo-American sisters. I would do for the women of my race, in a few words, this work that has been so ably done for our more favored sisters by another and abler pen. Accepting largely the divisions laid down in the above-mentioned volume, we have, along the line of successful educational work in the North, that most successful teacher and eloquent lecturer, Mrs. Fanny J. Coppin, principal of the Institute for Colored Youth at Philadelphia. Mrs. Coppin, one of the early graduates of Oberlin College, developed into one of the most noted educators in the United States. Hundreds of her graduates have filled positions of honor; hundreds of them are laboring as teachers for the upbuilding of their race. The grand work of establishing an Industrial School in connection with the Institute did not satisfy the heart of this noble benefactress of her race, but she at once set about establishing a boarding home for pupils from a distance. The effort is prospering and will no doubt be an assured fact in the near future. This lady is a very busy worker in various fields scores of needy students have been assisted by her own open-handed charity, as well as by the interest secured through her in their behalf. Her home is one of unostentatious hospitality. Mrs. Coppin is the wife of Rev. Levi Coppin, D. D., editor of the A. M. E. Review.
     Miss Julia Jones, Miss Lottie Bassett, and Miss Frazelia Campbell, of the same institution, Caroline R. Le Count of the O. V. Catto School, of Philadelphia, Mrs. S. S. Garnet, principal of Grammar School 81, 17th street, New York City, Edwina Kruse, principal of the Howard School, Wilmington, Del., are able educators. In the East, we have Miss Maria Baldwin, principal of the Agassiz School, Cambridgeport, Mass. In the South, we have Mrs. Anna J. Cooper, of the High School, Washington, D. C., Prof. Mary V. Cook, Miss Bessie Cook, of Howard University, Miss Lucy Moten, principal of the Normal School of Washington, who was one of the honorary vice-presidents of the World's Educational Conference at the World's Fair, and Miss Mary Patterson; passing farther southward, Miss Lucy Laney, of the Haynes Industrial School at Augusta, Ga., Miss Alice Dugged Cary, and scores of others, who are doing good work. Mrs. Wm. Weaver, who with her husband is laboring against great odds in the upbuilding of the Gloucester Industrial School, Va., deserves honorable mention. In the West, we have successful teachers giving instruction to our own race; we have also several Afro-American women elected to teacherships in the white schools of Cleveland, placed there as one must readily see by unquestioned merit. Miss Jennie Enola Wise, of the State Normal School, Alabama, now Mrs. Dr. H. T. Johnson, wife of the editor of The Christian Recorder, Miss Anna Jones, of Wilberforce, Miss Ione Wood and Miss Lucy Wilmot Smith, of the Kentucky State Normal School, have all labored successfully at their chosen profession. Among eminent educators who have retired from active work in this field of effort we would mention Miss Pet Kiger, now Mrs. Isaiah Wears, Mrs. Silone Yates, formerly of Lincoln Institute, Mrs. Cordelia Atwell, Mrs. Susie Shorter, Mrs. Dr. Alston of Asheville, N. C., formerly of Shaw University, Mrs. Sarah Early, of Wilberforce University, Mrs. Wm. D. Cook, formerly Miss Bertha Wolf, of Allen University. Miss Florence Cozzen and Miss Fanny Somerville of Philadelphia are successful kindergartners. Very many of the higher grade institutions for the education of Afro-American students North, South, East and West employ in their corps of teachers women of the race who are doing able work on the basis of education received in the High and Normal Schools of the various States. Our girls are yearly entering the collegiate institutions of the land. We can boast of Ella Smith, of Newport, an M. A. of Wellesley. Anna J. Cooper, Fanny J. Coppin and Mary Church Terril, of Oberlin. Wilberforce, Atlanta, Fisk, Howard, Scotia, Shaw, Tuskegee, Livingstone. The Institute for Colored Youth at Philadelphia, Wayland Seminary and Hampton are graduating yearly a fair share of the successful educators in this country, and continue to enroll yearly those who will in later years do honor to their race.
     Miss Florence and Miss Cordelia Ray, Miss Mary Eato and Miss Imogene Howard have all secured the degree of master of Pedagogy from the University of New York; Miss Mollie Durham and Miss Annie Marriot of Philadelphia have secured Supervising Principals' certificates in that city.
     Have the women of this race yet made a record in literature? We believe that we can answer this question in the affirmative. Phyllis Wheatley, our first authoress, gave to the world a most creditable volume of poems. The beautiful verses of the little slave girl, who though a captive yet sung her song of freedom, are still studied with interest.
     The path of literature open to our women with their yet meagre attainments has been traveled to some purpose by Mrs. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, who has through a long widowhood sustained herself and her family by her pen and by her voice as a lecturer on the reforms of the hour. Mrs. Harper is the author of two volumes of poems, “Forest Leaves" and “Moses.” A novel, "lola Leroy, or, The Shadows Uplifted," from the pen of this gifted woman, has just been placed upon the market. As superintendent of the colored work in the "Woman's Christian Temperance Union" she has labored for years with great success. A member of the “National Council of Women," of the “Association for the Advancement of Women," of the “Colored Authors and Educators Association," she has at various meetings of these societies furnished valuable papers ; “Dependent Races” and “ Enlightened Motherhood” being especially worthy of mention. The N. Y. Independent, A. M. E. Review, and other high grade journals receive contributions from her pen. Mrs. Anna J. Cooper, author of "A Voice from the South by a Black Woman of the South," has given to the world one of the finest contributions yet made toward the solution of the Negro problem. Mrs. Josephine Heard is the author of "Morning Glories," a charming little volume of verse. Mrs. M. A. Dove, the widow of Rev. W. A. Dove, is the author of a biographical sketch of her late husband that has received unstinted praise. “Poor Ben," a biographical sketch of the life of Benjamin F. Arnett, D. D., by Lucretia Coleman, and a volume of poems by Mrs. Frankie Wassoms, continues our list of fair authors. Mrs. Harvey Johnson, wife of Dr. Harvey Johnson, of Baltimore, Md., has published two valuable Sabbath School stories, for which she has received a good round sum; they are both published and have been purchased by the American Baptist Publication Society of Philadelphia. Amanda Smith, the noted evangelist, has published a most interesting autobiography of her labors in Africa, England, and the United States.
     Miss Florence and H. Cordelia Ray are the authors of an exquisite memorial volume in honor of their father, the late Charles B. Ray, of New York City. “Aunt Lindy," a story from the pen of Mrs. Wm. E. Matthews, president of the Women's Loyal Union of Brooklyn, N. Y., is our latest contribution to authorship. Mrs. Matthews is widely known by her chosen nom de plume “Victoria Earle."
IN JOURNALISM.
     The sex and race have reached high-water marks through the editorship of “Free Speech,” by Ida B. Wells; “Ringwood's Magazine,” Mrs. Julia Costen; "St. Matthew's Lyceum Journal,” Mrs. M. E. Lambert; Virginia Lancet," Lucindia Bragg; “The Boston Courant" and "Woman's Era," Mrs. Josephine Ruffin; “The Musical Messenger,” Miss Tillman; and “Woman's Light and Love," a journal of Home and Foreign Missions, published at Harrisburg, Pa., by Mrs. Lida Lowry and Mrs. Emma Ransom. 
     Victoria Earle of Waverly's Magazine, Lillian A. Lewis of the Boston Herald, Florence A. Lewis having charge of editorial departments of Golden Days and the Philadelphia Press, show unerringly the value of our women's work in this line of effort. Miss Frazelia Campbell's translations from the German give her high rank in this field of work.
     Mrs. Mary E. Lee, wife of Bishop B. F. Lee, Miss Mary Britton, Mrs. Layton, of Los Angeles, Mrs. Alice Felts, wife of Rev. Cethe Felts, Anna E. Geary, Elizabeth Frazier, Frances Parker, M. E. Buckner, Mattie F. Roberts, Ada Newton Harris, Bella Dorce, H. A. Rice, Josephine Turpin, Washington, Katie D.Yankton, Lucy Wilmot Smith, Cordelia Ray, Lucinda Bragg, Fannie C. Bently, Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, Kate Tillman, Mrs. Silone Yates, Florida Ridley, Medora Gould, Miss Dora J. Cole, Irene DeMortie, Maria Ridley, M. Elizabeth Johnson, Leslie Wilmot, Alice Ruth Moore, Mrs. Susie Shorter, Mrs. Mollie Church Terril, Miss Virginia Whitsett, Dr. Alice Woodby McKane, Dr. Lucy Hughes Brown, Maritcha Lyons, Mrs. Majors, Mrs. Scruggs, and Mrs. I. Garland Penn, have done goodwork in the past, and in many cases are still doing such work in literary lines as must reflect high honor on their race and sex.
     The profession of medicine has proven more attractive, and more lucrative also, to Afro-American women than either of the other liberal professions. We havesome dozen graduates of the finest institutions in the country; among the earliest is Dr. Susan McKinney, a graduate of the Women's Medical College of N. Y.; having been a student under Dr. Clement Lozier is largely to the advantage of Dr. McKinney. As a member of the Medical Staff of the Women's Dispensary and of the City Society of Homeopathy the Doctor is doing efficient work; this combined with a large and rapidly growing practice makes her labors along race efforts especially worthy of commendation. Dr. R J. Cole and Dr. Caroline V. Anderson were the pioneers from the Phila. Women's Medical College; Dr. Cole is also an excellent German scholar. Dr. Anderson, although not an author in her own right, yet gave valuable assistance to her father, Wm. Still, Esq., in the preparation of his famous work “The Underground Railroad.” Dr. Anderson conducts a Dispensary in connection with the mission work of the Berean Presbyterian Church, South College Ave., Phila.,of which her husband, the Rev. Matthew Anderson, is pastor. The doctor has secured through the kindness of wealthy friends an additional aid to the work of this mission by the gift of a cottage at Mt. Pleasant to be used as a retreat for invalids. Dr. Verina Morton is practising in partnership with her husband, an eminent physician of Brooklyn, N. Y. Dr. Alice Woodby McKane was resident physician at the Haynes Normal and Industrial School until her marriage with Dr. McKane. She has lately organized a Nurses' Training School at Savannah, Ga. Dr. Hallie Tanner Johnson, the eldest daughter of Bishop B. T. Tanner of the A. M. E. Church, is resident physician at Tuskegee University, Ala. This lady had the honor of being the first woman of any race to practise medicine in the State of Alabama. She has since entering upon her work at Tuskegee established a Nurses' Training School and Dispensary at that institution. The Doctor has lately become the wife of Prof. John Quincy Johnson, President of Allen University. Dr. Alice Bennett, of the Women's Medical College, is pleasantly located in the East. Dr. Consuelo Clark, a graduate of the Cincinnati Medical College, is an eminently successful practitioner. Dr. Georgiana Rumly, deceased, was a recent graduate of Howard University. Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tenn., has two female graduates, Dr. Georgia L. Patton of the class of 93, now an independent Medical Missionary at Monrovia, Liberia, and Dr. Lucinda D. Key, class of 94, a successful practitioner at Chattanooga, Tenn. Dr. Lucy Hughes Brown, the latest graduate we have to record in this honorable profession, is now an alumnus of the Women's Medical College, Philadelphia, Dr. Brown has entered upon an excellent practice at Wilmington, N. C. Miss L. C. Fleming, who has labored very efficiently as a missionary in South Africa, has entered upon her medical course at the above institution. We have in the profession of pharmacy, three graduates of Meharry Medical College, these ladies having taken their degrees at this year's Commence ment, Miss Matilda Lloyd, of Nashville, Tenn., Miss Margaret A. Miller, of S. C., and, Miss Bella B. Coleman, who has entered a drug store at Natchez, Miss. 
     Dr. Ida Gray, our only known graduate in dentistry, hails from the University at Mich., receiving her degree in 1890. Dr. Gray at once entered upon her work and has found herself highly appreciated. The Doctor has a charming personality.
     We have as trained nurses Mrs. Minnie Hogan, of the Nurses' Training School of the University of Pa., Miss Annie Reeve and Mrs. Nicholson of the Women's Medical College, Mrs. Georgian Rumbly, lately deceased, took a Nurse's course at Howard University and practised this profession prior to entering upon a Medical course.
     We have in the profession of law three graduates, Mrs. Mary Shadd Cary, of Washington, D. C., Miss Florence Ray, of N.Y., and Miss Ida Platt, of Chicago. The first named is also an eloquent lecturer the second an author of merit. Miss Ida B. Platt, of Chicago, has the honor of being the only representative of the race now practising at the bar. Miss Platt is a native of Chicago, a graduate of the High School of that city, at the early age of sixteen she had finished the course taking first rank among the students of that institution. At a later date this studious young lady entered an insurance office acting in the capacity of stenographer and private secretary where the correspondence required proficiency in the German and French languages. In 1892 she entered a prominent law office as stenographer and at a later date she established an independent office of law reporting and stenography, (Germans as it must be said to their credit in this as in most similar cases giving the largest percentage of patronage received from the dominant race). Two years ago Miss Platt entered the Chicago Law School from which she has recently graduated with the exceedingly creditable average of 96. This lady deserves unstinted praise for her courage and perseverance. Busy at her usual work during the day she had only the evening hours in which to pursue her chosen profession and yet ranked among the best students of her class.
     No woman of the race has completed a theological course so far as we can learn, but large numbers inspired with zeal for the Master's kingdom have gone forth to evangelistic and mission work. Amanda Smith, now laboring in Canada, spent many months with Bishop Taylor in the opening up of his mission work in Africa.
     Perhaps it might be said we have done the least in the line of State work and yet we believe, that according to the opportunities accorded us we have done our share. In time of war, in famine, in time of fire or flood, and especially during the horrors of pestilence the women of this race have done noble work often calling forth public praise; as was the case at Memphis, a few years ago, when the mayor of that city complimented the women of the race for the kindness to the sufferers in the awful epidemic that had recently visited that district.
     In the East and West, on the School and local option question they have given able support, in local and ward charity they have always done their share of the work in hand. Miss Amelia Mills, of Philadelphia, has been for years a most efficient worker especially along the line of the Country Week Association. 
     During the World's Fair we had five experienced refined and cultivated women upon the World's Fair State Committees, Miss Imogene Howard, of N. Y., Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, of Chicago, who read a most able paper before the World's Parliament of Religions, Miss Florence A. Lewis, of Philadelphia, who was also World's Fair correspondent for the Philadelphia Times. Mrs. S. A. Williams, of New Orleans and Mrs. M. A. Curtis, of Chicago. 
     Along the line of Art we have one noble representative: the work of Edmonia Lewis, the sculptress, is so well known that it scarce needs repetition; her Cleopatra Dying,” exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition, received a medal of honor. Most of her works have been sold to titled persons of Europe. Elizabeth Greenfield Selika, Flora Batson Bergen, Madame Sisseretta Jones, Madame Saville Jones, Madame Nellie Brown Mitchell, Madame Dessiro Plato, Mrs. Lizzie Pugh Dugan, and Miss Agnes Tucker rank as the Pattis and Nilssons of the race. In many cases not only delighting the millions of the common people, but receiving marked tokens of appreciation from the crowned heads of the European nations, Hallie Quinn Brown, Ednorah Nahr, Henrietta Vinton Davis, Alice Franklin, now Mrs. T. McCants Stewart, Mary Harper, Matilda Herbert and Emma White take rank among the finest elocutionists of the United States. As accomplished pianists we have Madame Montgomery, Madame Williams, Mrs. Ida Gilbert Chestnut, Miss Inez Casey and Mrs. Cora Tucker Scott. The women of this race have always been industrious, however much the traducers of the race may attempt to make it appear otherwise. They are proving daily the truth of this assertion. The following word of praise from a recent writer, in the "Boston Transcript," voices this self evident truth as set forth in the present condition of the most humble of our women, laboring in the Southland. This writer in the closing lines of an exceptionally truthful article entitled, “ The Southern Plantation of To day," gives this tribute to the Afro-American woman of this section of our fair land. "Too much credit cannot be given these hard-working wives and mothers, who hoe, rake, cook, wash, chop, patch and mend, from morning until night; very often garments will be patched until scarcely a trace of the original foundation material can be seen, and there are many cases where the wife is much the best cotton chopper' of the two, and her work far more desirable than her husband's. The wife works as hard as her husband—harder in fact, because when her field work is over she cooks the simple meals, washes the clothes, and patches the garments for her numerous family by the blaze of a lightwood torch after the members of the household are rolled in their respective quilts' and voyaging in slumberland. She does more than this, for she raises chickens and turkeys, sometimes geese and ducks, using the eggs for pocket money."
     The women of this race have been industrious but it is only in late years, that they have reaped the fruits of their own industry. Many have built up businesses for themselves that net thousands of dollars. Mrs. Henrietta Dutērte, the oldest and most successful undertaker of color in Philadelphia, is a brilliant example, Mrs. Addison Foster is also a successful worker in this field of effort.
     Mrs. Winnie Watson of Louisville is a graduate of the Clark School of embalming. She graduated in a class of forty-five, three colored and forty-two white, and yet took first honor. She has entered into partnership with her husband who is an undertaker. Mrs. Caroline E. White is a retired dry goods merchant of Philadelphia. Mrs. Margaret Jones, cateress, and many of our women in the Eastern and Western States having handsome millinery, dressmaking, and hair dressing parlors, carried on successfully attest the business capacity of the Afro-American woman. For years the finest tonsorial parlor on the Pacific coast, was owned and conducted by a woman of the As managers of the finest grade of hotels, they have been a marked success.
     It is stated on the authority of numbers of reputable journals, that in the camp at Yasoo, Montana, a colored woman named Millie Ringold ran the first hotel at that place and established an enviable reputation as a prospector and also, that Mrs. C. Whetzel, a resident of St. John, New Brunswick, becoming widowed in early life continued the ice trade formerly carried on by her husband. She first secured a long lease on the only body of fresh water within city limits with this advantage secured she placed the whole business secure footing, providing all modern improvements to secure the desired end, and at present has the monopoly of this business in that city. Of late years she has invented an ice house, whereby meats and other provisions may be kept for months without losing their sweetness.
     As stenographers, type writers, book keepers, and sales women those of the race who have gained a foothold in these employments have never failed to give satisfaction.
     Mrs. M. E. Elliot years ago secured a patent on several toilet articles and opened branch establishments in many cities.
     A colored woman has a contract for hauling sand at a small town in Florida. In connection with this work she carries on a small farm and poultry yard gaining thereby more than a comfortable living for herself and family. Miss Maud Benjamin, of Washington, has patented a call bell. Mrs. N. F. Mossell, of Phila, has invented a camping table and portable kitchen. Many unique inventions are now in the possession of Afro-American women too poor to secure patents.
     That the women of this race did not lack force of character, was shown at an early day, when Elizabeth Freemen, popularly known as “Mum Bett," and Jennie Slew of Ipswich sued for their liberty under the Bill of Rights, both winning their cases.
     It is also on record that Deborah Gannet, who had enlisted during the Revolutionary war in Captain Wells' company, under the name of Robert Shurtliffe, serving from May, 1782, until October 23, 1783, discharged the duties of her office and at the same time, preserved inviolate the virtue of her sex, and was granted therefore a pension of thirty-four pounds. 
     “‘Happy' or Kate Ferguson, born a slave, opened a Sunday School in Dr. John Mason's Murray Street Church, in New York City, in 1774. She secured homes for forty-eight children, white and black. The school growing, the lecture room was opened, Dr. Mason and his teachers assisting ‘Happy' in her work.” So says Colored American, a book printed through a fund bequeathed by Lindley Murray, "to promote piety, virtue and the truths of Christianity." This was the beginning of the Sunday School in Murray Street Church, and Kate Ferguson, the colored woman who had been a slave is believed to have thus gathered the first Sunday School in New York City. Says W. E. Chandler in his history of the Sabbath Schools of New York City, after stating the above facts, “God bless the dusky hands that broke here an alabaster box, the perfume of which still lingers about the great metropolis.”
     We have in the line of musical composers, Miss Estelle Rickets, Miss Bragg, Miss Tillman, Mrs. Yeocum and Mrs. Ella Mossell. In artistic work, Miss Julia F. Jones, Mrs. Parker Denny and Miss Nelson, now an art student of Philadelphia, take rank with those who are doing successful work. Miss Ida Bowser is a graduate of the Musical Department of the University of Pennsylvania. We have also several graduates of the Boston Conservatory of Music. The New York Conservatory has also several of our girls as pupils; Miss Blanche D. Washington is a student in harmony and composition. Madame Thurber's invitation and Prof. Dvorak's statement that the future music of this country must be founded upon what are called Negro melodies, has given great encouragement to the young of the race who are ambitious musically. Of late years the dramatic instinct has developed sufficiently to enable the presentation of many of the best plays. The Afro-American woman taking her part therein with an ease and grace that astonishes those who go to mock her efforts. Perhaps the effort that is most unique and yet entirely consistent with the character of the race has been done along the line of philanthropic work. Within these later years since better opportunities for educational and industrial work have been opened to them in the more favored sections of the country; many of our women have turned aside from laboring for their individual success and given thought to the condition of the weak and suffering classes. They have shown that the marvellous loving kindness and patience that is recorded of the native women of Africa, by Mungo Park, the great African explorer, that forms the tie that still holds captive to this day the heart of the white foster child of the “black mammies” of the Southland was not crushed out by the iron heel of slavery but still wells up in their bosoms and in this brighter day overflows in compassion for the poor and helpless of their own down-trodden race.
     Two of the earliest laborers in this field of effort “Moses" and "Sojourner Truth," Harriet, known for many years as “Moses," was a full blooded African woman, who escaped from slavery on the Eastern shore of Maryland. She returned to the South nineteen times, carrying off four hundred slaves. Gov. Andrew of Massachusetts, sent her as a scout and spy with the union army during the war; at its close she labored for the soldiers in the hospitals and later with the "Freedmen's Bureau," she is now living at Auburn, N. Y., where she looks after the poor and infirm of her race. “Sojourner Truth” was born in Webster County, N. Y., she escaped from slavery and were labored for years in the Anti-Slavery, Woman's Suffrage and Temperance movements. She was woman of magnificient presence, great power and magnetism. She possessed at her death a book called by her, the “Book of Life," it contained kind words and thoughts for her from the great of every land. Mrs. Mary Ella Mossell, wife of Rev. C. W. Mossell, labored with her husband for eight years at Port Au Prince, Hayti, establishing at that point a mission school for girls. Mrs. Mossell died in America two years after her return to their home at Baltimore, Md. The school is a portion of the work of Foreign Missions of the A. M. E. Church, and has been named the Mossell Mission School in honor of its deceased founder.
     Miss Elizabeth Ralls, the organizer of the “Sarah Allen Mission and Faith Home,” of Philadelphia, is a remarkable character. Without education or wealth, with a heart overflowing with love to the poor, she has from childhood, labored in season and out of season in the mission cause. For many years she served a Christmas dinner to the poor of her race, in Philadelphia, over five hundred being present. Boxes of clothing and food were distributed monthly. Of late years she has rented a house and taken in the aged who could not gain admittance to other institutions. She takes her basket on her arm and goes to the market, gleaning for her poor. The whole work is carried on by faith. Her sweet, loving countenance, the “darlings and“ dovies” that drop from her lips as she places the hands on one's shoulder and looks lovingly into the eyes of the person addressed carries conviction. Her coffers are always filled to the extent of the actual need of “her poor people," as she calls them. Mrs. Sarah Gorham is now a laborer in Africa under the Women's Mite Missionary Society of the A. M. E. Church. Mission work has also been done in the South by Miss Lucy Laney, of Augusta, Ga., and Miss Alice Dugged Cary, Mrs. Lynch, and Mrs. McClean, in the West and Southwest are doing good work. Mrs. S. A. Williams, of New Orleans, has organized an orphanage which is succeeding. Mrs. Mary Barboza, a daughter of the late Henry Highland Garnet, late consul to Liberia, sacrificed her life laboring to establish a school for girls in Liberia. Mrs. Roberts, widow of ex-president Roberts, of Liberia, is laboring to establish a hospital for girls at that point. Mrs. Fanny Barrier Williams has co-operated with a corps of physicians in establishing a hospital and Nurses' Training School in Chicago.Mrs. Maria Shorter, wife of Bishop James Shorter, of the A. M. E. Church, by a large contribution, assisted in the opening of Wilberforce College. Mrs. Olivia Washington, the deceased wife of Prof. Booker Washington, of Tuskegee Industrial School, did much by her labors to place that institution on a secure footing. Mrs. I. Shipley, of Camden, N. J., has established a Faith Retreat at Asbury Park; she also does much mission work in her native city. Misses Fanny and Alma Somerville, of Philadelphia, are quiet but efficient mission workers, especially along the line of Working Girls' Clubs. Miss Planter, a wealtlıy lady of color, gave a large bequest to Livingstone College, N. C. Mrs. Catherine Teagle and Mrs. Harriet Hayden both bequeathed handsome sums to the cause of Afro-American education. Mrs. Stephen Smith and Mrs. Mary A. Campbell, wife of Bishop J. P. Campbell, and Mrs. Margaret Boling have given largely of their means and labors toward the establishment of the Old Folks' Home at Philadelphia. Miss Nettie Wilmer, who has done efficient mission work in various lines, is now laboring for the upbuilding of the Gloucester Industrial School, Va.
     The Lend a Hand, Christian Endeavor, Epworth League and like institutions have a large contingent of our women as efficient workers. The last effort at organized work by the womanhood of this race has been the organization of two associations, namely, the Woman's Loyal Union of Brooklyn and New York, and the Colored Woman's League, of Washington, D.C. These associations have for their work the collecting of statistics and facts showing the moral, intellectual, industrial, and social growth and attainments of Afro-Americans. They aim to foster unity of purpose, to consider and determine the methods that will promote the best interests of the Afro-American race, to bring into active fellowship and organic union all movements which may be classed under the head of Woman's Work. It is also their intention to receive and distribute information concerning the activities of Afro-Americans throughout the length and breadth of the land. Perhaps the greatest work in philanthropy yet accomplished by any woman of the race is that undertaken and so successfully carried out at the present hour by Miss Ida B. Wells.
     This lady is a native of Holly Springs, Miss. She received a liberal education for the greater part at Rust University. A teacher for a few months in the State of Arkansas, she at a later date became a resident and teacher at Memphis, Tenn. This position she held for some seven years. Criticism of the condition of affairs prevailing in the colored school of Memphis gained the lady the ill-will of the Board of Education, and at the following term she failed to receive an appointment.
     Miss Wells, nothing daunted, purchased a one-third interest in the Memphis Free Speech. The paper was much benefited by this fact and continued to be an eminent success from every point of view.
     March 9, 1892, occurred at Memphis (in a section of the town called the Curve) a most brutal and outrageous lynching of Afro-Americans. An attempt was made by the press of Memphis to justify this crime by the most flagrantly untruthful statements regarding the conduct of the men lynched.
     Miss Wells at once began in Free Speech a series of letters and editorials setting forth the true state of the case. These editorials were succeeded by a series of articles criticising and condemning the treatment of her race in Memphis.
     At a later date, during the month of May, 1892, there appeared in the columns of Free Speech an editorial from the pen of our heroine that has since become famous. Starting out on a visit to Oklahoma and later to New York City, Miss Wells stopped in Philadelphia on a visit to Mrs. F. E. W. Harper and to take a peep at the doings of the A. M. E. General Conference then in session at that city. What was her consternation to find letters pouring in upon her from friends and correspondents at Memphis warning her not to return to her office on pain of being lynched. She was informed that her newspaper plant had been destroyed and the two male editors had been forced to flee for their lives.
     Miss Wells was at once placed upon the staff of the New York Age, and in the issue of that paper of June 27, 1892, gave the facts that led to the suspension of her paper and the real motive for Lynch and Mob Law.
     In the early fall Miss Wells entered upon a lecturing tour among her own race in the United States; later a committee of ladies under the title of The Woman's Loyal Union of Brooklyn and New York gave her a grand reception, a testimonial purse of $400 and also a beautiful gold pen engraved with the legend “Mizpah.”
     Miss Wells continued her lecturing tour meeting with a hearty welcome, especially in the city of Boston. The press of that city gave her a flattering reception, publishing lengthy interviews and carefully reporting her addresses. Mrs. Josephine Ruffin, of the Boston Courant, used her influence to get Miss Wells's cause a hearing before the most exclusive Women's Clubs of Boston and with great success. The Moral Educational Association, of Boston, was of this number.
     The ire of the Memphis press was aroused by the courtesy shown Miss Wells at Boston, and retaliated by flooding the North with slanderous accusations against the martyr editor.
     During the late fall Miss Wells was visited at Philadelphia by Miss Catherine Impey, of London, England, editor of Anti-Caste. By this lady's invitation Miss Wells sailed to England in the spring to present her cause to the reform element of English society. She lectured on “Lynch Law," in England and Scotland, for many weeks, speaking at forty meetings in most of the prominent cities of England and Scotland. At Glasgow, London, Liverpool, Edinburg, Aberdeen, Huntley, Morningside, Manchester, Carruter's Close, and many other points, she was heartily welcomed by the best people; great interest in the cause she represented was thereby aroused. This interest culminated in the formation of an important society.
     In the drawing-room of Mrs. Isabella Favie Mayo, April 21, 3 P. M., 1893, at Aberdeen, Scotland, with Miss Wells, Miss Catherine Impey and Dr. George Fernands, together with fifty of the most prominent clergy, professionals, tradesmen and others, was put in operation a force that will tell on the life of unborn generations. A second meeting was held later on at Music Hall, Aberdeen, April 24th. Professor Iverach offered a resolution condemnatory of lynching, which was seconded by Rev. James Henderson, the son of an ex-Mayor of this city.
     The society formed received the name of “The Society for the Recognition of the Brotherhood of Man.” Its aims were stated in the following declaration:-
     (a) The Society for the Recognition of the Brotherhood of Man declares itself fundamentally opposed to the system of race separation, by which the despised members of a community are cut off from the social, civil, and religious life of their fellow-men.
     (b) It regards lynching and other forms of brutal injustice inflicted on the weaker communities of the world as having their root in Race Prejudice, which is directly fostered by the estrangement and lack of sympathy consequent on Race Separation.
     (c) This Society for the Recognition of the Brotherhood of Man therefore requires its members to refrain from all complicity in the system of Race Separation, whether as individuals, or by co-
membership in organizations which tolerate and provide the same.
     And those becoming members gave the following pledge:—
     I, the undersigned, promise to help in securing to every member of the human family, Freedom, Equal Opportunity and Brotherly Consideration.
     The publication * Fraternity, into which Anti-Caste had been merged, became the organ of the Society,and S. J. Celestine Edwards was appointed editor.
     Miss Eliza Wigham, Secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society, entertained Miss Wells during this visit. 
     Miss Wells soon after returned to the States, established herself in Chicago, and as a staff contributor to The Conservator and New York Age did valuable work that led to a wide-spread discussion of the subject of lynching of Afro-Americans in the Southland. Soon after she began the preparation of a pamphlet entitled “The Reason Why,” for distribution at the World's Fair. This was a most carefully prepared series of papers on race subjects by such writers as the Hon. Fred. Douglass, I. Garland Penn, F. L. Barnett and Ida B. Wells.
     Miss Wells was sent by the Inter-Ocean to secure the facts concerning a lynching case; these facts she secured and the result of her work was published in the columns of that influential journal.
     Soon after, a few hours before the lynching of Lee Walker, at Memphis, Tenn., the following telegram was sent to the Inter-Ocean, Chicago:—
                                                  “MEMPHIS, July 22.
     "To, Chicago:—Lee Walker, colored man, accused of —, to be taken out and burned by whites. Can you send Miss Ida Wells to write it up? Answer.                     R. M. MARTIN, with Pub. Ledger."
Miss Wells did much effective work for the race at the World's Fair. At its close she was soon after invited to again lecture in England under the auspices of "The
Society for the Recognition of the Brotherhood of Man," which she had been instrumental in forming at her previous visit.
     On February 28, 1894, Miss Wells once more sailed for the shores of “Old England." While making her second lecturing tour, under the auspices of the above-named Society, resolutions endorsing her mission were secured from the following associations: The Congregational Union, National Baptist Association, Young Men's Christian Association, National British Women's Temperance Association, Women's Liberal Association, Society of Friends, Society for the Union of Churches, and the Unitarian Conference.
     Lady Jeune, Mrs. Lockhart Smith, Charles F. Aked, Sir Edward Russell, and other prominent persons and members of the nobility opened their drawing-rooms to a favored few to listen to the story of the woes of Afro-Americans as recited by Miss Wells. Sir Joseph Pease presided at the parliamentary breakfast given in Miss Wells' honor.
     Miss Ellen Richards, who so many years ago had purchased the freedom of Frederick Douglass and Wm. Wells Brown, received our young philanthropist as her honored guest.
     The following clipping from one of Miss Wells' letters to the New York Age will give an excellent idea of the drift of the public meetings held by her in London:—
     The Rev. C. F. Aked (Liverpool) moved: “That this union, having learned with grief and horror of the wrongs done to the colored people of the Southern States of America by lawless mobs, expresses the opinion that the perpetuation of such outrages, unchecked by the civil power, must necessarily reflect upon the administration of justice in the United States and upon the honor of its people. It therefore calls upon all lovers of justice, of freedom, and of brotherhood in the churches of the United States, to demand for every citizen of the Republic, accused of crime, a proper trial in the courts of law." He said that the scandal he referred to had no parallel in the history of the world, and it was their duty as Christians to do their best to put a stop to it. In the Southern States of America there are 25,000 negro teachers in elementary schools, 500 negro preachers trained in the theological institutes of the people themselves, and 2500 negro preachers who had not received college training. The colored race had also produced 300 lawyers, 400 doctors, 200 newspapers, and they possessed property valued at £50,000,000 sterling. Yet these people are being whipped, scourged, hanged, flayed, and roasted at the stake. There had been 1000 lynchings within the last ten years, and the average now was from 150 to 200 every year. Some of these murders were foul beyond expression and such as to appall and disgrace humanity. Most of the lynchings were alleged to be for assaults upon women, but only a small proportion of cases were really of that kind. The mobs who lynched these poor people were generally drunk and half insane and always bestial. The church must not keep silent while the press spoke out, and he was glad to see that the Daily Chronicle was doing splendid service in the cause of humanity—(cheers)—called attention to the subject that morning, and told them to give a moral nudge to their American brethren. It was the duty of great nations to shame each other, and if they could do any good, he should be pleased. He appealed to them to prove by their action the solidarity of the human race
and the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God, and thus to further the interest of the kingdom of heaven. (Cheers.)
     Rev. Charles F. Aked was one of Miss Wells' ablest English supporters, and gave an excellent account of her work in the Review of the Churches.
     Speaking of the purpose to be served by Miss Wells' mission to England, Mr. Aked says:—
     “One thing she has set herself to do, and that there seems to be every possibility of her accomplishing.
* * * 
Miss Wells does not suppose that any direct political action can be taken, but she does suppose that British opinion, if aroused, can influence American press and pulpit, and through the press and pulpit the people of the Northern States."
     The Anti-Lynching Committee formed in England has just given to the world through the publication of a letter from Miss Florence Balgarnie in the August 23d issue of the New York Age a list of its members. The men and women who in the name of humanity and civilization have banded themselves together in this committee are still adding both British and Americans to their numbers. Among those who have already joined are:—

     This has been further supplemented by the following list from the Philadelphia Press of Sunday, August 26, 1894, containing many English, and not a few names of persons of great influence, natives of the United States:—
     Duke of Argyle, Sir John Gorst, member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge and student of Social Phenomena; Justin McCarthy, Sir John Lubbock, Ellis Ashmead Bartlett, Rt. Rev. Ed. White Benson, Archbishop of York and Primate of all England; Passmore Edwards, treasurer, who has in hand 5000 pounds to carry on the work of the committee; Mrs. Humphrey Ward, president of the Women's Auxilliary Branch of the League; Lady Henry Somerset, the Countess of Aberdeen; the Countess of Meath, founder of the Ministering Children's League; J. Keir Hardie. Americans-Richard Watson Gilder, of Century Company; Samuel Gompers, labor leader; Miss Frances Willard, Archbishop Ireland, Dr. John Hall, W. Bourke Cochran, Carl Schurz, Mgr. Ducey, Bishop David Lessums, of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana; Archbishop Francis Jansens, of the Roman Catholic Arch-Diocese of Louisiana; Bishop Hugh Miller Thompson, of Mississippi; Bishop A. Van de Vyer, of Virginia. 
     The Legislatures of Texas, Alabama and Florida have consented to give a hearing to deputations sent out by the League.
     The following interesting and pathetic fact is stated (concerning the first contribution to the funds of the above-mentioned League) by Miss Wells in the Aug. 23d, 1894, issue of the New York Age:—
     The first donation that the committee received came from a party of a dozen Africans who were in England. Desiring to show their appreciation of what had been done for me and the cause of the race, they sent 14 pounds, or nearly $70, as a testimonial of appreciation. I shall be glad to give a copy of their letter in another issue. We want the same voluntary response on this side to carry on the work here. Shall we have it?
                                                                                     IDA B. WELLS.
     128 Clark street, Chicago, Ill.
     Returning to the United States July 24, 1894, Miss Wells was enabled to be present in person at a meeting of endorsement of her work in England held at Fleet Street A. M. E. Church, New York City. T. Thomas Fortune, editor of the New York Age and President of the National Afro-American League, had called for a national expression on Lynch Law by the various Leagues throughout the country, and the above-mentioned meeting voiced New York's Afro-American sentiment on the question.
     The press comments on Miss Wells' work would already fill many volumes, some favorable, others unfavorable to the cause of the Afro-American, but all showing conclusively the truth of a statement made by Miss Wells in a recent issue of the Age:
     “That the Afro-American has the ear of the civilized world for the first time since emancipation.” Eminent Afro-American leaders, such as the Hon. Frederick Douglass; Rev. Harvey Johnson, D.D., Baltimore, Md.; Bishop H. M. Turner and Dr. H. T. Johnson, of the Christian Recorder, have endorsed Miss Wells' work, also the National Afro-American League, Equal Rights Council of Boston, Afro-American Leagues of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Bedford, New Haven, Rochester, and other cities.
     “CHICAGO, Aug. 18.—The Chicago Anti-Lynching Committee has effected permanent organization with the following officers: President, F. L. Barnett; vice- president, Mrs. J. C. Plummer; secretary, Dr. C. E. Bently; treasurer, C. H. Smiley. There is an executive committee of nine, two of whom are women. There is already a membership enrolment of 30 and the representative citizens of Chicago, including the pastors of the churches, have enlisted to fight Lynch Law.
     “The Central Executive Council have organized at Brooklyn, N. Y., the following-named officers being elected: W. L. Hunter, president; Rev. A. J. Henry,
vice-president; W. H. Dickerson, secretary; and Rev. W. T. Dixon, treasurer. Mr. S. R. Scottron, Rev. Lawton, Drs. W. A. Morton, Coffey and Harper and Rufus L. Perry are eminent workers in this cause."
     Who shall say that such a work accomplished by one woman, exiled and maligned by that community among whom she had so long and so valiantly labored, bending every effort to the upbuilding of the man-hood and womanhood of all races, shall not place her in the front rank of philanthropists, not only of the womanhood of this race, but among those laborers of all ages and all climes?
     Before closing this chapter of race history, how shall we estimate those humble workers who have labored for the upbuilding of our churches and societies, the opening up everywhere to the race more favorable school privileges, such noble souls as Mary McFarland Jennings and Mrs. Mary Browne, wife of William Browne of The True Reformers; those dear ones who have so modestly ministered to the wants of the sick and afflicted until their record of good works has followed them abroad, as with Mrs. Florida Grant, the beloved wife of Bishop Abram Grant, and that sweet, quiet worker in the Master's Vineyard, Mrs. Eliza Turner, the deceased wife of Bishop H. M. Turner?
     Two classes we have failed to mention thus far, but our hearts hold them in fullest remembrance: those uncrowned queens of the fireside who have been simply home-keepers, raising large families to a noble manhood and womanhood; among these stand forth pre-eminently Mrs. Elizabeth Steward, wife of Dr. T. G. Steward, and Mrs. Bishop B. T. Tanner, and those other sisters still dearer to us, whose work lies around us with its sweet fragrance until it seems almost too
sacred to weave into this chaplet of pearls. Of this number are Martha Briggs, Rebecca Steward, Katie Campbell Becket, and Grace Douglass.
     We close this tribute to Afro-American womanhood with a heart warmed and cheered, feeling that we have proved our case.
     Hath not the bond-woman and her scarce emancipated daughter done what they could?
     Will not our more favored sisters, convinced of our desires and aspirations because of these first few feeble efforts, stretch out the helping hand that we may rise to a nobler, purer womanhood?
A SKETCH OF AFRO-AMERICAN LITERATURE.
“They who have their eyes fixed in adoration upon the beauty of holiness are not far from the sight of all beauty. It is not permitted to us to doubt that in Music, in Painting, Architecture, Sculpture, Poetry, Prose, the highest art will be reached in some epoch of its growth by the robust and versatile race sprung from those practical idealists of the seventeenth century, those impassioned seekers after the invisible truth and beauty of goodness.”—Moses Coit Tyler.
     The intellectual history of a people or nation constitutes to a great degree the very heart of its life. To find this history, we search the fountain-head of its language, its customs, its religion, and its politics expressed by tongue or pen, its folklore and its songs. The history of the Afro-American race in this country may be divided into three epochs—the separation from native land and friends, and later arrival in this land of forced adoption. Next follows two hundred and fifty years of bondage and oppression mitigated only through the hope thrown upon life's pathway by the presence of hundreds of freemen of the race eking out an existence hampered on all sides by caste prejudice. Later, an era of freedom covered by twenty years of emancipation, holding in name citizenship, but defrauded of its substance by every means that human ingenuity could devise. Again, the intellectual history of a race is always of value in determining the past and future of it. As a rule, a race writes its history in its laws and in its records. Not so the Afro-American: he could make no law; deprived of the opportunity to write, he could leave no written word; he could only protest against the injustice of his oppressors in his heart, in his song, an in his whispered consolations to the suffering and dying.
     The heredity and environment of a people fix their intellectual limitations as they do their moral and physical. Therefore, perhaps it would be said, these people can have no real literature; but in yet another sense let its successful achievement convince us of the accomplished fact. Every human attempt must have had its first, feeble, rudimentary steps, must have one day been the era of small things. The first tiny stream that at last swells to a broad river having therefore its own important place in the future life of that fact, so these faint, tottering intellectual steps must be worthy of record. With all its drawbacks the race has built up a literature of its own that must be studied by the future historian of the life of the American nation. Afro-American literature in the United States, and by this we mean literature which has originated with the Afro-American, must be largely tinctured with the history of three great happenings in their lives. Torn from their home and kindred, they soon lost all memory of their native tongue, except as here and there some idiom survived. Their first faint gropings in the language of the new world were recitals of the woes they had suffered and the longing for home and loved ones. The soul felt desire to see again the land of their birth and look once more upon its beauty. But as memory of the fatherland became dimmed by time, the experiences of the life of bondage, its hardships and sufferings, its chastened joys and its future outlook toward the longed-for day of freedom that all believed would some day come, the ties of love and friendship formed, became the burden of their song. 
     At the time the slave trade started in this country, the possibilities of the new continent were new to the master; he had not become adjusted to his own novel environment. The newly imported Africans were largely descendants of the lowest type of African barbarism—history telling us they were mostly drawn from the coast tribes, who were easiest of capture, the white man fearing to go into the interior. The few belonging to the mountain tribes brought to this land were only such as had been held as prisoners of war by the coast tribes. The slaves were located in the warmest section of the New World, employed in the lowest forms of labor. Their environment was from every point of view hostile to intellectual development. They had been captured and enslaved that their toil might enrich another nation; they were reared in the midst of a civilization from whose benefits they were largely debarred; they were taught two things- reverence and obedience to authority as embodied in the master, and next in all of his race, and lastly to fear God. In spite of all impediments to intellectual advancement, here and there faint searchings after knowledge appeared among them. With a nature keenly alive to inquiry, the stories of the Bible took fast hold upon their imagination. The history of the children of Israel they made their own. As Moses through God became the deliverer of the Israelites, so would He give the oppressed ones of that day a deliverer. This seems to have been the first germ of intellectuality that appeared among them; this thought they wove into verse and sung and crooned as a lullaby. In their first attempts at literature may be found their origin—native Africans made Americans against their will—the tribes to which they belonged giving a clue to the differences in their powers of physical endurance or strength of character, when drawn from mountain or coastland. Their place of residence in their new home, largely a sojourner in the sunny South; their fear of the rigor of the northern and eastern climes; the troubles they had to contend with from within were those caused by the jealousy and suspicion implanted by their cunning masters, from without by the lack of opportunities for educational or spiritual growth, it being at that day against the law for an Afro-American to be found with a book, and a felony to teach one the alphabet. In the course of time, however, by stealth in the South and through the philanthropy of individuals of the North, largely members of the Society of Friends, they gained a foretaste of education. It has been said that oratory is the art of a free people, but this race even in the days of bondage and at the first faint breath of freedom, seem to have given birth to those who could rank with the masters of this art. The matchless oratory of Frederick Douglass, Samuel Ruggles Ward, JabezPitt Campbell and Joseph C. Price, has never been surpassed by men of any race on this continent. Scattered through every State in the Union, the Afro-American unconsciously imbibed the traits of character and order of thought of those among whom he dwelt. He became the Chesterfield of the South; his courtliness even in his master's cast-off belongings put that of the master to shame. The slave-mother's loving kindness to her own and her foster child became a proverb; her loving, wifely spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice dimmed the lustre of these virtues in her more favored sister of a fairer hue.
     The preacher of this race has never been surpassed for his powers of imagery, his pathos, his abundant faith in the future states of reward and punishment. His faith in the word of God, even as a bondsman, made soft the dying pillow of many a passing soul; the quaintness and originality of his speech delighted many an auditor in the home circle, and his abounding love of great titles and high-sounding names has never ceased to amuse the student of this impressionable son of Ham.
     The first written works of the Afro-American were not issued to make money, or even to create a literature of their own, but to form a liberal sentiment that would favor the abolition of slavery, or at least, the gradual emancipation of the slaves, and thus laboring they assisted the Anti-Slavery workers in the advancement of their cause. Thus, the speeches of Frederick Douglass, his “Life of Bondage," and other like writings were given to the world. At a later day, as opportunities for education advanced, and readers among their people increased, various weekly, annual, quarterly and monthly publications appeared. Here and there some more cultured and learned member of the race gathered into book-form scattered sermons, church history and poems. Within the past twenty years they have become, to a large extent, their own journalists, gathering and compiling facts about the race, forming plans to erect monuments to their heroes, recording the deeds of these heroes both in prose and verse. The despised Afro-American is learning daily to honor himself, to look with awe upon the future possibilities of his people within the life of this nation.
     The first two books written by members of the race in America were by native Africans, who had for a time drifted to the shores of Europe, and there in that purer light of freedom published the outpourings of their burdened spirits, and at that early day, as at the present, the song was in the minor key, never rising to a glad and joyous note. Both books were well received, their merit recognized, and their authors honored with the love and confidence of those who had minds liberal enough to recognize the worth of a brother, although of sable hue. The first attempt at book-making by an Afro-American in the United States was, strange to say, from the pen of a woman, and was entitled "Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral,” by Phyllis Wheatley, servant to Mr. John Wheatley of Boston. The volume was dedicated to the Right Honorable the Countess of Huntington, by her much obliged, very humble and devoted servant, Phyllis Wheatley, Boston, June 12, 1773. A meekly worded preface occupies its usual place in this little book. Mr. Wheatley's letter of explanation of the difficulties encountered follows the preface. Fearing, as often occurred in those days of bitter race-hatred, that the authenticity of the poems would be questioned, an attestation was drawn up and signed by a number of worthy gentlemen.
     Afro-Americans are born idealists; in them art, poetry, music, oratory, all lie sleeping. To these the first dawn of hope gave utterance. The little slave girl, in the safe, quiet harbor of her mistress' boudoir, takes heart of grace and tunes her lyre. Her verse shows the shadow of her unhappy lot, but rises above these sorrows and on the uplifted wings of song, floats to the starry heavens and consoles the afflicted, gives praise to the faithful ruler, breaks forth in love for the new home.
     Phyllis Wheatley, from all accounts given of her from every source, was of a sweet, loving disposition, attaching herself readily to those with whom she came in contact by this especial trait in her character. Her book was written under the pleasantest auspices,
surrounded by loving and appreciative friends, with a bright fire and friendly lamp in her room that she might get up at any moment and jot down the thought. The point is often discussed whether the poems of Phyllis Wheatley are of literary merit or simply curiosities as the work of an African child. That this gifited one died in her early womanhood would lead us to feel that longer life might have left to the world poems of greater strength and beauty. Yet, scan as often as we will or may the verses of Phyllis Wheatley, we claim for her the true poetic fire. In the poem to the Right Honorable the Earl of Dartmouth, the perfect rhythm, the graceful courtesy of thought, the burning love for freedom capture the heart. The "Farewell to America," the "Tribute to New England," have a sweetness and grace, a sprightliness and cheer all their own. Another proof of the genius of this young poetess may be found in the poem beginning, “Your Subjects Hope, Dread Sire." How these verses must have won the heart of His Most Excellent Majesty the King! what a flood of sympathy must have gone out to this young maiden in bondage, who could forget her sorrows in his joy!
     A narrative by Gustavus Vassa, published October 2d, 1790, was the second volume written by an African made by force a resident of America. Prejudice being so great, this volume, as was Phyllis Wheatly's, was first published in England. The second edition was welcomed in his American home. The writing of this little narrative, unlike the first, was accomplished under many hardships and difficulties, pursued by troubles and trials and dire calamities, yet it is a true and faithful account, written in a style that deserves respect. The following memorial to the English Parliament will give an idea of the style of the volume.
To the Lords spiritual and temporal, and the Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain.
     My LORDS AND GENTLEMEN:—Permit me, with the greatest deference and respect, to lay at your feet this genuine narrative, the design of which is to excite in your august assemblies a sense of compassion for the miseries which the slave trade has entailed on my unfortunate country. I am sensible I ought to entreat your pardon for addressing to you a work so wholly devoid of literary merit, but as the production of an unlettered African who is actuated by the hope of becoming an instrument towards the relief of his suffering countrymen, I trust that such a man pleading in such a cause will be acquitted of boldness and presumption. May the God of Heaven inspire your hearts with peculiar benevolence on that important day when the question of abolition is to be discussed, when thousands in consequence of your decision are to look for happiness or misery.
     I am, my Lords and Gentlemen,
     Your most obedient and devoted humble servant,
                                                                                                                   GUSTAVUS VASSA.
     "I believe it is difficult," writes Vassa," for those who publish their memoirs to escape the imputation of vanity. It is, therefore, I confess, not a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual, and a stranger too, to thus solicit the indulgent attention of the public. If then the following narrative does not prove sufficiently interesting to engage general attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication. I am not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous friends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest degree promotes the interest of humanity, the end for which it was undertaken will be fully attained and every wish of my heart gratified. Let it therefore be remembered that in wishing to avoid censure, I do not aspire to praise.” Says the Abbe Gregoire in his volume entitled "An Inquiry Concerning the Intellectual and Moral Faculties, or a Literature of Negroes:" "It is proven by the most respectable authority that Vassa is the author of this narrative, this precaution being necessary for a class of individuals who are always disposed to calumniate Negroes to extenuate the crime of oppressing them.” Says the good Abbe in conclusion, “The individual is to be pitied who, after reading this narrative of Vassa's, does not feel for him sentiments of affection and esteem.”
     The second class of writers were natives of America, living in liberal communities, such as could be found in the New England and some of the Middle States. “Walker's Appeal” is one of the most notable of these volumes, as it counselled retaliation. The author's reward was a price upon his head. Writers, such as William Wells Brown, of“ Rising Sun" fame; William C. Nell, with "Colored Patriots of the Revolution;" Frederick Douglass, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, with other like workers, labored for the Anti-Slavery cause. Inspired with a hope of greater privileges for themselves and emancipation for their brethren in the South, they wrote with a burning zeal which had much to do with securing the end desired. After this came twenty-five years of freedom with its scores of volumes, such as Williams' "History of the Negro Race in America," Fortune's "Black and White," Bishop Gaines's "African Methodism in the South," Albery Whitman's "Poems," Crummel's "Greatness of Christ," Penn's "Afro-American Press," Scarborough's “Greek Grammar," Johnson's “ Divine Logos, Bishop Payne's “History of African Methodism," Steward's “Genesis Reread." 
     This era produced history, narrative, fiction, biography, poetry and scientific works varying in grade of excellence, but yet all of invaluable interest; for in them is garnered that which must give inspiration to the youth of the race. Each had its effect of gaining the hearts of their enemy, winning respect and admiration, thus strengthening the bands of a common humanity. Simple and unadorned, these writings have a force and eloquence all their own that hold our hearts, gain our sympathies, fill us with admiration for the writers, for their persevering energy, their strong love of freedom, the impartiality of their reasoning. With what sincerity they bear testimony to the good they find even in their enemies. With what clear judgment they state the difficulties that surround their path. With what firm faith they look ever to the Ruler of all nations to guide this one to justice. Yes, this race is making history, making literature: he who would know the Afro-American of this present day must read the books written by this people to know what message they bear to the race and to the nation.
     Of volumes of a later date all are more or less familiar. But we cannot forbear in closing to say a word of three recent race publications: “Iola, or The Shadows Uplifted,” by Mrs. F. E. W. Harper, and "A Voice from the South, by a Black Woman of the South” (Mrs. A. J. Cooper). "Iola, or The Shadows Uplifted,” is in Mrs. Harper's happiest vein. The scene is laid in the South, and carries us through the various stages of race history from slavery to this present day. All of the open and settled questions of the so-called Negro problem are brought out in this little volume. In the opening and closing of many chapters Mrs. Harper has risen to a height of eloquent pleading for the right that must win for the race many strong friends. Mrs. A. J. Cooper has done for her people a great service in collecting her various essays into book form. Together they make one of the strongest pleas for the race and sex of the writer that has ever appeared. In this little volume she proves that few of the race have sung because they could but sing, but because they must teach a truth; because of the circumstances that environed them they have always been, not primarily makers of literature, but preachers of righteousness. The third volume, “Aunt Lindy," by (Victoria Earle) Mrs. W. E. Matthews, the last to appear, is a beautiful little story and is deserving of careful study, emanating as it does from the pen of a representative of the race, and giving a vivid and truthful aspect of one phase of Negro character. It shows most conclusively the need of the race to produce its own delineators of Negro life.
     The scene is laid in Georgia. A Cotton Exchange has taken fire, the flames spreading to a neighboring hotel, many of the inmates are wrapped in the flames of the dread tyrant. One, a silver-haired stranger, with others is carried to neighboring homes for quiet and
careful nursing “Good Dr. Brown” thinks of no other nurse so capable as " Aunt Lindy." The old lady had been born in slavery, suffered all its woes, but in the joys of freedom had come to years of peace. 
     She welcomed the wounded sufferer, laid him in a clean, sweet bed that she had kept prepared hoping that some day one of her own lost children might return to occupy it.
     As she stands by his side suddenly some feature, some word of the suffering one, brings back the past. Peering closely into the face of the restless sleeper she exclaims, “Great Gawd! it's Marse Jeems!”
     Then begins the awful struggle in the mind of the poor freedwoman. The dreadful tortures of her life in bondage pass in review before memory's open portal. Shall vengeance be hers ? Shall she take from him the chance of life? Shall she have revenge, swift, sure and awful ?
     In these beautiful words Mrs. Matthews shows us the decision, how the loving forgiveness of the race, as it has always done, came out more than conqueror: 
* * *
“Soon from the portals of death she brought him, for untiringly she labored, unceasingly she prayed in her poor broken way; nor was it in vain, for before the frost fell the crisis passed, the light of reason beamed upon the silver-haired stranger, and revealed in mystic characters the service rendered by a former slave—Aunt Lindy.
     “He marvelled at the patient faithfulness of these people. He saw but the Gold-did not dream of the dross burned away by the great Refiner's fire.”
     In this little story, and especially in its sequel, Mrs. Matthews has given a strong refutation of the charges made against the race by Maurice Thompson in his “Voodoo Prophecy," where he makes the poet of wild
Africa to say:
“A black and terrible memory masters me,
     The shadow and substance of deep wrong.
* * *
I hate you, and I live to nurse my hate,
     Remembering when you plied the slaver's trade
In my dear land.  .  .  .  .  How patiently I wait
                                   The day,
                                   Not far away,
     When all your pride shall shrivel up and fade!
* * *
As you have done by me so will I do
     By all the generations of your race."
     Only the race itself knows its own depth of love, its powers of forgiveness. In the heart of this race, if the American nation will only see it so, they have the truest type on earth of forgiveness as taught by the Redeemer of the world.
     This blood-bought treasure, bought with a Saviour's love, a nation's dreadful agony, is yet spurned and trampled on by professed followers of the meek and lowly Jesus.
     As we remember that the one novel written in America that captured the hearts of the world sung the wrongs of this people; that the only true American music has grown out of its sorrows; that these notes as sung by them melted two continents to tears; shall we not prophesy of this race that has so striven, for whom John Brown has died, with whom one of Massachusetts' noblest sons felt it high honor to lie down in martial glory, to whom a Livingstone bequeathed to their ancestors in the dark continent that heart that in life beat so truly for them? Shall we not prophesy for them a future that is commensurate with the faith that is in them?

THE AFRO-AMERICAN WOMAN IN VERSE.
     EVERY age and clime has been blessed with sweet singers, both in song and verse. Many women have attained to rare excellence in each of these lofty vocations. Among modern songsters Jenny Lind, Patti and Parepa have won golden laurels. In verse Elizabeth Barrett Browning stands pre-eminent. She not only honored her own English island home, but sunny Italy, the land of her adoption, has been purified and sweetened by the power of her verse. And with rare appreciation and devotion has this land of poetry and art showered honors on this sweet singer. 
     That we, too, of the African race have equally shared in the gift of the muses, having had sweet singers born among us, I have chosen for my theme, “The Afro-American Woman in Verse."
     Have we not had among us Elizabeth Greenfield, "The Black Swan," and have we not now Madame Selika, Flora Batson, Madame Jones and Madame Nellie Brown Mitchell? Crowned heads, as well as the uncrowned populace, have delighted to do honor to many of the sweet singers of our race. And have not two continents hung in breathless silence on the melody floating heavenward from the lips of our Jubilee Singers?
     That we have also among us those with rare talent for verse we hope to prove in the limits of this short article.
     During the year 1761 there sailed from Africa for America a slave ship. Among its passengers was a little girl, then seven or eight years of age. The following is from Williams' “ History of the Negro Race:" "She was taken, with others, to the Boston slave market. There her modest demeanor and intelligent countenance attracted the attention of Mrs. John Wheatley, who purchased her. It was her intention to instruct the child in ordinary domestic duties, but she afterward changed her mind and gave her careful training in book knowledge. The aptness of the child was a surprise to all who came in contact with her. In sixteen months from her arrival she had learned the English language so perfectly as to be able to read the most difficult portions of Scripture with ease, and within four years she was able to correspond intelligently. She soon learned to read and even translate from the Latin. One of Ovid's tales was her first attempt. It was published in Boston and England and called forth much praise. Pious, sensitive and affectionate by nature, Phyllis soon became endeared not only to the family to whom she belonged, but to large circle of friends. Mrs. Wheatley was a benevolent woman, and took great care of Phyllis, both of her health and education. Emancipated at the age of twenty, she was taken to Europe by a son of Mrs. Wheatley." .  .  . “She was heartily welcomed by the leaders of society of the British metropolis, and treated with great consideration. Under all the trying circumstances of social life among the nobility and rarest literary genius of London, this redeemed child of the desert coupled to a beautiful modesty the extraordinary powers of an incomparable conversationalist. She carried London by storm. Thoughtful people praised her, titled people dined her, and the press extolled the name of Phyllis Wheatley, the African poetess. In 1773 she gave a volume of poems to the world. It was published in London. It was dedicated to the Countess of Huntington, with a picture of the poetess and a letter of recommendation, signed by the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of Boston. In 1776 she addressed a poem to George Washington, which pleased the old warrior very much. Unfortunately no copy of this poem can be found at the present date.” In a letter, however, he wrote to Joseph Reed, bearing date of the both of February, 1776, from Cambridge, Washington refers to it. He says: "I recollect nothing else worth giving you the trouble of, unless you can be amused by reading a letter and poem addressed to me by Miss Phyllis Wheatley. In searching over a parcel of papers the other day, in order to destroy such as were useless, I brought it to light again. At first, with a view of doing justice to her poetical genius, I had a great mind to publish the poem; but not knowing whether it might not be considered rather as a mark of my own vanity than a compliment to her, I laid it aside till I came across it again in the manner just mentioned.”
     This gives the world an “inside " view of the brave old general's opinion of the poem and poetess; but the outside view, as expressed by Washington himself to Miss Phyllis, is worthy of reproduction at this
point.
                                                                           CAMBRIDGE, 28 February, 1776.
     Miss PHILLIS:—Your favor of the 26th of October did not reach my hands till the middle of December. Time enough you will say to have given an answer ere this. Granted. But a variety of important occurrences, continually interposing to distract the mind and withdraw the attention, I hope will apologize for the delay, and plead my excuse for the seeming but not real neglect. I thank you most sincerely for your polite notice of me in the elegant lines you enclosed; and however undeserving I may be of such encomium and panegyric, the style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your poetical talents; in honor of which, and as a tribute justly due to you, I would have published the poem had I not been apprehensive that, while I
Near only meant to give the world this new instance of your genius, I might have incurred the imputation of vanity. This, and nothing else, determined me not to give it place in the public prints.
     If you should ever come to Cambridge, or headquarters, I shall be happy to see a person so favored by the muses, and to whom nature has been so liberal and beneficent in her dispensations.
     I am, with great respect, your obedient, humble servant,
                                                                                     GEORGE WASHINGTON.
     We regret our loss of this poem on account of the great general's modesty, but rejoice in the fact that the greater number of Miss Wheatley's poems were published in one volume, and given to the world. We will quote as largely as the limits of this paper will allow from this volume.
                    A FAREWELL TO AMERICA.
          Adieu New England's smiling meads,
                    Adieu the flowery plain;
          I leave thine opening charms, O spring,
                    To tempt the roaring main.
                                         * * *
          For thee, Britannia, I resign
                    New England's smiling fields,
     To view again her charms divine,
                    What joy the prospect yields! 
     
     The love of freedom is beautifully expressed in a poem “To the Right Honorable William Earl of Dartmouth, His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for North America."
     Hail, happy day, when, smiling like the morn,
     Fair Freedom rose New England to adorn:
     The northern clime beneath her genial ray,
     Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway.
     Elate with hope her race no longer mourns,
     Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns.
                                         * * *
     No more America in mournful strain
     Of wrongs and grievance unredressed complain.
                                         * * *
     Should you, my Lord, while you pursue my song,
     Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,
     Whence flow these wishes for the common good,
     By feeling hearts best understood,
     I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate,
     Was snatched from Afric's fancied happy seat:
     What pangs excruciating must molest,
     What sorrow labor in my parents' breast?
     Steel'd was the soul and by no misery mov'd
     That from a father seized his babe beloved:
     Such, such my case. And can I then but pray
     Others may never feel tyrannic sway?
     We cannot refrain from giving one more proof of the intelligence and genius of this young African poetess. It is dedicated to "The King's Most Excellent Majesty," on the repeal of the Stamp Act.
     Your subjects hope, dread Sire,
     The crown upon your brows may flourish long,
     And that your arm may in your God be strong.
     O may your sceptre num'rous nations sway,
     And all with love and readiness obey!
                                         * * *
     But how shall we the British King reward!
     Rule thou in peace, our father and our lord!
     Midst the remembrance of thy favors past,
     The meanest peasant most admires the last—
     May George, belov'd by all the nations round,
     Live with the choicest constant blessings crowned!
     At the death of Mrs. John Wheatley, Phyllis married John Peters, a grocer of Boston, of whom it is said, "he wore a wig, carried a cane, and quite acted out the 'gentleman.'” But not being a gentleman, except in seeming, he soon grew jealous of the attention his wife received, and by his abuse and harsh treatment shortened her life, her death occurring December
5th, 1784, in the thirty-first year of her life. She was the mother of one child.
     Esteemed by all and beloved by many, her influence upon the rapidly growing Anti-Slavery sentiment was considerable. Her works were pointed to as an unanswerable argument in favor of the humanity of the Negro and his capability to receive culture.
     From 1784 until 1890, there has not been a volume of poems written by a colored woman published in America. Several pamphlets and scattered poems have appeared from time to time in magazines and papers either devoted to the interest of the race or edited by colored men. But the race has never failed through all these long years of bondage to embalm in song and verse the beautiful thoughts that years of ceaseless oppression could not entirely banish from their minds. Through all the long years of slavery, through all the aftermath of the reconstruction era, the weird, plaintive melodies that welled up in their souls passed down from mother to child, and at last bore fruit when sung by the band of singers from the South land, the sweet-voiced Jubilee Singers, who sung a University* into existence.
     During the time of the publication of the Liberator, by William Lloyd Garrison, and at the time of the Anti-Slavery movement in Philadelphia, Sarah Forten, a woman of large culture and great refinement, wrote several poems. Some of these were published by Mr. Garrison in the Liberator. We present our readers the following:
               THE GRAVE OF THE SLAVE.
The cold storms of winter shall chill him no more,
His woes and his sorrows, his pains are all o'er;
The sod of the valley now covers his form,
He is safe in his last home, he feels not the storm.
The poor slave is laid all unheeded and lone,
Where the rich and the poor find a permanent home;
Not his master can rouse him with voice of command;
He knows not and hears not his cruel demand;
Not a tear, nor a sigh to embalm his cold tomb,
No friend to lament him, no child to bemoan;
Not a stone marks the place where he peacefully lies,
The earth for the pillow, his curtain the skies.
Poor slave, shall we sorrow that death was thy friend,
The last and the kindest that heaven could send ?
The grave of the weary is welcomed and blest;
And death to the captive is freedom and rest.
               ON THE ABANDONMENT OF PREJUDICE.
     We are thy sisters; God has truly said
     That of one blood the nations he has made.
     O Christian woman, in a Christian land,
     Canst thou unblushing read this great command?
     Suffer the wrongs which wring our inmost heart
     To draw one throb of pity on thy part!
     Our skins may differ, but from thee we claim
     A sister's privilege and a sister's name.
     The "Grave of the Slave" became quite popular, and was set to music by Frank Johnson, the great negro musician of Philadelphia.
     The next woman we shall delight to honor is Mrs. Françes Ellen Watkins Harper. Mrs. Harper has been an Anti-Slavery lecturer in the days now past, and wrote several poems of great worth in that movement. Since the emancipation of the slaves she has been a lecturer in the temperance cause, and is now Superintendent in the National Woman's Temperance Union, and is also a director in the Woman's Congress, of which she has been one of the ablest members.
     Both as a writer of prose and poetry Mrs. Harper's talents are too well known to need eulogy at our hands. She is still among us, laboring with her pen, as her poem, entitled “The Dying Bondsman,” and her contribution to the symposium on the Democratic return to power, both published in the A. M. E. Church Review, attest. She likewise contributed to the "Alumni
Magazine" and many of the first-class weeklies published by our race.
     We give a brief quotation from her beautiful poem, entitled “Moses. A story of the Nile."
     THE DEATH OF MOSES. CHAPTER IX.
     His work was done; his blessing lay
     Like precious ointment on his people's head,
     And God's great peace was resting on his soul.
     His life had been a lengthened sacrifice,
     A thing of deep devotion to his race,
     Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt's gild
     And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand
     And held them with a firm and constant grasp.
     But now his work was done; his charge was laid
     In Joshua's hand, and men of younger blood
     Were destined to possess the land and pass
     Through Jordan to the other side.
     While the Anti-Slavery movement was in progress in Massachusetts, Miss Charlotte Forten, of Philadelphia, now Mrs. Francis Grimke, of Washington, D. C., wrote several articles on Southern life. These found ready acceptance at the hands of the publishers of the “Atlantic Monthly.” Miss Forten wrote often, both in prose and verse, but many very beautiful poems were never published. As the wife of Dr. Grimke she has been so occupied with work more directly confined to the church and locality, that nothing from her pen has appeared for some years. We have been honored, however, with a few lines from private collections of herself and friends.
                                   CHARLES SUMNER.
     (On seeing some pictures of the interior of his house.)
     Only the casket left! The jewel gone,
     Whose noble presence filled these stately halls,
     And made this spot a shrine, where pilgrims came—
     Stranger and friend—to bend in reverence
     Before the great pure soul that knew no guile;
     To listen to the wise and gracious words
     That fell from lips whose rare, exquisite smile
     Gave tender beauty to the grand, grave face.
     Upon these pictured walls we see thy peers—
     Poet, and saint, and sage, painter and king,—
     A glorious band; they shine upon us still;
     Still gleam in marble the enchanting forms
     Whereon thy artist eye delighted dwelt;
     Thy favorite Psyche droops her matchless face,
     Listening, methinks, for the beloved voice
     Which nevermore on earth shall sound her praise.
     All these remain the beautiful, the brave,
     The gifted silent ones,—but thou art gone!
     Fair is the world that smiles upon us now; . 
     Blue are the skies of June, balmy the air
     That soothes with touches soft the weary brow.
     Mrs. M. E. Lambert scarce needs an introduction to the readers of the Review. The beautiful  “Hymn to the New Year" is still singing its sweet message to The following triumphant strains are from her Easter hymn, as published in “St. Matthew's Journal," of which she is editor.
                                   CHRIST IS RISEN.
Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. — 1 Cor. XV. 20.
The Lord is risen! In the early dawn
     Nature awakens to the glad surprise,
And incense sweet from blossoming vale and lawn
     Fills the fair earth, and circles to the skies.
                                         * * *
O, Death, where thy terrors, thy darkness and gloom!
     And where, evermore, is thy victory, O grave!
Behold, the Great Conqueror illumines the tomb,
     Where shall rest the redeemed He hath suffered to save.
O'er sin hath He triumphed, o'er ruler and foe,
     O'er scorn and rude insult, o'er mockery and shame;
Whose pain and whose anguish we never can know,
     But whose love through it all remaineth the same.
                                         * * *
Alleluia! He is risen, the song has begun,
     Alleluia! Let the music reach each echoing shore,
He is risen! He is risen! the theme of every tongue,
     To whom be endless glory, both now and evermore.
     Miss Cordelia Ray, one of the teachers of New York City, has won for herself a place in the front rank of our literary workers. A poem, entitled "Dante." contributed to a late issue of the Review, received well deserved praise, and many readers hope we shall again be charmed with offerings from the same pen. We regret our inability to quote sufficiently from poems sent us to do justice to the author's talent, but space forbids.
                                   COMPENSATION.
Men who dare mighty deeds with dauntless will,
     Oft meet defeat,—not glorious victory;
But the uplifting souls to undreamed heights,
     May not of poorest laurels worthy be.
There is a heroism born of pain,
     Whose recompense in noble impulse lies;
And sometimes tears that e'en from grief did flow
     Are changed to joy-drops in pathetic eyes.
From out the din of mighty orchestras,
     The sweetest, purest tones are oft evolved;
So, from the discord of our restless lives,
     May come sweet harmony when all is solved.
                                   SUNSET PICTURE
.
The Sun-god was reclining on a couch of rosy shells,
And in the foamy waters Nereids tinkled silver bells,
That lent the soft air sweetness, like an echoed seraphsong,
Floating with snow-flake hush the aisles of Paradise along.
The Sun-god wove bright flowers, gold and purple in their hue,
And to the smiling Nereids tenderly the blossoms threw;
The sapphire seas were shadowy, like an eye with dreamy thought,
Where all the soul's mute rapture—a prisoned star—is caught.
The billows' rainbow splendor, like a strange enchanting dream,
In fading, softened slowly to a trembling pearly gleam;
And soon the wondrous Sun-god, and the Nereids and the sea
Had vanished; one gray-tinted cloud alone remained for me.
                                   IN MEMORIAM.
     A leaf from Freedom's golden chapter fair,
     We bring to thee, dear father! Near her shrine
     None came with holier purpose, nor was thine
     Alone the soul's mute sanction; every prayer
     Thy captive brother uttered found a share
     In thy wide sympathy; to every sign
     That told the bondman's need thou didst incline,
     No thought of guerdon hadst thou but to bear
     A loving part in Freedom's strife. To see
     Sad lives illumined, fetters rent in twain,
     Tears dried in eyes that wept for length of days—
     Ah! was not that a recompense for thee?
     And now, where all life's mystery is plain,
     Divine approval is thy sweetest praise.
     This beautiful verse appears in the opening pages of an exquisite memorial volume to the memory of Charles B. Ray, prepared by his loving daughters, Florence and H. Cordelia Ray, of New York City. 
     Mrs. Mary Ashe Lee, a graduate of Wilberforce University and wife of Bishop B. F. Lee, has, by her intelligence and sympathy, done much to inspire the students of that University with a love for broad culture, true refinement and high moral aims. Mrs. Lee has frequently added to the grace of public occasions at the college by her contributions of verse. One of the most beautiful, “Tawawa," commemorates the former Indian name of the present site of Wilberforce. We give a short extract:
     Where the hoary-headed winter
     Dwells among the leafless branches,
     Filling all the earth with whiteness,
     Freezing all the streams and brooklets,
     And with magic fingers working
     With his frosty threads of lace work
     Wraps the land in sweet enchantment.
                                         * * *
     Thus the site of Wilberforce is,
     Wilberforce, the colored Athens.
     But another name she beareth,
     Which the Indians call Tawawa.
     I will tell you of Tawawa;
     She the pride in all of Piqua,
     Pride of all the Shawnee nation,
     Child of love and admiration.
     In the bosom of the forest,
     Of Ohio's primal forest,
     Stood a wigwam, lone and dreary,
     With its inmates sick and weary;
     Snow-drifts covered all the doorway;
     Still the snow kept falling, falling,
     And the winds were calling, calling
     Round the wigwam of Winona.
     Far had gone the good Owego
     To the lakes in north Ohio,
     Looking for some ven'son for her:
     Scarce was everything that winter.
     Thus Winona, weeping, sighing,
     On her bed of deerskin lying,
     Pressing fondly to her bosom,
     With a mother's love, a blossom,
     Which the Spirit sent to cheer her,
     Sent to coo and nestle near her;
     Cried Winona, in her anguish,
     For she feared the child would languish,
     “Oh, sweet Spirit, hear thy daughter;
     Give us bread, as well as water!”
     Then a vision passed before her,
     And its scenes did quite restore her,
     For she saw the dogwood blossom.
     Now she had her father's wisdom,
     So she knew that these white flowers
     Came to speak of brighter hours,
     Speak of sunshine and of plenty.
     “Ah, my wee, wee pickaninny,
     I will call you the white flower,
     My Tawawa, whitest flower!”
     Another poem by Mrs. Lee, entitled “Afmerica," and of a more recent date, contains many beautiful thoughts expressed in a most chaste and exquisite style.
                                   AFMERICA.
     Hang up the harp! I hear them say,
     Nor sing again an Afric lay,
     The time has passed; we would forget—
     And sadly now do we regret
     There still remains a single trace
     Of that dark shadow of disgrace,
     Which tarnished long a race's fame
     Until she blushed at her own name;
     And now she stands unbound and free,
     In that full light of liberty.
     Sing not her past!” cries out a host,
     “Nor of her future stand and boast.
     Oblivion be her aimed-for goal,
     In which to cleanse her ethnic soul,
     And coming out a creature new,
     On life's arena stand in view.”
     But stand with no identity?
     All robbed of personality?
     Perhaps, this is the nobler way
     To teach that wished-for brighter day.
     Yet shall the good which she has done
     Be silenced all and never sung?
     And shall she have no inspirations
     To elevate her expectations?
     From singing I cannot refrain.
     Please pardon this my humble strain.
     With cheeks as soft as roses are,
     And yet as brown as chestnuts dark,
     And eyes that borrow from a star
     A tranquil yet a brilliant spark;
     Or face of olive with a glow
     Of carmine on the lip and cheek,
     The hair in wavelets falling low,
     With jet or hazel eyes that speak;
     Or brow of pure Caucasian hue,
     With auburn or with flaxen hair
     And eyes that beam in liquid blue—
     A perfect type of Saxon fair.
     Behold this strange, this well-known maid,
     Of every hue, of every shade!
                                         * * *
     Oh ye, her brothers, husbands, friends,
     Be brave, be true, be pure and strong;
     For on your manly strength depends
     Her firm security from wrong.
     O! let your strong right arm be bold,
     And don that lovely courtesy,
     Which marked the chevaliers of old.
     Buttress her home with love and care,
     Secure her those amenities
     Which make a woman's life most dear.
     Give her your warmest sympathies,
     Thus high her aspirations raise
     For nobler deeds in coming days.
     A beautifully bound volume of poems has recently appeared under the authorship of Mrs. Josephine Heard. The charm of the fair author's personality runs through these verses full of poetic feeling, bright and sparkling. And yet the closing verse holds our memory longest, and in our own humble judgment is the gem of the collection.
                                   AN EPITAPH.
          When I am gone,
          Above me raise no lofty stone
          Perfect in human handicraft,
          No upward pointing, gleaming shaft.
          Say this of me, and I shall be content,
          That in the Master's work my life was spent;
          Say not that I was either great or good,
          But, Mary like, she hath done what she could.
     From time to time there have appeared within the columns of the A. M. E. Review, Christian Recorder, Ringwoods' Journal, The Monthly Review, New York Age, Our Women and Children, and Howard's Magazine, poems of exquisite beauty. From these we quote, here and there, a gem serene.
                                   APRIL.
          BY JOSEPHINE B. C. JACKSON.
     Robes of bright blue around her form are swaying,
     And in her bosom dewy violets lie;
     While the warm sun rays on her girdle playing,
     Give it the rainbow's soft and varied dye.
     Over the meadow where the grass is growing,
     She sprinkles early flowers of every hue;
     Weeping, she strews them, and the bright tears flowing,
     Bathe every leaflet with a shining dew.
     With stately step, and crowned with crimson roses
     She comes; and sighing, April bows her head;
     Then May the white lids on the sweet eyes closes,
     And lays fair April with her flowers—dead.
Jacksonville, III.
                              FLEETING YEARS.
     Swiftly beyond recall,
          The years are fleeting fast;
     The brittle threads of time,
          Will gently break at last.
     O man of wisdom, canst thou tell,
     Why human hearts love here to dwell?
     Is it because earth yields
          So many treasures rare?
     Is it because life gives
          So many pleasures fair?
     Cease, doubting soul; it may be fate
     That bids thee through the years to wait.
     Bright flowers and pricking thorns
          Bestrew this life's highway,
     Where weary feet still tread
          The changing paths of day.
     But there is bliss for all the tears
     That seem to dim the fleeting years.
     We know, beyond the veil,
          There is some hidden joy;
     'Tis worth this life to live,
          That we may then employ
     Our trembling lips, in praise sublime,
     Beyond the boundless space of time.
     And shall we then despise
          The day of smallest things?
     Ah, no! these souls of ours
          Shall soon on angel's wings
     Be borne aloft, when years shall cease,
     To rest in perfect joy and peace.
                                                                           FRANCIS A. PARKER.
Hamilton, Bermuda.
                              AT BAY ST. LOUIS.
                    BY MISS ALICE RUTH MOORE.
Soft breezes blow, and swiftly show,
Through fragrant orange branches parted,
A maiden fair, with sun-flecked hair
Caressed by arrows, golden darted.
The vine-clad tree holds forth to me
A promise sweet of purple blooms,
A chirping bird, scarce seen, but heard,
Sings dreamily, and sweetly croons,
                         At Bay St. Louis.
The hammock swinging, idly singing, lissome, nut-brown maid
Swings gaily, freely, to and fro.
The curling, green-white waters, casting cool, clear shade,
Rock small, shell boats that go
In circles wide, or tug at anchor's strain,
As though to skim the sea with cargo vain,
                         At Bay St. Louis.
The maid swings slower, slower to and fro,
And sunbeams kiss gray, dreamy half-closed eyes;
Fond lover creeping on with footsteps slow,
Gives gentle kiss, and smiles at sweet surprise.
                                         * * *
The lengthening shadows tell that eve is nigh,
And fragrant zephyrs cool and calmer grow,
Yet still the lover lingers, and scarce-breathed sigh
Bids the swift hours to pause, nor go,
                         At Bay St. Louis.
                         THOUGHTS ON RETIRING.
                    BY LUCY HUGHES BROWN, M. D.
     Oh Lord, the work thou gavest me
     With this day's rising sun,
     Through faith and earnest trust in Thee,
     My Master, it is done.
     And ere I lay me down to rest,
     To sleep—perchance for aye—
     I'd bring to thee at Thy request
     A record of the day.
     And while I bring it willingly
     And lay it at Thy feet,
     I know, oh, Saviour, certainly,
     That it is not complete.
     Unless Thy power and grace divine,
     Upon what I have wrought,
     Shall in its glorious fulness shine,
     Oh Lord, the work is naught.
                         A RETROSPECT.
                    BY L. H. BROWN, M. D.
     Oh God, my soul would fly away
     Were it not fettered by this clay;
     I long to be with Thee at rest,
     To lean in love upon Thy breast.
     Here in this howling wilderness,
     With enemies to curse, not bless,
     I feel the need of Thy strong hand
     To guide me to that better land.
     How oft, oh God, I feel the sting
     of those whose evil tongues would wring
     The heart of any trusting one
     As did the Jews to Thy dear Son.
     Yet in this hour of grief and pain,
     Let me not curse and rail again;
     But meek in prayer, Lord, let me go
     And say, “ They know not what they do.”
     Lord, when this hard-fought battle's o'er,
     And I shall feel these stings no more,
     Then let this blood-washed spirit sing
     Hosannah to my Lord and King.
     GOD'S CHILDREN—THE FATHERLESS.
                    BY IDA F. JOHNSON.
     Speak softly to the fatherless,
          And check the harsh reply
     That sends the crimson to the cheek,
          The teardrop to the eye.
     They have the weight of loneliness
          In this rude world to bear;
     Then gently raise the falling bud,
          The drooping floweret spare.
     Speak kindly to the fatherless—
          The lowliest of their band
     God keepeth as the waters
          In the hollow of his hand.
     'Tis sad to see life's evening sun
          Go down in sorrow's shroud;
     But sadder still when morning's dawn
          Is darkened by a cloud.
     Look mildly on the fatherless;
          Ye may have power to wile
     Their hearts from sadden'd memory
          By the magic of a smile.
     Deal gently with the little ones;
          Be pitiful, and He,
     The Friend and Father of us all,
          Shall gently deal with thee.
                    A REST BEYOND.
          BY MISS KATIE D. CHAPMAN.
If this world were all, and no
Glorious thought of a Divine
Hereafter did comfort me, then
Life with too much pain were
          Fraught and misery.
I should not car to live another
Day, with burdened heart and naught
To cheer my soul upon its lonely way,
          From year to year.
So many cares beset me on my way;
So many griefs confront me in the
Road, how wretched I, no hope,
No faith to-day, in Heaven 
          and God.
The friends I love, for whom my life
Is spent, do oft misjudge and rob
Me of their love. Ah, if I had
No hope in Jesus, sent down from above!
Why should I care to stay in such
A race? far rather give the
Bitter struggle o'er and die,
Caring not to face what the
          Future hath in store.
But just beyond is Heaven's
Eternal shore, a mansion
Waiteth for each sincere soul,
A blessed rest forever more
          Is at the goal.
     Of the history of these sweet singers we know but little. Of Miss Jackson, Miss Johnson, and Miss Chapman, naught but their song. Mrs. Frances A. Parker, we learn, purposes bringing out a pamphlet of her collected writings, bearing the title, “Woman's Noble Work."
     Mrs. Lucy Hughes Brown, the author of the two sweet poems, “Thoughts on Retiring” and “A Retrospect," is a graduate from Scotia Seminary, N. C.; later as the wife of Rev. David Brown, of the Presbyterian church, Wilmington, N. C., she was enabled to do much philanthropical work for her race. Mrs. Brown received the degree of M. D. from the Women's Medical College, Philadelphia, March, '94. 
     Miss Alice Ruth Moore, through a complimentary editorial in the Woman's Era, we learn, is a Southerner by birth, and we feel that the Era has voiced our own sentiments in so cordially thanking the editor of the Monthly Review for introducing to us this charming writer.
     During the year 1859, there was published in New York City, that Mecca of authors and editors, The Anglo-African, a magazine of merit. Its editor was Thomas Hamilton. An able corps assisted him in the work; among them was Charles Ray, George B. Vashon, James McCune Smith, and other well-known literary men. From this magazine we have culled the two closing poems of this paper. They rank well with the writers of this present generation. Mrs. Harper was then in her youth. Grace Mapps belonged to a family noted for its acquirements in music, literature and art. Her aunt, Mrs. Grace Douglass, wrote a most beautiful tract that was published in the history of the First African Presbyterian Church, of Philadelphia. Her cousin, Sarah M. Douglass, taught for over fifty years most successfully the preparatory department of the Philadelphia Institute for Colored Youth Miss Mapps, also, for several years, taught as a member of the faculty of the same institution, now presided over so ably by Mrs. Fanny J. Coppin, wife of Dr. Levi Coppin, of the A. M. E. Church. 
                    GONE TO GOD.
               MRS. F. E. W. HARPER.
     Finished now the weary throbbing,
     Of a bosom calmed to rest;
     Laid aside the heavy sorrows,
     That for years upon it prest.
     All the thirst for pure affection,
     All the hunger of the heart,
     All the vain and tearful cryings,
     All forever now depart.
     Clasp the pale and faded fingers,
     O'er the cold and lifeless form;
     They shall never shrink and shiver,
     Homeless in the dark and storm.
     Press the death-weights calmly, gently,
     O'er the eyelids in their sleep;
     Tears shall never tremble from them,
     They shall never wake to weep.
     Close the silent lips together,
     Lips once parted with a sigh;
     Through their sealèd moveless portals,
     Ne'er shall float a bitter cry.
     Bring no bright and blooming flowers,
     Let no mournful tears be shed,
     Funeral flowers, tears of sorrow,
     They are for the cherished dead.
     She has been a lonely wanderer,
     Drifting on the world's highway;
     Grasping with her woman's nature
     Feeble reeds to be her stay.
     God is witness to the anguish
     Of a heart that's all alone;
     Floating blindly on life's current,
     Only bound unto His throne.
     But o'er such Death's solemn angel
     Broodeth with a sheltering wing;
     Till the helpless hands, grown weary,
     Cease around earth's toys to cling.
     
     Then kind hands will clasp them gently,
     On the still and aching breast;
     Softly treading by they'll whisper
     Of the lone one gone to rest.
                    LINES
     BY GRACE A. MAPPS.
Oh harvest sun, serenely shining
     On waving fields and leafy bowers,
On garden wall and latticed vine
     Thrown brightly as in by-gone hours;
Oh ye sweet voices of the wind,
     Wooing our tears, in angel tones;
Friends of my youth, shall I not weep?
     Ye are still here, but they are gone.
I see the maples, tossing ever
     Their silvery leaves up to the sky;
Still chasing o'er the old homestead's walls
     The trembling light, their shadows fly.
Familiar forms and gentle faces
     Once glanced beneath each waving bough,
And glad tones rung: shall I not weep
     That all is lone and silent now?
Nay, for like heavenly whispers stealing,
Comes now this memory divine,
Where thy clear beams, Oh sun of autumn,
Through the stained windows richly shine;
A solemn strain, the organ blending,
Like a priest's voice, its glorious chord,
Is on the charmed air ascending;
“Come, let us sing unto the Lord."
And while the earth, year after year,
     Puts all her golden glory on,
And like it, God's most holy love
     Comes now, with every morning's dawn,
Singing unto the Lord," I love,
     With all the hosts that speak His praise.
I may not walk the earth alone,
     Nor sorrow for departed days.
I know the friends I loved so well,
     Through the years of their life-long race,
Lifted sweet eyes of faith to God,
     And now they see His blessed face.
Thou, Lord, forever be my song,
     And I'll not weep for days gone by;
But give Thee back each hallowed hour,
     A seed of immortality.
     Here and there, from this garden of poesy, we have culled a blossom; but how many gardens of beauty have we not looked upon? And yet, we must close, knowing "the half hath not been told."
VERSE.
                    TWO QUESTIONS.
You ask me these two questions, dear:
What is the purest gift
That erst survived the fall?
And how that I should choose to die,
If I must die at all?
I'll answer thee: I know no purer gift than Love;
No greater bliss than just to dwell
Close held in Love's own clasp;
And glancing oft into the lovelight of thine eye;
Thus drifting from this earthly shore
See thee only, until I reached that land
Where love is love forever more.
                    LOVE'S PROMPTINGS.
Let thy life be precious unto thee, remembering this:
There is no joy that life doth hold for me,
But greater is that I may tell it thee;
No burden borne that bids me weep,
But would be greater far if thou didst lie
Quiet and still in thy last sleep.
                                         * * *
I should be satisfied if I could lead thee to a stronger walk,
That thy work should lie in some channel deep and wide,
If heart and soul were attuned to some good purpose,
Though unto me through life, companionship should be denied,
Yet thus knowing, I should be satisfied.
                    LOVE'S FAILURE.
That love hath failed its task
That hath not moved to greater, purer deeds,
And I shall feel for evermore
That love hath failed to do all that I willed for thee,
Unless it moves to purer, loftier heights,
To nobler aims, that life may truly be
God's greatest, noblest gift, a heritage to thee.
                    RECOMPENSE.
Until life's end thy love shall be
The dearest boon earth holds for me,
And when death comes and leads us hence,
Then love shall find its recompense.
                    GOOD NIGHT.
Good night! Ah no, that cannot be
Good night that severs thee from me;
To dwell with thee in converse sweet,
And evermore thy presence greet,
Filling thy life with cheer and light,
Then each hour lost would bring good night.
To listen for thy footsteps' fall,
To answer when thy voice doth call,
To feel thy kisses warm and sweet,
Thy downward glance my lifted eye to greet,
To feel love's silence, and its might,
Then evermore 't would be good night.
To dwell with thee shut in, and all the world shut out,
Close clasped in love's own clasp,
And thus to feel that I to thee belong
And thou to me;
That nevermore on earth shall parting come,
But only at the bidding of that Loving One,
With will, power and hope to show love's might,
Then, and not till then, can come good night.
To know thy every helpful thought,
To look upon the universe and think God's thoughts after him,
To see the mystic beauty of music, poetry and art,
To minister unto thy every want,
To fill thy life with all the joy that woman's love can bring,
To shield thy life from evil, to bring thee good with love's insight,
This daily life would surely bring to each
The best good night.
                    LIFE
          A cry,
          A sigh,
          A sunny day,
          An hour of play,
          A budding youth,
          A time of truth,
          An "All is well,"
          A marriage bell,
          A childish voice,
          That bids rejoice,
          A fleeting hour
          Of transient power,
          A wounded heart,
          Death's poisoned dart,
          A fleeting tear,
          A pall, a bier,
          And following this,
          Oh! loss or gain,
          An afterlife of joy or pain.
          MY BABES THAT NEVER GROW OLD.
How oft in the gathering twilight
     I dream of the streets of gold,
Of my little angel children,
     “My babes that never grow old."
I can see my tiny woman
     With doll, and book held tight—
Keeping time with my every footstep,—
     From early morn until night.
And then, a white-robed figure
     Is kneeling at eventide,
And a voice lisps, “God bless papa,
     And dear little brother beside.
I see my laughing treasure,
     My darling baby boy,
With his little soft hands waving,
     And his cheeks aglow with joy.
The clap, clap, clap, for papa to come,
     To bring the baby a fife and drum,
Then each little pig that to market went,
     And the one wee pig at home.
In the bureau drawer hid out of sight
     Is the rattle, and cup, and ball;
The beautiful scrap-book laid away
     With dresses, and shoes and all;
And then, as the tears begin to flow,
     And grief to find a voice,
A soft cooing sound I hear at my side,
     That bids nie ever rejoice.
I clasp her quick in a loving embrace
     My one lamb out of the fold,
Yet I ponder oft as I softly kiss,
     Will baby ever grow old ?
Then cometh this thought to ease the pain,
     How God in his Book hath given,
Suffer little children to come unto Me,
     For of such is the kingdom of heaven."
                    EARTH'S SORROWS.

               There are nettles everywhere;
But smooth green grasses are more common still:
The blue of heaven is larger than the cloud.
                                                                 —Mrs. Browning.
In the bright and pleasant spring-time
     We laid a dear form to rest:
The silvered head and the face of care,
     The hands close crossed on the breast.
We gave God thanks for the suffering done,
     The peace, and the joy and bliss,
That life had been lived, its trial were o'er,
     The next world's rest for the toil of this.
Then with the coming of winter's chill blast,
     Low down in its earthy bed
The child of our love we softly laid
     In its place with the lowly dead.
Friends crowded around with their whispers of love,
     But we thought of the vacant cot,
The sweet voice now for evermore stilled,
     And with sorrow we mourned our lot.
Then, with the silent fall of the leaves,
     The last bird left our nest,
Our arms were empty, the house was stilled,
     For our boy had gone to his rest.
We tried to repeat all words of prayer,
     All submissive and quiet thoughts;
We tried to say God doth give and doth take,
     Blessed be the name of the Lord.
Earth's joys are many, its sorrows are few,
     And when in our arms was laid
A new little lamb to be trained for his fold,
     We said that our God was good.
With thankful hearts we took up once more
     The warp and the woof of life,
And out from our mind, our heart and thought,
     We thrust the struggle and strife.
And trusting God in His mercy still,
     The Man of sorrow and acquaint with grief,
We say this life to an end must come,
     Both its joys and sorrows be brief.
                    QUERY AND ANSWER.
You say that your life is shadowed
     With grief and sorrow and pain,
That you never can borrow a happy to-morrow
     And the future holds little of gain.
That a woman's life is but folly
     Scarce aught she may cheerfully do;
You think of your fate not with love but with hate,
     And wish that your days may be few.
You long with a bitter longing
     To enter the battle of life,
To strike some sure blow as onward you go
     To soften its warfare and strife.
You hate to be idly waiting
     As the years are drifting by,
A chance to be doing while duty pursuing
     And the years so swiftly fly.
Nay, a woman's life is the noblest
     That ever Old Time looked on,
Her lot both the rarest and fairest
     That ever the sun shone on.
Both dearer and sweeter and fairer
     Than any in all of this earth,
So full of its din of sorrow and sin
     Scarce feel we its cheer or its mirth.
Think oft of the hearts you may gladden,
     The tears you may soon chase away,
The many kind deeds that the wanderer needs
     To keep him from going astray.
Think oft of the mite of the widow,
     The cup of cold water given,
The love and faith mild of the little child
     That gaineth a seat in heaven.
Have you thought of the sweet box of ointment
     That Mary the Magdalene shed,
In its fragrance and beauty for love and not duty,
     Then wiped with the hair of her head?
Have you thought of the smile and the hand-clasp
     That met you some weary day,
That warmed you and fed you and hopefully led you
     To a safe and surer way?
Dear friend, when you faint by the wayside
     Oh think of these little things,
Then comfort the weary, the sad and the dreary
     And time will pass swift on its wings.
Let hope comfort, encourage and cheer you
     And help you to bravely say,
Not idly repining, but working and striving,
     Not hiding my talent away.
Then think not your lot has been hampered
     Or shadowed by grief or pain,
But up and adoing, still duty pursuing,
     The crown you surely must gain.
                    WORDS.
“Words fitly spoken are like apples of gold in pictures of silver.”
“A word is a picture of a thought."
     Words—idle words—ye may not speak,
          Without a care or thought;
     For all that pass your lips each day
          With good or ill are fraught.
     The words of joy, and peace, and love,
          You spoke at early morn,
     Though time has passed and day is o'er,
          Are on their mission borne.
     The threat of pain, and fear, and hate,
          You shouted in your wrath,
     With all its deadly doing, still
          Is lying in your path.
     Nay, e'en the tiny waves of air
          Your secret will not keep,
     And all you speak when wide awake
          Is whispered, though you sleep.
     A word may be a curse, a stab,
          And, when the sun is west,
     Its onward course it still may run
          And rankle in some breast.
     But words, small words, and yet how great,
          Scarce do we heed their power;
     Yet they may fill the heart with joy,
          And soften sorrow's hour.
     True hearts, by words, are ofttimes knit;
          Bound with a mystic tie,
     Each golden link a word may loose;
          Yea, cause true love itself to die.
     Mother, friendship, home and love;
          Only words, but Oh, how sweet!
     How they cause the pulse to quicken,
          Eye or ear, whene'er they greet.
     "Peace on earth, good will to men,"
          Are the words the angels spake,
     And long ages echo them;
          Still their tones glad music make.
     Each day we live, each day we speak;
          And ever an angel's pen
     Doth write upon those pages fair
          The words of sinful men.
     But one small word, but it must be
          A power for good or ill,
     And when the speaker lieth cold
          May work the Master's will.
     Then learn their power and use them well,
          That memory ne'er may bring
     In time of mirth or lonely hour
          A sad or bitter sting.
     Let only words of truth and love
          The golden silence break,
     That God may read on record bright,
          She spoke for "Jesus' sake."
     TELL THE NORTH THAT WE ARE RISING.
     At the laying of the corner-stone of Atlanta University in 1879 occurred the incident recorded in the following lines.
There was the human chattel
Its manhood taking;
There in each dark brain statue,
A soul was waking,
The man of many battles,
The tears his eyelids pressing,
Stretched over those dusky foreheads
His one-armed blessing.
And he said: “Who hears can never
Fear for nor doubt you;
What shall I tell the children
Up North about you?"
Then ran round a whisper, a murmur,
Some answer devising;
And a little boy * stood up—“Massa,
Tell 'em we're rising.” †
Tell the North that we are rising;
Tell this truth throughout the land—
Tell the North that we are rising—
Rising at our God's command.
Could the bravest say it better?
Was the child a prophet sent?
From the mouths of babes and sucklings
Are the words of wisdom lent.
Tell the North that we are rising;
East and West the tidings go;
Tell this truth throughout the nation—
Tell it to both friend and foe.
Tell our true and tried friend Lincoln,
Tell our Grant and Sumner true—
Tell them each that we are rising,
Knowing we have work to do.
See the child before us standing,
All his heart and life aglow,
Backward flit the years of sorrow;
Onward hopes, bright visions flow.
All his life has lost its shadow,
Filled is it with coming light;
Hope and Faith again triumphant
Make the present glad and bright.
Thus the keynote of our future
Touched he with his childish hand;
In his words the inspiration
Lingering yet throughout the land.
And the brave old poet Whittier
Treasured up his song in verse,
That the myriads yet to follow,
Might anon the tale rehearse.
Those who then wore childhood's garland
Now are true and stalwart men;
Those who bore war's dreadful burdens,
Friend and foe have died since then.
But we still would send the message
To our friends where'er they roam,
We are rising, yea, have risen:
Future blessings yet will come.
Noble son of noble mother,
When our hearts would shrink and falter,
We yet treasure up your message,
Laying it on freedom's altar.
We with courage strive to conquer,
'Till as England's Hebrews stand
We are neither slaves nor tyrants,
But are freemen on free land.
               THE MARTYRS OF TO-DAY.
By the swiftly flowing rivers,
     In the fertile Southern land,
Gathered there from lane and highway,
     Scores of men, an earnest band.
Not with brows of snowy whiteness,
     Not with chiseled features rare;
Rather cheeks of sable darkness,
     Yet was God's own image there.
Do they fear the chain of bondage?
     Do they fear the lash or mart?
Slaves ignoble! do they tremble—
     Sadly lack the freeman's heart?
                         * * *
See, one in their midst—a brother—
     Reads of blood and deeds of pain—
Deeds of cruelty and outrage—
     That with horror chill each vein.
He, with solemn tone and gesture,
     Furrowed brow and wearied hand,
Reads this tale so weird and solemn,
     To this earnest, thinking band.
                         * * *
In the silence of the midnight,
     Decked in robes of dingy white,
On their foamed and maddened chargers,
And with features hid from sight,
Ride a band of fearless South'rons,
     With a ruthless iron will:
Ride their foamed and maddened chargers,
     Through the vale and o'er the hill.
And they give to none the quarter
     Which the brave are wont to give;
Man nor woman, babe nor suckling,
     Be they black, are 'lowed to live.
These now all were made to perish
     By the flower of Southern life;
And the deed is yet commended
     By both Southern maid and wife.
                         * * *
Long, too long, our race has suffered,
     Both from church and school and state;
Trade and ballot long denied us,
     Yet our friends still council, wait.
Must we, then, give up the struggle?
     Must we sail for Afric's shore?
Must we leave this land we've toiled in?
     Must it swim again with gore?
Must we wait with greater patience?
     Must we say, "Oh, Lord, forgive?
Must we love these worse than foemen,
     Who forbid us die or live?
We must ponder Calvary's lesson;
     View our martyred Saviour's fate;
Work and pray, with faith in heaven;
     Right must conquer—therefore wait.
A GREETING SONG TO OUR BROTHERS IN AFRICA.
We send you a greeting, our brothers,
     Our brothers over the sea,
Who have sailed away to that sunny land,
     Its light and blessing to be.
We have heard of your safe arrival,
     Of the work you have chosen to do,
Of the little ones gathered together
     To hear the truths old and yet new.
We ask for God's blessing upon you,
     As we lift up our voices in prayer,
And by faith we know you receive it,
     Though we worship not with you there.
The harvest is great, let reapers be many;
     May ye sow and bountifully reap;
May your lives be long and useful,
     And mourned your eternal sleep.
               CHILD OF THE SOUTHLAND.
Child of the Southland
Baring thy bosom,
Feeling hate's poisoned dart,
Reeking with venom,
God looks upon you,
Seeth your sorrow;
Great the awakening,
Dawneth the morrow,
Lifteth the burden,
Greed placed upon you.
Mercy is watching
Justice but sleeping,
Angels above you,
Their vigils keeping;
Cometh the future,
With its hope laden,
Keepeth the promise,
Made us in Eden;
Ethiop stretcheth
Forward her hand,
Graspeth the staff of life,
Gaineth the promised land.
          WHY BABY WAS NAMED CHRIS.
I told mamma I was tired of noise,
Tired of marbles, and tops and toys,
had nobody to play with me.
So I didn't enjoy myself, you see.
I told her I guessed that I would pray
To dear old Chris that very day,
And tell him then, somehow or other,
I wanted him to send me a baby brother.
I knelt right down by my little chair,
As quick as I could, and said my prayer,
I went to bed right soon that night
And jumped up quick with the Christmas light.
In my little bare feet I softly crept
Down to the room where my ma slept,
And there, by the mantel, fast asleep
Down in a cradle wide and deep,
Lay a dear little baby brother.
He had a round face and a little red nose,
Ten little fingers, and ten little toes,
Two black eyes, and a dimpled chin,
That's where the angels had kissed him.
So we named him “Chris," only that,
And he grows so big, and rosy, and fat,
He rolls and tumbles about when we play,
But never gets hurt, for I always say
I'll be right good, so if Chris goes by,
He'll surely see that I always try
To 'preciate my Christmas present.
                              ONLY.
Only a baby, but strong and bright,
Making us happy from morn until night,
And knitting together with cords of love,
Those who were joined by the God above.
Only a boy, with his frolic and fun,
His marbles, and tops, and miniature gun,
But time rolls by, and leaves in his stead
The man, tender of heart, and wise of head.
Only a girl, with her dolls and play,
Her loving glance, and dainty way—
But the summers have fled with a sweet surprise,
And a stately maiden gladdens our eyes.
The maiden, now, is the matron dear,
That with tender counsel doth little ones rear;
And we vow in our hearts, our lips shall ne'er curl
As we scornfully say, “ Only a girl!”
Only a flower in a mossy bed;
By sun, and by rain, it was gently fed,
And now in the room of a suffering one,
Its mission fulfilled, its work is done.
Only a word, but it chanced to fall
On the ear of one forsaken of all,
And a heart, bowed down in its bitterness,
Arose once more its God to bless.
Only a song, a gladsome lay,
Sung cheerily on through a weary day;
'Twas a simple tune in a merry strain,
But it eased a heart of its burden of pain.
Only a thought, full of wondrous power,
Born in the need of a stricken hour,
Yet it grew and thrived, and taking root
In the hearts of many, it bore much fruit.
Only a prayer, from a heart, sad and lone,
It passed on its way to the Great White Throne;
'Twas spoken in faith, 'twas answered in love,
And a sinner turned to his God above.
                    BEAUTIFUL THINGS.
Beautiful eyes are those that see
God's own children that should be;
Beautiful ears are those that hear
Their little footsteps lingering near,
Beautiful lips are those that press
Stained ones with fond caress;
Beautiful hands are those that grasp
The blind and erring with gentle clasp.
Beautiful feet are those that lead
Wandering ones the path to heed;
Beautiful hearts are those that beat
In sympathy warm at the mercy-seat.
Beautiful faces are those we see
And bless our God for memory;
Beautiful forms are those that move
Joyfully forward, on missions of love.
Beautiful homes are those that teach
Patient acts and kindly speech;
Beautiful lives are those that give
Others the strength and courage to live.
Beautiful words are those we spake,
Timid and tearful, “For Jesus' sake;"
Beautiful thoughts are those that fly
On wings of love to God on high.
Beautiful prayers are those we raise
For them that turn from wisdom's ways;
Beautiful songs are those we sing
When sinners own our Lord and King.
Beautiful wills on God's work bent,
Beautiful errands of good intent;
Beautiful heaven smiling above,
Beautiful truth that God is love."
Beautiful promise in God's own Book—
Free to all who will only look;
Beautiful crown when cross we bear;
Beautiful ransomed ones, bright and fair.
Beautiful Saviour, the Crucified Lamb,
All wise, all loving, the Great I Am;
Beautiful Sabbath of perfect rest-
Beautiful day that God has blest.
Beautiful sleep, all joy and gain,
No grief or loss, neither sorrow or pain;
Beautiful rest with work well done;
Beautiful saints around God's throne.
THREE HOURS.
“Work while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work."
“Do noble things, not dream them all day long, and so make life, death and that vast forever one grand, sweet song.”
MORNING.
A mother sat in the rosy dawn
     Of a morning bright and fair,
Her arms are round her firstborn son,
     Her breath is in his hair.
My little son to my God I will give
     Ere yet his tongue can lisp;
And all the days my boy shall live
     Shall be spent in His service rich,
But the years pass on and he grows apace,
     His limbs are round and free,
His feet can tread the meadow path,
     His eyes its wonders see.
But the mother is busied with household care,
     And ever, like Martha of old,
Her heart is troubled with many things,
     And the Saviour's love untold.
The little child is bountifully fed,
     His form is daintily robed,
And mind and heart are stored with good—
     Only the soul is starved.
NOON.
'Tis noon of day and noon of life,
     And the infant is now a youth,
And the mother's heart to its depth is stirred,
     As it feels the bitter truth.
That years have passed with their length of days,
     And the babe no longer a child,
Though loved by all, by many praised,
     Is not loving the Master's precepts mild.
So carefully striving day by day
     Lost footsteps to retrace,
The mother's heart goes blindly on,
     Prays for the seed a resting-place.
But the youth is filled with the hour's conceit;
     The ground is stony and choked with weeds,
And seeds of evil already sown
     Must be rooted out ere we sow good seeds.
And now again the household care
     Is ruling heart and mind,
And neighbors oft her bounty share,
     And love the eye doth blind.
NIGHT.
And now again 'tis set of sun,
     And close of life's fair day;
The youth has passed to manhood's hour,
     But only lips can pray.
No longer may the mother voice,
     In accents sweet and mild,
With holy words of Bible lore,
     Still guide her little child.
In college walls by scoffers thronged,
     No precious word made household truth,
Is brought to him, by memory fair,
     To guide his erring youth.
His life no longer the mother may shape,
     Forever lost is the precious hour;
Now only God can the wrong undo,
     By the help of His mighty power.
O, mothers dear! throughout our land,
     Its acres fair and wide!
With little ones your daily care,
     Now walking by your side,
Keep ever this truth before you;
     At morn, at night, alway,
That to teach the love of the Saviour,
     His precepts to obey,
With kindly lips and true,
Is a work that lies ever before you,
The best that you can do.
Let not the hours pass idly on,
     'Till morn and noon and night have come,
And all your work lay idly by,
     And remain perhaps forever undone
But gird your heart up to the work;
     Let every day some Bible truth
Be sown in the heart and mind of each child,
     To guide him on in his tender youth.
And when the close of life shall come
     And all your work shall cease,
The Soul to its Giver shall return
     To a life of endless peace.
                    THE STORY OF A LIFE.
CHILDHOOD—HOME.
A precious gift our God has given
     To bless declining years,
Anew we feel our sins forgiven,
And eyes o'erflow in grateful tears.
A little child with gentle ways,
     The darling household pet,
Swiftly passing, peaceful days,
     The jewel is ours yet.
The child has passed to bloom of youth
     A maiden fair of face,
With heart of love and lips of truth,
     Doth still our fireside grace.
The skilful hands and winsome ways
     Win love without a thought;
And words of cheer and songs of praise
     Are given, though all unsought.
A time of sadness follows now,
     And then a Saviour's love;
A grateful band we humbly bow,
     And thank our Friend above.
But grown to years of maidenhood
     The heart is not our own;
Though home is dear and God is love,
     The sweet content has flown.
MAIDENHOOD—LOVE.
A quiet room, an easy chair,
     With firelight all aglow,
Two loving hearts beat happily—
     Ah, quickly time doth flow.
A breathless parting for a year,
     A tear from sweet, dark eye,
A joyful meeting at its close
     Ah, quickly time doth fly.
A fancied bond of friendship,
     A whispered confidence,
A wicked heart to prompt deceit,
     And happiness flies hence.
A stolen page, a recreant love,
     Ah, what is left to tell!
A broken heart, a weeping throng,
     And then—a funeral knell.
A wounded heart, a home bereft,
     No daughter grace now lends,
Long, weary years of loneliness,
     And thus the story ends.
WOMANHOOD—DEATH.
But to our hearts with healing balm
     This thought brings memory fair,
The weary couch had long become
     “A Christ-held hammock of prayer,"
Which faithful friends, a loving band,
     Had twisted with promises bright,
And angels fair with loving hands
     Had gathered and fastened tight.
Her words of love are with us still:
     "So quiet I lie 'neath the eternal sky,
“Biding the time when God, in His will,
     Shall take me to dwell with Him on high."
Though the beautiful form is laid away
     And our home is no more blest,
Though joy had its hour and sorrow its day,
     We know that with Jesus is rest.

Dedication: 


As my first pipings were inscribed to her, it is fitting, as a further recognition of my love and obligation, that I should also dedicate these later songs to MY MOTHER



IONE

Part I

Ah, yes, 't is sweet still to remember,
Though 'twere less painful to forget;
For while my heart glows like an ember,
Mine eyes with sorrow's drops are wet,
And, oh, my heart is aching yet.
It is a law of mortal pain
That old wounds, long accounted well,
Beneath the memory's potent spell,
Will wake to life and bleed again.

So 'tis with me; it might be better,
If I should turn no look behind,--
If I could curb my heart, and fetter
From reminiscent gaze my mind,
Or let my soul go blind--go blind!
But would I do it if I could?
Nay! Ease at such a price were spurned,
For, since my love was once returned,
All that I suffer seemeth good.

I know, I know it is the fashion,
When love has left some heart distressed,
To weight the air with wordful passion:
But I am glad that in my breast
I ever held so dear a guest.
Love does not come at every nod,
Or every voice that calleth "hasten,"
He seeketh out some heart to chasten,
And whips it, wailing up to God!

Love is no random road wayfarer
Who where he may must sip his glass.
Love is the King, the Purple-wearer,
Whose guard recks not of tree or grass
To blaze the way that he may pass.
What if my heart be in the blast
That heralds his triumphant way;
Shall I repine, shall I not say:
"Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!"

In life, each heart holds some sad story--
The saddest ones are never told.
I too, have dreamed of fame and glory,
And viewed the future bright with gold;
But that is as a tale long told.
Mine eyes have lost their youthful flash,
My cunning hand has lost its art;
I am not old, but in my heart
The ember lies beneath the ash.

I loved! Why not? My heart was youthfu],
My mind was filled with healthy thought.
He doubts not whose own self is truthful,
Doubt by dishonesty is taught;
So loved I boldly, fearing naught.
I did not walk this lowly earth;
Mine was a newer, higher sphere,
Where youth was long and life was dear,
And all save love was little worth.

Her likeness! Would that I might limn it,
As Love did with enduring art;
Nor dust of days, nor death may dim it,
Where it lies graven on my heart,
Of this sad fabric of my life a part.
I would that I might paint her now
As I beheld her in that day,
Ere her first bloom had passed away,
And left the lines upon her brow.

A face serene that, beaming brightly,
Disarmed the hot sun's glances bold.
A foot that kissed the ground so lightly,
He frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,
But loved her still though he was old.
A form where every maiden grace
Bloomed to perfection's richest flow'r,--
The statued pose of conscious pow'r,
Like lithe-limbed Dian's of the chase.

Beneath a brow too fair for frowning,
Like moon-lit deeps that glass the skies
Till all the hosts above seem drowning,
Looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,
With gaze serene and purely wise.
And over all, her tresses rare,
Which, when with his desire grown weak,
The Night bent down to kiss her cheek,
Entrapped and held him captive there.

This was Ione; a spirit finer
Ne'er burned to ash its house of clay;
A soul instinct with fire diviner
Ne'er fled athwart the face of day,
And tempted Time with earthly stay.
Her loveliness was not alone
Of face and form and tresses' hue;
For aye a pure, high soul shone through
Her every act: this was Ione.

Part II

'Twas in the radiant summer weather,
When God looked, smiling, from the sky;
And we went wand'ring much together
By wood and lane, Ione and I,
Attracted by the subtle tie
Of common thoughts and common tastes,
Of eyes whose vision saw the same,
And freely granted beauty's claim,
Where others saw but worthless wastes.

We paused to hear the far bells ringing
Across the distance, sweet and clear.
We listened to the wild bird singing
The song he meant for his mate's ear,
And deemed our chance to do so, dear.
We loved to watch the warrior Sun,
With flaming shield and flaunting crest,
Go striding down the gory West,
When Day's long fight was fought and won.

And life became a different story,
Where'er I looked, I saw new light.
Earth's self assumed a greater glory,
Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.
Then first I saw the need and might
Of that fair band, the singing throng,
Who, gifted with the skill, divine,
Take up the threads of life, spun fine,
And weave them into soulful song.

They sung for me, whose passion pressing
My soul, found vent in song nor line.
They bore the burden of expressing
All that I felt, with art's design,
And every word of theirs was mine.
I read them to Ione, ofttimes,
By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,
And she looked deeply in mine eyes,
And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.

Her life was like the stream that floweth,
And mine was like the waiting sea;
Her love was like the flower that bloweth,
And mine was like the searching bee--
I found her sweetness all for me.
God plied him in the mint of time,
And coined for us a golden day,
And rolled it ringing down life's way
With love's sweet music in its chime.

And God unclasped the Book of Ages,
And laid it open to our sight;
Upon the dimness of its pages,
So long consigned to rayless night,
He shed the glory of his light.
We read them well, we read them long,
And ever thrilling did we see
That love ruled all humanity,--
The master passion, pure and strong.

Part III

To-day my skies are bare and ashen,
And bend on me without a beam.
Since love is held the master-passion,
Its loss must be the pain supreme--
And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.
But pardon, dear departed Guest,
I will not rant, I will not rail;
For good the grain must feel the flail;
There are whom love has never blessed.

I had and have a younger brother,
One whom I loved and love to-day
As never fond and doting mother
Adored the babe who found its way
From heavenly scenes into her day.
Oh, he was full of youth's new wine,--
A man on life's ascending slope,
Flushed with ambition, full of hope;
And every wish of his was mine.

A kingly youth; the way before him
Was thronged with victories to be won;
So joyous, too, the heavens o'er him
Were bright with an unchanging sun,--
His days with rhyme were overrun.
Toil had not taught him Nature's prose,
Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,
And sorrow had not made him wise;
His life was in the budding rose.

I know not how I came to waken,
Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;
My heart by some vague thrill was shaken,--
A thrill so true and yet so slight,
I hardly deemed I read aright.
As when a sleeper, ign'rant why,
Not knowing what mysterious hand
Has called him out of slumberland,
Starts up to find some danger nigh.

Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,
But, having come, asserts his right,
He will not be repressed nor hidden.
And so my brother's dawning plight
Became uncovered to my sight.
Some sound mote in his passing tone,
Caught in the meshes of my ear;
Some little glance, a shade too dear
Betrayed the love he bore Ione.

What could I do? He was my brother,
And young, and full of hope and trust;
I could not, dared not try to smother
His flame, and turn his heart to dust.
I knew how oft life gives a crust
To starving men who cry for bread;
But he was young, so few his days,
He had not learned the great world's ways,
Nor Disappointment's volumes read.

However fair and rich the booty,
I could not make his loss my gain.
For love is dear, but dearer, duty,
And here my way was clear and plain.
I saw how I could save him pain.
And so, with all my day grown dim,
That this loved brother's sun might shine,
I joined his suit, gave over mine,
And sought Ione, to plead for him.

I found her in an eastern bower,
Where all day long the am'rous sun
Lay by to woo a timid flower.
This day his course was well nigh run,
But still with lingering art he spun
Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.
The vines waved soft and green above,
And there where one might tell his love,
I told my pangs--I told her all.

I told her all and as she hearkened,
A tear-drop fell upon her dress.
With grief her flushing brow was darkened;
One sob that she could not repress
Betrayed the depths of her distress.
Upon her grief my sorrow fed,
And I was bowed with unlived years,
My heart swelled with a sea of tears,
The tears my manhood could not shed.

The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,
Disporting in the hour of doom.
God made us men; times make the hero--
But in that awful space of gloom,

I gave no thought but sorrow's room.
All--all was dim within that bow'r,
What time the sun divorced the day;
And all the shadows, glooming gray,
Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.

She could not speak--no word was needed;
Her look, half strength and half despair,
Told me I had not vainly pleaded,
That she would not ignore my prayer.
And so she turned and left me there,
And as she went, so passed my bliss;
She loved me, I could not mistake--
But for her own and my love's sake,
Her womanhood could rise to this.

My wounded heart fled swift to cover,
And life at times seemed very drear.
My brother proved an ardent lover--
What had so young a man to fear?
He wed Ione within the year.
No shadow clouds her tranquil brow,
Men speak her husband's name with pride,
While she sits honored at his side--
She is--she must be happy now!

I doubt the course I took no longer,
Since those I love seem satisfied.
The bond between them will grow stronger
As they go forward, side by side;
Then will my pains be justified.
Their joy is mine, and that is best--
I am not totally bereft;
For I have still the mem'ry left--
Love stopped with me--a Royal Guest!
 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS

A hush is over all the teeming lists,
And there is pause, a breath-space in the strife;
A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists
And vapors that obscure the sun of life.
And Ethiopia, with bosom torn,
Laments the passing of her noblest born.

She weeps for him a mother's burning tears--
She loved him with a mother's deepest love
He was her champion thro' direful years,
And held her weal all other ends above.
When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust,
He raised her up and whispered, "Hope and Trust."

For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung
That broke in warning on the ears of men;
For her the strong bow of his pow'r he strung
And sent his arrows to the very den
Where grim Oppression held his bloody place
And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.

And he was no soft-tongued apologist;
He spoke straight-forward, fearlessly uncowed;
The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist
And set in bold relief each dark-hued cloud;
To sin and crime he gave their proper hue,
And hurled at evil what was evil's due.

Thro' good and ill report he cleaved his way
Right onward, with his face set toward the heights,
Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array--
The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites.
He dared the lightning in the lightning's track,
And answered thunder with his thunder back.

When men maligned him and their torrent wrath
In furious imprecations o'er him broke,
He kept his counsel as he kept his path;
'Twas for his race, not for himself, he spoke.
He knew the import of his Master's call
And felt himself too mighty to be small.

No miser in the good he held was he--
His kindness followed his horizon's rim.
His heart, his talents and his hands were free
To all who truly needed aught of him.
Where poverty and ignorance were rife,
He gave his bounty as he gave his life.

The place and cause that first aroused his might
Still proved its pow'r until his latest day.
In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right
Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray;
Wrong lived; His occupation was not gone.
He died in action with his armor on!

We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,
And felt the magic of his presence nigh,
The current that he sent thro'out the land,
The kindling spirit of his battle-cry
O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet
And place our banner where his hopes were set!

Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,
But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale!
Thou'st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar
And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.
She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,
She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,
And rising from beneath the chast'ning rod,
She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!

 
THE CHANGE HAS COME

The change has come, and Helen sleeps--
Not sleeps; but wakes to greater deeps
Of wisdom, glory, truth and light,
That ever blessed her seeking sight,
In this low, long, lethargic night,
Worn out with strife
Which men call life.

The change has come, and who would say?
"I would it were not come to-day."
What were the respite till to-morrow--
Postponement of a certain sorrow,
From which each passing day would borrow?
Let grief be dumb,
The change has come.

 
A MADRIGAL

Dream days of fond delight and hours,
As rosy-hued as dawn, are mine.
Love's drowsy wine,
Brewed from the heart of Passion flowers,
Flows warmly o'er my lips
And save thee, all the world is in eclipse.

There were no light if thou wert not;
The sun would be too sad too shine,
And all the line
Of hours from dawn would be a blot;
And Night would haunt the skies,
An unlaid ghost with staring dark-ringed eyes.

Oh, love if thou wert not my love,
And I perchance not thine--what then?
Could gift of men
Or favor of the God above,
Plant ought in this bare heart
Or teach this tongue the singer's soulful art?

Ah, no! 'Tis love, and love alone
That spurs my soul so surely on;
Turns night to dawn,
And thorns to roses fairest blown;
And winter drear to spring--
Oh were it not for love I could not sing!

 
WE WEAR THE MASK

We wear the mask that grins and lies,
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--
This debt we pay to human guile;
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile
And mouth with myriad subtleties,

Why should the world be over-wise.
In counting all our tears and sighs?
Nay, let them only see us, while
We wear the mask.

We smile, but oh great Christ, our cries
To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile,
But let the world dream otherwise,
We wear the mask!

 
THE POET AND HIS SONG

A song is but a little thing,
And yet what joy it is to sing.
In hours of toil it gives me zest,
And when at eve I long for rest;
When cows come home along the bars,
And in the fold I hear the bell,
As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,
I sing my song and all is well.

There are no ears to hear my lays,
No lips to lift a word of praise;
But still with faith unfaltering,
I live and laugh and love and sing.
What matters yon unheeding throng?
They cannot feel my spirit's spell,
Since life is sweet and love is long,
I sing my song and all is well.

My days are never days of ease,
I till my ground and prune my trees.
When ripened gold is all the plain,
I put my sickle to the grain.
I labor hard and toil and sweat,
While others dream within the dell;
But even while my brow is wet,
I sing my song and all is well.

Sometimes the sun, unkindly hot,
My garden makes a desert spot.
Sometimes a blight upon the tree
Takes all my fruit away from me;
And then with throes of bitter pain
Rebellious passions rise and swell;
But--life is more than fruit or grain,
And so I sing, and all is well.

 
ODE TO ETHIOPIA

O Mother Race! to thee I bring
This pledge of faith unwavering,
This tribute to thy glory.
I know the pangs which thou didst feel,
When Slavery crushed thee with its heel,
With thy dear blood all gory.

Sad days were those--ah, sad indeed!
But through the land the fruitful seed
Of better times was growing.
The plant of freedom upward sprung,
And spread its leaves so fresh and young--
Its blossoms now are blowing.

On every hand in this fair land,
Proud Ethiope's swarthy children stand
Beside their fairer neighbor;
The forests flee before their stroke,
Their hammers ring, their forges smoke,--
They stir in honest labor.

They tread the fields where honor calls;
Their voices sound through senate halls
In majesty and power.
To right they cling; the hymns they sing
Up to the skies in beauty ring,
And bolder grow each hour.

Be proud, my Race, in mind and soul;
Thy name is writ on Glory's scroll
In characters of fire.
High 'mid the clouds of Fame's bright sky
Thy banner's blazoned folds now fly,
And truth shall lift them higher.

Thou hast the right to noble pride,
Whose spotless robes were purified
By blood's severe baptism.
Upon thy brow the cross was laid,
And labor's painful sweat-beads made
A consecrating chrism.

No other race, or white or black,
When bound, as thou wert, to the rack,
So seldom stooped to grieving;
No other race, when free again,
Forgot the past and proved them men
So noble in forgiving.

Go on and up! Our souls and eyes
Shall follow thy continuous rise;
Our ears shall list thy story
From bards who from thy root shall spring,
And proudly tune their lyres to sing
Of Ethiopia's glory.

 
A DROWSY DAY

The air is dark, the sky is gray,
The misty shadows come and go,
And here within my dusky room
Each chair looks ghostly in the gloom.
Outside the rain falls cold and slow,--
Half-stinging drops, half-blinding spray.

Each slightest sound is magnified,
For drowsy quiet holds her reign;
The burnt stick on the fireplace breaks,
The nodding cat with start awakes,
And then to sleep drops off again,
Unheeding Towser at her side.

I look far out across the lawn,
Where huddled stand the silly sheep;
My work lies idle at my hands,
My thoughts fly out like scattered strands
Of thread, and on the verge of sleep--
Still half awake--I dream and yawn.

What spirits rise before my eyes!
How various of kind and form!
Sweet memories of days long past,
The dreams of youth that could not last,
Each smiling calm, each raging storm,
That swept across my early skies.

Half seen, the bare, gaunt-fingered boughs
Before my window sweep and sway,
And chafe in tortures of unrest.
My chin sinks down upon my breast;
I cannot work on such a day,
But only sit and dream and drowse.

 
THE SPARROW

A little bird, with plumage brown,
Beside my window flutters down,
A moment chirps its little strain,
Then taps upon my window pane,
And chirps again, and hops along,
To call my notice to its song;
But I work on, nor heed its lay,
Till, in neglect, it flies away.

So birds of peace and hope and love
Come fluttering earthward from above,
To settle on life's window sills,
And ease our load of earthly ills;
But we, in traffic's rush and din
Too deep engaged to let them in,
With deadened heart and sense plod on,
Nor know our loss till they are gone.

 
SUNSET

The river sleeps beneath the sky,
And clasps the shadows to its breast;
The crescent moon shines dim on high;
And in the lately radiant west
The gold is fading into gray.
Now stills the lark his festive lay
And mourns with me the dying day,--

While in the south the first faint star
Lifts to the night its silver face,
And twinkles to the moon afar
Across the heaven's graying space;
Low murmurs reach me from the town,
As Day puts on her sombre crown,
And shakes her mantle darkly down.

 
COLUMBIAN ODE

I

Four hundred years ago a tangled waste
Lay sleeping on the west Atlantic side;
Their devious ways the Old World's millions traced
Content, and loved, and labored, dared and died,
While students still believed the charts they conned,
And wallowed in their thriftless ignorance,
Nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond
Old Ocean's dense, indefinite expanse.

II

But deep within her heart old Nature knew
That she had once arrayed, at Earth's behest,
Another offspring, fine and fair to view,--
The chosen suckling of the mother's breast.
The child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine,
Each fold a work of Nature's matchless art;
The mother looked on it with love divine,
And strained the loved one closely to her heart.
And there it lay, and with the warmth grew strong
And hearty, by the salt sea breezes fanned,
Till Time with mellowing touches passed along,
And changed the infant to a mighty land.

III

But men knew naught of this, till there arose
That mighty mariner, the Genoese,
Who dared to try, in spite of fears and foes,
The unknown fortunes of unsounded seas.
O noblest of Italia's sons, thy bark
Went not alone into that shrouding night.
O dauntless darer of the rayless dark,
The world sailed with thee to eternal light.
The deer-haunts that with game were crowded then
To-day are tilled and cultivated lands;
The schoolhouse tow'rs where bruin had his den,
And where the wigwam stood the chapel stands;
The place that nurtured men of savage mien
Now teems with men of Nature's noblest types;
Where moved the forest-foliage banner green,
Now flutters in the breeze the stars and stripes!

October 21, 1892


 
THE MEADOW LARK

Though the winds be dank,
And the sky be sober,
And the grieving day
In a mantle gray
Hath let her waiting maiden robe her,--
All the fields along
I can hear the song
Of the meadow lark,
As she flits and flutters,
And laughs at the thunder when it mutters.
O happy bird, of heart most gay
To sing when skies are gray!

When the clouds are full,
And the tempest master
Lets the loud winds sweep
From his bosom deep
Like heralds of some dire disaster,
Then the heart, alone,
To itself makes moan;
And the songs come slow,
While the tears fall fleeter,
And silence than song by far seems sweeter.
Oh, few are they along the way
Who sing when skies are gray!

 
THE SEEDLING

As a quiet little seedling
Lay within its darksome bed,
To itself it fell a talking,
And this is what it said:

"I am not so very robust,
But I 'll do the best I can";
And the seedling from that moment
Its work of life began.

So it pushed a little leaflet
Up into the light of day,
To examine the surroundings
And show the rest the way.

The leaflet liked the prospect,
So it called its brother, Stem;
Then two other leaflets heard it,
And quickly followed them.

To be sure, the haste and hurry
Made the seedling sweat and pant;
But almost before it knew it
It found itself a plant.

The sunshine poured upon it,
And the clouds they gave a shower;
And the little plant kept growing
Till it found itself a flower.

Little folks, be like the seedling,
Always do the best you can;
Every child must share life's labor
Just as well as every man.

And the sun and showers will help you
Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
Till you raise to light and beauty
Virtue's fair, unfading flowers.


 
LIFE

A crust of bread and a corner to sleep in,
A minute to smile and an hour to weep in,
A pint of joy to a peck of trouble,
And never a laugh but the moans come double;
And that is life!

A crust and a corner that love makes precious,
With the smile to warm and the tears to refresh us;
And joy seems sweeter when cares come after,
And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter;
And that is life!

 
CHANGING TIME

The cloud looked in at the window,
And said to the day, "Be dark!"
And the roguish rain tapped hard on the pane,
To stifle the song of the lark.

The wind sprang up in the tree tops
And shrieked with a voice of death,
But the rough-voiced breeze, that shook the trees,
Was touched with a violet's breath.


 
WHY FADES A DREAM?

Why fades a dream?
An iridescent ray
Flecked in between the tryst
Of night and day.
Why fades a dream?--
Of consciousness the shade
Wrought out by lack of light and made
Upon life's stream.
Why fades a dream?

That thought may thrive,
So fades the fleshless dream;
Lest men should learn to trust
The things that seem.
So fades a dream,
That living thought may grow
And like a waxing star-beam glow
Upon life's stream--
So fades a dream.

 
THE SECRET

What says the wind to the waving trees?
What says the wave to the river?
What means the sigh in the passing breeze?
Why do the rushes quiver?
Have you not heard the fainting cry
Of the flowers that said "Good-bye, good-bye?"

List how the gray dove moans and grieves
Under the woodland cover;
List to the drift of the falling leaves,
List to the wail of the lover.
Have you not caught the message heard
Already by wave and breeze and bird?

Come, come away to the river's bank,
Come in the early morning;
Come when the grass with dew is dank,
There you will find the warning--
A hint in the kiss of the quickening air
Of the secret that birds and breezes bear.


 
HE HAD HIS DREAM

He had his dream, and all through life
Worked up to it through toil and strife.
Afloat fore'er before his eyes,
It colored for him all his skies:
The storm-cloud dark
Above his barque,
The calm and listless vault of blue
Took on its hopeful hue,
It tinctured every golden beam--
He had his dream.

He labored hard and failed at last,
His sails too weak to bear the blast,
The raging tempests tore away
And sent his beating barque astray.
But what cared he
For wind or sea!
He said, "The tempest will be short,
My barque will come to port."
He saw through every cloud a gleam--
He had his dream.


 
A CREED AND NOT A CREED

To J. E. Iliff

I am no priest of crooks nor creeds,
For human wants and human needs
Are more to me than prophets' deeds;
And human tears and human cares
Affect me more than human prayers.

Go, cease your wail, lugubrious saint!
You fret high Heaven with your plaint.
Is this the "Christian's joy" you paint?
Is this the Christian's boasted bliss?
Avails your faith no more than this?

Take up your arms, come out with me,
Let Heav'n alone; humanity
Needs more and Heaven less from thee.
With pity for mankind look 'round;
Help them to rise--and Heaven is found.


 
BEYOND THE YEARS

I

Beyond the years the answer lies,
Beyond where brood the grieving skies
And Night drops tears.
Where Faith rod-chastened smiles to rise
And doff its fears,
And carping Sorrow pines and dies--
Beyond the years.

II

Beyond the years, the prayer for rest
Shall beat no more within the breast;
The darkness clears,
And Morn perched on the mountain's crest
Her form uprears--
The day that is to come is best,
Beyond the years.

III

Beyond the years, the soul shall find
That endless peace for which it pined,
For light appears,
And to the eyes that still were blind
With blood and tears,
Their sight shall come all unconfined
Beyond the years.


 
DIRGE

Place this bunch of mignonette
In her cold, dead hand;
When the golden sun is set,
Where the poplars stand,
Bury her from sun and day,
Lay my little love away
From my sight.

She was like a modest flower
Blown in sunny June,
Warm as sun at noon's high hour,
Chaster than the moon.
Ah, her day was brief and bright,
Earth has lost a star of light.
She is dead.

Softly breathe her name to me,
Ah, I loved her so.
Gentle let your tribute be,
None may better know
Her true worth than I who weep
O'er her as she lies asleep--
Soft asleep.

Lay these lilies on her breast,
They are not more white
Than the soul of her, at rest
'Neath their petals bright.
Chant your aves soft and low,
Solemn be your tread and slow,--
She is dead.

Lay her here beneath the grass,
Cool and green and sweet,
Where the gentle brook may pass
Crooning at her feet.
Nature's bards shall come and sing,
And the fairest flowers shall spring
Where she lies.

Safe above the waters swirl,
She has crossed the bar;
Earth has lost a precious pearl,
Heaven has gained a star,
That shall ever sing and shine,
Till it quells this grief of mine
For my love.


 
THE COLORED SOLDIERS

If the muse were mine to tempt it
And my feeble voice were strong,
If my tongue were trained to measures,
I would sing a stirring song.
I would sing a song heroic
Of those noble sons of Ham,
Of the gallant colored soldiers
Who fought for Uncle Sam!

In the early days you scorned them,
And with many a flip and flout,
Said "these battles are the white man's
And the whites will fight them out."
Up the hills you fought and faltered,
In the vales you strove and bled,
While your ears still heard the thunder
Of the foes' increasing tread.

Then distress fell on the nation
And the flag was drooping low;
Should the dust pollute your banner?
No! the nation shouted, No!
So when war, in savage triumph,
Spread abroad his funeral pall--
Then you called the colored soldiers,
And they answered to your call.

And like hounds unleashed and eager
For the life blood of the prey,
Sprung they forth and bore them bravely
In the thickest of the fray.
And where'er the fight was hottest,--
Where the bullets fastest fell,
There they pressed unblanched and fearless
At the very mouth of hell.

Ah, they rallied to the standard
To uphold it by their might,
None were stronger in the labors,
None were braver in the fight.
At Forts Donelson and Henry
On the plains of Olustee,
They were foremost in the fight
Of the battles of the free.

And at Pillow! God have mercy
On the deeds committed there,
And the souls of those poor victims
Sent to Thee without a prayer.
Let the fulness of thy pity
O'er the hot wrought spirits sway,
Of the gallant colored soldier
Who fell fighting on that day!

Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom,
And they won it dearly, too;
For the life blood of their thousands
Did the southern fields bedew.
In the darkness of their bondage,
In the depths of slavery's night;
Their muskets flashed the dawning
And they fought their way to light.

They were comrades then and brothers,
Are they more or less to-day?
They were good to stop a bullet
And to front the fearful fray.
They were citizens and soldiers,
When rebellion raised its head;
And the traits that made them worthy,--
Ah! those virtues are not dead.

They have shared your nightly vigils,
They have shared your daily toil;
And their blood with yours commingling
Has made rich the Southern soil.
They have slept and marched and suffered
'Neath the same dark skies as you,
They have met as fierce a foeman,
And have been as brave and true.

And their deeds shall find a record,
In the registry of Fame;
For their blood has cleansed completely
Every blot of Slavery's shame.
So all honor and all glory
To those noble Sons of Ham--
The gallant colored soldiers,
Who fought for Uncle Sam!


 
DEAD

A knock is at her door, but she is weak;
Strange dews have washed the paint streaks from her cheeks;
She does not rise, but, ah, this friend is known,
And knows that he will find her all alone.
So opens he the door, and with soft tread,
Goes straightway to the richly curtained bed.
His soft hand on her dewy head he lays.
A strange white light she gives him for his gaze.
Then, looking on the glory of her charms,
He crushes her resistless in his arms.

Stand back! look not upon this bold embrace,
Nor view the calmness of the wanton's face,
With joy unspeakable and 'bated breath,
She keeps her last, long, liaison with death!


 
TO THE MEMORY OF MARY YOUNG

God has his plans, and what if we,
With our sight be too blind to see
Their full fruition; can not He,
Who made it, solve the mystery?
One whom we loved has fall'n asleep,
Not died; although her calm be deep.
Some new, unknown and strange surprise
In Heaven holds enrapt her eyes.

And can you blame her that her gaze
Is turned away from earthly ways,
When to her eyes God's light and love
Have giv'n the view of things above?
A gentle spirit sweetly good,
The pearl of precious womanhood;
Who heard the voice of duty clear,
And found her mission soon and near.

She loved all nature, flowers fair,
The warmth of sun, the kiss of air,
The birds that filled the sky with song,
The stream that laughed its way along.
Her home to her was shrine and throne,
But one love held her not alone;
She sought out poverty and grief,
Who touched her robe and found relief.

So sped she in her Master's work,
Too busy and too brave to shirk,
When through the silence, dusk and dim,
God called her and she fled to him.
We wonder at the early call,
And tears of sorrow can but fall
For her o'er whom we spread the pall;
But faith, sweet faith is over all.

The house is dust, the voice is dumb,
But through undying years to come,
The spark that glowed within her soul
Shall light our footsteps to the goal.
She went her way; but oh, she trod
The path that led her straight to God.
Such lives as this put death to scorn;
They lose our day to find God's morn.


 
COMPARISON

The sky of brightest gray seems dark
To one whose sky was ever white.
To one who never knew a spark,
Thro' all his life, of love or light,
The grayest cloud seems over bright.

The robin sounds a beggar's note
Where one the nightingale has heard,
But he, for whom no silver throat,
Its liquid music ever stirred,

 
BY THE STREAM

By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass,
How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass,
And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads,
Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads.

And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go,
For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show,
And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wonderous mysteries,
When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.


 
CONSCIENCE AND REMORSE

"Goodbye," I said to my conscience--
"Goodbye for aye and aye,"
And I put her hands off harshly,
And turned my face away,
And conscience smitten sorely
Returned not from that day.

But a time came when my spirit
Grew weary of its pace;
And I cried: "Come back, my conscience,
I long to see thy face."
But conscience cried: "I cannot,
Remorse sits in my place."


 
THE LOVER AND THE MOON

A lover whom duty called over the wave,
With himself communed: "Will my love be true
If left to herself? Had I better not sue
Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?
"But my friend might fail in my need," he said,
And I return to find love dead.
Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,
I will leave her in charge of the stable moon.

Then he said to the moon: "O dear old moon,
Who for years and years from thy throne above
Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,
My heart has but come to its waiting June,
And the promise time of the budding vine;
Oh guard thee well this love of mine.
And he harked him then while all was still,
And the pale moon answered and said "I will."

And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,
And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:
In isles of the south and in Orient lands,
Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.
But his star was high, so he braved the main,
And sailed him blithely home again;
And with joy he bended his footsteps soon
To learn of his love from the matron moon.

She sat as of yore, in her olden place,
Serene as death, in her silver chair.
A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,
And the tint of a blush was on her face.
At sight of the youth she sadly bowed
And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.
She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,
But "how," spoke the youth, "have you kept your charge?"

The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;
The blush went out in her blanching cheek,
And her voice was timid and low and weak,
As she made her plea and sighed and wept.
"Oh another prayed and another plead,
And I couldn't resist," she answering said,
"But love still grows in the hearts of men,
Go forth dear youth and love again."

But he turned him away from her proffered grace.
"Thou art false, Oh moon, as the hearts of men,
I will not, will not love again."
And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face,
To the sea, and cried: "Sea, curse the moon,
Who makes her vows and forgets so soon."
And the awful sea with anger stirred,
And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.

And ever the moon wept down in rain,
And ever her sighs rose high in wind:
But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,
And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.
And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,
The cries of a wraith through the thunders pierce:
And the waves strain their awful hands on high
To tear the false moon from the sky.


 
SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT

Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing,
I look far out into the pregnant night
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
And catch the gleaming of a random light,
That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.

My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips
And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.

Oh Earth, oh Sky, oh Ocean, both surpassing,
Oh heart of mine, Oh soul that dreads the dark!
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
That I may sight and check that speeding bark,
Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?


 
NATURE AND ART

To my friend, Charles Booth Nettleton

I

The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair,
Once on a time fell upon evil days.
From hearing oft herself discussed with praise,
There grew within her heart the longing rare
To see herself; and every passing air
The warm desire fanned into lusty blaze.
Full oft she sought this end by devious ways,
But sought in vain, so fell she in despair.

For none within her train nor by her side
Could solve the task or give the envied boon.
So day and night, beneath the sun and moon,
She wandered to and fro unsatisfied,
Till Art came by, a blithe inventive elf,
And made a glass wherein she saw herself.

II

Enrapt, the queen gazed on her glorious self,
Then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought,
Commanded that the skillful wight be brought
That she might dower him with lands and pelf.
Then out upon the silent sea-lapt shelf
And up the hills and on the downs they sought
Him who so well and wondrously had wrought;
And with much search found and brought home the elf,
But he put by all gifts with sad replies
And from his lips these words flowed forth like wine:
"Oh, queen, I want no gift but thee," he said.
She heard and looked on him with love-lit eyes,
Gave him her hand, low murmuring, "I am thine,"
And at the morrow's dawning they were wed.


 
PREMONITION

Dear heart, good-night!
Nay, list awhile that sweet voice singing
When the world is all so bright,
And the sound of song sets the heart a-ringing,
Oh, love, it is not right--
Not then to say, "good-night."

Dear heart, good-night!
The late winds in the lake weeds shiver,
And the spray flies cold and white.
And the voice that sings gives a tell-tale quiver--
"Ah, yes, the world is bright,
But, dearest heart, good-night!"

Dear heart, good-night!
And do not longer seek to hold me!
For my soul is in affright
As the fearful glooms in their pall enfold me.
See him who sang how white
And still, so dear, good-night.

Dear heart, good-night!
Thy hand I'll press no more forever,
And mine eyes shall lose the light:
For the great white wraith by the winding river
Shall check my steps with might.
So, dear, good-night, good-night!


 
ODE FOR MEMORIAL DAY

Done are the toils and the wearisome marches,
Done is the summons of bugle and drum.
Softly and sweetly the sky over-arches,
Shelt'ring a land where Rebellion is dumb.
Dark were the days of the country's derangement,
Sad were the hours when the conflict was on,
But through the gloom of fraternal estrangement
God sent his light, and we welcome the dawn.
O'er the expanse of our mighty dominions,
Sweeping away to the uttermost parts,
Peace, the wide-flying, on untiring pinions,
Bringeth her message of joy to our hearts.

Ah, but this joy which our minds cannot measure,
What did it cost for our fathers to gain!
Bought at the price of the heart's dearest treasure,
Born out of travail and sorrow and pain;
Born in the battle where fleet Death was flying,
Slaying with sabre stroke bloody and fell:
Born where the heroes and martyrs were dying,
Torn by the fury of bullet and shell.
Ah, but the day is past: silent the rattle,
And the confusion that followed the fight,
Peace to the heroes who died in the battle,
Martyrs to truth and the crowning of Right!

Out of the blood of a conflict fraternal,
Out of the dust and the dimness of death,
Burst into blossoms of glory eternal
Flowers that sweeten the world with their breath.
Flowers of charity, peace, and devotion
Bloom in the hearts that are empty of strife;
Love that is boundless and broad as the ocean
Leaps into beauty and fullness of life.
So with the singing of pæans and chorals,
And with the flag flashing high in the sun,
Place on the graves of our heroes the laurels
Which their unfaltering valor has won!

 
THE RISING OF THE STORM

The lake's dark breast
Is all unrest,
It heaves with a sob and a sigh.
Like a tremulous bird,
From its slumber stirred,
The moon is a-tilt in the sky.

From the silent deep
The waters sweep,
But faint on the cold white stones,
And the wavelets fly
With a plaintive cry
O'er the old earth's bare, bleak bones.

And the spray upsprings
On its ghost-white wings,
And tosses a kiss at the stars;
While a water sprite,
In sea-pearls dight,
Hums a sea hymn's solemn bars.

Far out in the night,
On the wavering sight
I see a dark hull loom;
And its light on high,
Like a Cyclops' eye,
Shines out through the mist and gloom.

Now the winds well up
From the earth's deep cup,
And fall the sea and shore,
And against the pier
The waters rear
And break with a sullen roar.

Up comes the gale,
And the mist-wrought veil
Gives way to the lightning's glare,
And the cloud-drifts fall,
A sombre pall
O'er water, earth, and air.

The storm-king flies,
His whip he plies,
And bellows down the wind.
The lightning rash
With blinding flash
Comes pricking on behind.

Rise, waters, rise,
And taunt the skies
With your swift-flitting form.
Sweep, wild winds, sweep,
And tear the deep
To atoms in the storm.

And the waters leapt,
And the wild winds swept,
And blew out the moon in the sky,
And I laughed with glee,
It was joy to me
As the storm went raging by!


 
PASSION AND LOVE

A maiden wept and, as a comforter,
Came one who cried, "I love thee," and he seized
Her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath,
That dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks.
While ever more his boldly blazing eye
Burned into hers; but she uncomforted
Shrank from his arms and only wept the more.

Then one came and gazed mutely in her face
With wide and wistful eyes; but still aloof
He held himself; as with a reverent fear,
As one who knows some sacred presence nigh.
And as she wept he mingled tear with tear
That cheered her soul like dew a dusty flow'r,--
Until she smiled, approached, and touched his hand!


 
A BORDER BALLAD

Oh, I haven't got long to live, for we all
Die soon, e'en those who live longest;
And the poorest and weakest are taking their chance
Along with the richest and strongest.
So its heigho for a glass and a song,
And a bright eye over the table,
And a dog for the hunt when the game is flush,
And the pick of a gentleman's stable.

There is Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yesternight,
But he's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh;
'Twas the hand o' MacPherson that gave him the blow,
And the vultures shall feast on his marrow.
But its heigho for a brave old song
And a glass while we are able;
Here's a health to death and another cup
To the bright eye over the table.

I can show a broad back and a jolly deep chest,
But who argues now on appearance?
A blow or a thrust or a stumble at best
May send me to-day to my clearance.
Then its heigho for the things I love,
My mother'll be soon wearing sable,
But give me my horse and my dog and my glass,
And a bright eye over the table.


 
IF

If life were but a dream, my Love,
And death the waking time;
If day had not a beam, my Love,
And night had not a rhyme;
A barren, barren world were this
Without one saving gleam
I'd only ask that with a kiss
You'd wake me from the dream.

If dreaming were the sum of days,
And loving were the bane;
If battling for a wreath of bays
Could soothe a heart in pain;
I'd scorn the meed of battle's might,
All other aims above
I'd choose the human's higher right,
To suffer and to love !


 
A CORN-SONG

On the wide veranda white,
In the purple failing light,
Sits the master while the sun is lowly burning;
And his dreamy thoughts are drowned
In the softly flowing sound
Of the corn-songs of the field-hands slow returning.

Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.

O'er the fields with heavy tread,
Light of heart and high of head,--
Tho' the halting steps be labored, slow, and weary;
Still the spirits brave and strong
Find a comforter in song,
And their corn-song rises ever loud and cheery.

Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.

To the master in his seat,
Comes the burden, full and sweet,
Of the mellow minor music growing clearer;
As the toilers raise the hymn,
Thro' the silence dusk and dim,
To the cabin's restful shelter drawing nearer.

Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.

And a tear is in the eye
Of the master sitting by,
As he listens to the echoes low-replying
To the music's fading calls
As it faints away and falls
Into silence, deep within the cabin dying.

Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.


 
RETROSPECTION

When you and I were young, the days
Were filled with scent of pink and rose,
And full of joy from dawn till close,
From morning's mist till evening's haze.
And when the robin sung his song
The verdant woodland ways along,
We whistled louder than he sung.
And school was joy, and work was sport
For which the hours were all too short,
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, the woods
Brimmed bravely o'er with every joy
To charm the happy-hearted boy.
The quail turned out her timid broods;
The prickly copse, a hostess fine,
Held high black cups of harmless wine;
And low the laden grape-vine swung
With beads of night-kissed amethyst
Where buzzing lovers held their tryst,
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, the cool
And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows
When tumbling o'er the scented mows,
Or stripping by the dimpling pool,
Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face,
Save where we'd worn an ent'ring place.
How with our shouts the calm banks rung!
How flashed the spray as we plunged in--
Pure gems that never caused a sin!
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, we heard
All sounds of Nature with delight,
The whirr of wing in sudden flight,
The chirping of the baby-bird.
The columbine's red bells were rung;
The locust's vested chorus sung;
While every wind his zithern strung
To high and holy-sounding keys,
And played sonatas in the trees--
When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young.

When you and I were young, we knew
To shout and laugh, to work and play,
And night was partner to the day
In all our joys. So swift time flew
On silent wings that, ere we wist,
The fleeting years had fled unmissed;
And from our hearts this cry was wrung--
To fill with fond regret and tears
The days of our remaining years--
"When you and I were young, my boy,
When you and I were young."


 
NOT THEY WHO SOAR

Not they who soar, but they who plod
Their rugged way, unhelped to God
Are heroes; they who higher fare,
And flying, fan the upper air,
Miss all the toil that hugs the sod.
'Tis they whose backs have felt the rod,
Whose feet have pressed the path unshod,
May smile upon defeated care,
Not they who soar.

High up there are no thorns to prod,
Nor boulders lurking 'neath the clod
To turn the keenness of the share;
For flight is ever free and rare;
But heroes, they the soil who've trod,
Not they who soar!


 
THE MASTER-PLAYER

An old, worn harp that had been play'd
Till all its strings were loose and fray'd,
Joy, Hate and Fear, each one essay'd,
To play. But each in turn had found
No sweet responsiveness of sound.

Then Love the Master-Player came
With heaving breast and eyes aflame;
The Harp he took all undismayed,
Smote on its strings, still strange to song.
And brought forth music sweet and strong.



 
AFTER THE QUARREL

So we, who've supped the self-same cup,
To-night must lay our friendship by;
Your wrath has burned your judgment up,
Hot breath has blown the ashes high.
You say that you are wronged--ah, well,
I count that friendship poor, at best--
A bauble, a mere bagatelle,
That cannot stand so slight a test.

I fain would still have been your friend
And talked and laughed and loved with you,
But since it must, why, let it end;
The false but dies, 'tis not the true.
So we are favored, you and I,
Who only want the living truth.
It was not good to nurse the lie;
'Tis well it died in harmless youth.

I go from you to-night to sleep.
Why, what's the odds? why should I grieve?
I have no fund of tears to weep
For happenings that undeceive.
The days shall come, the days shall go
Just as they came and went before.
The sun shall shine, the streams shall flow
Tho' you and I are friends no more.

And in the volume of my years,
Where all my thoughts and acts shall be,
The page whereon your name appears
Shall be forever sealed to me.
Not that I hate you over-much,
'Tis less of hate than love defied;
Howe'er, our hands no more shall touch,
We'll go our ways--the world is wide.


 
UNEXPRESSED

Deep in my heart that aches with the repression,
And strives with plenitude of bitter pain,
There lives a thought that clamors for expression,
And spends its undelivered force in vain.

What boots it that some other may have thought it?
The right of thoughts' expression is divine;
The price of pain I pay for it has bought it,
I care not who lays claim to it--'tis mine!

And yet not mine until it be delivered;
The manner of its birth shall prove the test.
Alas, alas, my rock of pride is shivered--
I beat my brow--the thought still unexpressed.


 
ERE SLEEP COMES DOWN TO SOOTHE THE WEARY EYES

Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
Which all the day with ceaseless care have sought
The magic gold which from the seeker flies;
Ere dreams put on the gown and cap of thought,
And make the waking world a world of lies,--
Of lies most palpable, uncouth, forlorn,
That say life's full of aches and tears and sighs;
Oh, how with more than dreams the soul is torn,
Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.

Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
How all the griefs and heartaches we have known
Come up like pois'nous vapors that arise
From some base witch's caldron, when the crone
To work some potent spell, her magic plies.
The past which held its share of bitter pain,
Whose ghost we prayed that Time might exorcise,
Comes up, is lived and suffered o'er again,
Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.

Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
What phantoms fill the dimly lighted room;
What ghostly shades in awe-creating guise
Are bodied forth within the teeming gloom.
What echoes faint of sad and soul-sick cries,
And pangs of vague inexplicable pain
That pay the spirit's ceaseless enterprise,
Come thronging through the chambers of the brain,
Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.

Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
Where ranges forth the spirit far and free?
Thro' what strange realms and unfamiliar skies
Tends her far course to lands of mystery?
To lands unspeakable--beyond surmise,
Where shapes unknowable to being spring,
Till faint of wing, the Fancy fails and dies
Much wearied with the spirit's journeying,
Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.

Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
How questioneth the soul that other soul--
The inner sense which neither cheats nor lies,
But self exposes unto self, a scroll
Full writ with all life's acts unwise or wise,
In characters indelible and known;
So, trembling with the shock of sad surprise,
The soul doth view its awful self alone,
Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.

When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes,
The last dear sleep whose soft embrace is balm,
And whom sad sorrow teaches us to prize
For kissing all our passions into calm,
Ah then, no more we heed the sad world's cries,
Or seek to probe th' eternal mystery,
Or fret our souls at long-withheld replies,
At glooms thro' which our visions cannot see,
When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes.


 
A STARRY NIGHT

A cloud fell down from the heavens,
And broke on the mountain's brow;
It scattered the dusky fragments
All over the vale below.

The moon and the stars were anxious
To know what its fate might be;
So they rushed to the azure op'ning,
And all peered down to see.

 
THE LESSON

My cot was down by a cypress grove,
And I sat by my window the whole night long,
And heard well up from the deep dark wood
A mocking bird's passionate song.

And I thought of myself so sad and lone,
And my ]ife's cold winter that knew no spring;
Of my mind so weary and sick and wild,
Of my heart too sad to sing.

But e'en as I listened the mock-bird's song,
A thought stole into my saddened heart,
And I said, "I can cheer some other soul
By a carol's simple art."

For oft from the darkness of hearts and lives
Come songs that brim with joy and light,
As out of the gloom of the cypress grove
The mocking-bird sings at night.

So I sang a lay for a brother's ear
In a strain to soothe his bleeding heart,
And he smiled at the sound of my voice and lyre,
Tho' mine was a feeble art.

But at his smile, I smiled in turn
And into my soul there came a ray:
In trying to soothe another's woes
Mine own had passed away.

 
DAWN

An angel, robed in spotless white,
Bent down and kissed the sleeping Night.
Night woke to blush; the sprite was gone.
Men saw the blush and called it Dawn.



 
A LYRIC

My lady love lives far away,
And oh my heart is sad by day,
And ah my tears fall fast by night,
What may I do in such a plight.

Why, miles grow few when love is fleet,
And love, you know, hath flying feet:
Break off thy sighs and witness this,
How poor a thing mere distance is.

My love knows not I love her so,
And would she scorn me, did she know?
How may the tale I would impart
Attract her ear and storm her heart?

Calm thou the tempest in thy breast,
Who loves in silence loves the best,
But bide thy time, she will awake,
No night so dark but morn will break.

But tho' my heart so strongly yearn,
My lady loves me not in turn,
How may I win the blest reply
That my void heart shall satisfy.

Love breedeth love, be thou but true,
And soon thy Love shall love thee, too;
If Fate hath meant you heart for heart,
There's naught may keep you twain apart.


 
PHYLLIS

Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day,
Few are my years, but my griefs are not few,
Ever to youth should each day be a May-day,
Warm wind and rose-breath and diamonded dew--
Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day.

Oh for the sunlight that shines on a May-day;
Only the cloud hangeth over my life.
Love that should bring me youth's happiest hey-day,
Brings me but seasons of sorrow and strife;
Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day.

Sunshine or shadow, or gold day or gray day,
Life must be lived as our destinies rule;
Leisure or labor or work day or play day--
Feasts for the famous and fun for the fool;
Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day.
 
RIGHT'S SECURITY

What if the wind do howl without,
And turn the creaking weather-vane;
What if the arrows of the rain
Do beat against the window pane.
Art thou not armored strong and fast
Against the sallies of the blast?
Art thou not sheltered safe and well
Against the flood's insistent swell?

What boots it, that thou stand'st alone,
And laughest in the battle's face
When all the weak have fled the place
And let their feet and fears keep pace?
Thou wavest still thine ensign, high,
And shoutest thy loud battle cry;
Higher than e'er the tempest roared,
It cleaves the silence like a sword.

Right arms and armors, too, that man
Who will not compromise with wrong;
Tho' single, he must front the throng,
And wage the battle hard and long.
Minorities, since time began,
Have shown the better side of man;
And often in the lists of Time
One man has made a cause sublime!


 
OLD

I have seen peoples come and go
Alike the Ocean's ebb and flow;
I have seen kingdoms rise and fall
Like springtime shadows on a wall.
I have seen houses rendered great
That grew from life's debased estate,
And all, all, all is change I see,
So, dearest God, take me, take me.



 
HOW SHALL I WOO THEE

How shall I woo thee to win the[sic], mine own?
Say in what tongue shall I tell of my love.
I who was fearless so timid have grown,
All that was eagle has turned into dove.
The path from the meadow that leads to the bars
Is more to me now than the path of the stars.

How shall I woo thee to win thee, mine own,
Thou who art fair and as far as the moon?
Had I the strength of the torrent's wild tone,
Had I the sweetness of warblers in June;
The strength and the sweetness might charm and persuade,
But neither have I my petition to aid.

How shall I woo thee to win thee, mine own?
How shall I traverse the distance between
My humble cot and your glorious throne?
How shall a clown gain the ear of a queen?
Oh teach me the tongue that shall please thee the best,
For till I have won thee my heart may not rest.


 
AN ANTE-BELLUM SERMON

We is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs,
In dis howlin' wildaness,
Fu' to speak some words of comfo't
To each othah in distress.
An' we chooses fu' ouah subjic'
Dis -- we'll 'splain it by an' by;
"An de Lawd said, 'Moses, Moses,'
An' de man said, 'Hyeah am I.'"

Now ole Pher'oh, down in Egypt,
Was de wuss man evah bo'n,
An' he had de Hebrew chillun
Down dah wukin' in his co'n;
'Twell de Lawd got tiahed o' his foolin',
An' sez he: "I'll let him know--
Look hyeah, Moses, go tell Pher'oh
Fu' to let dem chillun go."

"An' ef he refuse to do it,
I will make him rue de houah,
Fu' I'll empty down on Egypt
All de vials of my powah."
Yes, he did -- an' Pher'oh's ahmy
Was n't wuth a ha'f a dime;
Fu' de Lawd will he'p his chillun,
You kin trust him evah time.

An' yo' enemies may 'sail you
In de back an' in de front;
But de Lawd is all aroun' you,
Fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.
Dey kin fo'ge yo' chains an' shackles
F'om de mountains to de sea;
But de Lawd will sen' some Moses
Fu' to set his chillun free.

An' de lan' shall hyeah his thundah,
Lak a blas' f'om Gab'el's ho'n,
Fu' de Lawd of hosts is mighty
When he girds his ahmor on.
But fu' feah some one mistakes me,
I will pause right hyeah to say,
Dat I'm still a-preachin' ancient,
I ain't talkin' 'bout to-day.

But I tell you, fellah christuns,
Things'll happen mighty strange;
Now, de Lawd done dis fu' Isrul,
An' his ways don't nevah change,
An' de love he showed to Isrul
Was n't all on Isrul spent;
Now don't run an' tell yo' mastahs
Dat I's preachin' discontent.

'Cause I is n't; I'se a-judgin'
Bible people by deir ac's;
I'se a-givin' you de Scriptuah,
I'se a-handin' you de fac's.
Cose ole Pher'oh b'lieved in slav'ry,
But de Lawd he let him see,
Dat de people he put bref in,--
Evah mothah's son was free.

An' dahs othahs thinks lak Pher'oh,
But dey calls de Scriptuah liar,
Fu' de Bible says "a servant
Is a-worthy of his hire."
An' you cain't git roun' nor thoo dat,
An' you cain't git ovah it,
Fu' whatevah place you git in,
Dis hyeah Bible too'll fit.

So you see de Lawd's intention,
Evah sence de worl' began,
Was dat His almighty freedom
Should belong to evah man,
But I think it would be bettah,
Ef I'd pause agin to say,
Dat I'm talkin' 'bout ouah freedom
In a Bibleistic way.

But de Moses is a-comin',
An' he's comin' suah and fas'.
We kin hyeah his feet a-trompin',
We kin hyeah his trumpit blas'.
But I want to wa'n you people,
Don't you git too frigity;
An' don't you git to braggin'
'Bout dese things, you wait an' see.

But when Moses wif his powah
Comes an' sets us chillun free,
We will praise de gracious Mastah
Dat has gin us liberty;
An' we'll shout ouah halleluyahs,
On dat mighty reck'nin day,
When we'se reco'nised ez citiz'--
Huh uh! Chillun, let us pray!


 
A BANJO SONG

Oh, dere's lots o' keer an' trouble
In dis world to swaller down;
An' ol' Sorrer's purty lively
In her way o' gittin' roun'.
Yet dere 's times when I furgit 'em,--
Aches an' pains an' troubles all,--
An' it's when I tek at ebenin'
My ol' banjo f'om de wall.

'Bout de time dat night is fallin'
An' my daily wu'k is done,
An' above de shady hilltops
I kin see de settin' sun;
When de quiet, restful shadders
Is beginnin' jes' to fall,--
Den I take de little banjo
F'om its place upon de wall.

Den my fam'ly gadders roun' me
In de fadin' o' de light,
Ez I strike de strings to try 'em
Ef dey all is tuned er-right.
An' it seems we're so nigh heaben
We kin hyeah de angels sing
When de music o' dat banjo
Sets my cabin all er-ring.

An' my wife an' all de othahs,--
Male an' female, small an' big,--
Even up to gray-haired granny,
Seem jes' boun' to do a jig;
Twell I change de style o' music,
Change de movement an' de time,
An' de ringin' little banjo
Plays an ol' hea't-feelin' hime.

An' somehow my th'oat gits choky,
An' a lump keeps tryin' to rise
Lak it wan'ed to ketch de water
Dat was flowin' to my eyes;
An' I feel dat I could sorter
Knock de socks clean off o' sin
Ez I hyeah my po' ol' granny
Wif huh tremblin' voice jine in.

Den we all th'ow in our voices
Fu' to he'p de chune out too,
Lak a big camp-meetin' choiry
Tryin' to sing a mou'nah th'oo.
An' our th'oahts let out de music,
Sweet an' solemn, loud an' free,
Twell de raftahs o' my cabin
Echo wif de melody.

Oh, de music o' de banjo,
Quick an' deb'lish, solemn, slow,
Is de greates' joy an' solace
Dat a weary slave kin know!
So jes' let me hyeah it ringin',
Dough de chune be po' an' rough,
It's a pleasure; an' de pleasures
O' dis life is few enough.

Now, de blessed little angels
Up in heaben, we are told,
Don't do nothin' all dere lifetime
'Ceptin' play on ha'ps o' gold.
Now I think heaben'd be mo' homelike
Ef we'd hyeah some music fall
F'om a real ol'-fashioned banjo,
Like dat one upon de wall.


 
THE OL' TUNES

You kin talk about yer anthems
An' yer arias an' sich,
An' yer modern choir-singin'
That you think so awful rich;
But you orter heerd us youngsters
In the times now far away,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.

There was some of us sung treble
An' a few of us growled bass,
An' the tide o' song flowed smoothly
With its 'comp'niment o' grace;
There was spirit in that music,
An' a kind o' solemn sway,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.

I remember oft o' standin'
In my homespun pantaloons--
On my face the bronze an' freckles
O' the suns o' youthful Junes--
Thinkin' that no mortal minstrel
Ever chanted sich a lay
As the ol' tunes we was singin'
In the ol'-fashioned way.

The boys 'ud always lead us,
An' the girls 'ud all chime in,
Till the sweetness o' the singin'
Robbed the list'nin' soul o' sin;
An' I used to tell the parson
'T was as good to sing as pray,
When the people sung the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.

How I long ag'in to hear 'em
Pourin' forth from soul to soul,
With the treble high an' meller,
An' the bass's mighty roll;
But the times is very diff'rent,
An' the music heerd to-day
Ain't the singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.

Little screechin' by a woman,
Little squawkin' by a man,
Then the organ's twiddle-twaddle,
Jest the empty space to span,--
An' ef you should even think it,
'T is n't proper fur to say
That you want to hear the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.

But I think that some bright mornin',
When the toils of life air o'er,
An' the sun o' heaven arisin'
Glads with light the happy shore,
I shall hear the angel chorus,
In the realms of endless day,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.


 
A NEGRO LOVE SONG

Seen my lady home las' night,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,
Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,
An' a smile go flittin' by--
Jump back, honey, jump back.

Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
An' my hea't was beatin' so,
When I reached my lady's do',
Dat I couldn't ba' to go--
Jump back, honey, jump back.

Put my ahm aroun' huh wais',
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Raised huh lips an' took a tase,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Love me, honey, love me true?
Love me well ez I love you?
An' she answe'd, "'Cose I do"--
Jump back, honey, jump back.


 
WHEN DE CO'N PONE'S HOT

Dey is times in life when Nature
Seems to slip a cog an' go,
Jes' a-rattlin' down creation,
Lak an ocean's overflow;
When de worl' jes' stahts a-spinnin'
Lak a picaninny's top,
An' yo' cup o' joy is brimmin'
'Twell it seems about to slop,
An' you feel jes' lak a racah,
Dat is trainin' fu' to trot
When yo' mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.

When you set down at de table,
Kin' o' weary lak an' sad,
An' you'se jes' a little tiahed
An' purhaps a little mad;
How yo' gloom tu'ns into gladness,
How yo' joy drives out de doubt
When de oven do' is opened,
An' de smell comes po'in' out;
Why, de 'lectric light o' Heaven
Seems to settle on de spot,
When yo' mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.

When de cabbage pot is steamin'
An' de bacon good an' fat,
When de chittlins is a-sputter'n'
So's to show you whah dey's at;
Tek away yo' sody biscuit,
Tek away yo' cake an' pie,
Fu' de glory time is comin',
An' it's 'proachin' mighty nigh,
An' you want to jump an' hollah,
Dough you know you'd bettah not,
When yo' mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.

I have hyeahd o' lots o' sermons,
An' I've hyeahd o' lots o' prayers,
An' I've listened to some singin'
Dat has tuck me up de stairs
Of de Glory-Lan' an' set me
Jes' below de Mahstah's th'one,
An' have lef' my hea't a-singin'
In a happy aftah tone;
But dem wu'ds so sweetly murmured
Seem to tech de softes' spot,
When my mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.



 
LONESOME

Mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two,
An' oh, the house is lonesome ez a nest whose birds has flew
To other trees to build agin; the rooms seem jest so bare
That the echoes run like sperrits from the kitchen to the stair.
The shetters flap more lazy-like 'n what they ust to do,
Sence mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two.

We've killed the fattest chicken an' we've cooked her to a turn;
We've made the richest gravy, but I jist don't give a durn
Fur nothin' 'at I drink er eat, er nothin' 'at I see.
The food ain't got the pleasant taste it used to have to me.
They's somep'n' stickin' in my throat ez tight ez hardened glue,
Sence mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two.

The holly-hocks air jest ez pink, they're double ones at that,
An' I wuz prouder of 'em than a baby of a cat.
But now I don't go near 'em, tho' they nod an' blush at me,
Fur they's somep'n' seems to gall me in their keerless sort o' glee
An' all their fren'ly noddin' an' their blushin' seems to say:
"You're purty lonesome, John, old boy, sence mother's gone away."

The neighbors ain't so fren'ly ez it seems they'd ort to be;
They seem to be a-lookin' kinder sideways like at me,
A-kinder feared they'd tech me off ez ef I wuz a match,
An' all because 'at mother's gone an' I'm a-keepin' batch!
I'm shore I don't do nothin' worse 'n what I ust to do
Fore mother went a-visitin' to spend a month er two.

The sparrers ac's more fearsome like an' won't hop quite so near,
The cricket's chirp is sadder an' the sky ain't ha'f so clear;
When ev'nin' comes, I set an' smoke tell my eyes begin to swim,
An' things aroun' commence to look all blurred, an faint an' dim.
Well, I guess I'll have to own up 'at I'm feelin' purty blue
Sence mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two.



 
THE WOOING

A youth went faring up and down,
Alack and well-a-day.
He fared him to the market town,
Alack and well-a-day.
And there he met a maiden fair,
With hazel eyes and auburn hair--
His heart went from him then and there
Alack and well-a-day.

She posies sold right merrily,
Alack and well-a-day;
But not a flower was fair as she,
Alack and well-a-day.
He bought a rose and sighed a sigh
"Ah, dearest maiden, would that I
Might dare the seller too to buy,"
Alack and well-a-day.

She tossed her head--the coy coquette,
Alack and well-a-day.
"I'm not sir in the market yet"
Alack and well-a-day.
Your love must cool upon a shelf;
Tho' much I sell for gold and pelf
I'm yet too young to sell myself
Alack and well-a-day.

The youth was filled with sorrow sore
Alack and well-a-day;
And looked he at the maid once more
Alack and well-a-day.
Then loud he cried, "Fair maiden, if
Too young to sell, now as I live,
You're not too young yourself to give"
Alack and well-a-day.

The little maid cast down her eyes
Alack and well-a-day,
And many a flush began to rise
Alack and well-a-day.
"Why, since you are so bold," she said,
"I doubt not you are highly bred,
So take me!" and the twain were wed.
Alack and well-a-day.



 
THE CORN-STALK FIDDLE

When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine
Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,
And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;
Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,
For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.

And you take a stalk that is straight and long,
With an expert eye to its worthy points,
And you think of the bubbling strains of song
That are bound between its pithy joints--
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,
With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.

Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow
O'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!
And the music's flow never loud but low
Is the concert note of a fairy band.
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle
To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.

When the eve comes on and our work is done,
And the sun drops down with a tender glance,
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,
Come the neighbor girls for the evening's dance,
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle,
More time than tune--from the corn-stalk fiddle.

Then brother Jabez takes the bow,
While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow,
And John takes Nellie Jones's hand,
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,
And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.

"Salute your partners," comes the call,
"All join hands and circle round,"
"Grand train back," and "Balance all,"
Footsteps lightly spurn the ground.
"Take your lady and balance down the middle"
To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.

So the night goes on and the dance is o'er,
And the merry girls are homeward gone,
But I see it all in my sleep once more,
And I dream till the very break of dawn
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle
To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.


 
CURTAIN

Villain shows his indiscretion,
Villain's partner makes confession.
Juvenile, with golden tresses,
Finds her pa and dons long dresses.
Scape-grace comes home, money-laden,
Hero comforts tearful maiden,
Soubrette marries loyal chappie,
Villain skips, and all are happy.


 
THE DESERTED PLANTATION

Oh, de grubbin-hoe's a rustin' in de co'nah,
An' de plow's a tumblin' down in de fiel'--
While de whippo'will's a wailin' lak a mou'nah
When his stubbo'n hawt is tryin' ha'd to yiel'.

In de furrers wha' de co'n was allus wavin',
Now de weeds is growin' green an' rank an' tall;
An de swallers roun' de whole place is a bravin'
Lak dey thought their folks had allus owned it all.

An' de big house stan's all quiet lak an' solemn,
Not a blessed soul in pa'lor, po'ch er lawn;
Not a guest, ner not a ca'iage lef' to haul 'em,
Fu' de ones dat tu'ned de latch-string out air gone.

An' de banjo's voice is silent in de qua'ters,
D'ain't a hymn ner co'n-song ringin' in de ah;
But de murmur of a branch's passin' waters
Is de only soun' dat breks de stillness da.

Wha's de da'kies, dem dat used to be a dancin'
Ebry night befo' de ole cabin do'?
Wha's de chillun, dem dat used to be a prancin',
Er a rollin' in de san' er on de flo'?

Wha's de Uncle Mordecai an' Uncle Aaron?
Wha's Aunt Doshy, Sam an' Kit an' all de res'?
Wha's ole Tom de da'ky fiddlah, how's he farin'?
Wha's de gals dat ust to sing an' dance de bes'?

Gone! not one o' dem is lef' to tell de story;
Dey have lef' de deah ole place to fall away.
Couldn't one o' dem dat seed it in its glory
Stay to watch it in de hour of decay?

Dey have lef' de ole plantation to de swallers,
But it hol's in me a lover till de las';
Fu' I fin' hyeah in de memory dat follers
All dat loved me an' dat I loved in de pas'.

So I'll stay an' watch de deah ole place an' tend it
Ez I used to in de happy days gone by.
Twell de othah Mastah thinks it's time to end it,
An' calls me to my qua'ters in de sky.


 
WHEN MALINDY SINGS

G'way an' quit dat noise, Miss Lucy-
Put dat music book away;
What's de use to keep on tryin'?
Ef you practice twell you're gray,
You cain't sta't no notes a-flyin'
Lak de ones dat rants an' rings
F'om de kitchen to de big woods
When Melindy sings.

You ain't got de nachel o'gans
Fu' to make de soun' come right,
You ain't got de tu'ns an' twistin's
Fu' to make it sweet an' light.
Tell you one thing now, Miss Lucy,
An' I'm tellin' you fu' true,
When hit comes to raal right singin',
'Tain't no easy thing to do.

Easy 'nough fu' folks to hollah,
Lookin' at de lines an' dots,
When dey ain't no one kin sence it,
An' de chune comes in, in spots;
But fu' real melojous music,
Dat jes' strikes yo' hawt and clings,
Jes' you stan' an' listen wif me
When Malindy sings.

Ain't you nevah heerd Malindy?
Blessed soul, take up de cross!
Look heah, ain't you jokin' honey?
Well, you don't know whut you los'.
Y'ought to heah dat gal a-wa'blin',
Robins, la'ks, an' all dem things,
Heish dey moufs an' hides dey faces
When Malindy sings.

Fiddlin' man, jes' stop his fiddlin',
Lay his fiddle on de she'f;
Mockin'-bird quit tryin' to whistle,
'Cause he jes' so shamed hisse'f.
Folks a-playin' on de banjo
Draps dey fingahs on de strings--
Bless yo' soul--fu'gits to move 'em,
When Malindy sings.

She jes' spreads huh mouf and hollahs,
"Come to Jesus," twell you heah
Sinnahs' tremblin' steps and voices,
Timid-like a-drawin' neah;
Den she tu'ns to "Rock of Ages,"
Simply to de cross she clings,
An' you fin' yo' teahs a drappin'
When Malindy sings.

Who dat says dat humble praises
Wif de Master nevah counts?
Heish yo' mouf, I heah dat music,
Ez hit rises up an' mounts--
Floatin' by de hills an' valleys,
Way above dis buryin' sod,
Ez hit makes its way in glory
To de very gates of God!

Oh, hits sweetah dan de music
Of an edicated band;
An' hits dearah dan de battle's
Song o' triumph in de lan'.
It seems holier dan evenin'
When de solemn chu'ch bell rings,
Ez I sit an' ca'mly listen
While Malindy sings.

Towsah, stop dat ba'kin', heah me!
Mandy, make dat chile keep still;
Don't you heah de echoes callin'
F'om de valley to de hill.
Let me listen, I can heah it,
Th'oo de bresh of angel's wings,
Sof' an' sweet, "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"
Ez Malindy sings.

GEORGE S. FERGUSON CO.,
PRINTERS AND ELECTROTYPERS.
Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.—Isaiah 60:15.
My Mother’s Kiss.
My mother’s kiss, my mother’s kiss,
I feel its impress now;
As in the bright and happy days
She pressed it on my brow.
You say it is a fancied thing
Within my memory fraught;
To me it has a sacred place—
The treasure house of thought.
Again, I feel her fingers glide
Amid my clustering hair;
I see the love-light in her eyes,
When all my life was fair.
Again, I hear her gentle voice
In warning or in love.
How precious was the faith that taught
My soul of things above.
The music of her voice is stilled,
Her lips are paled in death.
As precious pearls I’ll clasp her words
Until my latest breath.
The world has scattered round my path
Honor and wealth and fame;
But naught so precious as the thoughts
That gather round her name.
And friends have placed upon my brow
The laurels of renown;
But she first taught me how to wear
My manhood as a crown.
My hair is silvered o’er with age,
I’m longing to depart;
To clasp again my mother’s hand,
And be a child at heart.
To roam with her the glory-land
Where saints and angels greet;
To cast our crowns with songs of love
At our Redeemer’s feet.
A Grain of Sand.
Do you see this grain of sand
Lying loosely in my hand?
Do you know to me it brought
Just a simple loving thought?
When one gazes night by night
On the glorious stars of light,
Oh how little seems the span
Measured round the life of man.
Oh! how fleeting are his years
With their smiles and their tears;
Can it be that God does care
For such atoms as we are?
Then outspake this grain of sand
“I was fashioned by His hand
In the star lit realms of space
I was made to have a place.
“Should the ocean flood the world,
Were its mountains ’gainst me hurled,
All the force they could employ
Wouldn’t a single grain destroy;
And if I, a thing so light,
Have a place within His sight;
You are linked unto his throne
Cannot live nor die alone.
“In the everlasting arms
Mid life’s dangers and alarms
Let calm trust your spirit fill;
Know He’s God, and then be still.”
Trustingly I raised my head
Hearing what the atom said;
Knowing man is greater far
Than the brightest sun or star.
The Crocuses.
They heard the South wind sighing
A murmur of the rain;
And they knew that Earth was longing
To see them all again.
While the snow-drops still were sleeping
Beneath the silent sod;
They felt their new life pulsing
Within the dark, cold clod.
Not a daffodil nor daisy
Had dared to raise its head;
Not a fair-haired dandelion
Peeped timid from its bed;
Though a tremor of the winter
Did shivering through them run;
Yet they lifted up their foreheads
To greet the vernal sun.
And the sunbeams gave them welcome,
As did the morning air—
And scattered o’er their simple robes
Rich tints of beauty rare.
Soon a host of lovely flowers
From vales and woodland burst;
But in all that fair procession
The crocuses were first.
First to weave for Earth a chaplet
To crown her dear old head;
And to beautify the pathway
Where winter still did tread.
And their loved and white haired mother
Smiled sweetly ’neath the touch,
When she knew her faithful children
Were loving her so much.
The Present Age.
Say not the age is hard and cold—
I think it brave and grand;
When men of diverse sects and creeds
Are clasping hand in hand.
The Parsee from his sacred fires
Beside the Christian kneels;
And clearer light to Islam’s eyes
The word of Christ reveals.
The Brahmin from his distant home
Brings thoughts of ancient lore;
The Buddhist breaking bonds of caste
Divides mankind no more.
The meek-eyed sons of far Cathay
Are welcome round the board;
Not greed, nor malice drives away
These children of our Lord.
And Judah from whose trusted hands
Came oracles divine;
Now sits with those around whose hearts
The light of God doth shine.
Japan unbars her long sealed gates
From islands far away;
Her sons are lifting up their eyes
To greet the coming day.
The Indian child from forests wild
Has learned to read and pray;
The tomahawk and scalping knife
From him have passed away.
From centuries of servile toil
The Negro finds release,
And builds the fanes of prayer and praise
Unto the God of Peace.
England and Russia face to face
With Central Asia meet;
And on the far Pacific coast,
Chinese and natives greet.
Crusaders once with sword and shield
The Holy Land to save;
From Moslem hands did strive to clutch
The dear Redeemer’s grave.
A battle greater, grander far
Is for the present age;
A crusade for the rights of man
To brighten history’s page.
Where labor faints and bows her head,
And want consorts with crime;
Or men grown faithless sadly say
That evil is the time.
There is the field, the vantage ground
For every earnest heart;
To side with justice, truth and right
And act a noble part.
To save from ignorance and vice
The poorest, humblest child;
To make our age the fairest one
On which the sun has smiled;
To plant the roots of coming years
In mercy, love and truth;
And bid our weary, saddened earth
Again renew her youth.
Oh! earnest hearts! toil on in hope,
’Till darkness shrinks from light;
To fill the earth with peace and joy,
Let youth and age unite;
To stay the floods of sin and shame
That sweep from shore to shore;
And furl the banners stained with blood,
’Till war shall be no more.
Blame not the age, nor think it full
Of evil and unrest;
But say of every other age,
“This one shall be the best.”
The age to brighten every path
By sin and sorrow trod;
For loving hearts to usher in
The commonwealth of God.
Dedication Poem.
Dedication Poem on the reception of the annex to the home for aged colored people, from the bequest of Mr. Edward T. Parker.
Outcast from her home in Syria
In the lonely, dreary wild;
Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken,
Sat a mother and her child.
There was not a voice to cheer her
Not a soul to share her fate;
She was weary, he was fainting,—
And life seemed so desolate.
Far away in sunny Egypt
Was lone Hagar’s native land;
Where the Nile in kingly bounty
Scatters bread throughout the land.
In the tents of princely Abram
She for years had found a home;
Till the stern decree of Sarah
Sent her forth the wild to roam.
Hour by hour she journeyed onward
From the shelter of their tent,
Till her footsteps slowly faltered
And the water all was spent;
Then she veiled her face in sorrow,
Feared her child would die of thirst;
Till her eyes with tears so holden
Saw a sparkling fountain burst.
Oh! how happy was that mother,
What a soothing of her pain;
When she saw her child reviving,
Life rejoicing through each vein.
Does not life repeat this story,
Tell it over day by day?
Of the fountains of refreshment
Ever springing by our way.
Here is one by which we gather,
On this bright and happy day,
Just to bask beside a fountain
Making gladder life’s highway.
Bringing unto hearts now aged
Who have borne life’s burdens long,
Such a gift of love and mercy
As deserves our sweetest song.
Such a gift that even heaven
May rejoice with us below,
If the pure and holy angels
Join us in our joy and woe.
May the memory of the giver
In this home where age may rest,
Float like fragrance through the ages,
Ever blessing, ever blest.
When the gates of pearl are opened
May we there this friend behold,
Drink with him from living fountains,
Walk with him the streets of gold.
When life’s shattered cords of music
Shall again be sweetly sung;
Then our hearts with life immortal,
Shall be young, forever young.
A Double Standard.
Do you blame me that I loved him?
If when standing all alone
I cried for bread a careless world
Pressed to my lips a stone.
Do you blame me that I loved him,
That my heart beat glad and free,
When he told me in the sweetest tones
He loved but only me?
Can you blame me that I did not see
Beneath his burning kiss
The serpent’s wiles, nor even hear
The deadly adder hiss?
Can you blame me that my heart grew cold
That the tempted, tempter turned;
When he was feted and caressed
And I was coldly spurned?
Would you blame him, when you draw from me
Your dainty robes aside,
If he with gilded baits should claim
Your fairest as his bride?
Would you blame the world if it should press
On him a civic crown;
And see me struggling in the depth
Then harshly press me down?
Crime has no sex and yet to-day
I wear the brand of shame;
Whilst he amid the gay and proud
Still bears an honored name.
Can you blame me if I’ve learned to think
Your hate of vice a sham,
When you so coldly crushed me down
And then excused the man?
Would you blame me if to-morrow
The coroner should say,
A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn,
Has thrown her life away?
Yes, blame me for my downward course,
But oh! remember well,
Within your homes you press the hand
That led me down to hell.
I’m glad God’s ways are not our ways,
He does not see as man;
Within His love I know there’s room
For those whom others ban.
I think before His great white throne,
His throne of spotless light,
That whited sepulchres shall wear
The hue of endless night.
That I who fell, and he who sinned,
Shall reap as we have sown;
That each the burden of his loss
Must bear and bear alone.
No golden weights can turn the scale
Of justice in His sight;
And what is wrong in woman’s life
In man’s cannot be right.
Our Hero.
Onward to her destination,
O’er the stream the Hannah sped,
When a cry of consternation
Smote and chilled our hearts with dread.
Wildly leaping, madly sweeping,
All relentless in their sway,
Like a band of cruel demons
Flames were closing ’round our way
Oh! the horror of those moments;
Flames above and waves below—
Oh! the agony of ages
Crowded in one hour of woe.
Fainter grew our hearts with anguish
In that hour with peril rife,
When we saw the pilot flying,
Terror-stricken, for his life.
Then a man uprose before us—
We had once despised his race—
But we saw a lofty purpose
Lighting up his darkened face.
While the flames were madly roaring,
With a courage grand and high,
Forth he rushed unto our rescue,
Strong to suffer, brave to die.
Helplessly the boat was drifting,
Death was staring in each face,
When he grasped the fallen rudder,
Took the pilot’s vacant place.
Could he save us? Would he save us?
All his hope of life give o’er?
Could he hold that fated vessel
’Till she reached the nearer shore?
All our hopes and fears were centered
’Round his strong, unfaltering hand;
If he failed us we must perish,
Perish just in sight of land.
Breathlessly we watched and waited
While the flames were raging fast;
When our anguish changed to rapture—
We were saved, yes, saved at last.
Never strains of sweetest music
Brought to us more welcome sound
Than the grating of that steamer
When her keel had touched the ground.
But our faithful martyr hero
Through a fiery pathway trod,
Till he laid his valiant spirit
On the bosom of his God.
Fame has never crowned a hero
On the crimson fields of strife,
Grander, nobler, than that pilot
Yielding up for us his life.
The Dying Bondman.
Life was trembling, faintly trembling
On the bondman’s latest breath,
And he felt the chilling pressure
Of the cold, hard hand of Death.
He had been an Afric chieftain,
Worn his manhood as a crown;
But upon the field of battle
Had been fiercely stricken down.
He had longed to gain his freedom,
Waited, watched and hoped in vain,
Till his life was slowly ebbing—
Almost broken was his chain.
By his bedside stood the master,
Gazing on the dying one,
Knowing by the dull grey shadows
That life’s sands were almost run.
“Master,” said the dying bondman,
“Home and friends I soon shall see;
But before I reach my country,
Master write that I am free;
“For the spirits of my fathers
Would shrink back from me in pride,
If I told them at our greeting
I a slave had lived and died;—
“Give to me the precious token,
That my kindred dead may see—
Master! write it, write it quickly!
Master! write that I am free!”
At his earnest plea the master
Wrote for him the glad release,
O’er his wan and wasted features
Flitted one sweet smile of peace.
Eagerly he grasped the writing;
“I am free!” at last he said.
Backward fell upon the pillow,
He was free among the dead.
“A Little Child Shall Lead Them.”
Only a little scrap of blue
Preserved with loving care,
But earth has not a brilliant hue
To me more bright and fair.
Strong drink, like a raging demon,
Laid on my heart his hand,
When my darling joined with others
The Loyal Legion band.
But mystic angels called away
My loved and precious child,
And o’er life’s dark and stormy way
Swept waves of anguish wild.
This badge of the Loyal Legion
We placed upon her breast,
As she lay in her little coffin
Taking her last sweet rest.
To wear that badge as a token
She earnestly did crave,
So we laid it on her bosom
To wear it in the grave.
Where sorrow would never reach her
Nor harsh words smite her ear;
Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber
Would ever shed a tear.
“What means this badge?” said her father,
Whom we had tried to save;
Who said, when we told her story,
“Don’t put it in the grave.”
We took the badge from her bosom
And laid it on a chair;
And men by drink deluded
Knelt by that badge in prayer.
And vowed in that hour of sorrow
From drink they would abstain;
And this little badge became the wedge
Which broke their galling chain.
And lifted the gloomy shadows
That overspread my life,
And flooding my home with gladness,
Made me a happy wife.
And this is why this scrap of blue
Is precious in my sight;
It changed my sad and gloomy home
From darkness into light.
The Sparrow’s Fall.
Too frail to soar—a feeble thing—
It fell to earth with fluttering wing;
But God, who watches over all,
Beheld that little sparrow’s fall.
’Twas not a bird with plumage gay,
Filling the air with its morning lay;
’Twas not an eagle bold and strong,
Borne on the tempest’s wing along.
Only a brown and wee-some thing,
With drooping head and listless wing;
It could not drift beyond His sight
Who marshals the splendid stars of night.
Its dying chirp fell on His ears,
Who tunes the music of the spheres,
Who hears the hungry lion’s call,
And spreads a table for us all.
Its mission of song at last is done,
No more will it greet the rising sun;
That tiny bird has found a rest
More calm than its mother’s downy breast.
Oh, restless heart, learn thou to trust
In God, so tender, strong and just;
In whose love and mercy everywhere
His humblest children have a share.
If in love He numbers ev’ry hair,
Whether the strands be dark or fair,
Shall we not learn to calmly rest,
Like children, on our Father’s breast?
God Bless Our Native Land.
God bless our native land,
Land of the newly free,
Oh may she ever stand
For truth and liberty.
God bless our native land,
Where sleep our kindred dead,
Let peace at thy command
Above their graves be shed.
God help our native land,
Bring surcease to her strife,
And shower from thy hand
A more abundant life.
God bless our native land,
Her homes and children bless,
Oh may she ever stand
For truth and righteousness.
Dandelions. 
Welcome children of the Spring,
In your garbs of green and gold,
Lifting up your sun-crowned heads
On the verdant plain and wold.
As a bright and joyous troop
From the breast of earth ye came
Fair and lovely are your cheeks,
With sun-kisses all aflame.
In the dusty streets and lanes,
Where the lowly children play,
There as gentle friends ye smile,
Making brighter life’s highway.
Dewdrops and the morning sun,
Weave your garments fair and bright,
And we welcome you to-day
As the children of the light.
Children of the earth and sun,
We are slow to understand
All the richness of the gifts
Flowing from our Father’s hand.
Were our vision clearer far,
In this sin-dimmed world of ours,
Would we not more thankful be
For the love that sends us flowers?
Welcome, early visitants,
With your sun-crowned golden hair,
With your message to our hearts
Of our Father’s loving care.
The Building.
“Build me a house,” said the Master,
“But not on the shifting sand,
Mid the wreck and roar of tempests,
A house that will firmly stand.
“I will bring thee windows of agates,
And gates of carbuncles bright,
And thy fairest courts and portals
Shall be filled with love and light.
“Thou shalt build with fadeless rubies,
All fashioned around the throne,
A house that shall last forever,
With Christ as the cornerstone.
“It shall be a royal mansion,
A fair and beautiful thing,
It will be the presence-chamber
Of thy Saviour, Lord and King.
“Thy house shall be bound with pinions
To mansions of rest above,
But grace shall forge all the fetters
With the links and cords of love.
“Thou shalt be free in this mansion
From sorrow and pain of heart,
For the peace of God shall enter,
And never again depart.”
Home, Sweet Home.
Sharers of a common country,
They had met in deadly strife;
Men who should have been as brothers
Madly sought each other’s life.
In the silence of the even,
When the cannon’s lips were dumb,
Thoughts of home and all its loved ones
To the soldier’s heart would come.
On the margin of a river,
’Mid the evening’s dews and damps,
Could be heard the sounds of music
Rising from two hostile camps.
One was singing of its section
Down in Dixie, Dixie’s land,
And the other of the banner
Waved so long from strand to strand.
In the land where Dixie’s ensign
Floated o’er the hopeful slave,
Rose the song that freedom’s banner,
Starry-lighted, long might wave.
From the fields of strife and carnage,
Gentle thoughts began to roam,
And a tender strain of music
Rose with words of “Home, Sweet Home.”
Then the hearts of strong men melted,
For amid our grief and sin
Still remains that “touch of nature,”
Telling us we all are kin.
In one grand but gentle chorus,
Floating to the starry dome,
Came the words that brought them nearer,
Words that told of “Home, Sweet Home.”
For awhile, all strife forgotten,
They were only brothers then,
Joining in the sweet old chorus,
Not as soldiers, but as men.
Men whose hearts would flow together,
Though apart their feet might roam,
Found a tie they could not sever,
In the mem’ry of each home.
Never may the steps of carnage
Shake our land from shore to shore,
But may mother, home and Heaven,
Be our watchwords evermore.
The Pure in Heart Shall See God.
They shall see Him in the crimson flush
Of morning’s early light,
In the drapery of sunset,
Around the couch of night.
When the clouds drop down their fatness,
In late and early rain,
They shall see His glorious footprints
On valley, hill and plain.
They shall see Him when the cyclone
Breathes terror through the land;
They shall see Him ’mid the murmurs
Of zephyrs soft and bland.
They shall see Him when the lips of health,
Breath vigor through each nerve,
When pestilence clasps hands with death,
His purposes to serve.
They shall see Him when the trembling earth
Is rocking to and fro;
They shall see Him in the order
The seasons come and go.
They shall see Him when the storms of war
Sweep wildly through the land;
When peace descends like gentle dew
They still shall see His hand.
They shall see Him in the city
Of gems and pearls of light,
They shall see Him in his beauty,
And walk with Him in white.
To living founts their feet shall tend,
And Christ shall be their guide,
Beloved of God, their rest shall be
In safety by His side.
He “Had Not Where to Lay His Head.”
The conies had their hiding-place,
The wily fox with stealthy tread
A covert found, but Christ, the Lord,
Had not a place to lay his head.
The eagle had an eyrie home,
The blithesome bird its quiet rest,
But not the humblest spot on earth
Was by the Son of God possessed.
Princes and kings had palaces,
With grandeur could adorn each tomb,
For Him who came with love and life,
They had no home, they gave no room.
The hands whose touch sent thrills of joy
Through nerves unstrung and palsied frame,
The feet that travelled for our need,
Were nailed unto the cross of shame.
How dare I murmur at my lot,
Or talk of sorrow, pain and loss,
When Christ was in a manger laid,
And died in anguish on the cross.
That homeless one beheld beyond
His lonely agonizing pain,
A love outflowing from His heart,
That all the wandering world would gain.
Go Work in My Vineyard.
Go work in my vineyard, said the Lord,
And gather the bruised grain;
But the reapers had left the stubble bare,
And I trod the soil in pain.
The fields of my Lord are wide and broad,
He has pastures fair and green,
And vineyards that drink the golden light
Which flows from the sun’s bright sheen.
I heard the joy of the reapers’ song,
As they gathered golden grain;
Then wearily turned unto my task,
With a lonely sense of pain.
Sadly I turned from the sun’s fierce glare,
And sought the quiet shade,
And over my dim and weary eyes
Sleep’s peaceful fingers strayed.
I dreamed I joined with a restless throng,
Eager for pleasure and gain;
But ever and anon a stumbler fell,
And uttered a cry of pain.
But the eager crowd still hurried on,
Too busy to pause or heed,
When a voice rang sadly through my soul,
You must staunch these wounds that bleed.
My hands were weak, but I reached them out
To feebler ones than mine,
And over the shadows of my life
Stole the light of a peace divine.
Oh! then my task was a sacred thing,
How precious it grew in my eyes!
’Twas mine to gather the bruised grain
For the “Lord of Paradise.”
And when the reapers shall lay their grain
On the floors of golden light,
I feel that mine with its broken sheaves
Shall be precious in His sight.
Though thorns may often pierce my feet,
And the shadows still abide,
The mists will vanish before His smile,
There will be light at eventide.
Renewal of Strength.
The prison-house in which I live
Is falling to decay,
But God renews my spirit’s strength,
Within these walls of clay.
For me a dimness slowly creeps
Around earth’s fairest light,
But heaven grows clearer to my view,
And fairer to my sight.
It may be earth’s sweet harmonies
Are duller to my ear,
But music from my Father’s house
Begins to float more near.
Then let the pillars of my home
Crumble and fall away;
Lo, God’s dear love within my soul
Renews it day by day.
Jamie’s Puzzle.
There was grief within our household
Because of a vacant chair.
Our mother, so loved and precious,
No longer was sitting there.
Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow,
Our eyes with tears were blind,
And little Jamie was wondering,
Why we were left behind.
We had told our little darling,
Of the land of love and light,
Of the saints all crowned with glory,
And enrobed in spotless white.
We said that our precious mother,
Had gone to that land so fair,
To dwell with beautiful angels,
And to be forever there.
But the child was sorely puzzled,
Why dear grandmamma should go
To dwell in a stranger city,
When her children loved her so.
But again the mystic angel
Came with swift and silent tread,
And our sister, Jamie’s mother,
Was enrolled among the dead.
To us the mystery deepened,
To Jamie it seemed more clear;
Grandma, he said, must be lonesome,
And mamma has gone to her.
But the question lies unanswered
In our little Jamie’s mind,
Why she should go to our mother,
And leave her children behind;
To dwell in that lovely city,
From all that was dear to part,
From children who loved to nestle
So closely around her heart.
Dear child, like you, we are puzzled,
With problems that still remain;
But think in the great hereafter
Their meaning will all be plain.
Truth.
A rock, for ages, stern and high,
Stood frowning ’gainst the earth and sky,
And never bowed his haughty crest
When angry storms around him prest.
Morn, springing from the arms of night,
Had often bathed his brow with light,
And kissed the shadows from his face
With tender love and gentle grace.
Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
Smiled on him from the distant West,
And from her throne the dark-browed Night
Threw round his path her softest light.
And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
He bared his brow to every blast
And scorned the tempest as it passed.
One day a tiny, humble seed—
The keenest eye would hardly heed—
Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,
And found a lowly, hiding-place.
A ray of light, and drop of dew,
Came with a message, kind and true;
They told her of the world so bright,
Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
And lured her from her hiding-place,
To gaze upon earth’s glorious face.
So, peeping timid from the ground,
She clasped the ancient rock around,
And climbing up with childish grace,
She held him with a close embrace;
Her clinging was a thing of dread;
Where’er she touched a fissure spread,
And he who’d breasted many a storm
Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
A Truth, dropped in the silent earth,
May seem a thing of little worth,
Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
It saps its pillars proud and strong,
And o’er the fallen ruin weaves
The brightest blooms and fairest leaves.
Death of The Old Sea-King.
’Twas a fearful night—the tempest raved
With loud and wrathful pride,
The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds,
And rode on the raging tide.
The sea-king lay on his bed of death,
Pale mourners around him bent;
They knew the wild and fitful life
Of their chief was almost spent.
His ear was growing dull in death
When the angry storm he heard,
The sluggish blood in the old man’s veins
With sudden vigor stirred.
“I hear them call,” cried the dying man,
His eyes grew full of light;
“Now bring me here my warrior robes,
My sword and armor bright.
“In the tempest’s lull I heard a voice,
I knew ’twas Odin’s call.
The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed
To lead me unto his hall.
“Bear me unto my noblest ship,
Light up a funeral pyre;
I’ll walk to the palace of the braves
Through a path of flame and fire.”
Oh! wild and bright was the stormy light
That flashed from the old man’s eye,
As they bore him from the couch of death
To his battle-ship to die,
And lit with many a mournful torch
The sea-king’s dying bed,
And like a banner fair and bright
The flames around him spread.
But they heard no cry of anguish
Break through that fiery wall,
With rigid brow and silent lips
He was seeking Odin’s hall.
Through a path of fearful splendor,
While strong men held their breath,
The brave old man went boldly forth
And calmly talked with death.
Save the Boys.
Like Dives in the deeps of Hell
I cannot break this fearful spell,
Nor quench the fires I’ve madly nursed,
Nor cool this dreadful raging thirst.
Take back your pledge—ye come too late!
Ye cannot save me from my fate,
Nor bring me back departed joys;
But ye can try to save the boys.
Ye bid me break my fiery chain,
Arise and be a man again,
When every street with snares is spread,
And nets of sin where’er I tread.
No; I must reap as I did sow.
The seeds of sin bring crops of woe;
But with my latest breath I’ll crave
That ye will try the boys to save.
These bloodshot eyes were once so bright;
This sin-crushed heart was glad and light;
But by the wine-cup’s ruddy glow
I traced a path to shame and woe.
A captive to my galling chain,
I’ve tried to rise, but tried in vain—
The cup allures and then destroys.
Oh! from its thraldom save the boys.
Take from your streets those traps of hell
Into whose gilded snares I fell.
Oh! freemen, from these foul decoys
Arise, and vote to save the boys.
Oh, ye who license men to trade
In draughts that charm and then degrade,
Before ye hear the cry, Too late,
Oh, save the boys from my sad fate.
Nothing and Something.
It is nothing to me, the beauty said,
With a careless toss of her pretty head;
The man is weak if he can’t refrain
From the cup you say is fraught with pain.
It was something to her in after years,
When her eyes were drenched with burning tears,
And she watched in lonely grief and dread,
And startled to hear a staggering tread.
It is nothing to me, the mother said;
I have no fear that my boy will tread
In the downward path of sin and shame,
And crush my heart and darken his name.
It was something to her when that only son
From the path of right was early won,
And madly cast in the flowing bowl
A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.
It is nothing to me, the young man cried:
In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride;
I heed not the dreadful things ye tell:
I can rule myself I know full well.
It was something to him when in prison he lay
The victim of drink, life ebbing away;
And thought of his wretched child and wife,
And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.
It is nothing to me, the merchant said,
As over his ledger he bent his head;
I’m busy to-day with tare and tret,
And I have no time to fume and fret.
It was something to him when over the wire
A message came from a funeral pyre—
A drunken conductor had wrecked a train,
And his wife and child were among the slain.
It is nothing to me, the voter said,
The party’s loss is my greatest dread;
Then gave his vote for the liquor trade,
Though hearts were crushed and drunkards made.
It was something to him in after life,
When his daughter became a drunkard’s wife
And her hungry children cried for bread,
And trembled to hear their father’s tread.
Is it nothing for us to idly sleep
While the cohorts of death their vigils keep?
To gather the young and thoughtless in,
And grind in our midst a grist of sin?
It is something, yes, all, for us to stand
Clasping by faith our Saviour’s hand;
To learn to labor, live and fight
On the side of God and changeless light.
Vashti.
She leaned her head upon her hand
And heard the King’s decree—
“My lords are feasting in my halls;
Bid Vashti come to me.
“I’ve shown the treasures of my house,
My costly jewels rare,
But with the glory of her eyes
No rubies can compare.
“Adorn’d and crown’d I’d have her come,
With all her queenly grace,
And, ’mid my lords and mighty men,
Unveil her lovely face.
“Each gem that sparkles in my crown,
Or glitters on my throne,
Grows poor and pale when she appears,
My beautiful, my own!”
All waiting stood the chamberlains
To hear the Queen’s reply.
They saw her cheek grow deathly pale,
But light flash’d to her eye:
“Go, tell the King,” she proudly said,
“That I am Persia’s Queen,
And by his crowds of merry men
I never will be seen.
“I’ll take the crown from off my head
And tread it ’neath my feet,
Before their rude and careless gaze
My shrinking eyes shall meet.
“A queen unveil’d before the crowd!—
Upon each lip my name!—
Why, Persia’s women all would blush
And weep for Vashti’s shame!
“Go back!” she cried, and waved her hand,
And grief was in her eye:
“Go, tell the King,” she sadly said,
“That I would rather die.”
They brought her message to the King;
Dark flash’d his angry eye;
’Twas as the lightning ere the storm
Hath swept in fury by.
Then bitterly outspoke the King,
Through purple lips of wrath—
“What shall be done to her who dares
To cross your monarch’s path?”
Then spake his wily counsellors—
“O King of this fair land!
From distant Ind to Ethiop,
All bow to thy command.
“But if, before thy servants’ eyes,
This thing they plainly see,
That Vashti doth not heed thy will
Nor yield herself to thee,
“The women, restive ’neath our rule,
Would learn to scorn our name,
And from her deed to us would come
Reproach and burning shame.
“Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand
This stern but just decree,
That Vashti lay aside her crown,
Thy Queen no more to be.”
She heard again the King’s command,
And left her high estate;
Strong in her earnest womanhood,
She calmly met her fate,
And left the palace of the King,
Proud of her spotless name—
A woman who could bend to grief,
But would not bow to shame.
Thank God for Little Children.
Thank God for little children,
Bright flowers by earth’s wayside,
The dancing, joyous lifeboats
Upon life’s stormy tide.
Thank God for little children;
When our skies are cold and gray,
They come as sunshine to our hearts,
And charm our cares away.
I almost think the angels,
Who tend life’s garden fair,
Drop down the sweet wild blossoms
That bloom around us here.
It seems a breath of heaven
Round many a cradle lies,
And every little baby
Brings a message from the skies.
Dear mothers, guard these jewels,
As sacred offerings meet,
A wealth of household treasures
To lay at Jesus’ feet.
The Martyr of Alabama.
[The following news item appeared in the newspapers throughout the country, issue of December 27th, 1894:
“Tim Thompson, a little negro boy, was asked to dance for the amusement of some white toughs. He refused, saying he was a church member. One of the men knocked him down with a club and then danced upon his prostrate form. He then shot the boy in the hip. The boy is dead: his murderer is still at large.”]
He lifted up his pleading eyes,
And scanned each cruel face,
Where cold and brutal cowardice
Had left its evil trace.
It was when tender memories
Round Beth’lem’s manger lay,
And mothers told their little ones
Of Jesu’s natal day.
And of the Magi from the East
Who came their gifts to bring,
And bow in rev’rence at the feet
Of Salem’s new-born King.
And how the herald angels sang
The choral song of peace,
That war should close his wrathful lips,
And strife and carnage cease.
At such an hour men well may hush
Their discord and their strife,
And o’er that manger clasp their hands
With gifts to brighten life.
Alas! that in our favored land,
That cruelty and crime
Should cast their shadows o’er a day,
The fairest pearl of time.
A dark-browed boy had drawn anear
A band of savage men,
Just as a hapless lamb might stray
Into a tiger’s den.
Cruel and dull, they saw in him
For sport an evil chance,
And then demanded of the child
To give to them a dance.
“Come dance for us,” the rough men said;
“I can’t,” the child replied,
“I cannot for the dear Lord’s sake,
Who for my sins once died.”
Tho’ they were strong and he was weak,
He wouldn’t his Lord deny.
His life lay in their cruel hands,
But he for Christ could die.
Heard they aright? Did that brave child
Their mandates dare resist?
Did he against their stern commands
Have courage to resist?
Then recklessly a man arose,
And dealt a fearful blow.
He crushed the portals of that life,
And laid the brave child low.
And trampled on his prostrate form,
As on a broken toy;
Then danced with careless, brutal feet,
Upon the murdered boy.
Christians! behold that martyred child!
His blood cries from the ground;
Before the sleepless eye of God,
He shows each gaping wound.
Oh! Church of Christ arise! arise!
Lest crimson stain thy hand,
When God shall inquisition make
For blood shed in the land.
Take sackcloth of the darkest hue,
And shroud the pulpits round;
Servants of him who cannot lie
Sit mourning on the ground.
Let holy horror blanch each brow,
Pale every cheek with fears,
And rocks and stones, if ye could speak,
Ye well might melt to tears.
Through every fane send forth a cry,
Of sorrow and regret,
Nor in an hour of careless ease
Thy brother’s wrongs forget.
Veil not thine eyes, nor close thy lips,
Nor speak with bated breath;
This evil shall not always last,—
The end of it is death.
Avert the doom that crime must bring
Upon a guilty land;
Strong in the strength that God supplies,
For truth and justice stand.
For Christless men, with reckless hands,
Are sowing round thy path
The tempests wild that yet shall break
In whirlwinds of God’s wrath.
The Night of Death.
Twas a night of dreadful horror,—
Death was sweeping through the land;
And the wings of dark destruction
Were outstretched from strand to strand.
Strong men’s hearts grew faint with terror,
As the tempest and the waves
Wrecked their homes and swept them downward,
Suddenly to yawning graves.
’Mid the wastes of ruined households,
And the tempest’s wild alarms,
Stood a terror-stricken mother
With a child within her arms.
Other children huddled ’round her,
Each one nestling in her heart;
Swift in thought and swift in action,
She at least from one must part.
Then she said unto her daughter,
“Strive to save one child from death.”
“Which one?” said the anxious daughter,
As she stood with bated breath.
Oh! the anguish of that mother;
What despair was in her eye!
All her little ones were precious;
Which one should she leave to die?
Then outspake the brother Bennie:
“I will take the little one.”
“No,” exclaimed the anxious mother;
“No, my child, it can’t be done.”
“See! my boy, the waves are rising,
Save yourself and leave the child!”
“I will trust in Christ,” he answered;
Grasped the little one and smiled.
Through the roar of wind and waters
Ever and anon she cried;
But throughout the night of terror
Never Bennie’s voice replied.
But above the waves’ wild surging
He had found a safe retreat,
As if God had sent an angel,
Just to guide his wandering feet.
When the storm had spent its fury,
And the sea gave up its dead,
She was mourning for her loved ones,
Lost amid that night of dread.
While her head was bowed in anguish,
On her ear there fell a voice,
Bringing surcease to her sorrow,
Bidding all her heart rejoice.
“Didn’t I tell you true?” said Bennie,
And his eyes were full of light,
“When I told you God would help me
Through the dark and dreadful night?”
And he placed the little darling
Safe within his mother’s arms.
Feeling Christ had been his guardian,
’Mid the dangers and alarms.
Oh! for faith so firm and precious,
In the darkest, saddest night,
Till life’s gloom-encircled shadows
Fade in everlasting light.
And upon the mount of vision
We our loved and lost shall greet,
With earth’s wildest storms behind us,
And its cares beneath our feet.
Mother’s Treasures.
Two little children sit by my side,
I call them Lily and Daffodil;
I gaze on them with a mother’s pride,
One is Edna, the other is Will.
Both have eyes of starry light,
And laughing lips o’er teeth of pearl.
I would not change for a diadem
My noble boy and darling girl.
To-night my heart o’erflows with joy;
I hold them as a sacred trust;
I fain would hide them in my heart,
Safe from tarnish of moth and rust.
What should I ask for my dear boy?
The richest gifts of wealth or fame?
What for my girl? A loving heart
And a fair and a spotless name?
What for my boy? That he should stand
A pillar of strength to the state?
What for my girl? That she should be
The friend of the poor and desolate?
I do not ask they shall never tread
With weary feet the paths of pain.
I ask that in the darkest hour
They may faithful and true remain.
I only ask their lives may be
Pure as gems in the gates of pearl,
Lives to brighten and bless the world—
This I ask for my boy and girl.
I ask to clasp their hands again
’Mid the holy hosts of heaven,
Enraptured say: “I am here, oh! God,
And the children Thou hast given."
The Refiner’s Gold.
He stood before my heart’s closed door,
And asked to enter in;
But I had barred the passage o’er
By unbelief and sin.
He came with nail-prints in his hands,
To set my spirit free;
With wounded feet he trod a path
To come and sup with me.
He found me poor and brought me gold,
The fire of love had tried,
And garments whitened by his blood,
My wretchedness to hide.
The glare of life had dimmed my eyes,
Its glamour was too bright.
He came with ointment in his hands
To heal my darkened sight.
He knew my heart was tempest-tossed,
By care and pain oppressed;
He whispered to my burdened heart,
Come unto me and rest.
He found me weary, faint and worn,
On barren mountains cold;
With love’s constraint he drew me on,
To shelter in his fold.
Oh! foolish heart, how slow wert thou
To welcome thy dear guest,
To change thy weariness and care
For comfort, peace and rest.
Close to his side, oh! may I stay,
Just to behold his face,
Till I shall wear within my soul
The image of his grace.
The grace that changes hearts of stone
To tenderness and love,
And bids us run with willing feet
Unto his courts above.
A Story of the Rebellion.
The treacherous sands had caught our boat,
And held it with a strong embrace
And death at our imprisoned crew
Was sternly looking face to face.
With anxious hearts, but failing strength,
We strove to push the boat from shore;
But all in vain, for there we lay
With bated breath and useless oar.
Around us in a fearful storm
The fiery hail fell thick and fast;
And we engirded by the sand,
Could not return the dreadful blast.
When one arose upon whose brow
The ardent sun had left his trace;
A noble purpose strong and high
Uplighting all his dusky face.
Perchance within that fateful hour
The wrongs of ages thronged apace;
But with it came the glorious hope
Of swift deliverance to his race.
Of galling chains asunder rent,
Of severed hearts again made one,
Of freedom crowning all the land
Through battles gained and victories won.
“Some one,” our hero firmly said,
“Must die to get us out of this;”
Then leaped upon the strand and bared
His bosom to the bullets’ hiss.
“But ye are soldiers, and can fight,
May win in battles yet unfought;
I have no offering but my life,
And if they kill me it is nought.”
With steady hands he grasped the boat,
And boldly pushed it from the shore;
Then fell by rebel bullets pierced,
His life work grandly, nobly o’er.
Our boat was rescued from the sands
And launched in safety on the tide;
But he our comrade good and grand,
In our defence had bravely died.
Burial of Sarah.
He stood before the sons of Heth,
And bowed his sorrowing head;
“I’ve come,” he said, “to buy a place
Where I may lay my dead.
“I am a stranger in your land,
My home has lost its light;
Grant me a place where I may lay
My dead away from sight.”
Then tenderly the sons of Heth
Gazed on the mourner’s face,
And said, “Oh, Prince, amid our dead,
Choose thou her resting-place.
“The sepulchres of those we love,
We place at thy command;
Against the plea thy grief hath made
We close not heart nor hand.”
The patriarch rose and bowed his head,
And said, “One place I crave;
’Tis at the end of Ephron’s field,
And called Machpelah’s cave.
“Entreat him that he sell to me
For her last sleep that cave;
I do not ask for her I loved
The freedom of a grave.”
The son of Zohar answered him,
“Hearken, my lord, to me;
Before our sons, the field and cave
I freely give to thee.”
“I will not take it as a gift,”
The grand old man then said;
“I pray thee let me buy the place
Where I may lay my dead.”
And with the promise in his heart,
His seed should own that land,
He gave the shekels for the field
He took from Ephron’s hand.
And saw afar the glorious day
His chosen seed should tread,
The soil where he in sorrow lay
His loved and cherished dead.
Going East.
She came from the East a fair, young bride,
With a light and a bounding heart,
To find in the distant West a home
With her husband to make a start.
He builded his cabin far away,
Where the prairie flower bloomed wild;
Her love made lighter all his toil,
And joy and hope around him smiled.
She plied her hands to life’s homely tasks,
And helped to build his fortunes up;
While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet,
Were mingled and mixed in her cup.
He sowed in his fields of golden grain,
All the strength of his manly prime;
Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees,
Was as sweet as the dollar’s chime.
She toiled and waited through weary years
For the fortune that came at length;
But toil and care and hope deferred,
Had stolen and wasted her strength.
The cabin changed to a stately home,
Rich carpets were hushing her tread;
But light was fading from her eye,
And the bloom from her cheek had fled.
Her husband was adding field to field,
And new wealth to his golden store;
And little thought the shadow of death
Was entering in at his door.
Slower and heavier grew her step,
While his gold and his gains increased;
But his proud domain had not the charm
Of her humble home in the East.
He had no line to sound the depths
Of her tears repressed and unshed;
Nor dreamed ’mid plenty a human heart
Could be starving, but not for bread.
Within her eye was a restless light,
And a yearning that never ceased,
A longing to see the dear old home
She had left in the distant East.
A longing to clasp her mother’s hand,
And nestle close to her heart,
And to feel the heavy cares of life
Like the sun-kissed shadows depart.
The hungry heart was stilled at last;
Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.
A lonely man sat by the bier
Of a corpse that was going East.
The Hermit’s Sacrifice.
From Rome’s palaces and villas
Gaily issued forth a throng;
From her humbler habitations
Moved a human tide along.
Haughty dames and blooming maidens,
Men who knew not mercy’s sway,
Thronged into the Coliseum
On that Roman holiday.
From the lonely wilds of Asia,
From her jungles far away,
From the distant torrid regions,
Rome had gathered beasts of prey.
Lions restless, roaring, rampant,
Tigers with their stealthy tread,
Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery,
Met in conflict wild and dread.
Fierce and fearful was the carnage
Of the maddened beasts of prey,
As they fought and rent each other
Urged by men more fierce than they.
Till like muffled thunders breaking
On a vast and distant shore,
Fainter grew the yells of tigers,
And the lions’ dreadful roar.
On the crimson-stained arena
Lay the victims of the fight;
Eyes which once had glared with anguish,
Lost in death their baleful light.
Then uprose the gladiators
Armed for conflict unto death,
Waiting for the prefect’s signal,
Cold and stern with bated breath.
“Ave Cæsar, morituri,
Te, salutant,” rose the cry
From the lips of men ill-fated,
Doomed to suffer and to die.
Then began the dreadful contest,
Lives like chaff were thrown away,
Rome with all her pride and power
Butchered for a holiday.
Eagerly the crowd were waiting,
Loud the clashing sabres rang,
When between the gladiators
All unarmed a hermit sprang.
“Cease your bloodshed,” cried the hermit,
“On this carnage place your ban;”
But with flashing swords they answered,
“Back unto your place, old man.”
From their path the gladiators
Thrust the strange intruder back,
Who between their hosts advancing
Calmly parried their attack.
All undaunted by their weapons,
Stood the old heroic man;
While a maddened cry of anger
Through the vast assembly ran.
“Down with him,” cried out the people,
As with thumbs unbent they glared,
Till the prefect gave the signal
That his life should not be spared.
Men grew wild with wrathful passion,
When his fearless words were said.
Cruelly they fiercely showered
Stones on his devoted head.
Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit,
Victor in that hour of strife;
Gaining in his death a triumph
That he could not win in life.
Had he uttered on the forum
Struggling thoughts within him born,
Men had jeered his words as madness,
But his deed they could not scorn.
Not in vain had been his courage,
Nor for naught his daring deed;
From his grave his mangled body
Did for wretched captives plead.
From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful,
Ceased her sport in human gore;
And into her Coliseum
Gladiators came no more.
Songs for the People.
Let me make the songs for the people,
Songs for the old and young;
Songs to stir like a battle-cry
Wherever they are sung.
Not for the clashing of sabres,
For carnage nor for strife;
But songs to thrill the hearts of men
With more abundant life.
Let me make the songs for the weary,
Amid life’s fever and fret,
Till hearts shall relax their tension,
And careworn brows forget.
Let me sing for little children,
Before their footsteps stray,
Sweet anthems of love and duty,
To float o’er life’s highway.
I would sing for the poor and aged,
When shadows dim their sight;
Of the bright and restful mansions,
Where there shall be no night.
Our world, so worn and weary,
Needs music, pure and strong,
To hush the jangle and discords
Of sorrow, pain, and wrong.
Music to soothe all its sorrow,
Till war and crime shall cease;
And the hearts of men grown tender
Girdle the world with peace.

Dear friend:--I affectionately dedicate to you, this my first volume of defective matter as a token of my strong regard and esteem for your estimable character.
Though all the world censure, I shall be content if I have but pleased you, and feel myself rewarded should I see the light of your approving smale.
Your humble admirer,

PREFACE
I timidly present this little volume to the public with a full knowledge of its many faults. Indeed, I sometimes feel greatly frightened at my own temerity, and wonder how I would feel should an able critic deign to censure me as I deserve; but, if fortune should place my work in the hands of some clever judge, even though his criticism might seem harsh and unmerciful, I should feel that his judgements would benefit me in the future.
Never would I have allowed these imperfect productions to appear in print had I not been advised repeatedly by my many friends, especially one whose kind aid and disinterested friendship I shall never forget, to place this volume before the public.
I have implicitly obeyed them because I am aware that "intense timidity and subtle self-criticism" retard success equally as much as arrogance and conceit. E. B.
IN MEMORIAM FREDERICK DOUGLASS.
O Death! why dost thou steal the great,
With grudging like to strongest hate,
And rob the world of giant minds,
For whom all nature mourns and pines.
So few have we upon the earth,
Whom God ennobled at their birth,
With genius stamped upon their souls,
That guides, directs, persuades, controls.
So few who scorn the joys of life,
And labor in contending strife,
With Zeal increased and strength of ten,
To ameliorate the ills of men.
So few who keep a record clean,
Amid temptations strong and keen;
Who live laborious days and nights,
And shun the storms of passion's blights.
O, why cannot these linger here,
As lights upon this planet drear;
Forever in the public sight,
To lead us always to the right?
O Douglass! thou wert 'mong the few
Who struggles and temptations knew,
Yet bravely mounted towering heights,
Amazing both to blacks and whites.
The Sons of Ham feel desolate
Without thee, O Douglass the Great;
A nation's tears fall now with mine,
While mourning at thy sacred shrine.
IN MEMORY OF ARTHUR CLEMENT WILLIAMS.
"Alas! That such a soul should taste of death,"
Such lofty genius fade for want of breath,
Such wit find refuge 'mong the mournful, dead,--
Such brains lie silent in that narrow bed.
O, let the Negro weep most bitter tears!
Our brightest star from earth now disappears;
He would have stretched Ethiopia's hand to God
Had Death not early placed him 'neath the sod.
Ne'er breathed a man who saw that classic brow,
That did not then within himself allow
He saw a fixed desire to raise his race,
Imprinted on that noble, comely face.
There is one thought that pains me much to-night.
Although of him I sing and sometimes write,
I did not know this brave and gifted one,
This gallant youth,--this good, obedient son.
Yet, ne'er-the-less, I sighed when others sighed;
I wept to think of fondest hopes denied--
Of fleeting joys, of earthly woes and cares,
Of all that mother's tears and anxious prayers.
That soul so loved by all now rests in peace,
He's happy there where cares and sorrows cease;
In that celestial home he dwells to-night,
That place of love, of joy, of dazzling light.
(Son of Mrs. S. F. Williams. Written for the anniversary of his twenty-second birthday, August 23, 1891.)
EARLY SPRING.
"The early spring's sweet blush,
Like a maiden's beauteous flush,
Mounts the cheek of earth and sky,
With radiance soft and shy.
She comes like a virgin queen,
From her couch of emerald green,
Enrobed in garments bright,
With sunny locks of light
And gladness in her smile,
Beguiling care the while,
With music from the thrush,
And the brook's low warbling rush.
She stoops and whispers low,
To the violets 'neath the snow,
On bended knee she peeps,
In the home where the clover sleeps;
Her warm and fragrant breath
Has chased the gloom of death,
That shrouded tree and sky,
When winter's tears were nigh.
She dotes on the light and shade,
Her curls and mantle made.
O, Ye who weep and sigh!
Bid tears a long good-bye;
Be not now overcast
With Scenes of the buried past;
Forget the pangs of yore,
That made thy bosom sore;
Know that the soul grows strong
In battles great and long,
Weep not, nor e'en be sad,
Rejoice, for the world is glad!
CLASS SONG OF '91
We are sighing, for time is flying,
We are going from those so dear;
Friends are severed, though 'round us gathered,
With a cheer to greet us here.
Hope is beck'ning, our fate we're reck'ning,
Life seems bright, all earth is light;
Stars are gleaming, beacons of meaning,
Lights of truth to human sight.
CHORUS.
Then, fare you well, fare you well,
Life for us has just begun;
Don't regret, ne'er forget
This dear class of ninety one.
Hours of pleasure, our mem'ries treasure,
Life's best moments for these we sigh;
Thoughts of gladness will scatter sadness,
When we're dreaming of days gone by.
We are sighing, for time is flying,
Soon we part from friends so dear;
Guiding teachers, God's favor'd creatures,
Ah! good-bye to all friends here.
(Sung to the air of "What Care I," by Alice Hawthorne.")
ELIZA IN UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.
HER MARRIAGE.
I.
See! The moon is smiling
Down her brightest beams,
And the leaflets sleeping,
Whisper in their dreams,
Hear the merry music,
And the darkies' lays,
Hear the happy voices
Joining in the plays.
There in old Kentucky,
On a summer's night,
Stands a quadroon maiden,
Clothed in robes of white;
On her raven ringlets,
Orange blossoms sleep,
O'er her slender figure,
Bridal vestments sweep.
There we see her mistress,
Smiling now with pride,
On her handsome favorite,
Whom she sees a bride.
There is much rejoicing
O'er Eliza's match;
Misses Shelby fancies
George is a good "catch."
So the banjo's sounding,
And the darkies sing,
Hear them gayly dancing,
To the fiddle's ring.
But the dawn is breaking,
Guests must now disperse;
Quick the bow is silent,
Ere the sunlight bursts.
II.
The moon now shines upon a scene,
Much different from the one we left:
A mother gazes on her babe,
A mother feeling richly blest.
A smile of pride plays on her face,
A light of love shines in her eye.
She moves one black curl from its place,
And kisses it with many a sigh.
Ah! a mother's love is great,
E'en a slave could love and hate.
Swift the mother's blood ran cold,
When she knew her boy was sold.
III.
Haste thee, mother, pluck thy flower,
From the bed thou lov'st so well;
Plant it in a soil congenial,--
Quick! Or they'll thy flower sell.
How that mother tore her tresses,
When she learned they sold her bud;
Neither sigh nor tear escaped her,
Only her poor heart dropt blood.
"I will save thee, I'll rescue thee!"
Cried the mother with new life,
"Though my life's blood perish for it,
You'll be free from all this strife."
Close she wrapped her life, her treasure,
Quick she steals out in the night,
All things dear she bids farewell to,
Then she disappears from sight.
IV.
"Farewell! farewell!" Eliza cried,
"Old home, I loved so well;
Farewell! dear trees and shady groves,
I'll miss your magic spell.
Neath shrubs like these oft have I played,
These groves have sheltered me,
Just such a night my heart was won,
Beneath that old beech tree."
With hurrying feet, she quickly sped
Across the frosty ground:
Her fears were roused with awful dread,
At every quaking sound.
At length she neared the river's side,
Her blood turned cold with fright;
Those huge green blocks of floating ice
Will land not boat to-night.
She heard a voice--the voice of Sam,
And saw Haley, the man
Who bought her child, her all and all,
She clasped her boy and ran.
The trader watched her disappear
Far down the river's bank,
And when he saw her desperate leap,
All hope within him sank.
She vaulted o'er the current swift,
The ice now creaked beneath;
She leaps, she slips, she stands again,
Upon the river's reef.
Her shoes are gone, her feet are cut,
The water's dyed with blood,
With mad'ning shrieks she stumbled on,
Forgetful of the flood.
She sees a man, as in a dream,
Upon the other side;
She hears a voice--her heart is still,
"O, aid me, sir!" she cried:
"O, hide me quick, they've sold my boy,--
This child I'd die to save."
"Go thar," he said, "to them kind folks,
They'd save you from the grave."
V.
Eliza slept and dreamed of peace,
Of lands where all is rest;
Of bright, green shores where sorrows cease,
Of homes which God had blest.
She dreamed her child was happy there,
A free and merry boy;
She felt that God had heard her prayer,
And filled her life with joy.
She heard a step, she felt a tear
Upon her forehead fall;
She knew that he she loved was near,--
Her husband and her all.
VI.
Farewell! Farewell! Our time is spent.
We leave thee now in peace;
At last thou'rt free and highly blest,
May heaven thy joys increase.
Thy dear ones all around thee now,
Are bent in tearful prayer;
Their grateful words ascend to Him
Who brought them safely, there.
But we to-day lift up our hearts,
And kneel in prayer with thee;
We bless the God who broke the chain,
And set thy people free.
IMOGENE.
I.
We had been school-mates,--she and I,--
How sad, those years have all rolled by.
I loved her with a school-boy's heart,
A love from which I'll never part.
Though vultures tore my heart in twain,
Still would it beat for her again.
With fancy's eyes I see again,
The old school-house within the glen.
I see the master, bell in hand,
The ranks in single file command.
I feel my heart within me bound,
I welcome so the gladsome sound.
But now I'm tired of ball and bat;
Beneath a large, old oak I sat,
And watched the girls intent at play
With hearts so light and spirits gay.
Oh, that life's morning could return!
For boyhood's days I'll ever yearn.
And as I sat beneath the tree,
I said a maiden watching me,
But when I looked with smile benign,
She quickly turned her eyes from mine,
A maiden blush o'er-spread her face;
She turned from me with natural grace.
The maid was very fair to see,
And shy and prim as maid could be;
My boyish heart began to beat,
I rose and begged she'd have my seat.
But high she held her shapely head,
"I care not for it, sir," she said.
Advances after that were vain,
She treated me with cold disdain.
And still I tried with strongest will,
But she remained persistent still.
Ah! Imogene, had I but known,
We'd then had little need to mourn.
But Cupid's bow had touched my heart,
I struggled from that love to part.
A boy no more, a man to be
From that bright hour she gazed at me.
The hopes of youth had long been o'er,
I vowed I'd live, and love no more.
And gradually the years passed by:
My life was wrecked, I wished to die.
My Mother, on her dying bed,
Implored an heiress I would wed.
My wife was very fair to see,
But not the one beloved by me.
II. [ THE BALCONY SCENE. ]
The moon shone bright one cloudless night,
The earth was bathed in silver light.
I strolled along, quite tired of life,
I longed to rid myself of strife.
In vain I struggled to forget,
Oh, how I loathed the day we met.
I came upon a mansion bright,
From every window streamed the light;
Sweet strains of music reached my ear,
And peals of laughter loud and clear.
"Ah! this gay throng, I quickly see,
would be no place for woeful me."
I hurried on. But hark! Just see,
Who is this walks you balcony
All clothed in pure, seraphic white?--
I know that form, e'en though it's night.
I've heard that voice,--can it be true?
My Imogene, say--is it you?
Be still, she speaks; my God! 'Tis she!
Oh, list! My darling speaks of me,--
Of me, whom I believed she loathed:
Oh, can it be her love was clothed
Within a garb of blackest hate?
But now the knowledge comes too late
"O love, come back!" I hear her cry,
My Waldershaw, for thee I sing!
My heart was thine long years ago
Didst thou not see? Didst thou not know?
Alas! I kept the secret well,--
This love will be my funeral knell.
She wrings her hands in silent woe;
O God! I watch her shadow go
From off the lonely balcony,
And leave me sighing mournfully,
A still, small voice I've learned to hate,
Within me whispered,"Tis--too late.
III.
These prison-walls are bleak and drear;
Who would have thought I'd enter here.
They say four men will die to-day;
My blood, also, will ebb away.
Ah, well! 'tis sweet to die for love,
That sacred essence from above.
That wretch which spoke my darling's name
With free license in homes of shame,
Deserved to die, just as he did.
I killed him,--though the law forbid;
The slaughter of man's fellow-man.
His blood o'er heath and flower ran.
I hear a step. who may it be!
Some friend who comes to pity me.
A comely youth, his face is hid
His eyes are drooped beneath their lid.
The jailer locks and bars the door,
I see the light of day no more.
Who is this form that o'er me bends,
And rapture to my spirit lends?
"What! Imogene, who brings thee here
To this bleak prison, dark and drear?
Why weepest thou? 'Tis for the best,
I'll pass from woe to realms of rest."
Why does she hold her kerchief near
My nostrils? Sure, she is sincere!
A stupor deadens limb and will.
My brain receives impressions still,--
But Oh, a deadness grips my heart;
Can it be true from life I part?
I see her change her garb for mine,--
I watch her scrawl a single line,
I hear her cry, "Yes, love, I sigh
That I but once for thee can die;
Far better had'st thou never seen
The proud, but faithful Imogene."
I hear her fall upon the ground.
The jailor enters at the sound,
And bears me from the darkened cell.
And Imogene,--how can I tell
The madness of that dreadful hour!
To save my love, I'd not the power.
I knew no more, my senses slept.
Of brain, of mind I was bereft.
When reason cleared the dark away,
I hastened where my darling lay.
With maddened speech I neared the spot,
But there my Imogene was not
Too late! My God! I see my love!
O angels from the choir above,
Oh, stay that hand that deals the blow!
Oh, raise that arm that trembles so!
My God! Too late! The last I've seen
Of her I love, lost Imogene.
DESTINY.
I.
In far-off England, years ago,
There dwelt a wise old sage
Who, from the book of future years
could tare for you a page
One day there came into his home
A youth of noble birth,
who asked that he'd unfold to him
His mission on the earth.
"Lord Allsmere," spoke the rev'rend sage,
"This day is born for you
A wife, in far-off Italy,
For whom, one day, you'll sue,
Your bride is born of humble birth,
No gold or lands has she;
But you will love her just the same,
However poor she be."
"What!--I? How dare you say these things
To me, Lord Allsmere's heir!
I take a, beggar for my wife,
With me my wealth to share?
Ha! Ha! A fool you think me then.
I'll let my chances slip,
And leave the wealth of all the land
To kiss a pauper's lip!"
You'll see, young man," the sage replied,
"That all I've said is true,
In Venice, near the riverside
A bride is born for you.
You'll know her by a blood-red mark
That stains her slender arm;
Upon that mark a leaf is traced,
Quite like a stately palm."
"I'll die before I'll bring such shame
Upon my noble home,
I'll seek this child, and murder her,
And then o'er seas I'll roam.
'Tis well you've told me where she bides;
I'll leave England to-night.
Farewell, old man, you'll see that I
Will make this thing allright."
Ah, man! Thou egotist,--how vain
To fight against thy fate;
Know thou the laws if destiny
Are powerful and great!
And its decrees obscured trolls thee
Thou trav'lest in the night!
Bide thou with peace, thou'it reach thy goal
Without the aid of light.
II.
The night was dark, the air was cold,
The city slept in peace;
A whistle shrill rung on the breeze
But soon was made to cease.
Two men, both clad in strange costumes
Stole near the river's side;
They launched a babe within a crib
Upon the flowing tide.
"At last, 'tis o'er; the babe will drown;
She'll be no bride of mine.
I'll show that old phlegmatic sage
For her I'll never pine.
And now, away to Lady dare,
The woman of my heart!
Oh, for that hour when we'll be one,
On earth, no more to part!"
Lord Allsmere traveled all that night,
And reached his lady's side,
And pledged again his vows of troth
To his intended bride.
And he forgot the lonely babe
He launched upon the deep,
But God, who guards the sparrows' nest,
Watched o'er the babe in sleep.
And when the morning's roseate tint
Was seen to light the sky,
A stray gondolier saw thecrib.
And greatly wondered why
An infant's wail was loudly heard
Upon the water's breast.
He took the crib within his boat,
And soothed the babe to rest.
He landed with his precious charge
And placed her near the gates
Of old Count Dido's stately home,
Of whom the world relates
Is seven times a millionaire,
With neither kith nor kin.
And there the babe was reared, and grew
A maiden free from sin.
III.
Oh, list! to sounds that cheer the heart;
Stay! 'Tis the clarion's peal;
The harp is mingled with the tones
That make the senses reel.
And from the water's surface blue
I hear the light guitar;
Some knight of Venice sings of love
That is his guiding star.
And why this song and merriment?
Count Dido gives a ball,
And his adopted daughter stands
Admired by one and all.
And oh, who would not love to gaze
Into those liquid eyes!
To clasp that slender, rounded form
Would seem like paradise.
But Mariann knows nought of this,
She see one form, one face,
She hears the music of one voice.
She notes the air of grace
That marks her hero from the rest.
Lord Allsmere owns her heart,
And she not his?--Oh, dreadful thought
That makes the tear-drops start.
But see! he, too, has stood apart
From that gay company,
And notes with eyes lit up with love,
The charms that others see.
"Ye stars! I've never loved before,"
Lord Allsmere cries amazed.
"I thought I loved the Lady Clare,
But pshaw! My brain was crazed.
"I've loved a score of times, and more ,
But 'twas not love like this .
My heart's on fire with doubt and fear,
Yet 'tis a state of bliss.
Oh, love, that wrings the human heart
Who has not felt its pain!
Who does not know its bitter sweets,
That madden soul and brain!"
Lord Allsmere smiles on Mariann,
And begs a moonlight walk.
Her gentle hand is on his arm,
And soon engrossed in talk--
They near the famed Rialto's arch,
He finds for her a seat,
And lays his sore and bleeding heart
With fervor at her feet.
And Oh! the joy that thrills her soul,
To know she owns his heart.
Such heaven, ah, yes! 'tis paradise!
Will bliss like this depart?
Two arms she lifts, such perfect limbs;
Her hands are clasped in prayer.
But oh! What is that blood-red mark
He sees imprinted there?
He grasps the slender wrist, and looks
Upon the lovely arm;
And there a tiny leaf is traced
Quite like a stately palm
"The babe I drowned!" Lord Allsmere gasps.
"Say! how can this be true?
Explain!--I'm dazed!--Long years ago!
I sought to murder you!
"Aha! You've crossed my path again;
The sage then spoke aright.
Plebian! Ah, no! you'll ne'er be mine,
I'll slay you, sure , to-night!
And who is Destiny that dares
Choose beggar for my bride;
Ye powers above, I pluck this thorn
That lingers in my side!"
"Oh, spare! Oh, spare! I thee implore,
I'll hide myself airway.
On thy dear face I'll never look,
Nor see the light of day.
I love thee! Ah, my heart is sore,
Why dost thou hate me so?
And what is this that thou dost speak?
Pray tell, I fain would know."
"Alas! I cannot do the deed,
My heart a traitor proves.'
He slowly hides his sword from view,
And from his hand removes
A brilliant ring with opals set,
And lustrous stones that shine.
"See here ! this ring will noir decide
If you will e'er be mine.
"If e'en in days that are to come,
I see your treacherous face,
And on that hand I loathe and spurn,
This ring finds not its place,
I swear to you this night in truth--
I swear I'll have your heart !
And if, instead, you wear this ring,
We'll wed, no more to part."
He throws the ring far in the deep,
The water's sink it low.
He leaves her with, an angry oath,
To bear this dreadful blow.
Weep not, O maid! Dost thou not know
That thou art led by fate?
And it decreed e'er thou wast born
That thou shouldst be his mate?
IV.
Ten years have passed; they've done their work
On Allsmere's stony heart.
No longer proud, nor arrogant
He feels love's piercing dart.
He longs again to touch that hand,
To kiss that fevered check;
Away! he hastens to that land
His destined bride to seek.
He sees her by the water's side,
She kneels in tearful prayer.
"What does' she lisp? What are those, words?
What is that sparkling there?
My ring! O Mariann, arise.
My love! Forgive thou me!
My other soul! I strove in vain
To baffle destiny."
"Lord Allsmere!--See, I wear thy ring?"
The maid, uprising, cried,
"In yonder fish, the cook, yestern,
By chance, the diamond spied.
And now, my love, no more this strife,
My heart's an fire for thee.
Oh, thou canst never fathom, love;
My heart's deep agony!"
"Come, Mariann! Fate's chosen bride,
Twin soul, I sought to slay.
Come to my heart, thou'lt never know
A care I cannot lay.
Come, warm my life,--thou beacon-light,
Shine thou, this night, on me,
And I will bless forevermore
My planning Destiny.
GERARDA.
I.
The day is o'er and twilight's shade,
Is darkening forest, glen and glade;
It steals within the old church door,
And casts its shadows on the floor;
It throws its gloom upon the bride,
And on her partner by her side:
But ah! It has no power to screen
The loveliest form that ever was seen.
Sweet tones as from the angels' lyre,
Came pealing from the ancient choir;
They rouse the brain with magic power,
And fill with light that twilight hour,
Some artist's soul one easily sees,
Inspires the hands that touch the keys;
A genius sits and wakes the soul,
With sounds that o'er the passions roll.
"Till death we part," repeats the bride,
She shuddered visibly and sighed;
And as she leaves the altar rail,
She's startled, end her features pale,
For in the ancient choir above,
The man who sits and plays of love,
Has held her heart for many a year.
Alas! her life is sad and drear.
He never dreamed he roused a thrill,
Within that heart that seemed so still;
He never knew the hours of pain,
That racked that tired and troubled brain.
He could not see that bleeding heart,
From which his face would not depart;
He never could have known her grief,
From which, alas! there's no relief.
At last she thought the fire had cooled,
And love's strong guardian she had ruled;
'Twas then she vowed to be the bride
Of him who stands at her side.
Ill-fated hour! She sees too late,
This man she cannot help but hate'
He, whom she promised to obey,
Until from earth she's called away.
This life is sometimes dark and drear,
No lights within the gloom appear.
Gerarda smiled and danced that night,
As though her life had been all bright;
And no one knew a battle waged,
Within that heart so closely caged.
The few who've never felt love's dart,
Know not the depth of woman's heart.
II.
Gerarda sat one summer day,
With easel, brush, and forms of clay,
Within her much-loved studio,
Where all that makes the senses glow.
Were placed with great artistic skill;
Content, perhaps, she seems, and still,
She'd give this luxury and more,
To ease that heart so bruised and sore.
Her paintings hang upon the wall,
The power of genius stamps them all;
On this material soil she breathes,
But in her spiritual world she leaves
Her mind, her thoughts, her soul, her brain,
And wakes from fancy's spell with pain.
And thus her pictures plainly show,
Not nature's self but ideal glow.
And now to-day o'er canvas bent,
She strives to place these visions sent
From that bright world she loves so well,
But fancy fails to cast her spell,
And sick at heart, Gerarda sighs,
And wonders why her must denies
The inspiration given before,
When oft in heaven her soul would soar.
But now her ear has caugh a sound,
That causes heart and brain to bound,
With rapture wild, intense, sincere,
For, list! those strains are coming near;
She grasps the brush, her muse awoke,
Within those notes her genius spoke;
An Angelo might e'en be proud,
Of forms that o'er her vision crowd.
What power is this that swells that touch,
And sends it throbbing with a rush,
That renders all its hearers dumb!
If he be man, whence did he come?
Lo! 'tis the same who played with power
The wedding march that twilight hour;
The strains seem caught from souls above,
It is the very food of love.
And yet, he's neither old nor bent,
A comeliness to youth is lent;
A radiant eye, a natural grace,
An eager, noble, passionate face,--
All these are his, with genius spark,
That guides him safely through the dark,
To hearts that throb and souls that feel,
At every grand and solemn peal.
Triumphant Wagner's soul he reads,
And then with Mozart gently pleads,
And begs the weary cease to mope,
But rise and live in dreams of hope,
The sounds have ceased,-- how drear life
seems!
He wakes from out his land of dreams,
And fins Gerarda rapt, amazed,
In speechless ecstacy she gazed.
"Neville! thou king of heroes great,
A tale of love thou dost relate,
In tones that rend my heart in twain,
With intense agony and pain,
Forgive whate'er I say to-day,
Thy touch has ta'en my sense away:
O man that dreams, thou can'st not see,
That I, alas! doth worship thee!
"Behold! thou Orpheus, I kneel
And beg thee, if thou e'er canst feel,
Or sympathize with my unrest,
To thrust this dagger in my breast.
Shrink not! I can no longer live
Content in agony to writhe;
And death with thy had given to me,
Will be one blissful ecstacy."
He starts, and lifts her from her knees,
Her features pale, and soon he sees
That tired heart so sick and sore
Can bear its grief and woe no more.
She swoons-- her pulse has ceased to beat,
A holy calm, divine and sweet,
Has settled on the saintly face,
Lit up with beauty, youth and grace.
Neville amazed, in rapture stands,
Admiring hair, and face, and hands.
Forgetful then of hour and place,
He stoops to kiss the beauteous face,
And at the touch the fire of love,
So pure as to come from above,
Consumes his heart and racks his brain,
With longing fear and infinite pain.
The kiss, as with a magic spell,
Has roused Gerarda,-- it seems to tell,
'Tis time to bid her conscience wake,
And off her soul this burden shake.
"Neville, forgive'" with downcast eyes,
Gerarda sorrowfully cries;
"I've told thee of my love and woe,--
The things I meant thou should'st not know."
"Gerarda thou hast woke the heart,
That ne'er before felt passion's smart;
Oh! is it true thou'rt lost to me,
My love, my heart knows none but thee!"
"Enough! Neville, we must forget,
That in this hour our souls have met,
Farewell! we ne'er must meet in life,
For I'm, alas! a wedded wife."
III.
Why ring those bells? what was that cry?
The night winds bear it as they sigh;
What is this crushing, maddening scene?
What do those flames of fire mean?
They surge above Gerarda's home,
Through attic, cellar, halls, they roam,
Like some terrific ghost of night,
Who longs from earth to take his flight.
Gerarda stands amid the fire,
That leaps above with mad desire,
And rings her hands in silent grief,
She fears for her there's no relief.
But now she hears a joyous shout,
A breathless silence from without,
That tells her God has heard her prayer,
And sent a noble hero there.
And here he comes, this gallant knight,
Her heart rejoices at the sight,
For 'tis Neville, with aspect grave.
Who risked his life, his love to save.
And all have perished now but she,
Her husband and her family.
Mid tears and sobs she breathes a prayer,
For loved ones who are buried there.
Neiville has brushed her tears away,
Together silently they pray
And bless the Lord with thankful prayer
For all his watchfulness and care.
"Gerarda, love," he whispers now,
Implanting kisses on her brow,
"This earth will be heaven to me,
For all my life, I'll share with thee."
THE VESTAL VIRGIN.
I.
Virgin of the vestal flame,
Numa's child so chaste and fair,
Ah! Floronia is thy name!
Goddess of the raven hair;
Weepest thou o'er love denied?
Thou canst ne'er become a bride.
Thou hast sworn to tend the fires,
While thy bosom pants with life,
That the vestal hall requires,
Hence thou ne'er canst be a wife:
Germ of death, Floronia fair,
Sleepest in thy heart,-- beware!
Glorious night! the evening air
Shakes the murmuring fountain's breast,
Moonbeams now their lustre share,
Gives to earth an air of rest."
From the convent's garden bower,
Comes Floronia at midnight's hour,
Deep in thought, yet still she hears
Light steps rustling o'er the leaves
'Tis a phantom here she fears,
To the garden bower she cleaves,
Fearful lest some wandering shade,
Her retreat a visit paid.
"Ay, no mortal dare come near,"
Thinks Floronia with affright.
"Guarded all these gates are here,
Yet the vision comes in sight,
Sacred are these cloistered walls,
Vestal maids receive no calls.
"See! the moon is shining now,
On his face she throws her light,--
Ah! methinks I know that brow,
And that sparkling eye so bright,
Lucius! my heart's desire,
Why for me thou dost inquire?
"Lucius, dost thou not know
All such meetings end in death,
Thou wilt bring us both to woe,
Love, thy boldness steals my breath,
Pledged to feed the vestal flame,
Never can I bear thy name."
"Ah, Floronia! could'st thou know,
Mine's a flame more potent still,
Sick my heart with passion's glow,
Mad my brain with thoughts that kill.
Rome, for wisdom thou'rt renowned,
'Tis a boasted, hollow sound.
"Lofty walls and guarded gates
Thwart not love's most strong desire;
Listen, while my tongue relates
How I quenched love's burning fire:
Deepest abyss, love, for thee,
Would I plunge, thy face to see.
"Tarquin built in days of yore,
Subterranean passage here,
Lovers, aye, like me, before,
Trod this aqueduct so drear.
Love, I beg thee fly with me,
See, I give my life for thee."
"Lucius, behold the dawn,
Go, I pray thee, leave me here,
Mark the first fresh breath of morn,
Leave this cloister dark and drear,--
Lo! ye gods-- we are perceived,
Warnings, they, no doubt, received.
"Lucius, I beg thee, fly!
Go, my, heart, think not of me.
Love, I cannot see thee die,
Look !-- they carry chains for thee;
Hear the virgins' dismal cry,
Darling, thou wilt surely die.
"See! the pontiff cometh near,
Fly, my own, thou canst be free!
See thy unknown passage drear,--
Lucius, think not of me!
Vain! the lictors bind him fast,
They have stilled his voice at last.
"With those rods they're scourging him,
Vesta! save my early love!
Oh! they tear him limb from limb;
Help him, gods, who reign above;
Mark! his large and bright blue eyes
Seek my face before he dies.
"Lucius, lost love, farewell!
I will meet thee soon again;
Short indeed was love's sweet spell,
Full of misery, dread and pain;
Ah! they bind me now in chains,
Soon released I'll be from pains."
II.
"Drear this dungeon, cold and dark,
Showers of stones are on my tomb;
They have left a single spark,
In this bleak and silent room.
Slowly must I perish here,
In this gloomy dungeon drear.
"Not a dagger have I,-- none,
O, to end this torturing pain;
Poison, weapons-- on, note one--
Wild my thoughts and mad my brain.
Lucius, call me, love, to thee,
Set this tortured spirit free.
"Rome, thou tyrant,--barbarous land,
Jupiter dost frown on thee;
May Olympu's angry hand
Set these tortured vestals free!
Dark my soul with dread and fear,
Darling Lucius, enter her.
"Death!-- dost thou-- encompass me?
Is it-- thee-- that grips-- my heart?
Come,-- thou friend, I-- welcome thee
True ,-- with torture,--now, I part?
Lucius,--for thee ,--I cry,
Gods!--at last--at last--I die."
CHARMION'S LAMENT.
Oh, for a drink, to-night,
Mixed by some god of might,
A draught of strange device,
Though of exorbitant price,
To give this tortured soul
The calmness of control!
Oh, for a cup of balm
From a kind and heavenly palm,
To soothe the aching pain
That racks this tired brain
With never-ending thought
Of the battle that must be fought!
Oh, for a potion strong
To keep the soul from wrong;
To give me strongest will
These waves of pain to still;
To ease this heaving breast,
So wild with deep unrest!
A balm I ask? For shame!
How dare I breathe the name!
What balm is there for care,
Except one heartfelt prayer
To Osiris full of love,
Who weeps for me above
Away with sighs of pain!
Away with tears like rain,
That blind this tired eye
And cause the heart to sigh.
This truth I've found, I bless,
There is no happiness.
Ah! poets sing of love,
Fashioned by Powers above.
'Tis naught but fancy wrought,
A flimsy, graceful thought
As fatally false as vain,
Trust not the tale again.
They paint two hearts as one,
Who know no other sun
But the light from violet eyes
In their connubial skies
Of a love that ends with breath,
True ever until death.
Years have I watched this thing
Of which these wise bards sing;
Through Winter's frost and snow,
I've seen a spectre go,
Resembling Venus fair,
Which they do paint with care.
And when flowers of spring,
To earth their fragrance bring,
This phantom, still, I chase,
I run with her a race,
And seek to grasp the hand
Which say they, hearts command.
And when the autumn came,
I watched her just the same;
In rosy, fragrant June,
When time had reached her noon,
Forsooth, I saw her there,
Just as she fled in air.
She is a siren bright,
That oft your hearts delight;
Garbed in a mantle black,
She heart and soul doth rack
Not constant, nor yet true,
A bitter foe to you.
Enough, ye bards, of love
Fashioned by hands above,
That live, ye sing, alway,
And grow more bright each day.
Go to! and tune thy Muse,
To sing us truthful news.
Nor tell me, ye, of joy,
Do not my soul annoy
With hopes that never bloom!
Better ye bought my tomb,
And laid me down to rest,
Than tire this weary breast!
I'll harden brain and heart.
Thy oft-sung Cupid's dart
Will never pierce my soul
Through the armor of control.
Away with pain and strife,
I'll live a restful life.
I long not now for balm,
This reckless soul to calm!
Keep thou, ye gods, your drink,
I fear not now to think,
The violent storm has past,
And I breathe peace at last.
THE HERMIT.
I.
The hermit sat within his cave,
A prey to anxious care;
Distress sat gravely on his brow,
And suffering slumbered there.
His form is worn with constant fasts,
His eyes are dimmed from tears,
Within this gloomy wilderness,
He's spent full twenty years.
Yet 'neath the lofty, classic brow,
The window of his soul
O'erlooks a face where beauty dwells,
And strong emotions roll.
To-night, the tempter's crafty arts,
Repeated oft before,
Has stirred ambition's smoldering fires,
And roused the hopes of yore.
"Alone, alone;" he sadly sighs,
No human voice I hear;
For twenty years no son of Eve
Has passed this prison, drear.
No gentle hand has grasped my palm,
And with its feeling touch,
Taught me to value sympathy,
My fate has ne'er been such.
"And yet, my vision can recall,
A bright but buried past;
The casket of those happy days,
Too bright by far to last,
Is strewn with hope's dead blossom leaves,
That withered, ay, too fast,
Ere fragrance lent her added charm,
They perished in the blast.
"Within those crumbled halls of time,
With fancy's kindly eyes,
I see a form flit to and fro,
With beauty's soft surprise.
Her smile is like the April sun
That gladdens leaf and flower;
Her tear of tender sympathy
Is like to April's shower.
"A hermit, near to nature's heart,
For twenty years I've lived;
And dark temptations could my life,
In agony I've writhed.
But now, no more I'll linger here,
I'll let the die be cast,
I'll live once more those days of yore,
And breathe again that past."
II.
The sun has sunk behind the hills,
The day has gone to rest,
A sweet repose has settled now
On nature's placid breast.
A palace 'mong the Syrian plains,
Is all ablaze with light;
The king of Ansarey's divan,
With splendor shines to-night.
Before this august presence now,
There bows a stately knight,
The hermit of the wilderness
Is welcomed to his sight.
His form is wasted now no more,
And lustrous is his eye,
A strong conceit replaced the look
That once was calm and shy.
"Thy majesty will hear me now?"
He asks with rising fear,
"I've loved the princess Fakredeen,
This many, many a year.
Full twenty years ago, O king,
Her shadow then was I,
And if you say me nay, to-day,
O Sovereign, I will die!"
"Most noble Englishman, Sir Luke,
I've ne'er disclosed to thee;
A sacred Pantheon I hold,
That is beloved by me;
Within its walls, the god of light,
To Syria's heart most dear,
For centuries revealed to us
Our future dangers here.
"Come thou, and Fakredeen, my love,
We'll to the fane repair,
An answer to thy lover's quest,
We will elicit there.
And if the gods approve the match,
My blessing follows thee,
If not, then thou, O noble knight,
I must refuse to see."
He rose; and straightway followed him,
The princess Fakredeen,
The hermit of the wilderness,
And subjects clothed in green,
Who carried with them garlands fair,
They lifted to the sky.
As solemnly they chanted low,
A hymn to Gods on high.
And silently, through portico,
They neared the sacred fane,
Where sculptured forms of ideal grace,
Serene and calm remain.
This noble hierarchy fair,
The god, the nymph, the faun,
New beauties rise and greet the view,
As does the sky at dawn.
They paused before a statue made
Of ivory and gold,
The color pure and polished high,
Displaced a matchless mold.
"The god of Ansarey, O knight,"
The sovereign whispered now,
"My father's god, look thou on him,
Thy knee before him bow."
"Before this figure, them, O king,"
The hermit calmly said,
"Libations flowed from golden cups,
And scores of steers were bled.
O god of light, if power thou hast,
Give Fakredeen to me,
And with my pen I will proclaim
Thy glorious deity."
" I must the gold invoke, Sir Like,--
O god of Ansarey,
Shall Fakredeen be given away?
Give heed, O god, I pray.
This knight from northern shores came he,
My daughter fair to woo,
He is a Christian, sacred god,
Will he always prove true?"
"Hold thou! O Syrian ruler, brave,"
The god was heard to say,
"Unless the vows to worship me ,
Thou sure must say him, nay.
The God to whom he knelt in prayer,
Who died at Calvary,
He must denounce, and live to prove
A dangerous enemy."
"Oh, heaven forbid!" the hermit cries
With heartfelt agony.
"An enemy to God, the Son?--
Oh, that can never be.
My God! I have abandoned thee,
Alas! 'tis now too late
To ask forgiveness, yet I know,
Thee, I can never hate."
"O Luke, my own, remember thou,"
The princess whispered low,
Those years of dark estrangement, love,
And all my bitter woe.
Admirers came, and suitors yearned,
My heart for thee did pine,
O Luke, forsake thy foolish creed,
And let my god be thine.
"Ah, Fakredeen! my promised bride,"
The hermit then replied,
"For twenty years a moment's sight
Of thee I was denied.
O sovereign, king of Ansarey,
Say to the god of light,
That I denounce the Christian's God,
And bow to him to-night!"
"Hold thou! O Syrian Ruler brave,"
The god began a new,
The man who to his god is false,
To thee can ne'er be true.
Give not the princess, Fakredeen
To traitor false and vain,
Lest he to thee, as to his God,
Bring agony and pain."
"Almighty Father, wise and great,"
With sobs the hermit cried,
"I see Thy hand beneath this cloud,
That deadens all my pride.
That faithful heart, so brave and true,
Was never meant for me;
Farewell, my love, I go to die
A hermit cheerfully."
A TALE OF ITALY.
Twas eve in sunny Italy;
The world was bright as earth can be,
In that delightful month of June,
When sun, and birds, and leaves, and flowers,
And e'en the queen of night, -- the moon,
Make earth one of fair Eden's bowers.
The wind was singing to the sea,
A soft and plaintive symphony.
The shadows of this placid eve,
To Count Villani's loggia cleave,
Where guests of wealth and noble birth
Await,-- with eyes more eager growing,
As darkness hides the views of earth,
And stars begin their silver showing,
The entrance of the lovely bride,
Ninna Maso,-- Villani's pride.
An hour or more they've waited now,
Anxiety is on each brow.
A sudden fear of coming woe
Like weights upon their hearts are falling.
They'd give a goodly price to know
What unforeseen event is calling
The bride who weds Count Villani,
The richest man in Italy.
And now the gossip tongues begin
To tell, in spite of outside din,
How Count Villani old and gray,
From poverty and want rescuing
The girl whom he will wed to-day.
And then their fears again renewing,
Their talk is of a serious strain,
Some fear to longer there remain.
But hold! a shriek, a piercing cry,
A woman's scream is heard near by;
And guests involuntary start,
And move to where the sound's proceeding,--
That sound that seems to rend the heart.
They look and see the bridge receding
From yonder spacious balcony,
And hear her wailing mournfully.
In trailing robes of pearly white,
With loosened curls -- a sunny sight,
The graceful form in flowers arrayed,
As if in maddest haste pursuing
Some fallen Peri; this lovely maid
Madly sped on, her speed renewing.
What is her fate-- her history?
Who will explain this mystery?
II.
"Twas midnight over Italy,
Still was the wind, and calm the sea.
The ceiling of this glowing earth,
Frescoed with stars of twinkling light,
Whose orbs were bright with quiet mirth,
O'er-looked a sad and mournful sight--
A maid in bridal garments 'rayed,
Beside the sea quite wildly prayed.
It was Ninna, Villani's pride,
Who weary, weeps by the sea-side.
Before her eyes the buried past,
Like spectres of the midnight hour,
O'er saddened heart its visions cast
With all their former maddening power.
Her home in Florence far away,
Her fancy paints as bright as day.
She sees herself ingirlish frocks,
With golden, silken, curling locks
That crown a head and forehead high,
Above the brows of velvet touch,
That over-look a deep blue eye,
Where quiet sadness linger much.
Within an ante-chamber dear
She sits. A harpsichord is near.
'Tis eve-- this time of which she dreams,
The dying sun has sent his gleams
To play on Pallas sculptured there,
To light the ancient liggio,
And kiss the maiden torso fair.
And while she sees the sunset glow,
A passion seizes heart and brain,
And bids her strike a mournful strain.
She wakes the harpsichord to life,
She dreams of peace away from strife,
"Of sunny isles of Lake Cashmere,"
Of the sacred grass near the Ganges' side,
Where he plane-trees lie reflected clear,
"And the valley of gardens lie beside."
She starts, and quickly turns to find
A man with face both proud and kind.
"This is Signora Ninna fair?
I've heard of thy rich gift so rare,"
The stranger said with courteous bow.
"And know this era brings to light,
As critics artists will allow,
A soul aflame with genius bright.
O maid, art thou content to die
Unknown, and in oblivion sigh?
"Great Orpheus awoke the trees,
But in thy hands thou hold'st the keys
That hope the hearts of human -kind.
O maid, the world will bow to thee.
List thou to me and thou wilt find
A mine more rich than India's sea!
My youth is gone, my hair is gray,
Yet I will see thy famous day.
"Signora, thou must fitted be
To join this pictured pageantry.
To glorious Rome thou must repair,
Where lives the giant minds of art,
And study with the masters there.
From Florence, then, thou wilt depart,
And leave behind thy poverty;
They'll soon forget thy history.
"And now I will disclose to thee,
What I would have thee know and see.
This old, impassioned, foolish heart
Dost beat most tenderly for thee.
Signora, Cupid's thrilling dart
Has pierced an old man fearfully!
Hear me, Ninna mia, I pray,
Send not a hungry heart away!
"I only ask, O maid, of thee,
That thou'll bestow thy hand on me,
When thou for years have studied there,
(And I, thy every want supply)
Where master minds of art repair.
Oh, thou wilt ne'er these hopes deny.
Reflect on thy celebrity,
For thou'll be Countess Villani!"
"Oh, tempt me not!" fair Ninna cried.
"You offer gold and fame beside.
I care not for your boasted wealth,
I hate the thing you value much--
The coin's more dear to you than health,
That thrill you with their every touch.
But fame! That I could tell to thee,
How dear a thing is power to me!
"Alas! if I will make my mark,
It must be done without a heart,
For I must sell myself to thee.
This is the payment thou dost ask;
No longer gay, no longer free,
Thou would'st confine me to the task
Of wedding, and of pleasing thee
For this -- I'll reap celebrity.
"Look down Via de Bardi there,
See yonder youth with raven hair?
He has a soul akin to mine;
A poet's lyre he tunes at will!
My heart is his , 'twill ne'er be thine!
When he is near the tempest's still.
Shall I for fame's bright, glittering page
These passions trod that storm and rage?
"And yet'tis sweet to think of power.
Will I e'er see that glorious hour
When counts and princes bend the knee,
And queens of every land will smile
With pleasure at my symphoney
While I their leisure hours beguile?--
Go, tempter, go. Call thou again,
And I'll give thee thy answer, then."
This scene of fancy passes by,
And Ninna sees within her eye.
While she thus prays beside the sea,
The hour when she has bade farewell
To him she loves most tenderly.
Her agony, no tongue can tell,
Yet she has given up all for art,
And e'en has trampled on her heart.
She sees herself in glorious Rome.
Of intellect it is the home;
And after years of study there,
She wakes to fame of which she dreamed,
Surrounded by her votaries fair.
Life, others thought, an Eden seemed.
But no! a serpent day by day,
Slowly ate her heart away.
And now Villani comes to claim
The girl who'll share his wealth and name.
To-day, she was to be his bride;
And while her maids her form arrayed,
A serving-boy stole near her side,
And in her hand a missive laid.
Amazed, the words therein she read,
And this is what the letter said:
"Among the sick and dead I lie,
A voice within has said I'll die;
Before another fading day,
This plague that sweeps o'er Italy,
Will long have made my body clay;
But while I go I think of thee.
Wilt thou not let my fainting eye
Rest on thy face before I die?"
Then wild her shrieks rung through the hall,
Arousing guests, spectators all.
And madly rushing through the streets,
She swiftly neared the water-side.
Escaping all the friends she meets,
Who know that She's Villani's bride.
She wrings her hands and sobs that he
She loves should die so mournfully.
Just now she thought she heard a groan,
A smothered sigh, and then a moan
Beneath those sheltering lime-trees there.
Softly she steals, and lists again;
She breathes to heaven another prayer,
And quickly, wildly rushing then
Beholds her lover, lonely dying,
Beside the lime-trees sadly lying.
"Nello Mio!" she whispers now,
As with her tears she bathes his brow,
Too late I know the human heart
Is master of the human will.
Ambition's all-consuming spark
Will ne'er tender passions kill.
O love! my art has slowly died
Since I refused to be thy bride.
"'Twas thou who woke my Muse at will,
'Twas thou who could the tempests still.
With thee I would have touched the skies.
My pinions into fancy soar;
Inspired by those, thy love-lit eyes,
Imaginations realms explore.
But no! my soul on flattery fed,
My genius fades, and now is dead."
"Weep not, Ninna mia," he cries.
He moans again, and sadly sighs.
'Twas destined that our paths should stray
Dear heart, such are the things of life.
We'll meet within a brighter day,
Where there is neither woe nor strife.
Farewell! my spirit wings its flight,
Borne up by thine orb's softest light."
"Nello! I cannot see thee go
From out this life of mine, no, no!
Death sure, will likewise come to me;
This torture cannot longer last,
My spirit soon Shall follow thee.
The plague its fetters o'er me cast.
I die: my soul is borne with thee,
To the boundless sphere of eternity."
CAPT. SMITH AND POCAHONTAS.
The night hung o'er Virginia's forest wild,
Stately with beauty unsurpassed before
Shone the full moon serenely; and the wind
As it roused slumb'ring leaflets from their dreams,
Wakens alike the violet wet with dew,
And fans the lily on the water's breast,
Bidding the nodding petals sleep no more.
The crackling branches told a fire was stirred;
Its light wad dim; yet, round it sat huge forms,
Like lofty oaks that near the watchers stood
With giant strength, spectators dumb, yet wake
With tenderest sympathy. The Red man decked
With plumage gorgeous, and bracelet bright,
With cheek besmeared with paint, and visage wild,
In solemn conference debated now.
Murdering Captain Smith. The forest still,
With a thrill echoed angrily their loud and stormy words;
The croaking of the frog had the exactness of a dirge;
And when clouds from the moon were swept,
A prisoner bound in chains, with wan and
death-like face was seen to pray.
An Indian maid, with slender form in rustic beauty clad,
And crowned with a wealth of raven ringlets,
Heard him say in tongue familiar, these words of deep woe:
"Alone, alone, I die.
No friend or much-loved face is here to-night
To chase these visions dark from out my sight.
That blind my quiv'ring eye.
Alas! could I but live another year,
Much of the things I dream would I know here.
"How shines the moon to-night?
Divinely! with a grace I've seen before.
Ay--sick indeed this heart, these temples sore,
That could forget thy light!
Thou'll be the torch to light my light my spirit, queen,
From this bleak world to visions now unseen.
"And this is life! Ay, life!
Anxiety, dull care, a restless pain,
That rouses, thrills, and sickens sould and brain,
A never-ending strife
'Twixt the spirit and the flesh for right,
And thus we ripen in a world of night,
"But see! they hasten now,
Their consultation o'er, I soon will die;
On yonder block of stone my head will lie.
And crushed will be my brow.
Farewell, dear home and loved ones far away;
Farewell to her who taught me first to pray.
"They come,--Alas! so soon,
To die, O God! among this dusky crew,
Where there is neither friend nor kinsmen true.
Shine on, O friendly moon!
Thine is the only white face that dost see
This savage crowd that seek to murder me.
"My head is on the stone,
The chief with huge club bends to strike the blow;
A moment longer and no more I'll know,
But list! I hear a moan.
Who weeps for me and mourns that I should die?
Who wastes on Smith a tear, or e'en a sigh?
"What ! the blow does not descend!
Whose form is this that clingest to mine own?
What means these tears and that heart-
breaking groan?
An angel heaven dost send
To plead my cause and save this worthless life.
That seems to love adventure, gloom and strife.
"O, Pocahontas, brave!
Thou beaut'ous queen! thou givest thy love to me,
As did Dian, unasked,--an offering free.
Cursed be the treach'rous knave,
Who would forget his manhood and destroy
Thy noble soul, or with they affections toy.
"Long livest thou, sweet maid!
My bosom glows with gratitude and love,
That thou wast sent as from the choir above,
This reckless being to save.
How sweet life seems when snatched from death and pain,
O God of love! 'tis true, I'm free again."
THE WANDERING JEW.
I.
"Toil! toil! toil!"
What curse is this sent from the hand of God,
That man must work till placed beneath the sod,
And see no recompense in future years,
Save anxious thoughts and bitter, fruitless tears;
What fight is this from morn till close of day,
To keep starvation's meagre face away.
Unjust proceeding, man's the slave of man,
And this, they say, is a divine command.
"A cobbler's son I saw when quite a boy,
The mean privations that the soul annoy;
And childhood's days, the happiest time of life,
Was blighted by this same, disgraceful strife,
Just so it was with manhood's happy prime,
And so 'twill be until I've done with time;
And toil, and toil, and toil, thus, this, I must,
Until this tired frame returns to dust."
The voice has ceased, the cobbler's hand is still,
The sight he sees has overpowered the will,
And hushed the vain complaints that mar his life,
And fill his brain with discord, woe and strife;
He sees afar a crowd of human Fiends,
No law nor order'mongst the group remains;
They all seem mad with mutiny and rage,
Like lions lately freed from cell or cage.
Within that crowd a tearful, bloods-stained face,
Where torture's marks had blotted beauty's trace,
Looks up with loving, patient, sorrowing eyes,
And seems to find its comfort in the skies;
A crown of thorns is on the lofty brow,
And from his wounds the blood is trickling now;
He bears a heavy cross upon his back, 
The prints of blood are borne alone the track.
The King of heaven and earth with scourges rent,
Endures with patience. woes His Father sent,
And sick with pain, insulted by their jeers,
The cobbler's bench he sees, and quickly nears.
"O friend,"he cries, and seeks the cobbler's chair,
"One moment let me rest and linger there;
'Twill ease my fainting frame from half its pain,
Refuse me not, I will not long remain."
"Go on, go on." the cobbler cries with wrath,
"No friend have ever cheered my dreary path:
And I shall never help nor give relief
To you, a hypocrite and groveling thief.
This world for the has been a dreary place,
I have no wish my steps here to retrace;
"Go on, go on, I' ve known to rest below,
I'll give you none, so hasten now and go."
"And thou, too, friend," the Saviour sadly cries,
With mournful face and melancholy eyes,
"Shall now 'go on' until the end of time,
And rest at Gabriel's Solemn trumpet's chime."
He moves away and bears his cross again,
And stifles now his moans and sighs of pain;
On Calvary's hill with eyes turned to the skies,
The God of love for mankind slowly dies.
II.
"'Go on, go on," I hear those words again,
The Saviour spoke them,--Ah! with infinite pain;
A century has passed and more since then,
And still I walk along the streets of men,
Through Europe, Asia, Africa, I roam,
But dare not linger long at any home;
I watch the years go by,--the old, and new,
But I ne'er change, I'm still the Wandering Jew.
"Oh God, I beg you, take the sentence back,
Remorse, like adders, soul and brain doth rack;
Forgive a culprit's bitter words to thee,
And set this lonely, wandering spirit free.
Have not these years of woe and dark despair,
With none beside my agony to share,
Atoned for that black sin of long ago?
Cut short, I beg you, now this time of woe.
" 'Go on, go on'until the end of time,
And rest at Gabriel's solemn trumpet's chime."
That awful voice, those words it seems to say,
O King! 'tis true, no rest till judgment day.
O God! turn back thy universe I pray,
And I'll erase my blackest crime away;
Alas! those bitter words I spoke to you,
Have sealed my fate, I'm still the Wandering Jew.
JUDITH.
I.
O, that the years had language! time would tell,
Of one bright night the moon has loved so well,
For oft in darkness when she hides her face,
She'll to the stars with energy and grace
Relate in her soft tongue the scenes of yore,
Repeat her strange experience once more.
The night upon which she dotes --' twas grand, sublime,
More perfect sure than any other time,
She bathed unsparingly the hill, the brook,
Within its depths a glance of pride she took.
O Juda! if thou wast endowed with power,
Thou would'st describe that grand and solemn hour.
In yonder sacred oratory there,
Thou dost behold a woman strangely fair,
With classic brow and jet-like dreamy eyes,
Whose liquid depth outrivalled Italy's skies';
And pencilled brows 'neath glossy, raven hair.
Adorned the lids with silken fringes fair.
Though haircloth clothed that form of matchless grace,
It could not hide the beauty of that face.
With hands devoutly clasped she's heard to say,
"O God! send Holofernes far away;
Let not that tyrant's hand my people slay,
O pity Juda, Lord, again I pray!
My people all in agony and fear,
Dost pray thine anger soon will disappear.
With ashes on their heads they mourn and weep,
Too overcome with anguish e'en to sleep.
Forsake us not, O Lord, for woe is me,
Forget thy wrath, and set my people free."
And while she prayed a ray of heavenly light,
Upon her soul was shed,--all things were bright;
And with a vision cleared by sacred love,
She saw her mission handed from above,
And rising cast the hair cloth far away,
And 'rayed her form in garments bright as day.
To Holofernes' camp with serving maid,
A lengthened visit to that tyrant paid,
And charmed his sense with beauty's dazzling power,
And waited patiently for victory's hour.
II.
O sound the trumpets; let the bells ring out,
Their cadence has a mournful sound throughout,
To merry hearts a night of joy they tell,
To one they ring a solemn funeral knell.
A banquet Holofernes gives to-night,
And honors Judith who has charmed his sight.
But he and officers have drunk so free,
They fail their imminent danger now to see;
Upon their couches wrapt in soundest sleep,
Forgetful of the vigils they should keep.
But who is this so near the tyrant's tent,
With eyes uplifted prayerfully is bent?
Then softly rising, near his couch she steals,
With one wild prayer again to heaven appeals;
Then from its scabbard soon his sword she draws,
And lifts aloft-- and then, one awful pause
Before it falls. She quickly grasps the head,
For Holofernes, Juda's foe, is dead.
Rejoice, Bethulia, God has pitied thee,
And noble Judith set thy people free.
O, hail to thee, thou joy of Israel!
Thy name o'er nations cast a wholesome spell,
Long live thy valor 'mong the deeds of fame,
And may oblivion never know thy name,
Thou art the glory of Jerusalem,
Of dauntless knights, thou art the queen of them,
Posterity will ever reverence thee,
Before thy shrine all Juda bends the knee.
Stay any rejoicings yet a longer time,
And honor Judith with anthems divine.
BELSHAZZER'S FEAST.
The sun has sunk 'neath yonder distant hill,
A hush pervades the world and all is still;
And twilight shadows lengthen into night,
That screens earth's beauties from the eager sight.
The city seems to sleep, yet, many a scene
Of sin, of misery and sorrow keen
This hour enacted 'neath the garb of night,
Most terrifying to the human sight.
But hark!-- these sounds-- are they of revelry?
What means this grand and pompous pageantry,--
These notes rung from the harp and tabret's soul,
That wake the brain and o'er the senses' roll.
All Babylon awakes to view the sight,
Of lords and princes 'rayed in garments white;
And mark their march to yonder stately hall,
Where sits Belshazzar, king and lord of all.
And here on rich drawn of sumptuous rate,
This king of Babylon in robes of state,
Has deigned to feast with lords and ladies fair,
Who bow before his august presence there.
More beauteous scene the eye will ne'er behold,
Than all those sculptured forms in matchless mould,
That rise above those towering columns grand,
And seem to form one powerful, heavenly band.
"Beneath the porphyry pillars that uphold
The arabesque-- work of the roof of gold,
A stately peristyle in grand array,
With moresque work stands proud, as well it may,
For artists would their souls mortgage away,
But to behold this work of art one day;
And from this bower of Eden, rich perfume,
Like Brahma's burning founts, the hall illume.
Belshazzar speaks, "I issue this command,
That all the sacred vessels now on hand,
Within the temple of Jerusalem,
Be brought to me that I dispose of them,
And we will drink, my drives end princes all,
Make merely here within this stately hall.
Long live the gods of gold, of brass and wood,
But cursed be the kingdom of the good."
Why does he cease? and why this sudden hush,
A moment past there was an obvious rush,
The tabret and the harp are heard no more,
The jests, and jokes of king and lords are o'er,
Belshazzar's face is of an ashen hue,
His joints are loosed, and why-- his conscience knew.
The eyes of all within that lofty hall,
Are turned upon a hand that's on the wall.
It writes mysterious words that no one knew,
The king would give to know their purport true
A scarlet robe, a chain of priceless gold,
His kingdom e'en, their meaning to unfold,
In vain he bade the wise men rise and speak,
'Twas folly sure their import now to seek;
The queen bethought of Hebrew Daniel's fame,
And mentioned to the king the prophet's name.
And Daniel entering in the stately hall,
Soon reads the words inscribed upon the wall;
He gave a solemn warning to the king,
And loud the echoes through the building ring;
" `Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin.'-- see,
I will, O king, these words explain to thee:
Thou art found wanting for thou hast been weighed,
Thy kingdom numbered, and a section made."
Bring forth the scarlet robe," Belshazzar cried,
With death-like face that bore no marks of pride,
"And on his neck put on his chain of gold,
And make him ruler, who these things have told: "
And then the kingly head in dark despair,
Was bowed upon his breast as if in prayer;
Too late, Belshazzar, time for thee is o'er,
Thou will offend thy maker never more.
THE EXPULSION OF HAGAR.
The morn hath risen clear and bright,
The sun displays his glorious light;
Through heaven's vault of azure dye,
Where peeps the glistening morning star,
And smiles the moon's great silver eye,
Ord`ring the dozing stars afar,
Give up their watch, withdraw from sight,
For now'tis morn, no longer night.
A century's frost upon his brow,
Old Abraham arises now,
With hoary locks o'er shoulders bent,
And wasted form and withered cheek,
And faded eye to which is lent
A lurking sadness; it seems to seek
Poor Hagar there with Ishmael,
Who must bid him a long farewell.
Hagar," he calls,'take thou the boy
And go, for thou wilt here destroy
My household's peace. Go thou, I say,
Depart in yonder wilderness;
Ne'er turn again thine eye this way,
God with thy son protect and bless.
Fear not. And now, take Ishmael,
I bid thee both a long farewell."
O Abraham! what dost thou say?--
That I depart? I must away
From out thy home, from out thy life!
What words are these? canst thou be mad,
Or do I dream? What means this strife?
Thy love alone hast made me glad;
O Abraham! thou hast been the light,
Within these years of woeful night.
"And now behold thee never more!
This woe has reached my bosom's core.
O Abraham! I kneel to thee,
Look thou upon thy Hagar now.
Thou art a paradise to me,
Let me but stay to smooth thy brow.
Let me but linger near thy side,
Thou ne'er before my wish denied.
"And mark thy son,--my Ishmael,
His beaut'ous face,--note thou it well;
In yonder wilderness, the sun
Will scorch that broad and noble brow,
And dark the cheek it shines upon.
My Abraham, O hear me now!
Oh! I would live in thy fond sight,
And dream in thine eye's softest light."
Low bowed the head on Abraham's breast,
And to his heart a, hand he pressed,
And breathed a long and deep-drawn sigh
At length he slowly raised his head,
And brushed a tear-drop from his eye,
He gazed, on Hagar, then he said,
"Begone! Though it should grieve my heart,
The Lord hath said that we must part."
"Take, thou, the water and the bread,
I mean the words that I have said.
Go thou into Beer-sheba there,
The Lord wilt guide and thy boy;
Lift, thou, thy heart to God in prayer,
And cease my soul thus to annoy.
Again, Hagar and Ishmael,
I bid to thee, once more, farewell."
"Alas! 'tis true, I see, I know,
Thou meanest what thou sayest, I go;
And Hagar ne'er shall smile again,
No rippling laughter leave her lips.
The saddest 'mongst the wives of men,
Will e'er be she, who sorrow sips.
My boy! my own! all, all is o'er,
And we are outcasts ever more."
ODE TO THE SUN.
How many scenes, O sun,
Hast thou not shone upon!
How many tears, O light,
Have dropped before thy sight!
How many heart-felt sighs,
How many piercing cries,
How many deeds of woe,
Dost thy bright light not know!
How many broken hearts,
That are pierced by sorrow's darts;
How many maddened brains,
That are wild with passion's rains;
How many soul-sick lives,
Stabbed with despair's sharp knives,
Hast thou above the skies,
Not seen with thy radiant eyes!
Shine on, majestic one!
Shine on, O glorious sun!
And never fail to cheer
My life so dark and drear.
Whene'er thou shinest bright,
And show thy brilliant light,
The cares I know each day
Silently steal away.
CATHARINE OF ARRAGON.
So tired! so weary--
The race--has been long,
And the paths have been rugged,
The winds have been strong,--
And the heart it has weakened,
In tempests so strong.
Soul, thou art sick
With the fever of strife,
Of delusions of hope
That will poison a life,
Of a world that is foul
With the passions of life;
Of a world that is false,
Souls that are vain,
Of men with a conscience
Who live to give pain,
Of words from the fair that hide
Vials of pain.
Of minds that are blackened
With crime and with sinning,
That seek to ensnare.
I am tired of the spinning
Of these;-- yes, so terribly
Tired of their spinning.
So tired! so weary--
Of men and of things,
Of the woes of a life-time,
That time ever brings:
Of the cares and the sorrows
That life ever brings!
(Lines written to my dear friend, Miss Leona Hanna, on the presentation of a Christmas card.)
Leona, dear, twelve months ago,
Your pensive soul I scarce did know;
A summer's touch we did require
To wake the strings of love's soft lyre.
Accept this trifle, dear, and know
My blessing glides where'er you go.
May joy with her delightful breeze
Fan all your life, prays Eloise.
TRIBUTE.
(To the sweet bard of the Woman's Club, Miss Alice Ruth Moore)
I peer adown a shining group,
Where sages grace the throng,
And see the bard of Wheatley Club
Proclaimed the Queen of Song.
I see her reach the portico,
Where muses smiling now,
Adorn with the green laurel wreath,
Her broad and thoughtful brow.
Fair Alice! shed thy radiance more,
And charm us with thy verse;
So dulcet, so harmonious,
So graceful, sweet, and terse.
LINES TO MRS. M.C. TURNER.
Some bright thoughts visit me to-night,
Of a lady fair to see,
ho hides a faithful heart from sight,
In a form of symmetry.
'Tis strange that nature placed that soul
In a woman's lowly breast,
With all its noble self-control,
And its zeal that knows no rest!
Work on, my patriotic friend,
With increasing energy,
And God his choicest blessings send,
For thy kind humanity.
SONNET.
(To Dr. L. A. Martinet, editor of the New Orleans Crusader.)
O thou who never harbored fear.
Who ever scorned her visage drear,
Who loathes the name of cowardice,
Whose banner bears the orate device,
"For justice, I will give my life,
Though I should perish in the strife! "--
To thee, I sing my humble lay.
Posterity will see the day,
When thy exalted name shall stand
Immortalized by every land!
Be thou our beacon over-head,
Ay, lead us; blindly we will tread.
Until our dark sky is serene,
May thy unfailing light be seen.
LINES TO THE HON.GEORGE L KNOX
(Editor of "The. Freeman," Indianapolis, Indiana.)
Know ye the man whom God has blessed,
With gifts peculiar to the rest
Of men who crowd the walks of life,
And battle in the world of strife?
E'er heard his thundering eloquence,
Or marvelled at the common sense
And flowing diction from his pen,
That soothes the very souls of men?--
This man who shines 'mong sensless stocks,
Is the great and famous George L. Knox.
ANNE BOLEYN.
Lost! lost! lost!
The famed and gracious Anne is no more,
Her sceptre broken, now her power is o'er,
Ye judges, who, to-day pronounced my doom
With solemn words that filled my soul with gloom.
And Henry, king with deeds so just and and canny,
Come thou, and tell me if this still be Anne.
This sunken cheek, this tearful eye, this frame
So withered in its woe, cans't be the same?
My maidens, who, with skillful touch and care,
Have looped with jewels these locks of silken hair,
And smiled with pleasure at my face so fair,
When through the mirror they saw it reflected there,
Say, tell me if a likeness can be seen
In this poor wasted frame, to England's queen.
Ah, Wolsey, Yes; thy fate was like to mine,
I,too, did rise, but now, my lot is thine.
At once arrayed in pomp, endowed with power,
Now, fickle fortune assigns to me the tower.
Will naught but blood e'er quench king Henry's thirst?
Naught but revenge with which his brain is curst?
Base villain! though thou decked in robes of state,
Thy heart is like to Lucifer's in hate!
Thou dwell'st beneath a canopy of light
With soul in lust enshrouded, black as night,
And yet this man, so base, so weak, so vain,
Great heaven! this poor heart could love again.
Could kneel with 'raptured words and tearful prayer;
Bid him clasp me to his heart, and linger there.
Yes, he was loving, kind, and good to me,
Six years I knew naught but felicity,
And gratitude, like some emitted spark,
Awoke the fire within my woman's heart.
My babe, Elizabeth, he loved the child;
Oft have I seen his countenance grow mild
Whene'er in infant voice she lisped his name;
In tones like an Æolian harp it came.
But why this change! How turned his love to ire?
Whence comes this wrath like some outburst of here?
False! false! O God! the light has dawned at last;
I know now why his tenderness has passed!
Ah! I can see why he thus thinks me site!
He basks within another's 'switching smile;
'Tis Jane Seymour, my fair and gifted maid
Has made upon his heart this sudden raid.
O Father! and 'tis she will reign the queen,
When I on earth, no more will e'er be seen.
She'll wear this crown I prize more than my life,
She holds his heart, 'tis she he'll make his wife.
O heaven! for an arm of Samson's strength,
That I might burst these doors of wondrous length,
And flee this tower; sweet freedom breathe again,--
Ah! I would seek this treasured one,-- and then
This dagger thrust into her siren heart.
And see her writhe in pain from its keen smart.
Then could I smile, and know forevermore,
Her fascinations and her smiles were o'er!
Delusion vain! these thoughts but poison peace,
And rack the soul with storms that never cease.
Lost! lost! lost! I've played the game of chance, and lost.
And O ye destinies! what it has cost
To brain, and heart, and soul! and now I die,
Scorned, and derived, and loathed by every eye.
O thou, who lov'st the paths of home and power,
Know thou the darkness of this dreadful hour
Will yet be thine! Oh, quench this fearful thirst,
Else thy life, too, with madness will be crust.
Thou'lt live to know thy hopes and dreams are o'er,
And thou wilt fall, as I, to rise no more.
AN OFFERING.
Lord, all I am and hope to be,
I humbly offer, King, to thee!
When clouds arise, thy guidance send,
Accept my life, and bless it, Friend.
O Father! let me rest in thee,
Resigned to what thou will'st for me;
Content, though all my fond hopes fade,
And visions bright in gloom are laid.
When I was but a tiny child,
Thou shielded me from tempests wild;
And gave me strength to do the right
Within temptation's treacherous sight.
And now in girlhood's solemn time,
Oh, make my life one perfect rhyme,
Sung to the air of sweet content,
With blended sounds of a life well spent.

RACE LITERATURE. 
The author of these poems, if such they may be called, is fully conscious that there is no special merit in them. They do not represent any very continued effort and study, a thing necessary for meritorious composition, even where there is genius, and much more so, where there is only a passing ability. I have never had a chance to do what I might be able to do by hard work, if leisure and freedom from the constant struggle for daily bread were given. The poems in this collection have been written at odd times. Some of them at the noon- hour in the swamps of Mississippi, when a student teacher in vacation, during college days; gome of them later in wayside depots in Connecticut and Massachusetts, while I waited for trains, during my travels as financial agent for Fisk University; others wThile about Nashville, and my native hills of the Highland Rim of Middle Tennessee. This accounts for the local color so widespread, where such local color appears. I have been too full of things and obliga¬ tions in other lines than that of poetry- writing to do much in that direction. The only apology, then, I have to offer for seeking to call attention to what I have written, is the criticism that the Negro has contributed essentially nothing to literature. The criticism itself is true enough and must remain so for a long time to come, but the spirit of it has often been unkind. Indeed in some cases where it has been urged as a proof of the Negro's incapability of ultimate high development, the criticism has become a demand as glaringly absurd as it is lacking in a generous and compre¬ hensive judgment. Thirty years ago from this day of writing, 1894, the Negroes of the United States- were slaves in the grossest ignorance and degradation. Is thirty years enough time for children to be born of such parents, to get an education and produce a race literature? It only takes a moment's reflection to see the absurdity of such an arraignment of the race on this score, as that which appeared in the April number of the North by a Southern gentleman of some merit in letters. It is time that there should begin to ap¬ pear some literary attempts of passing merit from representatives of the Negro race. But superior excellence in literary instinct and capacity is a plant of slow growth, the cultivated gift of many generations. There are no environments that can keep true genius in the background, let it be under a black or white skin. But Negro writers of that great common class who, with ordinary ability, must achieve success by hard labor^ will be at a great disadvantage necessarily in having to compete with the great writers of the white.race who are already centuries ahead. They must suffer in such a comparison. Our situation as a race is without parallel in history. A race's literature is the expression of its national and social life. Its subjects are drawn from its heroes and their historic achievements. As a race we have never had a national life. We have no heroes to form worthy subjects of epics and dramas. We have no great and inspiring history. The Israelitish race offers the nearest parallel to that of ours. But that race has no inspiring history at the time of the Exodus, except that event itself and the covenant with Abraham. All that is especially noteworthy in the history of that race followed the crossing of the Jordan in the outcome of its national life. Aside from the story of our emancipation and the hardships of our enslavement, of what subjects have we to sing to make a literature peculiarly native to us? To pro¬ duce a Negro literature, we must have time to produce song-material, as well as singers. In this little attempt of mine I have not tried to sing Negro songs purely, but songs of beautiful landscapes, wherever I have seen them, and felt song-inspired by them, or of touches of human loves and feelings, as I have felt them. For what these songs are worth I can but hope they will be kindly received. In a few more years I hope to give expression of better and worthier things.

PASSING SONGS. 
THE JUNE. 
The June has come with all its brilliant dyes, 
Its honeyed breath, its balmy gusts and sighs, 
In fields and stretching up-lands, glade and glen, 
And by the high and lowly haunts of men, 
With all-surpassing glory bloom the flowers, 
And come are sun-lit skies and dreamy hours. 
The morning earth is all begemmed with dew, 
The toiling bee the blissful hours through 
Hums softly on his self-beguiling tune, 
While gathers he the sweetest sweets of June. 
Low murmuring the crystal brooklet leads 
Its way through fields and lane and emerald meads. 
The clover fields are red and sweetly scent 
The pasture lands, where browse the kine content. 
The corn is swayed with breezes passing by, 
And everywhere the bloom is on the rye. 
Already on the bearded wheat is seen 
The gold which tempts the farmer's sickle keen, 
And I can almost see the gleaming blade 
By which the golden grain is lowly laid ; 
And hear the singing scythe and tramp of feet, 
And see the cone-shaped shocks of wheat. 
All shimmering the landscapes far and wide 
Bespeak fair promise for the harvest tide.
The June has come with summer skies and glow, 
Reflecting bliss and Junes of long ago— 
Bare feet, and careless roving bands of boys 
That haunted lake and stream in halcyon joys, 
The bow and arrow, hunting ground and snares, 
The sudden flight of quails and skulking hares, 
The wild and joyous shouts along the glen 
Come back in all the month of June again. 
Then other days and solitary dreams 
Are come again with flash of flaming gleams, 
Where red birds shot across the opening glades, 
In quest of deeper thickets, deeper shades. 
Again far inland, on and on I tread, 
Where cooling shades and carpets green are spread 
And modestly the violet blooms and sups 
The dew; and glow the golden butter-cups ; 
And sweet the odor of the woods I scent 
Where perfume of a thousand kinds is spent. 
And stretched full length upon the ground 
I lie and watch the leaves and hear their sound 
And wonder what their whisperings include 
To tell of life spent in such solitude. 
Here dreaming on forgetting time and men 
The June a million visions brings again, 
In imagery so rare of that and this, 
A self-forgetting turmoil, nameless bliss. 
Unseen but felt, the spirit of the wood 
Without a dogma teaches of the good 
In God sublime. An all-pervading sense 
Is everywhere of his resource immense, 
His love ineffable—infinite power, 
In storm resisting oaks, and purple flower
Scarce lifting up its head an inch above the ground 
Is seen alike, and with the joyous sound 
Which Robin-Redbreast from a tree top trills 
Full orthodox confession comes and fills 
The heart. The lip is mute but deep a sigh 
The spirit sendeth upward to the sky 
Baptized in faith, its adoration, love, 
A credo of the soul, to God above. 
The June has come with all its brilliant dyes, 
Its honeyed breath, its balmy gusts and sighs. 
The soft sunshine comes down aslant the hills, 
With perfume sweet the honeysuckle fills 
The summer atmosphere for miles around, 
And all the groves and fields are sweet with sound, 
While hills, and woods and vale and grassy slope 
Are teeming everywhere with life and hope. 
Come out, ye sons of men from street and ward, 
Come forth again upon the welcome sward, 
At least for one brief day leave toilsome care 
In offices and stifling banks and wear 
The boyish spirit over field and glen, 
Drink deep once more of all his joys again. 
The way is not so long—the brook in size 
Has lost to longer legs and manhood eyes, 
But its low murmuring the morning through 
Is still a lullaby ; and love is true 
In brook and field, and sky, and dale and glen 
For all the changing, faithless sons of men. 
In these no hot contentions, endless strife, 
Nor aching hearts, consuming greed of life, 
No soul-corrupting lusts, debasing sin, 
Nor blighted lives where innocence has been
 Are ever brought by June. But to assuage 
The sorrows of mankind from age to age 
A subtle charm, a bliss, a merry tune 
Abideth in the country lap of June. 
Come out where kindly nature deftly weaves 
Her cooling bowers with the tender leaves 
Ye tired wives and husbands vexed with care. 
And find life's true elixir in the air. 
Let tinkling bells of flocks and browsing herd, 
The song of brooks and twitter of the bird 
Unite with children voices in their shout 
Of mirth and joy on all the sward about, 
And let the maidens come with rosy cheeks 
And merry boys with gallantry that speaks 
Of dawning love, and sentiment the best 
That ever came to swell the human breast; 
Let all come forth in holiday array 
From care, and feel the bliss of one June day.
AN OCTAROON'S FABEWELL. 
O love, farewell, a long farewell, 
Ten thousand times good-night, 
God's benediction with thee dwell, 
And guide thy steps aright. 
We part to-night; it must be so, '
Tis best for thee and me, 
But my true heart can never know 
Love lessening for thee. 
Love's promises were but a myth, 
A mockery and sham ; I've lived to learn 
I'm tainted with 
The cursed blood of Ham. 
Dear love, how could I know when I 
Gave to thee all my heart, 
That far as earth is from the sky, 
Our lives must lie apart? 
Yet I can never rue the day, 
Though all the world I miss, 
For death itself can not outweigh, 
My momentary bliss-
THE MARCH'S PROMISE. 
When gray clouds break on Southern skies 
And winds of March begin to blow, 
Our fancies run to summer sighs, 
That whisper and delight us so. 
For in this stormy month of winds, 
The first new pulse of life is felt, 
When spring with all her sweets begins, 
Where winter's ice and snow have dwelt. 
The bluebird carols out his note, 
A prelude to the country round, 
Of chimes a few more days remote, 
To which the forest will resound— 
The plowman's song, the forest chime, 
The ujiturned sod, the country scene, 
Bespeak a resurrection time 
In air and sky and sprouting green. 
O, blessed hope of life anew 
That comes from death when spring begins ; 
Life after death a promise true 
Is brought in March's stormy winds.
DOGWOOD BLOSSOMS. 
To dreamy languors and the violet mist 
Of early spring, the deep sequestered vale 
Gives first her paling-blue Miamimist, "
Where blithely pours the cuckoo's annual tale 
Of summer promises and tender green, 
Of a new life and beauty yet unseen. 
The forest trees have yet a sighing mouth, 
Where dying winds of March their branches swing, 
While upward from the dreamy sunny South, 
A hand invisible leads on the spring. 
His rounds from bloom to bloom the bee begins 
With flying song, and cowslip wine he sups, 
Where to the warm and passing southern winds, 
Azaleas gently swing their yellow cups. 
Soon everywhere with glory through and through, 
The fields will spread with every brilliant hue. 
But high o'er all the early floral train, 
Where softness all the arching sky resumes, 
The dogwood dancing to the wind's refrain, 
In stainless glory spreads its snowy blooms.
A SERENADE. 
Dear heart, I would that thou couldst know 
How like the burning glow of Mars, 
My love here keeps a watch below 
Thy window and the midnight stars. 
How sweet the breath of night is now, 
Of sweets the rose and jessamine keep ; 
Go, winds, with these and kiss her brow, 
And bear my love to her in sleep. 
Oh ! such a love, that loves her so, 
With such a little space apart, 
Should through yon open casement go, 
And gently stir her dreaming heart. 
Dear heart, sleep on without a fear, 
If all unconsciously to thee, 
My love must watch, to watch so near, 
Makes even that a bliss to me.
ETERNITY. 
Rock me to sleep, ye waves, and drift my boat 
With undulations soft far out to sea; 
Perchance where sky and wave wear one blue coat, 
My heart shall find some hidden rest remote. 
My spirit swoons, and all my senses cry -
Tor Ocean's breast and covering of the sky. 
Rock me to sleep, ye waves, and outward bound, 
Just let me drift far out from toil and care, 
Where lapping of the waves shall be the sound, 
Which mingled with the winds that gently bear 
Me on between a peaceful sea and sky, 
To make my soothing slumberous lullaby. 
Thus drifting on and on upon thy breast, 
My heart shall go to sleep and rest and rest.
 SUSTAINING HOPE. 
 
 Farewell, Dearest and Best, 
What matters it whether the name be Dove, 
Dear-heart, and all sweet words at love's behest, 
Since none can voice my love ? 
To stay is past my power ; 
Oh, love, my own Dear-heart, farewell, good-bve! 
For thee I'll breathe through every passing hour, 
A fond and secret sigh. 
But, Dear, though it be long, 
This hope 'mid distant scenes and fellow-men 
Will lead me on, in solitude, or throng, 
That we shall meet again.
 A SUMMER AFTERNOON. 
 
 Sing on, sweet bird, and soothe my soul, 
With thy melodious tune, 
Chant me tliy rhapsodies this whole Delightful afternoon. 
And hiding in thy secret bower, 
In modesty's retreat, 
Thy music, melting by the hour, 
Is ravisliingly sweet. 
Comes perfume from the climbing rose 
That interlacing meets 
Above my head, where comes and goes 
The bee in search of sweets. 
The cooling Zephyrs stealing by, 
Faint-scented odors bear, 
Which make with every gusty sigh, 
Exquisite all the air. 
Wide as the naked eye can reach, 
Are landscapes stretching far, 
Too beautiful for human speech 
To paint them as they are. 
And here beneath this climbing rose 
A dreamy blissful state 
Comes on, as when one for repose, 
Has drunk some opiate. 
If thou couldst charm my lover here 
To lean upon my breast, 
Thy music, bird, would be more dear, 
And I would be more blest.
And singing on in thy retreat, 
Thy melting, sensuous tune, 
My dreamy bliss would be complete, 
This lovely afternoon.
 A SEPTEMBER NIGHT. 
 
 The full September moon sheds floods of light, 
And all the bayou's face is gemmed with stars 
Save where are dropped fantastic shadows down 
From sycamores and moss-hung cypress trees. 
With slumberous sound the waters half asleep 
Creep on and on their way, twixt rankish reeds, 
Through marsh and lowlands stretching to the gulf. 
Begirt with cotton fields Anguilla sits 
Half bird-Jike dreaming on her summer nest 
Amid her spreading figs, and roses still 
In bloom with all their spring and summer hues. 
Pomegranates hang with dapple cheeks full ripe, 
And over all the town a dreamy haze 
Drops down. The great plantations stretching far 
Away are plains of cotton downy white. 
O, glorious is this night of joyous sounds 
Too full for sleep. Aromas wild and sweet, 
From muscadine, late blooming jessamine, 
And roses, all the heavy air suffuse. 
Faint bellows from the alligators come 
From swamps afar, where sluggish lagoons give 
To them a peaceful home. The katydids 
Make ceaseless cries. Ten thousand insects' wings 
Stir in the moonlight haze and joyous shouts 
Of Negro song and mirth awake hard by 
The cabin dance. O, glorious is this night. 
The summer sweetness fills my heart with songs 
I cannot sing, with loves I cannot speak. 
Anguilla, Miss., September, 1892.
AS SIFTED WHEAT. 
O sift me, Lord, and make me 
Clean as sifted wheat: 
My soul, an empty vessel, bring 
To my Redeemer's feet. 
However sinful I have been or be, 
Thou knowest, Lord, that I love thee. 
I am so closely hedged about, Oh Christ, as thou hast been, 
My soul hemmed in with flesh 
Is so in love with sin. 
Sin-stained am I, but sift me, 
Lord, complete 
And make me clean as sifted wheat.
A Belated Oriole
Gay little songster of the spring,
This is an evil hour
For one so light of heart and wing
To face the storms that lower.
December winds blow on the lea
A chill that threatens harm,
With not a leaf on bush or tree
To shield thee from the storm.
Why hast thou lingered here so late
To face the storms that rise,
When all thy kind, and yellow mate
Have sought for southern skies ?
Hast thou like me some fortune ill
To bind thee to this spot,
Made to endure against thy will,
A melancholy lot ?
Chill is the air with windy sighs,
A prophecy that blows,
Of cold and inhospitable skies,
Of bitter frost and snows.
But there is One whose power it is
To'temper blast and storm,
And love to love a bird is his,
And keep it safe from harm.
To Him thy helplessness will plead,
To Him I lift a prayer,
For we alike have common need
Of His great love and care.
A PSYCHE OF SPRING. 
Thou gaily painted butterfly, exquisite thing, A child of light and blending rainbow hues, In loveliness a psyche of the spring, Companion for the rose and diamond dews. 'Tis thine in sportive joy from hour to hour, To ride the breeze from flower to flower. But thou wast once a worm, as now am I, And seeing thee, gay thing, afloat in bliss, I take new hope in thoughts of by and by, When I, as thou, have shed my chrysalis. Then through a gay eternal spring of light, Shall my immortal soul pursue its flight.
HEART YEARNINGS. 
Oh ! for the welcome breath of country air, With summer skies and flowers, To shout and feel once more the halcyon Of gayer boyhood hours. I think the sight of fields and shady lanes Would ease my heart of pains. To cool once more my thirst where bubbled up The waters of a spring, Where I have seen the golden daffodils And lilies flourishing, My fevered heart would more than half forget Its sighs, and vain regret. Far, far away from early scenes am I; And, too, my youth has fled ; For me a stranger's land, a stranger's sky, That arches over-head. For scenes and joys that now have passed me by, I can but give a sigh. But Oh ! for hearts that yearn and hearts that sigh, For wayward feet that roam, Hope whispers for the by and by, A never-changing home. And there no more in a strange land will break The home-sick heart, and ache.
MY MADONNA. 
It is a sacrilege in form I fear, To make this photograph of him and thee, From my own sunny south sent north to rue, In all my heart my own Madonna, dear; Yet Raphael could paint no face or brow To make me worship it with glory lit, Although the Holy Virgin sat for it, As I do this, our baby's face and thou. Though priests my worship may condemn to scorn, I think the virgin with her mother love, The Babe of Bethlehem, of woman born, And later all my sins and sorrows bore, If my great love for thee they watch above, For it they both are pleased and love me more. Hartford, Conn., December, 1893.
 A MEADOW-LAND. 
 
 Delight of keen delights in summer hours, Is this long meadowy scene, All rioting in festival of flowers, And pageantry of green, With smiling skies above and summer blue, With ancient fields below, yet ever new. Thou mindest me of other scenes and days, In sunnier climes than thine, Of mocking-birds and ever piping lays, Of figs and muscadine, Of dreamy afternoons and dreamy love In silent bliss with southern skies above. Dear meadow-lands, it makes me sigh to know That this fair scene must die, And sleep long months beneath the frost and snow, And inhospitable sky; And yet why should I sigh and yield to pain, Since all thy loveliness will bloom again? For long before the red men trod thy soil3 Or white men came to till Thy blo.oming waste, and crown with patient toil, Surrounding vale and hill, All rioting with gleeful vagrant flowers Wert thou in bloom, through long and sunny hours.
 'Tis mine to lie beneath a changeless snow, Sad, sad, to me the truth, But thine to sleep awhile and wake to know A gay immortal youth; Weep thou for me, for when to dust I'm gone, Thy festive face will still be smiling on. 
 
 Long Meadow, Mass., August, 1893.
 TO A BUTTERFLY IN CHUKCH. 
 
 What dost thou here, thou shining sinless thing, With many colored hues and shapely wing? Why quit the open field and summer air To flutter here? Thou hast no need of prayer. ' Tis mete that we who this stone structure built Should come to be redeemed and washed from guilt, For we this guilded edifice within Are come with every kind of human sin. But thou art free from guilt, as God on high; Go seek the blooming waste and open sky, And leave us here our secret woes to bear, Confessionals, and agonies of prayer:
THE HARVEST MOON. 
The dark magnolia leaves and spreading fig, With green luxuriant beauty all their own, Stirless, hang heavy-coated with the dew, Which swift and iridescent gleams shoot through As if a thousand brilliant diamonds shone. Afloat the lagoon, water-lilies white In sweets with muscadines perfume the night. A song bird restless chants a fleeting lay; Asleep on all the swamp and bayou lies A peaceful, blissful, moonlight, mystic haze, A dreaminess o'er all the landscape plays, While lake and lagoon mirror all the skies. There is a glory doomed to pass too soon, That lies subdued beneath the harvest moon. Columbus, Miss., September, 1892.
 IN THE HEART OF A ROSE. 
 
 I will hide my soul and itsjmighty love In the bosom of this rose, And its dispensing breath will take My love where'er it goes. And perhaps she'll pluck this very rose, And quick as blushes start, Will breathe my hidden secret in Her unsuspecting heart. And there I will live in her embrace And the realm of sweetness there, Enamored with an ecstasy Of bliss beyond compare.
AN AUTUMN DAY. 
The golden-rod was flaming bright, The autumn day was fine, The air was soft and scented with The purple muscadine. We travelled far a wooded path, The sky was bright above And all things seemed to smile and breathe A blessing on our love. 0 ! sweet and dreamy was that face, Such tenderness expressed In every line, and born to be, Love burdened and caressed. So happy in my happiness 1 could not think it then, That after parting on that day "We should not meet again. For hope is ever found with love, And there were visions fair For us of boundless happiness In that sweet autumn air. But many years of shifting scenes, Have come and gone since then, And those dear, tender, dreamy eyes I have not seen again. And once I thought with bitterness— My God, forgive the sin— My barren life and hapless love Would better not have been.
 But looking back through all my years Of weariness and pain, I know that tender, dreamy face I did not love in vain. The lengthening days and months and years Have brightened on my way By living on in memory One long past autumn day. And late a faith has come to me, I think it God has willed, That all those autumn promises Are yet to be fulfilled. ZFor I believe with all my heart, The time I know not when, With hearts still true, my loye and I •Shall somewhere meet again.
 THE FEET OF JUDAS. 
 
 Christ washed the feet of Judas! The dark and evil passions of his soul, His secret plot, and sordidness complete, His hate, liis purposing, Christ knew the whole, And still in love he stooped and washed his feet. Christ washed the feet of Judas! Yet all his lurking sin was bare to him, His bargain with the priest and more than this, In Olivet beneath the moonlight dim, Aforehand knew and felt his treacherous kiss. Christ washed the feet of Judas! And so ineffable his love 'twas meet, That pity fill his great forgiving heart, And tenderly to wash the traitor's feet, Who in his Lord had basely sold his part. Christ washed the feet of Judas ! And thus a girded servant, self-abased, Taught that no wrong this side the gate of heaven Was e'er too great to wholly be effaced, And though unasked, in spirit be forgiven. And so if we have ever felt the wrong Of trampled rights, of caste, it matters not, Whate'er the soul has felt or suffered long, Oh heart! this one thing should not be forgot, Christ washed the feet of Judas !
 A FAITHLESS LOVE. 
 
 The lovely May has come at last, With songs and gleaming dews, And apple blossoms bursting out With evanescent hues. A newer life, a newer charm Is bursting every hour, With pledge and faithful promises, From leaf and bud and flower. And hope is growing on the hill, And blooming in the vale, And comes new vigor and new life On every passing gale. But O my heart! my heart of hearts, What hope is there for me, For what was hope and what was joy, For me have ceased to be. The woodlark's tender warbling lay, Which flows with melting art, Is but a trembling song of love, That serves to break my heart. ■Gay flowers burst on every side, The fairest of the fair, But what are these to any heart That's breaking with despair? O May ! my heart had found a rose As lovely as the morn, Which charmed awhile, then faithless went, But left with me its thorn.
 A SONG OF NASHVILLE. 
 
 Oh ! Nashville, Athens of the South, Thy valleys beauty fills ; How can I tell with human mouth How well I love thy hills ? Thy hills with beauty far renowned Where rugged glory rules, Are from a dozen places crowned With colleges and schools. A modern Attica in truth, The South may call thee well, Thy benefits unto her youth Will coming ages tell. For to thy founts of learning here Fair Attica's chosen seat, Ambition turneth year by year Full many a thousand feet. To minds with aspirations led, And ardor of the heart, Are ever endless fields outspread In sciences and art. And year by year dispensing truth, Thy guiding hand is great, In that thou givest through thy youth The destinies of state. Oh Nashville, could I sing of thee, Praise worthy of thy name, Approximate what is to be The future of thy fame.
 Thy institutions, hillsides bright, Beneath a Southern sky, Make scenes of beauty and delight To every traveler's eye. O'er all thy byways round about, Once on thy grassy slopes, I was a wanderer in and out, With all a student's hopes. To-day I walked those same old rounds, I walked in days gone by, And heard from fields the same sweet sounds, Beneath the same blue sky. The mocking bird in bush and tree, "With melody and voice, In ecstacy did welcome me, And bade my heart rejoice. The hills and dales were in the smile Of spring as they had been ; And seemed to welcome without guile, Their lover back again. The lazy herds were feeding still, On slope and grassy plain, And strangely in my heart would fill A pleasure kin to pain. Old friends were gone and former ties, Were broken and estranged; But my old haunts and smiling skies, Were constant and unchanged.
But not more constant, nor more true, My fields, my skies above, Than came your wanderer back to you, Unchanged in heart and love.
TO KITTY WYSONG. 
And hast thou indeed such disdaining, To hold thy head so high ? In pride from one swift glance abstaining, You pass me by. I recall the days—it were choices To us sweeter than rhymes, To freely mingle our lips and voices, In happier times. You have gone up higher, but I lower, And it is much, Kitty, Queen-like to give scorn, but more, To give pity. And wearers, (for such is human strife) Of poverty or crowns, Pride is not best, so full is this life, Of ups and downs. And thy lot, proud heart, may be fair, Which chance has left thee in ; But pass not disdainingly where Thy love has been.
 THE APRIL OF ALABAMA. 
 
 Fair Alabama, " Here we rest," thy name— And in this stretch of oak and spotted ash, Well said that long past swarthy tribe who came Here, " Alabama," in these glamour wilds. To-day thy April woods have had for me A thousand charms, elusive loveliness, That melt in shimmering views which flash From leaves and buds in half grown daintiness. From every tree and living thing there smiles A touch of summer's glory yet to be. Already overhead the sky resumes Its summer softness, and a hand of light All through the woods has beckoned with its blooms Of honeysuckle wild and dogwood white As bridal robes— With bashful azure eyes All full of dew-born laughing falling tears The violets more blue than summer skies Are rioting in vagrancy around Beneath old oaks, old pines and sending out Like prodigals their sweets to spicy airs. And as to-day this loveliness for years Unknown has come and gone. To-day it wears Its pageantry of youth with sylvan sound Of many forest tribes which fairly shout Their ecstacies. But soon with summer smiles Will such a gorgeousness of flaming hues Bedeck those Alabama glamour wilds As ever burst to life by rain and dews.
 LINES TO MOUNT GLEN. 
 
 In this soft air perfumed with blooming May, Stretched at thy feet on the green grass, Old Glen, It is a joy unspeakable to me To see again thy face and friendly crags. My childhood friend, then height of heights to me, I am come home to worship thee once more, And feel that bliss in indolent repose Of those long past delightful afternoons, When first you smiled on me and gave to my Imaginings such imagery, when I Would lie down at thy base as I Do now. My feet have wandered far since then, And over heights with prouder heads than thine, Such as would name thy majesty with hills. But I, Old Glen, my early mountain friend, Am come with loyalty and heart still true As thy bald crags are to their kindred skies. My own Olympus yet and pride thou art, With thy Thessalian gates of clouds Which hide the great Olympian Hall, Where Hebe still sweet nectar pours Out to the gods. And murmurs sweet and low Of melting cadences Apollo from His magic lyre sends gently wandering In soft succeeding measures yet in air Familiarly to me. And yet, Old Glen, A stranger at thy base I lie to-day To all but thee, save this soft yielding grass, And blooming waste, thy pageantry of flowers. All these with yond bald eagle circling in
 The upper air with keen descrying for Some timorous skulking hare, are but old friends Who laughed and played with me in childhood hours Full many a summer day and told me tales Of fairy lore. With such immortal friends To welcome me again, what care I then For yon rude plowman's stare and taking me For some trespassing rake. This broad domain Of circling hills and intervening vales Is thine by ancient rights to shelter me, And take me in thy lap when I have come With love to worship thee. Before Koine was, Or Greece had sprung with poetry and art, Thy majesty with impartiality Was here. The first soft tread of moccasin On Indian feet, in ages none can tell, That bent this yielding grass was thine to hear. And all the sons of men who since have brought Their pulsing hearts to thee with loves, with aches, With tragedies, with childhood innocence, Have had thy welcoming. To thee no race May come with arrogance and claim first right To thy magnificence, and mighty heart, And thy ennobling grace that touches every Soul who may conimune with thee. And so It was Old Glen we came at first to love In this soft scented air now long ago, When first I brought my youthful heart to thee, All pure with pulsing blood still hot In its descent of years in tropic suns And sands of Africa, to be caressed By thee. And to your lofty heights you bore
 Me up to see the boundless world beyond, Which nothing then to my young innocence Had aught of evil or deceptive paths. With maddening haste I quit thy friendly side To mix with men. And then as some young bison Of the plain, which breathes the morning air And restless snorts with mad excess of life, And rushes heedless on in hot pursuit Of what it does not know : So I, Old Glen, As heedlessly went out from thee to meet With buffeting, with hates and selfishness And scorn. At first I stood abashed, disarmed Of faith. Too soon I learned the ways of men, Forgetting much I wish I had retained Of once a better life. And in the fret And fever of the endless strife for gain I often sigh for thee, my native peaks, And for that early life for me now past Forever more. But for one day, my early friend, I am come back to thee again, to feel Thy gentle grace so indefinable, So subtile is thy touch, yet to the heart A never-failing gift to all who come To thee. And so it is, Old Glen, that I am come, But not with all-believing innocence As in those unsuspecting days of yore. And O Mount Glen ! sin-stained my burning heart With shame lifts up its face to thine, but with A love as changeless as thy ancient crags Does it still beat for thee. And I rejoice To feel thy mighty heart here solace mine. For when the day leads in the early dawn
 With blushing rosy light and caroling Of larks; and sleepy flowers half unclosed, All wet with dew, unfold their buds and leaves, There is enchantment in this lovely spot Beyond, by far, all mortal utterances. To come here then and lie down on thy side, As I do now, and see the butterflies Bobbing from flower to flower, and hear The restless songs of birds as they in joy Flit carelessly from bush and tree, is all The bliss my heart could ask. Here I could lie In such repose and let a lifetime pass. And here, Old Glen, could I forget the fret Of life and selfishness of men, and see The face of him who is all beautiful. And here in this perfume of May, and bloom Luxuriant, and friendly rioting Of green in all this blooming waste, is seen A glimpse of that, which He, the Lord of all, Intended there should be with things and men In all this earth, a thing which yet will be, A universal brotherhood.
 THAT BETTER DAY. 
 
 Still courage, brother, courage still, Repress the rising sigh, Oppression now the race must bear, But freedom by and by. And art thou sore at heart from Southern wrongs? Well, then I pray Be comforted ; all wrongs shall pass away. God's freedom he will give to all, Now mercy is disguised, But he will smile and crown at last, Our race so long despised. And art thou stumbled over Southern bate? Well, then I pray Be comforted; all that shall pass away. The time will come when man to man Will clasp each other's hand, And color-bane shall cease to be, In all our goodly land. Dost thou despair the death of prejudice? Well, then I pray Be comforted ; that too shall pass away. It takes a faith, a mighty faith, To look for such a day— But look, for sure as God is God, All wrongs shall pass away.
 MAY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND. 
 
 Embodiment of all the beautiful That crowns the year, O May! is come with thee. For miles and miles along the rugged hills, Where in and out the Cumberland must wind, And spring her first response of green doth find, A rapt'rous beauty all the valley fills. The yellow sun with summer at his heels, Betokeneth the time about to be, Siestas, days and nights alive with wings, The stirring of a million living things. The month is full of roses, perfumed air, And crooning bees upon the clover's breast, The morning woodlands ring with music sweet, The Zephyrs whisper to the corn, And echo back the hills the dinner horn, But all in tune and harmony complete. In blissful self-abandonment awhile, Here on thy lap, sweet May, O ! let me rest, And dream and dream, till lulled by sight and sound In unison to all the earth around. May, 1891, Nashville, Tenn.
SERVICE.
Lord, let me live to serve and make a loan Of life and soul in love to my heart's own. And what if they should never know How weary are the ways, How pitiless the snow, How desolate the days Sometimes in reserve. And what if some esteem above Me others far less true, And barter off my wealth of love For passing comrades new ? I still would serve. To be permitted once in life To kiss a little child And call it mine is worth the strife In a million battles wild. To have a woman's holy love, One friend to half divine The heart, is heaven from above Come to this soul of mine. And O, dear Lord, I thank Thee for the cup Of hydromel thou givest me to sup ; Though rue soon pass my lips and fill My heart with deadly pain, My soul will rise to thank Thee still For guerdon and its gain. And though insentient clay the sward My form will hold ; for life,
 For love, sunshine and rain, My heart above all earthly strife Soars up through joy andlpain In thanks to Thee, dear Lord.
 A DECORATION DAY. 
 
 The reign of death was there, "Where swept the winter winds with pipes and moans, And stretched in silence bare, A colonade of gray sepulchral stones. But then it was in May, And all the fields were bright and gay with tune That Decoration Day, And blossoms wore their hues and breath'of June. A motley crowd that came— But who more fit than they that once were slaves, Despised, unknown to fame, With love should decorate the soldiers' graves. Black feet trod cheerily From out the town in crowds or straggling bands, And flowers waved and flaunted merrily, From little Negro hands. And far, far away From home and love, deep in a silent bed, Beneath the sky of May, Was sleeping there in solitude, the dead. But for the hearts that day, Who in the distant North wept sore andjsighed, Black hands with sweets of May, Made green the graves of those who for them died.
 BY THE CUMBERLAND. 
 
 See through this lovely valley, dear, This river ever goes, And so on through a thousand years, Just as to-day it flows. I sigh to see it stretching on Through time and to the sea, When by its banks the moments are So brief for you and me. Of the long line of human hearts, 'Tis marvelous to think, Which have so throbbed with hope and love Along this sandy brink ; While one by one they slipped away In all the ages gone, With ceaseless glide and slipping flood The river traveled on. I know our time is brief and we So soon must go, as they, But, dear, my thoughts have been far more Upon our bliss to-day. For one short hour to hold your hand And kiss away your tears, In happiness is more than all This river's thousand years.
IN SUMMER. 
The summer shimmering to-day- Puts on the earth a rune, Which blends in magic waves of light, Beneath the sky of June. Along the pavements of the street, And in the crowded mart, There is a joy of summer-time, A comforting of heart. To-day one hardly can believe, Along these pavements old, That March held such an icy sway Of bitterness and cold. The little gamin of the street, Full keeping with the boy, Forgetting all his winter woes, Is hallooing for joy. And I go back to youth again, And get myself away, To where the country fields are in The green and blue of May. And on I sweetly glide with them, With changing song and tune. With bursting buds and brilliant dyes, That line the lap of June. The morning trembles with its throbs Of ever-gushing notes, Which pour with shuddering sweetness from A thousand feathered throats.
 'Tis true the shadows of four walls Are ever on me cast, But they have a transparency, To me of a sweet past.
YOUTHFUL DELUSIONS. 
And where now restless, wilt thou roam Thou young uneaseful heart? ' Tis better far to stay at home So young a stripling as thou art. And thinkest thou to go Abroad to taste the sweets of life And miss its lurking woe ? Yea, doubtless thou wouldst find a bliss Of honey sweet awhile, And many a love-born, smothered kiss, Unknown to thee erstwhile. And of a thousand hues Would blossoms give thee morning sweets With honey-dabbled dews. And all-believing heart and young, Thou wouldst unfold thy^best, To faith, and laugh till thou wert stung With poison in thy breast. Then who would be thee nigh So far from home, to heal thy pain And soothe thy bitter cry ? 7 Tis best, by far, to stay at home, Dear over-trusting heart, None but a prodigal may roam So far from love apart. Doubt not—abide thy day, And what is best for thee to have In time will come thy way.
 LOVE IS A FLAME. 
 
 Love is a flame that burns with sacred fire,. And fills the being up with sweet desire ; Yet, once the altar feels love's fiery breathy The heart must be a crucible till death. Say love is life; and say it not amiss, That love is but a synonym for bliss. Say what you will of love—in what refrain, But knows the heart, ' tis but a word for pain-
TO LOCHIEL. 
Dear little babe, of all born things alive Most helpless thou—of life a slender thread. Can such as thee so rough a sea survive, And come at last the way all feet must tread? Yea, by the God whom I adore above, If I could fix thy destiny by choice Thou wouldst be safe, my little love. ' Tis love ineffable I wrap thee in. To pitiless pain, and ache, and storm and blast I'd bare my soul to save thy feet from sin, And bring thee safely home, Lochiel, at last. But in thy chancing boon of birth, thy whole And everlasting destiny of life Lies in thy self-directing soul.
PRAYER. 
Wherever man on earth is found Let him his tribute pay, For he is in all nature bound To bend to God and pray. And every man on earth who dwells In darkness or in light Has in his breast a voice that tells Him that to pray is right. Though but all shadowy and dim Of God the savage reads, No savagery can take from him The knowledge of his needs. So let him pray if but to stone And senseless stock of wood, For in his mercy God will own All motives that are good. But he who knows the heavenly power And feels the heavenly care, Is doubly bound in every hour To breathe some form of prayer. The darkest doubts the soul may fill; Still pray, though doubts be there, For he is safest from all ill Whose lips are moved with prayer. ' Tis best for every one who can To pray with faith devout, But God is gracious in his plan For him beset with doubt.
 Still pray, for long as any heart, Can feel its deep despair, Not from it can there once depart Efficiency of prayer. And all who strive, and strive and fall In sore besetting sins, Still pray—God's love is over all ' Tis prayer on prayer that wins.
 A JANUARY DANDELION. 
 
 All Nashville is a chill. And everywhere Like desert sand, when the winds blow, There is each moment sifted through the air, A powdered blast of January snow. O ! thoughtless Dandelion, to be misled By a few warm days to leave thy natural bed, Was folly growth and blooming over soon. And yet, thou blasted yellow-coated gem, Full many a heart has but a common boon With thee, now freezing on thy slender stem. When the heart has bloomed by the touch of love's warm breath Then left and chilling snow is sifted in, It still may beat but there is blast and death To all that blooming life that might have been.
 SUNDAY MORNING. 
 
 Softly the cool breath of the early morn, Swamp-scented air, fragrant with deep lagoons And water-lilies, stole on through the fields Of cotton, whispering a sighing song. 'Twas Sunday morning then, and everywhere The May dew rolled away in diadems. Another day was born with floods of light; The grass with newer green all wet with dew Gave welcoming. And rose hues spent with yesterday Found blushes still and sent out night-born sweets To mingle with a thousand other spicy Airs and perfumes of the jessamine, And wild aromas of the summer air. And murmured low the sycamores o'erhead With whisperings of passing summer winds. The dapple sunshine kissed and kissed their leaves, And golden gleams were on the fields. Rich were The blackbird's notes and joyous sounds from all The feathered tribes. In lazy lengths the bayou went With stretches on, and murmuring low songs Like those of love. There floated far and wide The queenly water-lilies white, perfuming All the Sunday air. And like a dove Of peace, fair Nitta Yuma sat amid Her spreading figs and rich magnolia blooms In rest; for there was come the hallowed day, The Sabbath of the Lord. 
 
 Nitta Yum:i, Miss., May, 1SS4.
 ESTRANGED. 
 
 An autumn sky, a pleasant weather, The asters blossom by the way ; We two between them walk together, And watch the ships pass on the bay. His summer song yet to the clover, The hovered bee still murmurs there, But there's that tells that summer's over In this sweet dreamy autumn air. "When it was May and lovely weather, And ships went sailing to the west, We walked this path, we two together, With happy throbs of heart and breast. The spring was young and hope was growing, And love went idling on the sand, And there was blissful overflowing Of heart in touch of lip and hand. And yet the bee hums to the clover Soft, all the dreamy hours long, But there's that tells that summer's over In all his drowsy, flying song. An autumn sky, a pleasant weather, But all the summer glow is changed, Here where in love we walked together, Before we two were so estranged.
A LITTLE NEWS VENDER. 
Scarce ' bove a whisper—half a sound Heard, causing me to hark, To turn and see a baby face Peering at me in the dark. I bent my head with ready grace With open ear and eye, To learn what such a baby had To say to passers by. Above the clatter of the street I caught the faint accent, A little maiden vender's cry— " The Post! The Times ! a cent "— And swift to strike a trade with me As promptness could command, Out from her tangled skirts came up, A paper in her hand. The wind was blowing merc'lessly, And pitiless the snow, In downy flakes was falling on This little mite of woe. " The Post! The Times ! ' tis but a cent," She looked with eager eye For sympathy and ready sale, How could I fail to buy? O! God, I thought must such be seen, As this on such a night, In this so rich a commonwealth, So pitiful a sight?
 Is bread so dear and life so cheap, So circumstanced the strife For food, that babes must barter off, All that is worth in life ? For who can hope these peddling maids Could once escape the price, Backed up and forced by all street laws Legitimate to vice. No Communist to blame the rich, Am I, though sad the sight, But O ! I know somewhere is wrong And somewhere is the right. God pity all the pitiful, And send from door to door, Him whom thou wouldst to minister To the deserving poor. Hartlord, Conn., February, 1893.
THE COLOR BANE. 
There was profusion in the gift
Of beanty in her face,
And in her very form and air
An inexpressible grace.
Her rustling silk, moire-antique,
The daintless taste would please ;
Her life in all appearances
Was opulence and ease.
It could be seen from head to foot,
And in her piercing eye,
That she had had advantage of
All that hard cash could buy.
But Oh! it was so sad to see,
That in her heart was pain,
That caste should force this Negro queen
To cold and proud disdain.
That one so beautiful as she,
Could any sphere adorn,
Should so be made to hate a heart
And give back scorn for scorn.
For all her wealth and gifts of grace,
Could not appease the sham
Of justice that discriminates

LINES TO A WHIPPOORWILL. 
Poor Whippoorwill, what ancient secret woe, Has been the burden of thy feathered tribe? Is it misfortune of some long ago Thy quaint and ever wailing notes describe? Or is it for some faithless truant mate Thy love bemoans in solitude remote, And pining in thy solitary state, Comes forth this woeful ditty from thy throat? Poor Whippoorwill: I truly pity thee, Whatever sorrow fills thy aching breast, Taught sympathy by Plim who pities me, I glad would grant thy mourning tribe a rest. And O! sad bird, there lingers with me still A memory which makes me half rejoice, As I recall the echo from the hill, When first I heard thy strange mysterious voice. With it the thought of many a summer night Comes back, when planets and stars were out, And on the green where floods the moon writh light, I hear again a wild and joyous shout. Again romps there full many a village lad In play upon the early evening tide, And thinking thus my heart grows strangely sad, For my companions scattered far and wide. And I recall emotions, O ! sad bird, When Venus early sheds her distant light, Which vaguely in my childish bosom stirred, When rang thy awesome cry upon the night.
 Too young to know the common lot of pain To which the flesh of man and bird is heir, My heart was only moved by thy refrain To sympathy and vagueness of despair. But time has taught me, bird, too well since then The minor which thy wailing failed to do : To-night, with thousands of my fellow men, I am with thee, sad one, a mourner too. And listening to thy voice down in the glen To-night pour forth its ancient sorrowing strain, I well could fancy childhood back again But for my own benumbing ache of pain. ■ But, bird, I bid thfee come and learn with me, That which is worth far more than gems most rare, However great thy sorrow here may be It need not lead to darkness and despair. Though dim the light, if we but trust His will In time the Master maketli all to find, That underneath the deepest pain are still His purposes most wonderfully kind. Cease, bird, thy long complaint and cry of woe, And teach thy young a far more tuneful strain ; Learn that which men are strangely slow to know : Life's guerdon comes to all through ache and pain.
THE BRIDAL WREATH'S LAMENT. 
O woe! ah bitter woe for us, AVho did the foolish thing, To trust our folded leaves and buds, To the first warm sun of spring. Up from the lagoons of the South, From lake and flowers about, Came soft deceitful sighing winds And gently called us out. They whispered strange Floridian tales,. Of bayous and the brake, Of spring's aroma and the rose, And bade us to awake. The sun so old for many springs, Looked down on us and smiled, And all our foolish swelling buds, To leaf and flower beguiled. We rivalled the Japonicas Which budded half in doubt, But reassured by southern winds, Fast sought to beat us out. But O ! we spread our leaves and buds Up to the open sky, And looked with condescension on Our lagging neighbors by. Bedecked in all our finery And blind with silly pride, We laughed unconscious of our doom,. And of our woe betide.
 But swift and stealthily as comes A lurking foe at night, Without a warning note swept down A storm with bitter blight. Now all the highway and the plain Lie covered up with snow, The sun is hid and leaden clouds, Look down on all below. Deceitful Zephyrs of the South, Where are your kisses now? The snowtlakes make our winding sheet, And death is on our brow. But soon the true warm spring will come, And violets in their beds Will bloom : and flauntingly will Lift the tulips up their heads. The gladsome summer time will come, The summer winds will sigh, A thousand brilliant flowers will bloom Beneath a summer sky. But we, O ! vain and foolish buds, Who did the foolish thing, To trust our folded leaves and flowers To the first warm sun of spring, So premature must pass away To nothingness for time and aye.
 MARCH WINDS. 
 
 Welcome, here, cold March winds blowing, Welcome are the songs you sing, Each discordant, shrill vibration, Is a messenger of spring. Blow, now, March winds, blow at pleasure Rush o'er moorland, field and plain, Far and wide bear ye the tidings, That the spring returns again. Spring, when all new life is given, Thou art ever welcome here, For thy voice is sweet with singing, And thy face is ever dear. In thy time sweet hope returning Steals into despairing hearts, And with subtile feeling touching, Vigor and new life imparts. 'Tis a time when birds are mating, And is heard the burnished dove, Pouring out his heart in cooing, Of his constancy and love. ' Tis a time when sounds are pleasing, And when whispers fill the air, Sounds whose sources have no telling, For they come from everywhere. ' Tis a time when meadows glisten, With the dew drops of the morn, When the lilacs and the lilies, And the modest rose are born.
 Then it is sweet smelling flora Maketli fragrant all the air, Then it is that life feels lighter, And a lessening of care. Then it is that youth is happy, And the fancies are as light, As uncertain and as lofty, As the careless school boy's kite. Welcome, then, cold March winds blowing, Soon thy howl away shall die, Die in summer breezes sighing, Soft as any lover's sigh. Welcome, here, cold March winds blowing, Welcome are the songs you sing, Each discordant, shrill vibration Is a messenger of spring.
LINES TO NIGHT. 
In twilight lingers yet a hue Of light that fades along the distant west, The blushing rose sips up the evening dew, And homeward flies the birdling to its nest. The shepherd leads his flock unto the fold, And sounding bells are heard along the hills, And fainter grows the cloudlet tinged with gold, A deeper twilight all the valley fills. With clanking chains and drivers urging on, The teams at longer intervals go by, And soon the sounds that mark the day are gone, In myriads the stars shine in the sky. The heavens yield their faintest tints of blue, And softer grows the murmur of the sea, The west is robbed of every golden hue, And silent, peaceful night begins to be. The tired workmen to their huts return, Where childish greetings wait them at the door, And sweet a simple bliss which they well earn Makes rich the humble cabin of the poor. The cloth is spread, and o'er the frugal fare, The grace is said and, yea, the feast is blest, For at that festival unseen is there To grace the board, a silent heavenly guest. Around the family altar blest with love They come with reverence and God adore ; There faith in phrases set, to God above, Takes up the meek petitions of the poor.
 O'er all who haunt the sea or land about, In love alike for those who weep or sing The silent darkness kindly stretches out And folds the earth beneath her brooding wing. Of all the gifts to man in heavenly grace, O! soothing night, of blessing thou art blest, The sinless child, and wretch in thy embrace, Are cradled in forgetfulness and rest. For humble slave and swain with labor spent, For hearts bowed down with pain and aching woes, In love and kindest mercy thou art sent To give them all in sleep a sweet repose.
 MAY. 
 
 The sweetest time of the year to me Comes in the month of May, The sky has then its brightest blue, And earth its mildest day. Not then is felt cold winter's chill, Nor felt its summer's heat, But all the earth is blithe and gay And all the month is sweet. When May is come, sweet, placid May, The hills and vales are seen With lofty peaks and mountain sides To smile in living green. The meadow streams, the rippling streams, Through all the glad day long Glide by their mossy banks and join The earth in one sweet song. ' Tis then I love to wander forth, Into some quiet vale, And dream through all the livelong day, And watch the cloudlets sail. ' Tis then those dreamy days gone by When I was but a child, Return and bring to me again Old visions sweet and wild. Those days when I would lie and watch Beneath some shady tree, The clouds float lazily along la human forms to me.
 Sometimes those forms a Bible name Which I had heard or seen, My childish fancy gave to each One suited to his mien. For sure I thought those holy men— Those patriarchs of old Were sailing round the skies in clouds, For such to me was told. But in those visions of them all The sweetest one is this, I hear again a voice, a call, A call to hear is bliss. A mother calls her careless boy, One loth to leave his fun To answer for some wickedness Or on some errand run. 0 ! smiling May, how dear thou art, Thou bringest back to me A dreamy time, a time which now In dreams can only be. 'Tis true ten thousand common joys My restless soul make glad, But all my joys unless in dreams Are mingled with the sad. So, May, when thou art come to me 1 can but steal away And live again in childhood dreams At least for one brief day.
 And O ! that thou couldst stay with me, Throughout the lagging year, And let me work and love and dream Out my existence here.
 LINES TO A MOCKING BIRD. 
 
 Sing, sweet bird, Thy melody is sweet, Chant now thy summer song, For summer days are fleet. But while the earth holds gladsome summer yet, From early morn to peaceful twilight dim, Till God doth bid the burning snn to set, Heard thou art chanting praises unto him. Sing, sweet bird, Sing all the summer long, There is a gladsome joy, A soothing in thy song. O! for a life like thine—one free from care, In dewy fields or clover wet with rain Or in some blissful spot as there I'd dwell unknown to human ache and pain. Sing, sweet bird, Mid clover, grasses green ; Soon pansies and the rose Can nowhere here be seen. And then away unto the far off south Thou wilt wing thy self in flight And leave me but to hear from human mouth A ceaseless groan and fret from morn till night. Sing, sweet bird, With mirth and gladness vie, While flowers blush and bloom And summer breezes sigh.
 O ! could I sing for man in bowers green Sweet songs as thou, and soothe his aching breast, I'd gladly sing and pass away unseen To some Elysian fields of peace and rest.
 LINES TO THE MEMORY OF DR. POWELL OF THE A. M. A. 
 
 One night, entranced, I sat spellbound, And listened in my place, And made a solemn vow to be A hero for my race. He plead as but a few can plead With eloquence and might, He plead for a humanity, The Freedmen and the right. His soul and true nobility Went out in every word, And strongly moved for better things Was every one that heard. Too soon has death made good liis claim On him who moved us so, Too great and white the harvest yet, To spare him here below. Oh ! why this waste?—forgive me, Lord, I would not Judas be, Yet who will plead as he has pled, For Freedmen and for me ? And yet in death, I think he will— This sleeping prince of thine, In many a multitude be heard Still plead for right and mine.
RESENTMENT. 
You ask for summer instead of cold weather, But that can never be, The passion that once so bound us together, Forever is dead in me. O yes ! I loved and sought to discover To you my heart's distress, But the love you cheaply gave to another, Turned mine to bitterness. It is now too late; and past forever The time to gather in The ties of love and bind together, The life that might have been.
 IN MEMORY OF KATIE REYNOLDS—DYING. 
 
 O ! death, If thou has aught of tenderness Re kindly in thy touch Of her whose fragile slenderness Was overburdened much With life. And let her seem to go to sleep, As often does a tired child, when it has grown Too tired to longer weep. A rose but half in bloom— She is too young and beautiful to die, But yet if she must go, Let her go out as goes a sigh From tired life and woe. And let her keep in death's brief space This side the grave, the dusky beauty still Belonging to her face. She must have been Of those upon the trembling lyre Of whom the poets sung ; " Whom the gods love " and desire Fade and " die young." Her life so loved on earth was brief, But yet withal so beautiful there is no cause, But in our loss, for grief. 
 
 Nashville, Tenn., December, 1893.
A THANKSGIVING DAY IN NEW ENGLAND. 
O, bliss ! where hearts are all aflame With love far deeper than a name, Where speech from hearts so sweetly slips, In loving words and touch of lips, Where rise and find a transient rest, The noblest passion of the breast, I fain would dwell if not for aye, At least on each Thanksgiving day. O, love! wherever love is found In all this toilsome world around In ache and woe and endless strife Thou art the balm in human life, That maketh possible to bear Our mingled load of joy and care. No lot can wholly cheerless be, Dear love, when it is blessed by thee. To-day I've watched glad hurrying feet, Trip gaily homeward love to meet. The father's hand, the mother's kiss, Thanksgiving day, New England's bliss Calls to the old paternal chair The single youth, the married pair, And blithe they go with winsome grace To see again the old home-place. The snow comes down in feathered flakes, On noisy street and silent lakes, Through window panes the fire lights glow Upon the fallen spotless snow, And snug within from cold and storm Love's own are gathered safe and warm, And from the scene is banished care, And all is joy beyond compare.
 The youngsters romp with boisterous stride, The mothers with ill-concealed pride Half scold in their indulgent way, For more decorum in their play ; For this the youngsters feel no need And scarcely pay their parents heed. They make the old home ring without, With gayety and childish shout. And when they to the loaded board Come with their patriarchal lord, The grace is said and all the guests, A second time and more are pressed. To more of all the good things nice With sauce and aromatic spice. And gathered thus on this glad day The time speeds happily away. The old forget their years of pain, Feel in their children young again, Perchance some tears a smile displace For some beloved absent face, But all are met with one accord To happy be and thank the Lord. And joy from other things apart Is uppermost in every heart. But Oh ! all homes are not so blest With love and gathered family guest; And, ye whom God doth favor give, Think kindly of the poor who live In tenements and never see The comforts God hath given thee. Ah ! lonely hours pass away For many on Thanksgiving day. My homesick heart gives useless sighs
For love beneath my southern skies, And feels that longing which must come, To aliens far away from home. But still I know while fades the light, And daylight deepens into night, Love travels fast and cometh nigh, In answer to my own heart's sigh, And so ' tis sweet though far apart— When love doth answer heart to heart.
 AFTER COMMENCEMENT AT FISK UNIVERSITY. 
 
 The halls are all deserted now, And silence reigns complete, Where one could hear but yesterday A thousand tramping feet. The flowers, wreaths and evergreens, Lie withered up and dead, And with the hands that handled them, Their beauty now has fled. No sound of boisterous laugh and life, Nor student jesting word Breaks silence of the hall, save where A nibbling mouse is heard. The life that here but yesterday With hope and college pride, Rang out in song and careless mirth Is scattered far and wide. The long vacation time has come, A timely season blest, When tired brains may revel in Forgetfulness and rest. Thus Jubilee and Livingstone In solitude complete Are left with none to tread their halls, But ghosts of absent feet.
THE WOODS OF OCTOBER. 
The last sweet blush of summer in her glory Still lingers in October woods and skies, But changed in forests, hills and mountains hoary,. From green unto a thousand brilliant dyes. The cloudless skies a restful peace betoken, The Indian summer broodeth over all, In earth and everywhere is plainly spoken A placidness which only comes with fall. In fields where to the breeze was lately swaying,. The wheat in all its golden beauty seen, Are flocks and herds of lazy cattle straying, And feeding on a second growth of green. A bee is seen still out in hope of finding, A blossom in the second growth of clover, But nature's law too on the bee is binding, His harvesting will also soon be over. 'A few more days of autumn's hazy gleaming, And all October woods to-day so fair, The very imagery of death in seeming Will stand dismantled, naked, bare. O, who would think that all this beauty painted,. Upon these leaves in colors clear, In every brilliant hue with death is tainted, But for the dying lesson year by year. That lesson let me learn to-day in earnest, Wrhich thou dost teach in every hue and dye, Who knows but when thy glory here returnest,. Within the silent grave my head shall lie.
 Farewell, October woods—soon bleak December "Will all the forest wrap in spotless snow, But I, forgetting not, shall still remember, Thy glory which to-day delights me so.
THE MESSAGE OF A DEAD EOSE. 
The rose you gave me, dear, is dead, The hope which it begot Is gone. An aching heart and head, Is my unhappy lot. Perhaps you could not fully know, The danger of your smiles, How often hearts are poisoned so, By thoughtless maiden wiles. I would not think so hard of heart You thoughtfully could be ; To gratify a flirting art, Such passion stirred in me. Yet many a trusting heart has been From honor made to rove, In darksome ways and paths of sin, By lightly feeding love. This rose cut from its mother stem, With thy unfeeling knife, Has lost, though such a lovely gem, All that could feed its life. And faded its untimely death Tells silently to me, As is its fate and scentless breath, So my heart's love must be.
 THE SUN WENT DOWN IN BEAUTY. 
 
 The sun went down in beautv, Beyond Mississippi's tide, As I stood on the banks of the river, And watched its waters glide ; Its swelling currents resembling The longing restless soul, Surging, swelling, and pursuing Its ever-receding goal. The sun went down in beauty, But the restless tide flowed on, And the phantoms of absent loved ones Danced o'er the waves and were gone ; Nautical phantoms of loved ones, Their faces jubilant with glee In the spray, seemed to rise and beckon, And then rush on to the sea. The sun went down in beauty, While I stood musing alone, Stood watching the rushing river, And heard its restless moan ; And longings, vague, intenable, So far from speech apart, Like the endless rush of the river, Went surging through my heart. The sun went down in beauty, Peacefully sank to rest, Leaving its golden reflection On the great Mississippi's breast;
 Gleaming on the turbulent river, In the coming gray twilight, Soothing its restless surging, And kissing its waters good-night. The sun went down in beauty, The stars came one by one, Speaking from the vault of heaven, Of the mighty Father and Son ; Speaking to earthly mortals, Whose souls like the river's tide, Forever and ever are flowing, But never are satisfied. The sun went down in beauty, But still in the calm starlight, My feet were wont to linger To the coming of gray midnight; My heart was filled with musings, Of past and coming years, And the thoughts of friends departed, Filled my eyes with tears. The sun went down in beauty, But still in visions fair, My soul to the gate of heaven, Was wafted through the air; The gate of life eternal, Where cease tumult and strife, Where men borne down with sorrow, Lay down the burden of life. The sun went down in beauty, Tinging the west with gold,
 Gleaming as a symbol in heaven, Of light in the Father's fold ; And. soul, why fret with emotions, Of sorrow, joy or renown ? Soon life with all that is earthly, Forever will be laid down. The sun will go down in beauty, 'Mid summer and mid winter snow, When we in the grave are sleeping, Beyond its radiant glow ; Speak to our souls, my Father, Their void with comfort fill, And ease our anxious longings, And bid them, " Peace, be still."

OVER THE BAY. 
The daylight dies and sinking in the west, The sun is red and tinges all the bay, And soft a sigh escapes a woman's breast, And dreamingly her eyes are far away. Then love alert and swifter than a sigh Rocks tenderly a babe. "With cooings low He sleeps again to her sweet lullaby. And night creeps on in livery of gray, But still she lingers, gazing on the west, While all the world is putting toil away, And coming slowly on to home and rest. But love with nimble feet eternally All tirelessly skims on and on O'er night, and league, and wave, to Jack at
 THE SECRET. 
 
 Go whisper to her gentle winds, While you are passing by, The mighty secret of my heart, The burden of my sigh. Take to her from this blushing rose, Such sweets of scented air, As are befitting for a queen, And one divinely fair. And from this lily of the vale, Take her who is to me. The emblem of all that is good, And sweetest purity. The violets of azure eyes, Which ever sweets impart, Take her their gentle modesty, So like her guileless heart. Take all the sweets which you can find Along your airy way, To her whose face and daily life Are like the month of May. Blow softly on her lovely brow, And give her lips a kiss, The thing were I to do, O winds, Would count a wondrous bliss. She does not know my secret flame, But what is that to you ? Oh winds, but take her from my heart, Its mighty love and true.
 THE NEW JERUSALEM. 
 
 O New Jerusalem ! abode unseen, Yet now as in all ages past, Thou art the bourne to which in deep despair Or hope, men turn their face at last. It matters not what race, or clime or creed In life has swayed the powers given, ' Tis always true that men about to die Will turn a longing heart to heaven. In youth ambition leads the mind along The way of hope and sweet delights, Fulfilling just enough its promises To point out more desired heights. And so for more of gold, or fame or power, Or for the bare necessities of life, Succeeding generations go the rounds Of failure or successive strife. But O, when age creeps on and life begins The gliding downward to its west, There comes a deep solicitude alike To fill the rich or beggar's breast. Far out beyond the stretch of space and time, Beyond experience or ken, The soul immortal thoughtfully must face The common destiny of men. The always poor and long despised of earth, To whom so many woes of life are given By faith or blind instinct are comforted, And hope for better things in heaven,
The New Jerusalem, 95 And lives all hopelessly ensnared with sin Too much to ever here undo, "When every other hope is gone will hope To live in heaven their lives anew. O, many are the weary souls and tired feet From every rank and walk of life, At last come gladly to that borderland, Where men lay down all pain and strife. Oft timorously with sore and fainting hearts They wait the dipping boatman's oar, But oh! the pilot there is kind who guides The boat to that Celestial shore. And there a king and kingdom without end Shall be to all as thine and mine, And never once a discord in His rule, But always harmony divine. The palace gates shall not be shut by night, There hearts shall never beat with fears, Nor ever ache, for O, the King is kind, And wipes away all bitter tears. O New Jerusalem ! abode unseen, Yet now as in all ages past, Thou art the bourne to which we ail must turn, For all there is to life at last. There deep and lasting is^ the law of love, As all eternity is wide, And all inhabitants for time and aye With God himself abide.
THE GODDESS OF PENITENTIALS. 
I saw and heard her often in my dreams— in my dreams at night, but oftener in my dreams by day. I saw her in my earliest childhood. She spoke to me then and told me things which my childish understand¬ ing could not comprehend. Sometimes her dark sayings stirred within me a feeling of uneasiness and vague apprehension of com¬ ing pain. When I looked at her wistfully for explanation, she would say, " Never mind. You will remember my sayings and understand them by and by." In the summers of my childhood I re¬ member times when I stood by a great bed of hollyhocks in bloom, charmed with their brilliant colors of many hues. I wondered why they should die, why such glory as theirs might not last forever. But I was too young for emotions of any kind to be very lasting, and my sadness on such occasions was but momentary. For at such 7 (97)
 times, seeing a humming bird flashing like a ray of light among the flowers, sucking the honey-dew from the heart of the blossoms, I forgot all and chased it with breath¬ less eagerness, hoping that I might clasp the shining, irridescent thing in my hands. Oh! faithful prophecy of other pursuits as vain in after years. Disappointed in this I stole upon a bee, and closed the bell-shaped mouth of the flower and imprisoned the little honey gatherer within. I took savage delight in its rage and terrified humming, unless it stung me in spite of my precaution. At other times I would lie for hours watching a summer cloud float lazily along or remain at rest. Sometimes I watched a great procession of clouds pass by and saw in them human forms, human restlessness, human passions, and human sorrows. And now I know that some features of her face were in all my visions. All about me were straggling hills, quiet vales between and sheltered nooks, through which went the singing brooks on their .way to fill the many mouths of the mighty and ever thirsty sea. There were mornings when I saw the earth sparkle with May dew and the glittering grass full of all the promise of summer. With my heart full of unutterable happiness I have gone forth then breathing the breath of the morning, sweeter than the burnt, incense of many altars. And yet at times the very raptures of such hours wrought in me a kind of mo¬ mentary pain. They were almost happy pains, but pains nevertheless full of sugges¬ tions of rue to come. It was the uncon¬ scious influence of her face, reflections of which I saw everywhere and in every thing. When the first morning hours in my life were past, my thoughts began to go beyond the horizon of my native vale. The coun¬ tries, the people, the heroes of whom I read stirred my heart with unutterable longings, and my indomitable imagination led into realms where there were only the great, the glorious, and all desirable things. The hap¬ piness of those visionary hours is indescrib¬ able. It is only a thing which the highly imaginative soul can feel, and this felicity is all the more blissful because it is beyond •description; because it is not hemmed in by time and space, and is not trammeled by necessary results that should follow a concourse of incidents, but is an unhindered •creation of the mind itself.
 Work of all kind involving excessive bodily exhaustion was to me irksome in the extreme, and unbearable. I was called lazy, and so I was; but certainly not of the lazy belonging to that vicious kind whose body and mind are alike averse to all activ¬ ity. The taunt of my fellows among whom my lot was cast in no sense disturbed my peace of mind. If to them I was a worthless idler, to me they were so many singing and dancing animals, the consummation of whose enjoyments was in sleep and feasting. In the dappled dawn of a summer morning they saw nothing but the coming of a hot day. In the profusion of roses and the luxuriant bloom of hollyhocks, they saw nothing but some flowers for the hands of girls and women to make bouquets for the mantlepiece on Sundays. In the strag¬ gling hills and mountain crags, they saw nothing but landscapes unfit for the culti¬ vation of corn. While in all "these things I saw not a world but a universe of beauty beyond compare, subjects for dreams with¬ out end and without limitation. In the conceit of my youthful soul I thought myself better than my clod-headed fellows, and dedicated to a higher life than
 they. I resolved to go out from among them and seek for companions of kindred spirits and an abode suited to my ambitions. Medi¬ tating upon this plan, one morning I walked out full of a sense of coming happi¬ ness and the transporting delights of Ely- sian fields through which my fancied pathway lay. I sought a sheltered nook and seated myself on the mossy bank of a babbling stream. It was the month of June and there was glory everywhere be¬ yond all naming. I gave myself up wholly to the pleasant sensations coming from the cool shade, the lulling whispers of the pass¬ ing breeze, the inimitable sweetness of the bird songs, the gurgling of the brook at my feet, the perfumed air, and the deep quiet of the woods beyond. How long I sat in this seducing state of happy indolence I do not know. But rousing from my revery I looked up and she stood before me, she, the Goddess of Penitentials. I knew her at once. I had never seen her gathered to¬ gether before; but all the beauty of her face, all the exquisite mouldings and grace of her body, all the majesty of her mien, all the gentle sweetness of her mouth, all the melancholy of her eyes, and all the sorrowful shadows of her soul, I had seen before. These gathered up from the summer clouds,, from the blushes of the morning, from the mountain sides, from the quiet vales, from the hollyhocks, from the roses, from the diamond dews, and come together in the person of the Goddess, had lost nothing of their individualities and their familiarity to me. Neither was I surprised at her coming, but felt at that moment as if I had been waiting for her all my life. Of this I was the more convinced when she said, " Thou hast kept the appointment. All the days of thy life have I waited for this hour of meeting with thee." Then for a moment she was silent. There was an indescribable cadence of sadness in her voice. I fancied that she looked upon me with compassionate pity—with a feeling akin to that which a relentless heads¬ man might bestoAV upon some doomed vic¬ tim whom he pities but cannot spare. Her look inspired me with no fear, but all the passions of my soul were stirred to- their deepest depths. I knew by some pre¬ science that with her coming had come also the turning point of my life. I knew that all my past was passed forever. I knew
 that there was before me a new life and one not of my dreams. Therefore I waited with breathless anxiety for her message, for a message I knew she had come to bring. She began once more : " Thou hast kept the appointment. I am the Goddess of Penitentials and from the hour of thy birth I have watched over thee. At the moment thou earnest into the world and breathed the breath of life, I was there and laid my hand upon thee and dedicated thee to my service—the service of human sorrows. That thou mightest the better serve in the kingdom for which thou art chosen, I endowed thee with fine and ex¬ quisite sensibilities. Thou wast given a keen perception of all beautiful things and in thy heart was formed a mighty capacity for love. Thou shalt have learning and the cultivation of £esthetic tastes. Thou shalt- see and mix with the great and the wealthy, but in none of these things shall it be unto thee according to thy dreams. The ache of all human sorrows that ever throbbed in the heart of man must go through thy soul till by them it is pierced through and through and thus purified. Thou shalt have the tastes and cultivated capacity of
 the refined and the wealthy • but in thy re¬ sources thou shalt be all thy life long the brother of the Pariah. Thou shalt have attainments that will recommend thee in many places that thy soul will desire. But on thy face to the day of thy death will be a sign which readeth thus: ' He is one from the tents of Ham'—an unjust version of which is : 'A child of hereditary disgrace.' Because of that sign thy excel¬ lencies, whatever they may be or wherever thou wouldest show them forth, even if secretly or openly acknowledged, must be denied their full rights, except, perhaps, by the compassionate few, whose very tender compassion will give thee a certain pain as well as pleasure. Of all the dis¬ grace and degradation of thy race thou must be a part. Thou shalt see thy breth¬ ren often unjustly treated, denied the full rights and protection of the law. " In some instances with no power to save, thou shalt be made to stand and see them racked with barbarous cruelty, even unto death, by the powerful wicked, whom God will judge and whose wickedness He will punish in hell. It shall be thy lot to feel thy brotherhood with the oppressed,
the despised and outcast vagrants of every clime. In quieter ways, but with no less oppres¬ sion to the soul, thou shalt see and feel all the sorrows common to the lot of man. Thou shalt look into the faces of men and women of high as well as low degree, and see the relentless touches of woe. There may be only professions of mirth and hap¬ piness, but by the secret signs which thou shalt see, the counterpart of which is en¬ graved upon thine own heart, thou shalt know them to be thy brothers and sisters. "Butin all this, thy sorrowful lot, there is 'this compensation for thee. By thy knowledge, by thy keen sensibilities and quickened sympathies thou mayest become a great comforter and great healer. But even in this compensation thou wilt find pain. Thou shalt give love with a lavish hand and w7ith such thou shalt heal many wounds, but such healing will beget in thee a great hunger which shall never be satisfied. Passing sentiments and impulses of grate¬ ful feeling will be given thee, but of the mighty love for which thou shalt long, thou shalt never taste. Thy ten lepers thou shalt heal, but only one will come back to
 thank thee. But in the forgetfulness of the nine thou shalt be blest, inasmuch as thou shalt then be shown the selfishness lurking in all thy acts where thou though test were only goodness and self-sacrifice. Then thou wilt see that thou gavest love for the hope of love in return, and in the futility of such giving thou mayest learn to give as He did, who gave, knowing beforehand that the nine would forget him. So shalt thou through all the days of thy life go desolate of soul and learn wisdom through lessons of bitterness and the feeling of sorrow in all phases of life that touch thee. But by thy knowledge and capacities enlarged through suffering, thou shalt understand the woes of thy fellow-men and become to them a serv¬ ant of servants in all things, who, at last, shall have exceeding great reward. These are the penitentials written in my book over against thy name. Go now into the world and perform them faithfully, and in the end thou shalt have a purified soul, a life everlasting." As the sighing of the wind dieth away, so died her voice. I looked up, and she, the Goddess of Penitentials, was gone. I arose and walked forth into the shining
 sun, which was still the sunshine of sum¬ mer, but its warmth I felt not, for there had fallen on my senses and on my heart the chill of death. Condemnation was written on my face and I dared not meet my fellows whose taunts I had borne be¬ fore with disdain and silent contempt. N ow I was fallen in my own estimation below them, and to leave my native vale without a moment's delay I was fully resolved. At the foot of the hill which led up from the valley, was old Silas, the swine herder. He greeted me as I passed him with his kind old voice. To me he had always been kind, but in my blind conceit I had never thought him worth notice. My heart was kindly-disposed towards all, and old Silas was indebted to me for many a good deed. The favors I had done him were such as I would have done for any bod}7; but in the simplicity of his heart they were special favors to him, and had greatly warmed his old heart towards me. And now as I bade him farewell, knowing that it was forever, though he did not notice that I bade him farewell, a great wave of regret swept over my heart and my eyes filled with tears. From this ignorant old man so low in the scale
 of life, I learned my first great lesson—that the proudest heart may come to need the sympathy of the humblest creature on earth. At that moment my heart was almost breaking for love and sympathy, and knowing how abundantly old Silas would have given all, had I told him my intentions, I could scarcely keep back the truth. But he would have made my departure known and I dared not tell him, for in truth, I was running away from home. Reaching the top of the hill, I turned and looked back on the vale below. There were the home, and all the scenes of my childhood, the low lying fields, the orchard, the meadow, and the quiet nooks of my happy dreams. Between me and all this I knew that to my spirit was a great gulf which could never be passed. A force which I could not resist led me on. Behold now the foolishness and insecurity of the human heart. Scarcely more than an hour before I was full of eagerness and impa¬ tience to leave my native vale, and now my heart was rent in twain because the hour of departure had come. I turned my face to¬ wards the blue-rimmed hills beyond where
 lay the world into which I was to go. Remembering the prophecy of pain await¬ ing me there my heart fainted and I fell upon the earth to pray—not with the lips, but with the bitter cry of the soul whose agony too great for lips to utter God can understand. Somewhere it was spoken audibly to me, as if out of the air: " Faint¬ hearted one arise, go forth into the world and do thy duties, and in the end thou shalt have a purified soul and a life ever¬ lasting." I arose, and from the height of my vain imaginations went down into my valley of humiliation.
A CHRISTMAS CAROL. 
The city was wrapt in snow. Every¬ where it wore white robes—robes resplen¬ dent with whiteness, like those which they say are worn by those who stand about the throne of God. So was the city white and spotless. It was the eve of the Holy Christmas. More than ten thousand feet hourly trod the streets, staining the im¬ maculate sheet let down from the four cor¬ ners of the heaven. But a billion flakes a second silently fluttered down to cover up the stains and to keep the city white for the coming of the Holy Babe of Bethlehem, for it is said, that he is born again on every Christmas eve. And there are some who burn candles at Catholic altars so that the little Christ-child may not be in the dark and the Holy Virgin will be pleased. I would that the saying of his yearly coming was true. Perhaps in the widespread usage at the (110)
 Christmas-tide in the presentation of gifts, the gladdening of little hearts, the partial re¬ membrance of the poor by the rich, and in the general good feeling that prevails, it is true that the little Prince of Peace is born again in the hearts of men. Surely in the happy homes on the Christmas morning, from the merry patter of little feet, the laughing voices, and the overflowing happi¬ ness from the hearts of little children, in them at least, it can not be doubted that the Babe of Bethlehem is born again. On this Christmas-tide there was the usual selling and buying, the usual throngs in the streets, till late at night. The show windows were'marvelous to see. The rich and the poor, the happy and the sorrowr- ful, the good and the bad, passed by and admired the beautiful sights. Perhaps, be¬ hind all this Christmas show was mainly the greedy love of gold and sordidness of heart. And yet in this display and cele¬ bration the hearts of the multitude passing by were more or less softened, and in un¬ conscious ways re-echoed the angelic song of the midnight, heard by the Bethlehem shepherds so long ago—"Peace on earth, good will towards men."
 In the passing crowds there were Simon Johns and his daughter Bess. Christmas had come and gone forty-five times for him and thirteen for her. They were among the poor and outcast who looked at the beautiful windows. He looked with in¬ difference, and she with childish delight, until at times she almost forgot the unap- peased hunger which gnawed at the very vitals of her life. That Christmas night they were homeless and out in the snow. At the windows of a baker's shop, Bess stopped to gaze at the brown loaves of bread with a hunger no words can ever ex¬ press. But in the father there was a thirst for drink greater than Bess' hunger. His craving was a madness for which there is no name which can bear an adequate meaning to the mind of man who never felt the raging of the whiskey demon. At times he would have given his very soul for a drink of whiskey, if such a bargain he could have made. And such was his thirst on that Christmas night. But there was one thing which he would not have given—the one thing which still kept him a human being from whom the image of God was not wholly effaced. In the mo-
 ments of his greatest craving, when his ■own soul would have been as a feather in the scale over against a drink of whiskey, he would not have given Bess for a drink. All through his downward course, even into the bottom of the gutter, she had been -at his side. Nothing could destroy his love for her. Cold and hungry, on and on they wrent through the snow-muffled streets, until they came to the Chattanooga depot. There in the "Colored Waiting Room" they hid in the crowrds waiting for the trains and for awhile they were sheltered and warm. But by and by the trains had carried away the very last passenger to his home, and the night watchman came round to lock the waiting-room doors. His wrath arose when he saw Simon Johns and Bess, for he had driven them out before and for¬ bidden them the use of the passenger's room. When he began to drive them out again, and raised his foot to kick the half dazed and drink-wrecked man, Bess stepped between them to shield her father. There was something in her look, some¬ thing in her pinched and pleading little black face that caused the watchman's foot 8
 to drop. Oat into the cold again they went. "Let us go to the Louisville depot, father; may be we can slip in there." Down to Cedar street they went and past the corner of "Hell's Half Acre," and along Vine and Gay streets, by the great white Capitol. Like some old Greek temple with its Corinthian pillars, Tennessee's pride and glory, towered upward in the night. A huge pile it was with its dim outlines in the snow which fell over it, and around it, whiter than its own marble pillars and porticoes. Down through Capitol avenue and to College street these two homeless vagrants tramped on. At College and Line there was a by-way of Hell in full blaze as they were about to pass. The clinking of glasses and the fumes issuing through the half- screened doors aroused in Simon Johns a legion of devils beyond all control. In he went with Bess clinging to him. "A drink," he cried. But the bar-tender knew him too well and refused him. "This is Christmas eve, man; give him a drink,"cried a voice, as a piece of silver was thrown on the counter. Oh the magic in a drink of whiskey! Simon Johns was no longer dazed and
 stupid, but trembling with excitement and the working of every devil of the legion, as the wolf with one taste of blood, he clamored and plead for one more, drink. One thing only silenced that clamor for the moment. Some one in that wild com¬ pany made a brutal address to Bess, but he was quickly hustled back by a few who knew Simon Johns too well, not to know that the forward reveler who abused the child was inviting death to come in their midst. "Give us a song," shouted one who knew Bess, and who had seen her in a saloon many times before, but always there an in¬ nocent child trying to save her father. "Yes, give us a song, a Christmas song," they shouted and a table was produced for her to stand upon. A rough but not un¬ kind hand lifted her upon it. It was not the first time she had been in a saloon and she had sung there many times for pennies, for she had the voice of a meadow lark. But that night the wild excitement half fright¬ ened her and she stood upon the table un¬ certain for a moment. "Sing, Bess, sing a Christmas song," said her father. Bess had been a faithful
 member of a mission Sunday school in old Howard Chapel once. But that was before she grew to be so big and so ragged. But the songs she learned there were still fresh in her memory. There were other things fresh, too. More things than those often discouraged teachers over the little rag¬ amuffins that used to assemble wTith Bess ever suspected. But that is God's way often. May be only one out of a large crowd of street Arabs will be saved where much effort has been put forth to save so many. But the one is always worth the effort put forth. That one may become God's mes¬ senger in some time of great need to carry His gospel wThere those who taught could never go. And so was Bess his messenger on that night. On that wooden table amid the wildest confusion, her voice untrained, but with a native sweetness so common to many Negroes, she lifted up and sang as one inspired of God. And who can safely say that she was not inspired at that mo¬ ment? Over the fumes of whiskey and tobacco, and oaths more vile than either, rose her voice like a lark's:
 "Jesus my Saviour to Bethlehem came, Born in a manger to sorrow and shame, Oh, it was wonderful, how could it be, Seeking for me, for me. Jesus my Saviour on Calvary's tree Paid the great debt and set my soul free, Oh, it was wonderful, how could it be, Dying for me, for me." On and on she went through all the verses of that beautiful song, swelling in the chorus, "Oh it was wonderful, how could it be, Dying for me;" letting her voice die away on those last words with a sweetness and pathos which a stage artist could not have surpassed. Every oath was dead on the lips of those profaning men while Bess sang to them. The little innocent Babe of Bethlehem had suddenly come into their presence and then later they saw him dy- on the Cross for them. When the first song was ended, without change of pitch the little black singer broke into another song more joyous. "In the sweet by and by," she went on trilling to them. Gathering greater and greater inspi¬ ration from her theme as she went on, in the sweetness of the voice of a nightingale, she sang to them of that land which is fairer than day. Out of the hard ex-
 periences of her pitiful life and the im¬ pulses of her mystical nature she had con¬ structed her own eschatology of the heaven. And in this moment of ecstacy she poured out a melody full of imaginary heaven, a heaven of green fields full of all the sweetness of summer, where the biting snows never come and wrhere there are no hunger and the pinchings of poverty. Indeed there were no evils of any kind in that sweet by and by of which she sang. In those sin-stained men, feelings and im¬ pulses long since dead were awakened to life by this unexpected Christmas carol, and in some of them at least a sense of their lost condition suddenly forced itself before their minds with all its dark suggestions. What sweet by and by was there for them ? They were all hardened men, full of oaths, full of drink, full of strife and unbridled passions, and some of them had hands stained with blood. And }7et while that little black singer stood in their midst pouring out the raptures of her song, there were lips vile with drink and oaths, that trembled, and there were tears that trickled doAvn faces long seared with vice. In that den of iniquity there were sons of
 Ireland, Italy, American-born whites, and Negroes, come to all stages of manhood in sin and vice. But all of them had once been little innocent boys. In the soft sun¬ shine of far away Itaty some of them had played in green fields and with childish delight listened to the nightingale sing her sweet and sad measures. And there in the old church-yard were little green mounds under which were peacefully sleeping little brothers and sisters who never grew up, who never crossed the wide sea, and who were never stained with drink, oaths, and sinful vices. There were others who in the "Old Country," St. Patrick's blessed Isle, who had been faithful little boys at the Cathedral, and with innocent young hearts and voices had joined in the priest's chant¬ ing at the solemn mass before sin had led them so far from home and so far from God. There were American white boys who had been happy and good 011 the farms, but yielding to their restlessness had come up to the city for better fortunes, but had found only a downward road to all shame. There were those who had been happy and sunny little Negro boys amid the plantations, who had wandered far
 away from their old mothers who were still praying and agonizing for their salvation in some little church cabin where Negro fervor and faith meet to wrestle with God and to tell Him the tales of their sorrowful life. For a moment years of vice and sin rolled away from the memory of those sin¬ ful men, and all of them felt, for the mo¬ ment at least, a touch of the sweetness of childhood's innocence again, and with it a yearning for that better life which they had thrown away. It was God's call to them—perhaps his very last call to some of them to become better men, and the judg¬ ment day may show that little black singer- wearing a crown shining with stars, given to her for having led some of those lost and benighted men out of darkness into light by singing her Christmas carol that night. And Simon Johns—all the legion of devils in him were cast out and he stood clothed in his right mind. Without a word he went to Bess and folded her in his arms and went out into the night. The keen north wind struck them with a savage howl and Bess shivered and clung to her father. But the heart of Simon Johns was warm.
 As he went down College street half blinded with the snow he felt that he was carrying Bess up the aisle of the Church to the altar again to be baptized. The snow- flakes made him think of Amanda's new white dress which she wore to the baby's baptizing, and Bess again was a little bun¬ dle of a cooing baby which he held half ashamed, but with a heart full of fatherly pride and love. He was young and full of hope then, and work was plenty. That was in the little home on Grannywhite street, before he knew drink and hard times. On he went in that momentary happy dream till he reached the Louisville depot and found the door of the " colored-wait¬ ing-room1' closed and locked. This brought him back to their real situation. Bitter]y he recalled his first great sorrow over Amanda's death, the loss of his job of work soon after, and the hard times which followed. Then the discouragement which he sought to soften in drink and all his downward course flashed over his mind. He recalled his efforts to reform and how he had fallen again and again until he had lost all hope. Then, down and down he had gone, till the moment of that bitter
 hour out in the snow. Keen remorse pierced his heart when he thought what he had brought Bess to—wThat he had done to the little baby God had given him. " Oh ! God pity me for Bess' sake. Try me once more," he moaned at heart. " It is no use," whispered one of the cast out demons, " you will end this night's repentance in a drunken spree to-morrow. To-morrow is the holy Christmas and there will be plenty of free whisky all over the city and you will be drunk again." " It shall never be, I swear it, by God." " Why, father, what do you say that for ? " " Nothing, Bess." A wild thought suddenly entered his mind and formed itself into a resolution as quickly. With Bess still in his arms he crossed the railway track. There was the little tower of the keeper of the crossing. He was snug and warm within and sat dozing over his stove. Simon Johns turned suddenly and walked down the track past the red light over the door of Linck's hotel towards the river. " One step off of the bridge will do it," he said to himself. His heart shuddered at the thought of the
 terrified cry that would come from Bess in the fall. But then he would hold her tight in his arms, and the midnight waters of the cold Cumberland would soon hush her cry and shut out of his ears the whispers of the legions of devils. Then there would be that land fairer than day. But sudden¬ ly he began to wonder if he could go along with Bess into that fair country, if the keepers of it would let a sin-stained man like him pass. What if the icy waves of the Cumberland should separate him from Bess forever? The thought was too terrible for him, and like some frightened and hard-pressed animal the poor drink-wrecked man turned up Market street towards Mar¬ ket square. He was exhausted with the excitement and carrying Bess. He crossed over to the courthouse yard, watching nar¬ rowly for the policemen. But there was no need of that for that blue-coated gentry hired to watch the city by night were too safely housed away from the cold to molest Simon Johns, had he been meditating a much greater crime than hiding from the storm in the old courthouse. All the doors to the hallways of that grim old building were locked. Her justice and her protec-
 tion were shut within. It Avas not a build¬ ing in which Negroes generally found comfort at any time, and to-night for these two vagrants of that race there was no wel¬ come. Indeed the old building might have been as fittingly called a temple of sorrows as a court of justice. In the days of slavery many broken-hearted Negroes had stood on her stone-steps and had been auctioned off to the far plantations of the South as so many cattle. Over her stone threshold many a poor sinful criminal had crossed to hear his doom and afterwards to be marched out to the penitentiary for life or to the gal¬ lows, leaving behind all hopes of life and a' name to be blotted out of the book of re¬ membrance. But that night that grim old building, the stage of so many life tragedies was as silent and peaceful as a tomb. As Simon Johns and Bess crouched away in the angle of the wall and the stone steps, there were none to molest them but the wind and the driving snow which searched out every nook and corner, and penetrated every crack and crevice. " 0 father, I am so cold,"' moaned Bess. But by and by she fell into a fitful sleep. Once when she gave a convulsive shiver
 Simon Johns took off his old coat and wrapped it around her. A blast of wind as if enraged at his daring, with a shriek swept down on him, chilling his very bones. But his heart grew warmer as he thought Bess was sleeping and was warm. By and by the warmth of his heart began to steal all over his body and a sense of the sweet¬ est sleep began to creep upon him. Some¬ how his heart began to be very glad and he wanted to shout and laugh, but he was too sleepy to do so. Such a peaceful rest kept stealing over him, till at last he was lost in that most lasting and the sweetest of all sleeps that ever comes to rest the weary. And the same sweet sleep was upon Bess and brought to her a beautiful dream. The Madonna so full of all sweetness and that ineffable tenderness of maternity came and brought the little Bethlehem babe, who smiled and stretched out his hands for Bess to take him. Then the mother of the little Christ said, "You sang a beautiful carol to him to¬ night and now I am come to take you with me to sing sweet carols to him for ever and ever." She and her father were so glad, and when they stood up they were clad in
 beautiful garments—garments more beauti¬ ful than all the Christmas show windows. For the first time since Bess could remem¬ ber all hunger was gone. Her father looked so young and happy. They crossed the square and went over the suspension bridge and on through East Nashville to¬ wards the rising sun. They had never seen the city look so beautiful before. Soon they came to the border of a new country and into a land of summer. They saw strange and beautiful trees, full of golden fruit. Birds of wonderful and brilliant plumage shot through the air and sang the sweetest songs. Bess began to warble after them to the delight of the little Christ child, and an inexpressible delight took possession of her soul. On and on they went with the beauty of the country ever increasing. At last they came to a park beautiful beyond all description. Here be¬ neath a great tree full of white blossoms that filled the air with delightful perfume they sat down to rest. The Madonna gave them luscious fruit to eat. " This," she said, " is that land fairer than day, and you are to live here for al¬ ways and always."
 And in this first hour of transporting de¬ light, to the musical ripples of fountains and the sweet songs of birds, Bess and her father fell into a sweet sleep. It was the morning of the Holy Christmas and the sun rose over all Nashville wrapt in snow. Early the saloons were thronged for a Christmas drink. And those who had money were generous in treats to those who lacked the amount necessary to buy a drink. A low class of Negroes and white people fought in the streets. Heeling here and there were men and women drunk with whisky. The patrol wagons were busy running in the Christmas revelers. Guns of all descriptions roared in the air and pandemonium wras abroad. It was a common celebration. It is the way in which the South keeps the commemoration of the Holy Christmas. While a police¬ man was crossing the courthouse yard to stop a fight on the opposite side, he noticed a strange looking mound of pnow in the angle of the courthouse wall and the stone steps. He went to it and gave it a kick. Simon Johns, who sat leaning against the wall with Bess in his arms, fell over on his side.
ANNETTE. 
" Annison is conjured." That was the story which went from cabin to cabin, all through the valley. For three days he had lain in a strange stupor, speechless and knowing no one. Annison was a hand¬ some mulatto, and so was Annette, his be¬ trothed. On the third day at sunset a bird flew into the room where Annison lay, and fluttered about in terror until it found its way out. A few moments later old Bull, Annison's dog, came in front of the door and howled three times. Then Annette knew Annison was doomed. These were two sure signs of death. Out in the darkness and down the lone¬ some path of Lunny's Hollow, Annette with unspeakable anguish sped on and on to old Martha's cabin. Martha knew she would come that night. She was the arch princess of conjurers among the Negroes of the Hollow. Martha was ignorant, but a (128)
 keen reader of human nature and a shrewd old woman. That mysterious power, given a few, by which they can sway the faith, spirit and souls of others, was old Martha's in a marked degree. Through all the ages from her ancestral Africa, and indeed further back from the families of Asia, this gift, false in all its claims, but nevertheless powerful and believed in by the ignorant of all nations, had come down to old Mar¬ tha all the way to Lunny's Hollow. She went with Annette so see Annison on the second day of his sickness, and she saw what Annette's eyes blinded with love and hope did not see. Old Martha lived by her art, and never risked her reputation incautious¬ ly. Her only pledge was that she would cod suit her " kards and colfee-grounds " the next day to see who had tricked Annison, and to find out the nature of the spell he was under. The next night when Annette with a face of woe burst in upon her, old Martha was ready for her. " 0 Aunt Martha! a bird flew in the house at sunset, and old Bull howled three times before the door. Save Annison, Aunt Martha." 9
 " I knowed all dat befo' you corned, An¬ nette." Old Martha's adopted daughter, Matilda Ann, was in the room, but she paid no at¬ tention to Annette. She had not spoken to her for months. She said Annette was " stuck up, kase she wuz yaller; " and once Annette had said that "Eph Divens is as ugly as ho-made sin." Eph was Matilda Ann's adored. " Annette," said old Martha, " how much does you love Annison, and what would you do to save him ?" There was some¬ thing so playful in her tone, Annette's heart gave a mighty bound of hope. " How much does I love him ? How much would the world weigh if it was all gold ? How much is the love which all the women of these valleys and mountains has for their husbands and lovers ? That is how much I loves Annison. What would I do to save him ? I would crawl to the end of the world on my knees-, and die after I got there, if that much more was needed to save him." " Would you, Annette ? " in a tone bor¬ dering on derision. There was a gleam of contempt in her
 eves, and of a sort of malicious pleasure which she would take in seeing Annette quail before the ordeal which she had in store for her. Old Martha had had the homage of fear and veneration for her power, but love never. Such avowals as that of Annette's aroused in her a feeling akin to resentment. She was not mean at heart, but she was human and had missed that something in life which softens all hearts. For the lack of it there had come into her heart a bitterness which she hardly knew existed, and the exact nature of which she could not have explained beyond that feeling of contempt and resentment which Annette had aroused. " Well, I will tell you what will take An- nison from under his spell and save him. Here is four bags. If you takes 'em to Sun¬ set Rock on Shagg's Point and throws em, one at de east, one to de no'th, one to de west, and one to de south, 'zackly at mid¬ night, and saj^s what I tells you—'zackly at midnight, mind you—you and Annison will live together." Annette gave a stifled scream of horror. Shagg's Point to the Negroes of Lunny's Hollow was the abode of all the evil spirits
 in the hobgoblin world. For his life's sake no Negro would venture there alone at night. Martha knew this all too well, and then it was five miles from her cabin to Sunset Rock—and it was then half past nine. She would have been glad to have given Annette an easier task, but her repu¬ tation was at stake, and the task must be an impossible one. A bold and strong moun¬ taineer would have found nothing impossi¬ ble in this task with two and a half hours of time, but old Martha knew that Annette weak and terrified could not make the trip in time if she dared—that is, Martha thought she knew that, and ran no risk by imposing the task. But there was something in Annette's heart that old Martha had never known : a something that had made man}- a maiden weaker than Annette perform greater feats than this one old Martha imposed. She underrated the powers of Annette's love. At first she did falter, and said, "0, Aunt Martha! ain't there some other way?" " No, dere ain't, and dat's a heap easier en crawl¬ ing to the end of the world on your knees." Matilda Ann had looked on in silence, but there is one sorrow that will move the
 hearts of all women into sympathy with one another. Matilda Ann had been bit¬ ter towards Annette, but then there was a secret sadness in her own heart that plead for Annette. Annette had a little educa¬ tion and a gift of speech which poor Matil¬ da Ann did not have. She was greatly moved by Annette's avowal of her love for Annison, and at that moment somewhere away down the Mississippi was her own Eph, who might be sick unto death, and she as Annette some day. She could not have expressed her love with Annette's elo¬ quence, but she knew that in her heart that love was all there—that love which her slow tongue and thick lips could never truly ut¬ ter. How much she was moved was summed up in her brief statement: "I will go along with Annette, mammy." Only those who can understand her deep superstitions and full belief in all the re¬ puted terrors of Shagg's Point could appre¬ ciate Matilda Ann's offer. " No, Annette must go by herself, or An¬ nison dies dis night." " Give me the bags, then, Aunt Martha," said Annette with sudden force born of love and despair.
 At the door she turned with the anguish of a lost soul and said, " Aunt Martha, if I don't get back, tell Annison I went there to save him." For a moment old Martha's heart sof¬ tened and she was tempted to call Annette back and tell her the truth. Then she mut¬ tered, " I se got to live ; it won't do. Den dere ain't nothin' up dar to hurt her. Let her go long." So Annette went out into the night and on and on in the dark. It was June. A shower of rain had fallen early in the even¬ ing and still there were shifting clouds in the sky. There was a sweet smell from the damp earth and the green wToods. The wild flowers were hidden in the darkness, but they sent out a sweet and silent greet¬ ing to Annette. One b}r one the clouds at last were withdrawn and the sheets of mist about Shagg's Point glided away. The moon was peeping up over the head of the mountain, and Sunset Rock clearly defined against the molten sky jutted out as a per¬ sonification of majestic solitude. Suddenly Annette felt a cold chill of death pass over her. As she looked at Shagg's Point, for a moment she saw stand
 out against the background of yellow sky, something—a mere speck it was, yet in shape like that of a man which passed from Sunset Rock to a shadow beyond. She thought it was a spirit and she knew she was going to her doom ; but she murmured the one name, " Annison," and went on. Still on and on she sped, climbing, stum¬ bling, and falling, butalwayson, murmuring the name that was love and life. At last a few minutes before midnight, sore and worn, she reached the crown of Shagg's Point. There before her Sunset Rock, with the moonbeams sweetly asleep upon it, lay stretched out, a mighty cliff over a fright¬ ful abyss. The scene was so peaceful An¬ nette approached half in hope that the spir¬ its were all absent. How far away sometimes are the evils for which we look, and how near are those which we do not suspect. Out from the copse near Sunset Rock, two keen, glitter¬ ing, cruel and merciless eyes were watching Annette as she approached. At first in them there was amazement, a moment of fear; but soon there was a gleam of gloat¬ ing triumph. Bill Hoard, the notorious murderer and outlaw of the mountains,
 knew Annette of the valley. He knew old Martha and Annison. He knew the super¬ stitions of the Negroes, and all their terrors of Shagg's Point. He did not know of An- nison's sickness; but he knew that some terrible and desperate measure forced An¬ nette to Shagg's Point at midnight. " Ah, ha! my fine lady. When I asked you to come and live with me, you called me a low-down thief, and the scrapings of poor-white-trash. When I told you any sort of a white man was good enough for a nigger, you spit in my face, for which I knocked you down. And now you have come all the way to Shagg's Point at mid¬ night to hunt Billy up. The giant's cave is not as good as the cabin I invited you to, but you won't mind that, my fine lady." Poor Annette! Was there no pity in heaven—no hand to save? But who can truly say that unseen in the soft moonlight, the most compassionate pity was not walk¬ ing by Annette's side ? What is pity and what is salvation ? Eternity alone can give full answer. Out on Sunset Rock she walked. Her fear was almost gone. On the east, the north, the west, there was a ledge of rock over which one might step to
 an abyss of three thousand feet below. To the south only was there a retreat from Sun¬ set Rock. Annette turned first to the east where the sky was golden with gleams, and murmured her gharm and then threw her first bag. With the throw to the north went a mighty wave of love, for there far down in the dark shadows of the valley was Annison whom she was saving. Then to the west she repeated her charm. Now half- gleeful she turned to the south to complete her work of magic. The incantation died on her lips. Horror palsied her uplifted hand. There in the dreamy moonlight, with a tiger's tread, sure of his victim, steal¬ ing upon her, was a man, who to her dilated vision was the father of giants. There was one swift moment of silent agony, and then with a scream that went up to the stars Annette was over Sunset Rock. How lovely was the June morning with its soft blue sky and meadows of green grass in the valleys. On Shagg's Point the hemlock boughs gracefully nodded to the cool breezes which swept down the sides of the mountain to the valleys below, car¬ rying such a sweet breath of new life. Ra¬ cing up and down an old chestnut, two gray
squirrels were chattering and playing like a newly married pair. The trees were full of birds which filled the air with chirping and singing, where the leaves were trem¬ bling and shaking out silvery glitters and dancing shadows to the ground. Under Sunset Rock more than a thou¬ sand feet below on a shelf of the mountain side, there was a little patch of broken stones and earth, which, doubtless, had fall¬ en in some little avalanche from the brow of the mountain long ago. Growing out from among the stones and earth were some mountain laurels. And there was a little stream of water that trickled from a cleft in the rock wall. Here in a niche was the home of a family of wrens which had dwelt there undisturbed for ages in all the bliss of bird life. By the edge of that short stream, down to the very edge where it leaped to the depths below, the wild lobe¬ lia flamed in crimson glory. Everywhere there was earth enough for their tiny roots, the violets were rioting in gay profusion.. And what was that lying half hidden among their green leaves and purple eyes ? What was it in this peaceful abode which was causing such a chattering and wild con-
 fusion among the wrens ? It was only a little mangled body of a beautiful quadroon girl. That body, now mangled beyond all recognition, at midnight had stood on Sun¬ set Rock, the temple of a mighty love. The reputation of old Martha, the arch princess of the conjurers, was maintained, for her word had come true. " Mind you," she had said, " If you is dar 'zackly at mid¬ night, you and Annison will live together." Almost an hour after Annette had stood on Sunset Rock, just as a hand of the clock pointed ten minutes to one, Annison sud¬ denly seemed conscious. He raised himself upon his elbow in bed, and with a smile, said, " Annette, how beautiful you looks." He laid down, turned over on his side and sweetly went off to sleep. Next morning word was sent ten miles down the valley to Nelie Fraction for Elder Dangerfield to come up to Lunny's Hollow to preach An- nison's funeral.
A CHRISTMAS NIGHT. 
Once more on the tall cliffs of Mount Paradise rest the melting rays of a setting sun. The bald tops of Gedor, Gibeah, and Mais Elias, as a thousand times before, flame in the distance with burnished gold. Gedor and Gibeah, from their bald tops, without emotion look down on centuries that have rolled away before them, like the mist of the morning. What shifting scenes, what tragedies of life have been played out on their sides and in the vales below. What mighty forces have gone out from before them to subdue the world, and to bring to it, peace and good will towards men. And still old Gedor and Gibeah stand on and on in grim silence, waiting for the perfection of that peace to come. As if to bless their patient waiting, on their bald tops the sun pauses with a good night smile, and to give once more a parting benediction. In the ancient stillness one can almost hear a hospitable greeting of Abraham to all the (140)
A Christmas Night. 141 world—Shalom Leka. Far over the val¬ leys, stretching away to the depressions of Cedron, where once were the vineyards and grain fields of Boaz and Ruth, and the sheep pastures of the boy David, the twi¬ light falls again, deepening more and more until all objects are lost in the indistinct¬ ness ; and once more a solemn and mys¬ terious awe drops down over Bethlehem, and the Christmas night begins to be.
A FAREWELL. 
The hills of the Highland Rim of Middle Tennessee—straggling spurs from the Unaka range, were lifting their lofty heads sky-ward, as they had been doing ever since the creation of the world. On their sides the green corn rustled and swayed to the passing breezes and the golden wheat waved in beautiful billowy undulations. The bright sun smiled down upon it with no cloud to dim his radiance. Slowly along the steep, winding path my friend and I walked in silence. He carried his gun— a little pretext for hunting— but, truly, he was out to take a last walk with me. Many a time before in a loving friendship of many years had we walked on this same path¬ way. Many a time before we both had gazed upon the inexpressible beauty of this same landscape, talking and dreaming of the future, with all of youth's hope and ambition. But this walk was a silent one. (142)
Soon my friend tired and we sat down un¬ der the shade of a great chestnut. Long we sat there. The sun moved upwards in the heavens and ever and anon his rays, like that of a great diamond, shot through some opening in the foliage. The branches of the trees above our heads, touched by an unseen hand of the winds, sang a low forest song. The hum of the insects and the twitter of the birds that belong to a summer's day in June, was all around^us. Far below us in the Liberty Valley all the grain fields were in a glimmer. My friend and I sat beside each other in a dreamy silence. Once he started suddenly and cocked his gun at a grey squirrel which frisked out before as upon a mulberry tree. It scampered off and my friend£sat down with a look on his face as if a'second thought of compas¬ sion had come to him. He was an unerring shot, but 0! in those hours life seemed so sweet to him. The slow and relentless hand of consumption was teaching him how to pity the living. He let the little squirrel pass which came frisking back again to bark at us. By and|by a faint echo of distant thunder, suggesting a summer shower, warned my friend to return to the house and me to pursue my journey. We arose to say good-by. Then there was a beating round the bush for some parting words. We both wanted to appear cheerful. I talked of my trip, soon to be made to Connecticut, and the long year of study there ; He, of his sum¬ mer's rest and recuperation to return to Fisk University. Thus we talked as we had talked before. But our souls—0 our souls! They were looking at each other face to face, and understood well enough the quibbling, lying words of our lips. When we started out for that good-bye walk we both knew that it was the last time we should ever walk together in our mortal bodies. When our hands clasped in the good-bye, with a promise to soon meet again, we knew that we would be in our robes of white when we did meet. And that last touch of hands was too much for us. Our souls gave a mutual cry for little more truth. And I said, "Be brave to the end, Little Wood. Sail your boat worthy of the Captain. When you are flagged to come in the port, go in with your colors still up." " I will," he said, " and don't you forget that your vessel is a light one,too." Again the thunder echoed along the hills and louder. We parted, my friend and I. At a bend in the path I turned to look again. Slowly homeward he walked. Yea, it was homeward that he walked. I stood and gazed till the gun and familiar form of "Little Wood'' passed from my view. Another June sun has smiled on the Highland Rim of Middle Tennessee, and on all the beautiful, rich Liberty Valley—as it has done a thousand times before. But it has made green for the first time the grave of my friend.

PREFACE.
A serious injustice is done an author when his friends
and enemies fail to read his preface. I trust that my friends
may at least do me the justice to read why I venture to send
these poems forth to the public.
To attempt to write poetry is very generally considered
an indisputable evidence of a mild form of insanity, and yet
I presume to trust that such is not my case.
No man should trust himself before the public unless he
has written something that the public ought to hear, or some-
thing that the public wants to hear, and he himself should
not constitute that public.
As to the first, I dare not say; as to the second, many
have so expressed themselves.
But even with the fear of public criticism, and possibly
public censure, I commit myself to its tender mercies.
So many have asked for copies of "Emancipation" and
other of my poems; the public press has spoken so kindly
of them, that I indulge the hope that they may meet some
favor.
Perhaps some line may cheer and help a struggling
brother, or bring some light and gladness into a stricken
heart; but anyway, no line can bring ught but pleasure, as I
believe a deep sense of the good, the beautiful and the true
can be found on every page. Should the rhyme, the meter
or the lines offend they at least are written from the heart.
Your humble and obedient friend,
THE AUTHOR.

Emancipation.
[Read at the Emancipation Exercises at True Reformers' Hall, Rich-
mond, Va., January 1, 1892.]
Blest freedom! 'tis the sweetest strain that fills the human heart,
Its blessings must delight the soul, and sweetest joys impart;
The feathered songsters of the globe were mute if caged in gold,
And, though in rags, the heart, free, beats in ecstacy untold.
Upon the ocean, calm and deep, a lordly vessel sails.
She bears upon her swelling breast twenty human slaves;
Far from their native land to dwell, beneath an alien sky,
Far from that dear and sunny home where Africa's waters lie.
She landed on Virginia's shore, just where we stand to-day,
And gaze upon a lovely group, clad in bright array.
And mem'ries strong and deep arise, and quick the tear-drops spring,
As we think of what to-day we are, and what we late have been.
But yesterday, and dark the cloud that hung above our sky;
To-day 'tis past, and, full of joy, the tears of gladness rise.
The day we longed and prayed for sore, at last has blessed our sight,
And, that we come to celebrate, who can but say 'tis right?
E'en in our slav'ry we can trace the kindly hand of God,
That took us from our sunny land, and from our native sod,
Where tropic birds their matins sing, and, sweet the streamlets flow,
And kindly Nature sweetly smiles upon the vales below.
Where scented zephyrs fan the cheek, and heav'nly music swells
And God's own matchless finger paints the lovely hills and delis;
There sweetest music fills the air, while beautious Nature smiles,
And every scene delights the soul, but only max is vile.
​There, clad in Nature's simplest garb he roamed a savage wild,
Untamed his passions, half a man, and half a savage child,
And knew not God, save, what in stones, the God of love revealed,
The blessed Revelation was to him a message sealed.
And God to teach him His dear will saw fit to bring him where
He learned of Him and Jesus Christ, those lessons rich and rare;
He made the savage into man tho' moulded by the rod, 
And, Ethiopia has, indeed, stretched forth her hands to God.
He was a man, and felt as men, his soul with anguish burned.
His heart with deep pulsations beat, and indignations spurned;
But God still held him to the blast, and still afflicted sore,
And still he groaned, and still he prayed, yet still his burden bore.
But, like the cries of Israel old, his prayers ascended high,
And reached the great Jehovah's throne, beyond the azure sky,
And His own power brought freedom down, and broke the chain, despair,
And bade the Negro walk with men, as free as Nature's air.
But was he true? speak Bunker Hill! and Boston Common say,
Did he defend from British foe on that historic day?
While thousands stood with heaving breast and dared not strike a blow,
A Negro's voice then cheered the throng, and bade them charge the foe.
His blood was spilled to gain a place in battle's honored roll,
And Crispus Attucks stands aloof among the heroes bold,
And when we speak of valiant deeds and love of country fair,
We not begrudge his well-bought. fame, but place a laurel there.
And in the dark and bloody days, when thick the battle rolled,
And North and South had gathered arms and called each other foes,
A soldier brave upon the field, a faithful slave at home,
He disdaned to mar the name of 'loved ones left alone.
But as a faithful, watch-dog stands and guards with jealous eye,
He watched his master's wife and child and at the door would lie
To shed his blood, if need should rise and one had come to mar
The peace of those whose father went to fight in cruel war.
To-day is hushed the cannon's roar and peace reigns every-where,
And blessed freedom makes our land the fairest of the fair;
Shall we who helped to make it bloom and blossom as a rose,
Be cast aside, unworthy of a place upon its sod?
We love her and are loyal as the truest of her sons,
For her our blood was shed, for her, so oft our tears have sprung,
We'll strive to have her take her place the first of any land
Stand ready to defend her soil from any alien band.
But God has freed us and to Him we bow in praise to-day,
He'll never leave us nor forsake but will protect alway,
And, conscious of a heart that's true with purpose brave and strong,
We leave our case in those just Hands that can not do a wrong,
'Tis here our eyes beheld the light, and, here at evening's close,
We hope to wrap our mantles 'round and take our last repose,
No politicians should divide relationships divine
No arm should sever friendships formed "in days of auld lang syne.
"Tis the blessing that we celebrate and not the cause now lost,
For that was dear to other hearts as this can be to us,
And who were right, or who were wrong, we are not here to say,
For still in death-they're heroes all, the blue, likewise the grey.
And now the din of battle past, they are our friends the same,
Not such as come to get our votes, not friends in only name,
But friends, who deep in honest hearts, but wish our highest joy,
God grant it may ne'er severed be, but last without alloy.
Then let us all with one accord now join the jubilee,
And praise our God the ruler of the new land of the free,
And babes unborn, in future years, will rise to call us great,
For fixing now for coming time "The Day We Celebrate."
Owls', Song.
[Written for The Owl Club of Richmond, Va, and sung at its Thanks-
giving Dinner, November, 1888.]
Bird of the night! to thee,
Perched on the forest tree,
Our song we raise;
Thy deeds we celebrate,
And thy great works narrate,
Thy fame we advocate,
In notes of praise.
The turkey may be sweet,
And many birds you meet
Are splendid "fowls;"
Not e'en the eagle bold,
Nor birds with plumage gold,
Nor song birds, young or old,
Can touch thee, owl.
And whence comes thy great name,
Bird of the noble fame!
Of being wise?
"Tis for thy silent tongue,
That oft thy praise is sung,
And oft thy name is rung
Up to the skies.
And many a man's called smart,
Who takes the screech-owl's part,
And holds his tongue;
And then men call him wise,
Though he is "otherwise,"
And laud him to the skies,
His praise is sung.
So we are festive owls,
And like that best of "fowls,"
When day declines;
Abroad we soar at night,
To scenes of joy and light,
To have, while life is bright,
A jolly time.
"Hope."
To my Sunday School Class-Set to music and sung at Commencement
Exercises, June 22d 1893.]
When evening shades, the night's fair warping,
Doth gild the spires with its fond lingering rays,
The sun's last tint is hope's bright dawning,
The gloom will pass, the night shades fade away:
Bright hope gives warning,
Of daylight's dawning,
When gloom is past, night's darkness chased away.
When sorrow, care, and pain unceasing,
Beset our pathway and our souls appall,
We still can trust that love increasing,
That gilds the stars, yet, marks the sparrows' fall.
That love imploring,
Our trust enduring,
Shall pierce the gloom by faith in Him our All!
When Death's dark night its shadows gather,
Hope brightly beams and sheds her cheering ray;
What e'er betide we trust our Father,
Who clothes the fields with flowers in bright array.
Through ages winging,
His praises singing,
New life shall dawn with heaven's eternal day.

De N*****'s Got to Go.
Written
[Written for the RICHMOND PLANET on the occasion of a bill being
offered in Congress to transport all Negroes to Africa.]
By Jenoter Gutter-
Dear Liza, I is bin down town,
To Massa Charley's sto',
An' all de talk dis nigger hear
Is-"n*****s got to go:"
I 'fess it bodders my ole head,
An' I would like to kno',
What all we cullud folks is done,
Dat now we's got to go?
I hear dem say dat long ago,
To ole Virginny's sho',
Dar kum a ship wid cullud folks,
Some twenty odd or mo',
Dey tells me dat dey hoed de corn,
An' wuz good wuckers sho';
Dey made Virginny like de rose,
But now dey's got to go.
Dat, when ole Ginnel Washington
Did whip dem red coats so,
A nigger wuz de fus to fall,
A-fightin' ub de foe;
Dat in de late "unpleasan'ness"
Dey watched at massa's do'
Proteckin' ub his lubin' ones,
But now we's got to go.
I 'fess I lubs dis dear ole place,
'Twuz here we buried Jo',
An' little Liza married off
So menny years ago,
An' now wez feeble, an' our lims
Is a-gittin mighty slo',
I'd hate to lebe dis dear ole place
But den wez got to go.
I don' kno' much 'bout politicks,
An' all dem things fur sho',
But de las leckshun I jes vote
Like de white folks tole me to;
Dey tole me vote for Dimikrats
An' 'twould be better sho',
But now dey don de leckshun win
But dey sez we's got to go.
Dey sez de white folks mad long us,
Kas wez-a-kummin up you kno',
An' sum un us is gittin' rich,
Wid do' bells on de do':
Dat wez get lawyers, doctors too,
An all dem things fur sho':
But den, it kan be jes for dis
Dat we all got to go.
De Lord he made dis lubly lan'
For white an' black folks too,
An' gin each man his roe to ten,
Den what we gwine to do?
We habes ourselbes, an' 'specks de laws,
But dey's peckin' mo' an' mo'
We aint don nuffin tall to dem,
Den huc-kum we mus' go.
Fur ebry nashun on de glob'

Dey welkums dem wid open arms,
No matter whar dey from
But we who here wuz bred an born,
Don' seem to hab no sho';
We hoped to make it what it is,
But den wez got to go.
It 'pears to me, my Liza dear,
Wez got a right to stay,
An' not a man on dis brod uf

But why kan white folks lef us lone,

An what dey all time talkin' 'bout

"But Rastus,” Liza sed, “Trus' in God,

He lubs us if wez cullud folks,
Our hearts is white an puh
An' less de Lord sez, forward march!
Wez not a gwine to go."
I Can Trust.
[Written for the YOUNG MEN'S FRIEND]
I can not see why trials come,
And sorrows follow thick and fast;
I can not fathom His designs,
Nor why my pleasures can not last,
Nor why my hopes so soon are dust,
But, I can trust.
When darkest clouds my sky o'er hang,
And sadness seems to fill the land,
I calmly trust His promise sweet,
And cling to his ne'er failing hand,
And, in life's darkest hour, I'll just
Look up and trust.
I know my life with Him is safe,
And all things still must work for good
To those who love and serve our God,
And lean on Him as children should,
Though hopes decay and turn to dust,
I still will trnst.
THE BABY SHOW.
[Written for SOCIAL DRIFTS.]
Babies large, and babies small,
And babies fat and fair;
The fond mammas and dear papas,
Had all the young ones there.
The "Dispatch" man came and viewed the scene,
And decided in a minute,
That the infant with the "kinky-top"
Was certainly not "in it."
Perhaps to some this argues ill,
And some, no doubt, are frigthened,
But to my mind it demonstrates,
We are simply being ENLIGHTENED.
"If I Should Die."
[Written for the NEW YORK AGE.]
If I should die, and ne'er again
Behold the daylight dear to me, carfessed,
Nor press the hand that once carressed,
Nor hear the voice of tenderness,
That spake in softest tones and free;
If I should die, would any heart
Feel for my lost? Would any deed
Of kindness wrought for ones in need
Rise up to bless me in the grave?
How have I lived ?-for self alone,
Or for the good of those around,
Who soon may list to hear a sound,
From these my lips-then still in death?
Will children come to strew around
"Forget me not" upon my tomb?
Or shall I go "Unwept, unhonored and unsung,"
From earth fair face when death shall come
To claim me for its own,
And my dear ones be left alone.
I can not tell, but still must hope,
As does the meanest beggar found,
That to some heart my silent grave
Shall be enchanted ground, where oft
At evening's close find feet may stray
To drop a tear: God grant it may
When I shall sleep in death's embrace,
Though safe "At home" I still would trust
That, to some heart, my silent dust
Shall mem'ries wake of sweetest strains.
When mute the lips, how soon forgot,
And tangled weeds but mark the spot,
Where sleeps the last of mortal clay:
And still the stars their vigils keep,
While night birds coo their mournful lays.
Good deeds live on; alone they shine,
And brighter grow 'mid coming years,
God's record fair; and when at last
The trump of God shall sound, white
Robes await the just and ramsomed there.
De Linin' ub De Hymns.
[Written for the RICHMOND PLANET.]
Dars a mighty row in Zion an' de debbil's gittin' high,
An' de saints done beat de sinners, a-cussin' on de sly;
What for it am? you reckon, well, I'll tell how it 'gin
Twuz 'bout a mighty leetle thing, de linin' ub de hyms.
De young folks say taint stylish to lin' out no mo',
Dat dey's got edikashun, an' dey wants us all to know
Dat dey likes to hab dar singin' books a-holin' fore dar eyes,
An sing de hymns right straight along to mansion in de skies.
Dat it am awful fogy to gin um out by lin',
An' ef de ole folks will kumplain 'cause dey is ole an' blin
An' slabry's chain don kep dem back from larnin how to read,
Dat dey mus' take a corner seat, and let de young folks lead.
We bin peatin' hine de pastor when he sez dat lubly pray'r
Cause some un us don kno' it an' kin not say it squar,
But dey sez we mus' peat wid him, an' ef we kan keep time,
De gospel train will drap us off from follin' long behin’.
Well p'haps dez's right, I kin not say, my lims is growin' ole,
But I likes to sing dem dear ole hymns 'tis music to my soul,
An' 'pears to me twon't do much harm to gin um out by lin',
So we ole folk dat kin not read kin foller long behin’.
But few ub us am lef here now dat bore de slabry's chain,
We don edekate our boys an' gals we'd do de sam' agin
An Zion's all dat's lef us now to cheer us wid its song,
Dey mought 'low us to sing wid dem, it kin not be fur long.
De sarmons high-falutin' an' de chuch am mighty fin',
We trus' dat God still understans ez he did in olden times;
When we do ign'ant po an' mean still worshiped wid de soul
Do oft akross our peac❜ful breas' de wabes ub trouble rolled.
De ole time groans an' shouts an' moans am passin' out ub sight,
Edikashun changed all dat, and we beleive it right:
We should serb God wid 'telligence but fur dis thing I plead,
Jes lebe a leeile place in chuch fur dem as kin not read.
Drifted Apart.
{TO M. E. H.]
'Twas years ago I met thee, when we both were young and free,
And no thought of years of sadness filled our hearts;
But the years have found us drifting, in a sad neglected way,
Until to-day we've drifted far apart.
How often didst thou tell me, in the happy days long sped,
We were drifting, drifting, drifting far apart,
But I would not heed the warning, until the years now fled
Have left a pall of sadness o'er my heart.
But 'tis best that we are parted, it is best for you and me,
And not a tear of sorrow must now start;
For, if we two had wedded, we ne'er could happy be,
So 'tis best that we have drifted far apart.
Thou art wedded to another, and, perhaps some day I'll be,
When time has covered over every smart;
Good-bye, and may God bless you with a happy life and free,
E'en though we two have drifted far apart.
THE CITY OF THE DEAD.
[Read at the Richmond Cemeteries, Memorial Day, May 30th, 1888.]
The setting sun now gilds the evening sky,
And darkness settles over land and sea;
And birds and bees, aweary, homeward fly,
To seek their rest within the sheltering trees.
The honest lab'rers daily task is done,
And, home to rest the tired steed is led;
A solemn silence settles o'er each home,
And stillness greets "The City of the Dead."
Sweet music floats upon the list'ning ear,
As to this long, last resting place we come,
To place upon each quiet mound so near,
Some sweet remembrance of the days now gone.
Upon each mound we drop a silent tear,
Upon each grave we place some flowers fair,
Whose leaves must fade and wither, year by year,
And die to leave not e'en a memory there.
Within these sacred grounds our dead are laid,
Who all life's weary journey now have done;
Who-all their solemn debt to nature paid-
Now rest beneath the shade-with God at home.
Within these precints silent forms repose,
Who hearts once burned with strong celestial fires;
Whose souls no more may deep ambition know,
But rest in silent gloom, both son and sire.
Near yonder stone an infant form doth lie,
Whose eyes scarce opened to the light of day,
E'er death in all its silent gloom drew aigh,
And bore its soul from reals of earth away.
Just there a child whose infant feet had trod
Upon the blooms of six or seven springs;
'Mid parents' tears and sobs was borne to God
On angel's fair and strong celestial wings.
Hard by a maiden turning in her teens,
A school-girl just from school and books away,
A youth in hope's young spring of blissful dreams
All borne aloft to realms of endless day.
There middle age, within life's brightest morn
That monster came to summon him away;
Of all his youth and joy and splendor shore,
And made a stiffened corpse in one brief day.
And, last of all, lies hoary-headed age,
That feel, "like autumn fruit that mellowed long,"
Whose hopes had fled; the withering fal'tring,
Who left in triumph for the realms of song.
Here high and low and wise and ignorant meet,
Here, side by side, both great and small repose,
Here he who toiled, and he who studied greet,
The grave no small, no wise, no ignorant knows.
Here they all meet whose mem'ries we hold dear,
Their works are done, their toils and cares are o'er,
The hopes are dead; the pine and faded sear
Now mark the spot, their forms are seen no more.
Scott Gwathney's here and Humphrey Osborne, too,
Their swords laid down, and gone the living breath,
And Brooks, that voice that once the hustings knew,
Now sleeps the long, last, silent sleep of death.
James Bowser's here, his earnest life work done,
And Robert Brown the countless thousands swell,
And Fitzhugh too, his checkered life race run,
Helps heap the mound where many loved ones dwell.
Our Maggie's here, whose music cheered our hearts,
And made the cares of life, so bitter, sweet;
Those fingers stilled to take no more their part;
And soldiers brave who fought, their end here meet.
And each of us can point to some dear spot,
Where friend or kindred rest in sweet repose;
Where we have wept and placed forget-me-nots,
And wreath-entwined the holly and the rose.
Rest on! brave souls! we would not call them back,
To this drear land, where sin and sorrow dwell;
Where pain and care are ever on our track,
And happy years, but toll a funeral knell.
Each year we'll come to strew upon their graves
Sweet flowers fair, until we too shall come,
From joys and griefs and hopes of earthly days,
To dwell with them within their silent home.
When we shall go from earth to realms of shade,
To take our places in the silent mound,
May others come to deck our silent graves,
And rise anew when God's last trump shall sound.
Stickin' To De Hoe.
Dar's mighty things agwine on,
Sense de days when I wuz young;
An' folks don' do ez dey did once,
Sense dese new times is kum;
Dey gals dey dresses pow'ful fin',
An all am fur a show;
But enny how dis nigger
Am a-stickin' to de hoe.
Larnin is a blessed thing,
An' good cloze mighty fin',
But I likes to see de cullud gal
What knows jes how to ine,
Gimme de gal to wash an' scrub,
An' keep things white an' clean,
An' kin den go in de kitchin,
An' cook de ham an' greens.

But dis I know am true,
Dat raisin' gals too good to wuck,
Ain't never gwine to do;
De boys dat look good nuf to eat,
But too good to saw de logs,
Am karrin us ez fas' ez smoke
To lan us at de dogs.
I spoze dat I'm ole fashun,
But God made man to plow,
An git his libbin by de sweat
Dat trickles down his brow;
While larnin an' all dem things
Am mighty good for sho',
De bes way we kin make our pints,
Is-stickin' to de hoe.
My Childhood's Happy Days.
To My Parents.
Many poets great and gifted whom the muse's touch had blessed,
Have sung in rhythmic measure, at the spirit's high behest,
Of the days of childish glory, free from sorrow and from pain,
When all was joy and pleasure, and wished them back again,
But, somehow, when my mind turns back to sing in joyous lays,
I remember great discomforts, in my childhood's happy days.
Why, my earliest recollections are of pains and colics sore,
And the meanest kinds of medicines the grown folks down would pour,
Ipecac and paregoric, and though I hard would kick
They still would dose and physic "Cause the baby must be
sick!"
When I think of this how can I sing a song in joyous lays,
And speak in tones of rapture of my childhood's happy days.
Off to school I then was started and the simple rule of three
Was as hard as now quadratics or geometry's to me:
And then the awful thrashings, with a paddle at the school,
And again at home with switches if I broke the simplest rule,
Oh, my life was one vast torment, so, of course I'm bound
to praise
The time that poet's nickname "our childhood's happy
days."
On a cold and snowy morning, when lying snug in bed,
"You Webster" was the sound I heard, and wished that I
was dead;
For I knew I had to make the fires, bring water, and cut
wood,
And then, perhaps, I might have chance to get a bit of food,
When off to school I trotted: these were the pleasant ways,
In which I spent that festive time, my childhood's happy
days.
Father's breeches, cut to fit me, was, of course, the proper
thing,
And no where would they touch me, my one "gallus" was a
string,
I couldn't tell the front from back-part, and my coat of navy
blue,
So variously was mended, it would match the rainbow's hue;
"Twill do all right for rich white boys to sing those merry
lays,
But the average little "Jap" fared tough, in childhood's
happy days.
I had a tender place where I couldn't bear the comb to
touch,
I'd jump three feet when tested, at last I cried so much
Mother said that she would cut it, oh, fate! to see me
then,
My head was picked by dull shears as if some turkey hen
Had gotten in his cruel work, and the boys, with jolly
ways
Hallowed "buzzard" when they saw me in my childhood's
happy days.
In the evening holding horses, selling papers—“Evening
News,"
To earn an honest penny, for the folks at home to use,
Yet, of course I had my pleasures, stealing sugar, playing
ball,
But I can not go in raptures o'er that season after all,
And, we repeat our childhood, and all life's sterner ways
Are mixed with rain and sunshine, as were childhood's
happy days.
Still I find that life's one "hustle" from the cradle to the
tomb,
With occasional rays of sunshine to lighten up the gloom,
And if we can help a brother, and mix our cares with joys,
We'll find old age as happy as the days when we were boys,
And above may sing in rapture heavenly songs of love and
praise,
When at last our bark is anchored there to spend our
happiest days.
GOOD NIGHT.
[To my Mother.]
Good night, the day is done,
And evening shadows softly fall;
God night-
The night bird's gently cooing to its mate,
And slowly now the silv'ry moonbeams
Deck the evening sky with lovely rays:
Good night-good night.
Good night the day was long,
And weary feet now gladly say
Good night,
To toil and care as gentle sleep,
The "sweet restorer," softly steals
And fills our tired eyes; we gladly say
Good night-good night.
Good night earth's day must close,
And death's last summons make us say
Good night;
From pain and care of life's rude day,
At last we come to Jordon's brink,
And fly to realms of blissful dreams;
Good night-Good night.
Good night we fondly hope
To us that brighter day will dawn;
Good night;
May we so strive, and long and trust
And live in faith to see that eve,
When earth's last scene shall fade from view;
Good night-good night.
Ole Virginny Reel.
Ez I set to-night I'm thinkin' ub de days now pas' an' gone,
Way down in Ole Virginny mid de corn;
Whar de sweet pertaters bloomin' an' de watermillion
smiles,
For down de souf in Dixie I wuz born.
Dat lan' to me is dearer den all on urf besiz,
An' I feel de tear drops down my ole checks steal,
Ez I think ub by gone plezuz in dat dear ole sunny lan’,
A dancin' ub de ole Virginny reel.
When our daily toil wuz ober in de quarters we would meet,
An' sick annuder scufflin' dar would be
To git Miss Susan Johnsing, de Car'line County belle
To dance de fus set on de flo' wid me:
We'd "Walk ole John de blin' man," play "Husko ladies
turn"
Would "Grin de bottle" or de "bobkin steal"
But twon't no use a talkin' de fun would jest begin
When all would dance de ole Virginny reel.
Ef you nebber seed de moshun, I'll tell you how it goes,
'Tis a bobbin up an' down a hop an' jump,
An' a turnin ebry lady ez you kum back down de line
Jes like a bobtail moc'sin roun' de stump,
"Miss Liza Jane" is lubly an' "Balmoral" is fine,
An' "Wipe dem di'mon winders" make you squeal,
But not "Bounce Aroun' my Sugar Lump" nor "Turnin
Good Ole Man"
Kin begin to tech de ole Virginny reel.
Dar wuz "Jimmy Put de Kettle on" an' "Shoo Miss Piggie
Shoo"
An' de play "King Willum wuz King Georges Son,"
"Blin' Man Buff" an' "Gimme corner" also "Walk de lone-
some Road;"
Whar de pint wuz gittin kisses suze you bon,
But now dey fuse to play it, an' kissin's out of style,
Bekase we folks is gittin pow'ful high,
Yet our kissin den wuz in'cent widout a bit of harm,
But now dey takes dar kissin' on de sly.
Ole 'Liz'ah wuz de bess man, he could cut de piggin wing,
An' crack his heels togedder keepin' time,
While his teef would look like tom'-stones, an' his face like
'possum fat,
An' ebry knot be stickin' out behin';
De gals would dress in homespun wid big ole brogan shoes,
An' ef dar feet would tech you, you would feel,
While de boys wore bed-tick breeches, but all dis wuz forgot,
Ez we 'joyed ourselbes wid ole Virginny Reel.
We wuz happy at a huskin' bee, a big molasses stew,
Or million-feas at closin' ub de day;
An' though our cares were menny, our plezuz mighty few,
We made de bes of all dat came our way.
An' now my banjos silent ez it hangs upon de wall,
My fiddle bow no longer gibs its peal;
Fur my playin's too ole fashun fur de dancin' ub to-day,
An' I long agin fur ole Virginny reel.
An' somehow ez I think to-night ub by-gone happy days,
Though cares and sorrows menny crowned our lot,
Dis lesson presses on me-now forgib an' ole man's say,-
But alwaz joy de blessins what you got;
An' agin I some times wonder ez I see ya'll hoppin' roun',
Wid waltzes, dances, schoctische, toe an' heel
Ef you really hab de plezuz an' as leetle ub de sin,
Ez we in dancin' ole Virginny reel.
The Negro as He Is.
[Written for RICHMOND PLANET.]
Our speakers tell of progress,
And laud us to the skies,
Until we're so inflated
We can not hope to rise;
Unless some moral cyclone,
Shall tear the structure down,
And show the negro as he is,
And then ignore his frown.
For the truth must now be told,
And we all need speak it bold,
We must reconstruct our building,
Or twill find us in the cold.
Gross errors must be righted,
We should at once begin;
Tell Jacob of transgressions,
And Israel of her sins;
No more should songs of siren
Sweetly lull our souls to ease;
And peace proclaimed in Zion
When really there's no peace.
For the truth from earth must rise,
Justice, sleeping, ope her eyes,
We must know our true condition
And the remedy apply.
We boast of education,
But the masses still plod on,
In grossest superstition,
And for bread prefer a stone;
And some more highly favored,
Make their learning but a snare;
And are yet so mean and wretched,
That the stoutest hearts despair,
Some stand aloof to-day,
From those less learned than they,
And cannot see their brothers,
Still struggling on the way.
Bitter spite and petty jealousies
Exist on every hand;
Each Negro hates the other
And will injure all he can
The Negro who attempts to rise
Above the common mass:
He knows "he is dishonest,"
That "his progress can not last,
If a Negroe's word must go,
Lord bless us here below,
For we all are thieves and cut throats,
For we call each other so.
If you get a piece of property,
You're a rogue of deepest die:
If you remain in poverty,
You are sinning on the sly,
But if teacher or if preacher,
Good Lord, in mercy bless!
For you can not please creation,
Though you do your level best,
Our prayer book should be thus,
As we bow our heads in dust,
“From long-tongued, slanderous Negroes,
Good Lord, deliver us.
We recognize no leaders,
For we all are in the lead,
Oft religion is a mockery,
Notwithstanding church and creed;
We will not help each other
On the hustings or the mart,
And we feel each one a brother,
And help him bear his part:
Remembering as we go,
To bear a brother's woe,
And help him in the race of life,
While in this vale below.
Our foes are all united,
We, divided, can but fall,
And yet I fear we are our own
Worst enemies for all;
With solid front for God and right,
No foe can e'er avail,
For "Right is Right as God is God"
And justice must prevail;
Let our hearts be for the right,
Let our purposes unite;
We need not fear the fiercest darts,
For we must win the fight.
See the errors to be righted,
Lord! nerve us for the task!
Though dark the night, the dawning
Must come when night is past;
By sword, by pen we labor,
Trusting Him, whose love doth bend
Like the blessed bow of promise,
To lead us to the end.
We have men both good and true,
Noble men who dare and do,
Fight on till death, my brother,
Its summons sends for you.
Bakin an' Greens.
Suggested by Mr. Lewis H. Douglass.
You may tell me ub pastries an' fine oyster paddies,
Ub salads, an' croquets an' Boston baked beans;
But dars nuffin so temptin' to dis nigger's palate,
Ez a big slice ub bakin an' plenty ub greens.
Jes bile um right down so dey'll melt when you eat um,
Hab a big streak ub fat, an' a small streak ub lean;
Dais nuffin on uf you kin fix up to beat um,
Fur de king ub all dishes am bakin an'

Den tak' sum good corn meal an' sif' it an' pat it,
An' put in de ashes wid nuffin between,
Den blow off de ashes, an' set right down at it,
Fur dars nuffin like ash cake wid bakin an' greens.
"Twill take de ole mammies to fix um up greasy,
Wid a lot ub good licker an' dumplins between,
Take all your fin' eatins I won't be uneasy,
Ef you'll lebe me dat bakin an' plenty ub greens.
Some folks go fur tuckey, an' some goes fur chicken,
But I lights up wid joy an' wid plejger I beams,
When I kum home from wuck an' a day ub hard pickins,
An' am greeted wid bakin, an' a big dish ub greens.
Rich folks in dar kerrage may fro de dus' on me,
But how kin I enby dem men ub big means,
Dey may hab de dispepsy an' do dey may scorn me,
Dey kant injoy bakin wid lots ub good greens.
You may put me in rags, fill my cup up wid sorrow,
Let joy be a stranger an' trouble my dreams;
But I still will be smilin' no pain kin I borrow,
Ef I still kin git bakin wid plenty ub greens.
Hoopskirts.
[Written for SOUTHERN NEWS.]
O cruel fate! again to bring,
Those awful things in season;
To make our girls, the lovely things,
Look big beyond all reason:
So slender now they seem and sweet,
Just fit for fond caresses,
Why should dame fashion now decree,
So to inflate their dresses.
The maidens, who are plump and fair,
Declare they will not wear them,
And even those now lean and lank
Are saying they can't bear them:
When fashion sends her edict forth,
They'll find they can not leave her,
And hoopskirts will be all the rage,
From Dan unto Beersheba
The slender train; the poor man's bane,
Is just about to leave us,
We say goodbye, and breathe a sigh,
The parting does not grieve us:
We can rejoice, our feet no more
Are tangled in the meshes,
To tear from bindings sweeping trains,
That spoiled our sweetheart's dresses.
The high hat too has had its day,
To blind our eyes from seeing
In hall or church whene'er we sat
Behind the lovely beings;
But, now alas, far worse than all
The ills from wife and daughter,
The crinoline now heaves in sight
To aggrivate our torture.
What shall we do in street-cars
Now oft packed beyond all bearing
When crinolines need double room,
"Twill set the men-folks swearing.
Our sweethearts fair, we love so well,
Our hearts can but endear them,
But when the hoopskirt gets full sway,
How can we then get near them?
The slender girl may yet “get by”
And small hoopskirts come handy;
And even those of medium weight,
May yet look "chic" and dandy;
But, oh, my stars! the girl that's stout,
"Twill be more than a notion,
When crinolines will make her look
Like some balloon in motion.
But still we men will have revenge
For all the care you give us;
And oh, my dears you'll catch it "tough,"
Nor will it sadly grieve us:
For when a gale shall catch those skirts,
And set them all-a-flying,
We fear we'll burst a jugular vein
By laughing until crying.
A Rose.
[To Mrs. R. D.B.]
This rose of the garden is given to me,
And to double its value 'twas given by thee;
And its beautiful tints to my eyesight is borne,
Like a kiss of a fairy, or blush of the morn.
How sweet the aroma that is wafted to me,
Let the scent of the breeze of the isles of the sea;
And it tells of the care of that Father above,
Who sends us the flowers to tell of his love.
?
But too soon must this sweet-scented flower decay,
Its bright leaves must wither, its scent die away,
But its memory lingers and the joys that it bore,
Will remain with me fondly, when the flower's no more.
Fond hopes too may perish, their leaves fade and die,
And great expectations all withered may lie;
But He who has loved us and given his Son,
Sets a sweet bow of promise and bids us hope on.
May our friendship ne'er perish, its strength ne'er decay,
But may it grow stronger and stronger each day;
And may the All Father his love o'er us bend,
Till life's journey's completed, and heaven the end.
The Triumvirate.
[To Jos. H. Douglass, Violinist, Chas. E. Mitchell, Esq., Editor and Jas.
E. Meriweather, M. D., on the occasion of a Thanksgiving Dinner
tendered the author by them at the residence of Mr.
Lewis H. Douglass, in Washington, D.C., Nov. 1892.]
Hail the illustrious three!
Gladly I sing to thee,
This song of praise:
Long may thy glory shine,
In every age and clime,
And may I claim thee mine,
In coming days!
Joe gives us music fine,
And "gets there" every time,
When e'er you call;
Charles is a "hustler" sure,
Jim is my friend of yore,
And each one I adore,
God bless them all!
THAT CANINE.
[To my friend G. S. on being chased dy a dog while on a social visit.]
A Parody on the Burial of Sir Jno. Moore.
Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As quick from that bull-dog he hurried;
Not a policeman was there to fire a shot,
As his teeth near his right leg were buried.
Quickly and lively he hurried away,
From that field-not of fame fresh and glory:
Not a "cuss word" escaped his closely pressed lips,
That dog was alone in his glory.
And slily he winked, as the seat of his pants,
That bull-dog sat quietly eating;
He remembers, no doubt, that storm-cloudy night,
And sighs with regret at that meeting.
A Christmas Wish.
[To L. E. S.]
"Peace on earth good will to men,
How sweet that message angels sang,
Until again the welkin rang,
And heavenly voices shout "amen."
May that sweet peace, and blest good will,
the measure of your joy!
Fill up
And give you peace without alloy,
And every hope and wish fulfill.
May love be thine this Christmas-tide,
And good will bless your every day,
And rest and peace be thine alway,
Until the heavens open wide,
And angels' voices sing for thee
The tenderest choral anthem sweet,
When in that blest abode we meet,
To rest through all eternity.
IN MEMORIAM.
In Memoriam.
[John Cyrus Ferguson, M. D., born Nov. 29, 1850, died July 5, 1889.]
Sleep on, brave soul! thy warfare o'er,
Thy rest comes sure and soon,
Thy sun, which rose at early morn,
Has passed away at noon;
As drops the flower when chilling frost,
But touch its tender leaves,
Thy brilliant life has passed away,
And left our hearts to grieve.
In many a home, when sorrow came,
And none but God could know,
Thy kindly touch applied the balm,
And soothed a brother's woe;
And "As ye did it unto these"-
How sweet these words must be
That softly fell from lips divine,
"Ye did it unto me."
And while our tears in sorrow fall,
Such grief no tongue can tell,
We stand resigned to his blest will,
Who doeth all things well;
And in the years, swift rolling by,
Thou wilt not be forgot,
For in our hearts for thee must bloom,
The sweet forget-me-not.
Rest on! brave heart,
Life's rude and weary warfare o'er
'Tis sweet to rest,
Where no sorrows come or cares oppress,
On that blest shore.
Thy work is done,
And in the bloom of youth and honor rich,
He's called thee home,
To rest beneath the shadow of God's throne,
No more to roam.
The Fellow This Will Fit.
[Dedicated to the "toughs" who disturb public gatherings.]
You may talk about your gallery gods,
And think you make a hit;
But there's nothing so mean on earth,
As the fellow this will fit.
His sympathies are with you,
His hands, his feet, his all,
You will always recognize him
By his aggravating squawl.
If you ever make a hit,
You will know it not a bit
By the awful clap and stamping
Of the fellow this will fit.
If your voice is weak and "sinful"
"Talk louder" he will cry;
If your ways are captivating,
He will hollow "you're to fly,"
He must join in the singing,
And will fill your soul with awe.
For generally his voice will sound
Just like a cross-cut saw:
But yet you must stand it,
Though it worries you a bit,
He must get in his ten cents' worth,
The fellow this will fit.
His nose is very "leaky,"
And he wipes it with his sleeve,
Or with a dirty handkerchief,
And would have you believe
That in a summer long ago-
In the good old days of old,
By accident he took a bath,
Likewise a dreadful cold
You can not make it "git"
Though you storm after it
For he's the boss dog of the show,
The fellow this will fit.
You may desire to listen,
To the music sweet and low,
Or to the voice of eloquence,
That softly, sweetly flow,
But that gallery chap is giggling,
Eating peanuts, or he snores,
To wake up at the wrong time,
Clapping louder than before.
I know you don't think it,
You won't believe a bit,
But really he has been to school
That fellow this will fit.
But 'tis at the big church concert,
That he worries people down,
When he gets up in the gallery,
When policemen are not around,
And hollows at the singers,
And disturbs the decent folk,
By his most outrageous conduct
That should shame a drunken blote,
They say we can't stop it,
But I can't believe a bit,
For I believe the law should stop
That fellow this will fit.
His pantaloons are seedy,
With great big eyes behind,
His coat is slick and greasy,
To decency he's blind,
But some are starched and dudy,
But clothes don't make a man,
"Twill take brains to be decent,
They do the best they can:
I know you will do it,
And 'twill help us quite a bit,
To "chip in" and buy mule brains,
For the fellow this will fit.
Disappointment.
[Written for YOUNG MEN'S FRIEND.]
Our hopes of life of every hue,
At noon are dead and blasted,
Our fruits of life we often view,
Are gone ere we have tasted.
And fondest hopes of coming bliss,
So bright at morning seeming,
Ere evening gives its parting kiss,
We find them but a dreaming.
If love doth give a promise sweet,
So full of hope and yearning,
"Tis turned from blissful waters sweet,
While we its joys are learning:
If wealth or fame or great estate,
Doth fill our hearts with gladness,
Ere we enjoy the hope it brings,
Our joy is turned to sadness.
And what though some have reached the goal,
And in its sunlight's basking,
Their joys, alas, must soon be told,
Life is not everlasting.
And soon the icy hand of death,
Will come our lives to sever,
Oh, may we, at our parting breath,
But dwell with Christ forever.
That spark within that can't be stilled,
And tells that we're immortal,
Is but the soul, by heaven willed,
To live beyond life's portal.
Where bathed in streams of purest bliss,
God's love is o'er us bending:
Where we shall dwell with spirits bright
In Sabbaths never ending.
Then may we choose that life above
Where disappointments never
Invade the precincts filled with bliss,
With God to dwell forever.
Then take the world with all its joys,
So transient and so fleeting,
Be thine to choose that perfect kiss
From God's own Son in greeting.
There friend again will meet with friends
And loved ones, sadly parted:
There God shall wipe away our tears,
And heal the broken hearted,
There ne'er to part, we meet at last
Young lives and grey hairs hoary
And bathe in blessed seas of rest.
Within the realms of glory.
My Love.
I loved, and earth far brighter seemed,
Than painter's art or poet's dream,
To me her smile was lovelier far,
Than summer noon or evening star:
And yet she loved me not, though I
Loved her so well I'd hope and sigh.
She smiled, and heaven seemed in that smile,
That every grief and care beguiled,
She frowned and death seemed better far,
Than frown from her my guiding star,
My life was spent twixt heaven and hell,
And still I loved her, ah, so well.
Some days to heaven my soul would fly,
On bended knee look to the sky,
And thank the gods who gave such bliss
Enfolded in a woman's kiss;
But ere I'd just begun to taste,
The gall and wormwood took its place.
My judgment told me 'twas in vain,
I'd kiss the rod, and love again,
The pangs I felt, the pains endured,
Too sacred far to be disclosed,
I thought 'twas fate and loved again
Though reason bade me be a man.
I thought this pain I must endure,
That love was love was forevermore,
That love once born could never die,
I've lived to prove that thought a lie,
Love must be tended, nourished, fed,
Or else some day you'll find it dead.
I often fought this demon strong,
Was oft defeated, oft disarmed,
But as the flowers need heat and rain,
To make them bud and bloom again,
So love that is so often spurned
At last will flee to ne'er return.
I found one day I'd broke my chain,
I tried to weld them back again,
I wished, and sighed, and prayed in vain,
The love had fled and the shell remained:
For e'en God's love when often spurned,
At last will flee to ne'er return,
Pomp's Case Argued.

An' furgittin to return um nobody could er say
Dat de brudder stole de breeches, tiz clear ez de day.
True, his moughter bin busted wid de seat towed out,
Fur it cert'ny is strainin' dis leadin' ub de shout,
But den he could er patched um an' wid coat tails long,
Could er cut a lubly figger dout doin' enny harm.
May be prid' wuz de kazhun, dar de debil tempts to sin,
An' his bedtick breeches won't good nuf fur him;
But I moves fur to sclude him fur he nebber had to ought,
Ef he stole dem breeches, go an' git hiself caught.
Skeetin' on De Ice:
[A Poetical Version of a true occurance in Henrico Co., Va.]
At a little country meeting in a log house near the road,
The saints had duly gathered "fur de worshup ub de Lord;"
When "Bru Levi send de pulpit" cleared his throat, and then began
"De spoundin' ub de scripshur, fur to cheer de spet'ual man.
I was a teacher in the county and was in duty bound
In attendance on the services, to help the brethren 'long;
Brother Levi was the pastor, and dispensed the gospel here
As he misunderstood it at twenty-five a year.
The day was warm and sultry, sleep was getting in my eyes,
When this most unique sermon filled me with intense surprise;
"My belubbed congregashun, I bin preachin' 'bout de possle,
An' tock my tex' whar Paul poked his 'pistle at de Romans."
"But to-day I gwine to tell you 'bout de chillua ub de Lord,
When dey crossed de ragin' waters at de spokin ub de word.
I kno' ya'll lung bin wondrin' how de chillun crossed de sea,
But tiz jes ez plan ez kin be, to er' spienced man like me."
"You see twus in de winter an' de water all wuz frez,
By de win de Marster sen dem 'strong nuf to raz de dead;
Now ya'll see de thing wuz simple, an' likewise very nic',
Fur all de chillun had to do, wuz to skeet across on ice."
"But when ole Farro kum long wid dem hebby chayut wheels,
De ice jes gin away an' ole Farro had to frez."
This was hard on my intelligence as the teaching of the school,
So I had to rise and say a word, although against the rule.
"Beg pardon, brother pastor, but geographies you know
Say this land is in the tropics where can be no ice or snow.
"I thanks you dough I does not like no sturbmence on dis topic,
But in dem days 'twont no gogerfies, so cours dar wont no tropics.”
Of course I was dumbfounded, the brethren said “amen,”
An thus he then concluded ere I could speak again,
When you gwine to cross de water you better take advice,
An' 'cep'n de Lord am wid you, don't skeet across on ice.”
Mat!
In the swamp by black gum, in a little log hut
Lived Mat,
The toughest little cuss in tatters and rags
At that.
"A reg'lar good for nothing," the neighbors all vowed,
Who would rob a hen-nest, not a melon he allowed
To remain in the patch yet we, but for that,
Liked Mat.
With his tatters all flying and a crownless hat,
Came Mat
Cross the hill by the cornfield and "sweet tater" patch
And that
Was a sign that "taters" and corn disappered,
For when Mat was about, why everybody feared,
But then when you saw him your sorrow changed that
For Mat.
For ten or eleven little brothers and sisters
Had Mat,
And his poor mother labored to feed and to clothe them,
At that
And work in the country, when you wash the whole day,
And receive but a quarter is mighty poor pay,
No wonder he was ragged and would steal at that,
Poor Mat!
Yet the world often wonders as it speeds on its way
At the Mats,
Who are reared in ignorance, the world's "good-for-
nothings"
But for that,
How many called better who've never felt the smart,
Of poverty's nettle can boast of a heart,
As free from guile and as tender, as that
Of Mat's!
De Chana Cup.
[A true incident that came under the eye of the writer.]
Our church had a meeting, where the brethren gathered
To transact the business they had for the Lord,
To turn out the lambs who had strayed from the sheepfold,
And to take in repentants in accord with his word.
The ax had been falling with impartiality,
On drunkards and policy players of old,
On sisters who'd fallen from pathways of virtue,
And all who had wandered like sheep from the fold.
At last came a sister whose skirts were all muddy,
With drabbling in sin all the days of her youth,
Had been caught and excluded amid tears of the brethren,
But now would return to the pathway of truth.
“I am truly repentant, the Lord has forgiven,
Since last month, when excluded, I've prayed night and day,
Will you brethren forgive and restore me to fellowship?
And with Jesus to guide I'll no more go astray."
"Bless the Lord!" said the brethren, "Amen!" said the
sisters,
"Thank God, she's returning; I move take her in;"
The motion was carried with great hallelujahs
For the sister restored from the pathway of sin.
Brother Slaughter waxed warm and spoke of the prodigal,
And rejoicing in heaven o'er sinners returned,
"Ef you fall do not woller, you kin tell a true Christian,
Fur down in de hart sper'tial oil will burn,"
"De sister am good ez befo' if not better,
Fur dear is de lam's whin returned to de fol',
Ef you gwine to sin, jes be sho you don't woller,
An' youz sho ub de glory as de pigg in his hole."
Up spoke Bro. Van, "My brudder hole on dar!
Youze ressin de scriphur an' teachin' us wrong.
'Tain't better to wander dan keep de straight pafway
An' de Lord lubs de young lam's dat keep right along."
"I once had a chana cup I sot quite much sto' by,
One day bein' kerless I drapped on de flo',
I patched it wid glu' sah, and dough it hel' water,
It nebber did ring like it did befo';"
You may dribe in a nail right in dis here pos' here,
Den draw out de nail, but de hole is still dar.
You may bring your phar arm an' heal up de bu'n, sah,
But de schar will tell on you wharebber you are.
True de prodigal Son can got some fine close an' some vittles,
But long he'd bin starbin wid nuttin to whar,
While de boy dat stayed home got de bes' ub de pickin's
Wid lots ub fine raiment an' plenty to sphar.
You wimmen who stray from de pafway ub virtue,
May be 'sto'ed to de chuch an' your sins plastered o'er,
But like a bell without clapper mus' always remain, sah!
An dey nebber kin ring like de did befo.
Bro. Van told the truth: true we may be forgiven,
But the world looks askance and is hard and is cold,
To some sins, most especially departures from virtue,
So 'tis best not to fall to return to the fold;
But up in that land, where forgiving's forgetting,
In the beautiful light of eternity's shore,
The bells on earth broken: up there fully mended,
Again may ring out as they did before.
Light in Darkness.
[Written for the VIRGINIA BAPTIST.]
[Dedicated to Hon Fred. Douglass.]
Though dark the night, my brother,
And dreary clouds bedeck the evening sky;
No star appears, and cold the wind doth blow,
The night must pass; and then,
The morning comes apace.
What though 'tis dark, my brother,
Canst thou not look beyond the stygian gloom;
See one faint ray of hope to lighten up
The darkness of the sky?
And still canst see His face?
God is not dead, my brother,
On Him my soul in faith will lean,
In darkest hour, if he but light the way
No fear can chill, for still
His mighty arm can save.
I only fear the wrong, my brother,
With God and right I breathe defiance bold
To every foe: for we can battle down
The hosts of hell and sin,
And triumph o'er the grave.
Uncle Rastus and the Whisky Question.
[Written for RICHMOND PLANET.]
I don' hear dem rebolushuns 'bout whiskey en all dat,
But yu aint gwy nebber pas' um, I tells you dat right flat;
Don't let ya'lls smartnis fool you, en try to do too much,
Cause you jes gwy bring 'bout sturbance, en you tryin' to bus dis chuch.
Ya'll know dat whiskey bin here long 'fore we wuz born,
En tain't nebber trubble nothin', better let wel nuf lone;
Size, Paul don tole you take it, jes fur de stomach's sake,
We cert'ny gwy bay de scripshur, den what ya'll speck to make?
I hear ya'll kote dat scripshur, "ef eatin meat fen, don't eat,"
But Paul won't talkin' 'bout whiskey, 'cause he plintly menshuns meat;
Dat drunkards khant reach hebbin, de guard wont let um in,
But dat don't mean wid whiskey, but folks dat's drunk in sin;
"Look not on de wine cup," is what de Word tells me,
Well don't dat mean to drink it? 'tis plain ez plain ken be.
But we 'cided 'fore we kum here to vote dat moshun down,
Cause we argued it at meetins we had all ober town.
In couse we'z pozed to dancin' en all dem no harm sins,
An' will turn um out like lightnin' ef tiz dem upper tens;
But all sich things ez drinkin', playin' policy en such,
"Am far too trifflin' matters to fotch befor dis chuch."
OLD NORMAL.
[Written for the Alumni Association of the Richmond Normal School.]
Old time with its sycle and swift onward play,
For once has turned backward, we are children to-day;
And the world with its conflicts, its battles and strife,
Is forgotten in pleasures and mem'ries of life.
These lassies with puffs, bangs and frizzes, galore,
Are girls in short dresses, and white pinafores;
While the men with stiff collars and high beaver hats,
Are boys in short breeches, and patches at that.
As I stand up here reading I'm quaking with fear,
For I think 'tis Miss Stratton, whose footsteps I hear;
Or dear Mr. Manly, or sainted Miss Knowles,
Comes tripping behind me and ready to scold.
"You Davis, sit down there!" I fancy she calls,
While Miss Manly, Miss Hadley, Miss Patterson all
Come trooping before me; but one thing I know,
I can slip by Miss Bass, she's so awfully slow.
My name is still cut on the seat by the door,
I am trying to cut it much higher, you know,
But I wonder if fame can e'er give the joy,
I found at old Normal when I was a boy?
On the green field of life we are still playing games,
Our base-ball and foot-ball we are playing the same;
As of old, the great winners must play the game bold
With the earth as a foot-ball and heaven the goal.
Some now play a fine game, and ne'er get a fall,
Some play as the kickers, and others the ball;
If you fail in your kicking cling close to the shore,
For the world kicks much harder than Normal of yore.
Some make a home run, and multitudes shout,
While some strike a grounder and other strike out,
Though fallen and beaten we still must be men,
And try it to-morrow, to win if we can.
Our girls of Old Normal are still jumping rope,
But don't let it trip you and get your neck broke;
For few, like our mother, will help us, alas!
When once we have fallen from virtue's straight paths.
But well we remember no boyhood could last,
The world called for men, and we went to the task,
Some won and some failed, but in heart we are one,
God grant we're as true as when we begun.
Some fellows are lawyers and sending to jail,
Their poor fellow creatures, nor getting them bail,
While others are doctors and curing life's ills,
At least, if not curing, are sending in bills.
Some presidents, professors and teachers in schools,
And thrashing young urchins for breaking the rules,
Some maidens, some matrons, some happy papas,
With eight or ten young ones their pleasures to mar.
What though they are climbing the ladder of fame,
They are Ben, Dan or Bowler, Hayes, Johnston or James,
Though clouded with care and in dignity dressed,
They are Sallie and Julia, Rose, Anna and Bess.
Some fellows are down who stood in the van,
Maybe gone to bad, but they are ours the same,
Let's throw out a line to them sinking in crime
And allure them to virtue for dear "Auld Lang Syne."
But some fail to answer at calling of roll,
Our eyes fill with tears, they are missed from the fold,
But in glory we'll greet them when battle is done,
Pat, Walter and others will meet us-at home.
Let's recount o'er our battles, take courage and aim
To help on each other to honor and fame;
Nor suffer our banner to trail in the dust,
Or the bright sword of honor in scabbard to rust.
We think of our sorrows, we think of our joys,
And in this our re-union are again girls and boys;
Old time can not dampen our spirits so gay,
We'll laugh at his efforts, we are children to-day.
By this hallowed elysium our tent is now spread,
But soon to new duties, new paths we must tread,
The world calls for heroes, our race calls for men,
Unselfishness and true 'till bright heaven's the end.
Sweet Sabbath Bells.
[Written for the S. S. QUARTERLY]
Sweet is the sound at Sabbath morn,
Of silv'ry bells, whose earnest peal
Doth call us from our home away:
O, glorious chimes!
Thy sound we love, of heaven born,
It calls us with its mute appeal,
From haunts of men, to praise and pray-
O, blessed time!
Now infant feet to school will tend,
To learn the way to heaven and God,
To fit them for that glorious place
Beyond the stars.
There thoughts of earth, with heaven blend,
And God is near, no more we plod
In toil and pain, no evil trace
Its beauty mars.
Ring out sweet bells! long at your call,
May young and old the pathway tread,
That leads to blissful realms above,
And God and rest.
And when no more we hear you call
May heavenly bells the message spread,
And bring us to eternal love,
Forever blessed.
I Wonder How This Is?
[Written for THE EDUCATOR]
I'm not a bad fellow, but just "kinder midlin,"
Not a devil incarnate, nor saint dressed in white;
But "bout half and half," with a sprinklin' of devil,
And enough of the angel to keep me near right.
Yet often I wander, my feet get entangled,
'Mid briers and quicksands too often I stray,
And often I wonder can I reach the pathway,
As sinful and crooked I oft lose my way.
Yet I went to a funeral, the chap was a "tough one,"
A gambler, a drunkard, he cheated and lied,
A deeply dyed rascal, but gave big donations,
11So the preacher just fixed him all right when he died.
I went to the graveyard, and looked on the tombstones;
What lovely inscriptions! all praising the dead;
Everyone there was good, everyone had reached heaven,
I wondered where all the bad fellows were laid.
But thus goes the world, if you've friends or have money,
You are certain of heaven, your sins plastered o'er;
But the poor, seedy devils, who have empty pockets,
Nobody knows if you're in heaven or no.
Perhaps they are right, and maybe up yonder,
The wonder will be, not that we were bad,
But as good as we have been, 'mid all of the weakness,
And all the temptations that each must have had.
But we'll find lots of folks we thought were in heaven
Have missed it, while others, assigned down below,
Are exalted, for there full justice is given;
By the heart God judges the rich and the poor.
Champion of Right-Good Night.
[To Dr. J. C. Price.]
Champion of right! Good night,
The day is gone, and death's dark hands
The sable curtain draws;
The stars shine forth from out the gloom,
And all is calm and still.
The pulse's throb is hushed-farewell,
The lights put out that shone with tender glow,
And hushed the voice that once the hustings knew,
And still the world moves on,
As if no hearts were crushed and bruised.
Champion of right—farewell,
The labor done 'tis sweet to have repose,
Beneath the welcome shade;
As darkest night bring out the stars,
May now new heroes rise,
Nor let the banner trail-good bye,
Thy noble deeds for God and race must live,
While honest hearts will-well-earned tribute give,
A hero in the strife takes rest,
Strife past, now comes the crown.
Ginger Snaps and Cider.
[Written for Christmas Number of RICHMOND PLANET.]
Again the Christmas time is here,
With joy in fullest measure;
And every fellow, great and small,
Is looking out for pleasure.
To me the days no brighter seem,
Although my vision's wider,
Than when I was a country lad,
With ginger snaps and cider,
And when 'twas near "hog killin' time,"
The world seemed to me bigger,
For christmas then was on the way,
When I could cut a "figger."
Most homely were the joys we had,
"Molasses stews" and "parties,"
But innocent the joy they gave,
With fun both pure and hearty.
Long past are now those simple joys,
But with the Christmas season,
I wonder if I'm happy now,
And with as good a reason.
I wonder if my heart's as free,
Now since my vision's wider,
As in those by-gone Christmas days,
Of ginger snaps and cider.
Am I now deaf to sorrow's cry,
And pass the poor unheeding?
Do I, in honor, wish them joy,
For which my heart is pleading?
Do I delight to bring a smile,
And hearts, cast down, to brighten,
And think as much of others' woes,
And help their lots to brighten?
As came the "God-man" from above,
To Bethl'hem's lowly manger,
To seek and save the wan'dring sheep,
The homeless and the stranger;
So be it ours some heart to cheer,
As comes this time of pleasure,
And fill the cup of lonely ones,
With joy in fullest measure.
Some sit to-day in gilded halls,
Secure from seeming troubles,
While others, with a single crust,
Are shivering in their hovels.
We wonder oft why this is true,
But life, at best, is fleeting,
And oh! what recompense will come
With heaven's eternal meeting.
I sometime think we're growing up
To be a wondrous people,
But yet I fear in building
We're commencing with the steeple,
Without a basis, broad and deep,
With virtue its foundation,
And truth and right as corner-stones,
We can not build a nation.
On social hops and fancy balls,
Society now fattens;
But still I find oft little souls
Doth dwell neath silks and satins.
Hypocrisy, deceit and lies,
May mean our scope is wider,
But give me honest truth and love,
With ginger snaps and cider.

INTRODUCTION.
THE  evolution of the Negro is fast destroying the unique types of the race. Another quarter of a century of freedom and the Negro of slavery days, the Nugro of the log cabin and the corn field will be but cherished memories. To those who have known the solicitous care of a "black
mammy" and listened to the homely philosophy and quaint humor of the plantation darkey there is a touch of pathos in the transformation they are undergoing, relieved by u feeling of pride and pleasure in their progression. 
In his anti-bellum state the Negro was close to nature. He gave a language to the birds and beasts, and his simplicity and superstition formed the basis for a charming fiction. Melody sprang spontaneously within him, and his gravest utterances were gilded with the quaintest humor.
American literature has preserved few of these types. The efforts of the majority of writers to portray them have been failures.
The author of this volume has caught the true spirit of *the anti-bellum Negro, and in characteristic verse has portrayed the simplicity, the philosophy and the humor of the In no instance has he descended to caricature, which has made valueless so many efforts in this fertile field of
literary effort. These poems will awaken tender memories in all who have dwelt in the Southland; they will be an inspiration to the musician in adding to the melodies peculiar to the plantation black, for all of them are adapted to musical interpretation. To the captious critic who may be inclined to find fault with the varying dialect, the following incident will be valuable:
A member of a minstrel company who desired to thoroughly master the Negro dialect associated for months with the Negroes on a Virginia plantation. When he appeared upon the stage in Richmond, he made an instantaneous success. Later on, he appeared in Georgia and Alabama, and no one understood him. There are other than dialect poems in this volume, and they show a fine feeling and are of a high order of expression.
I regard "Echoes from the Cabin " as a valuable contribution to American literature. The Negro dialect poems have not been equalled for fidelity to character since the Sewanee River was written.

WINTER-TIRED.
I wus a nottin' by my winder
Lookin' out the othor day,
On the Airth all white with snowdrifts-
Look you ever which-a-way;
An' while it all wus cleanly
Like a soul that's washed from sin,
I could not help a longin'
Fur the robins an' the green.
I am tired of all this sollum white,
Bare boughs an' tongueless brook;
The Airth is like a shrouded corpse
No matter whur I look.
0, I want to see the robins
An' hear the bluebirds sing,
An' in the pon' below the barn
The bullfrog swear its Spring!
I want to see white turn to brown,
An' then the brown turn green,
The hillsides put their mournin' off
As fifty times I've seen.
0, I want to hear that tongue-tied brook
Go singin' on its way,
Ashoutin' as it runs along:
"The robins 've come to stay!"

Always in Bohemia!
SOME DAY LAND.
1
Man nerer is, but always to be hlcunod.
- Alcrander Pope
O, myslic Land of Some Day,
For thee our sails are sprend;
Thy mountains blue are looming
Above us just alcad;
“ Land ho!" the lookout's calling,
nown oars and sails are falling,
The land is just ahead !
O, ever just before us
Dim, hazy lies thy shore;
We see the breakers rolling,
We catch the mad surf's roar-
Yet vain the helmsman's stooring,
Despite our hoping, fearing-
Forever, just ahead!
We know, O Land of Some Day,
That on thy sun-kissed heights
Embodied dreams await us
That filled the long, long nights;
Thai face to face beholding,
With eager arms enfolding,
These visions we shall clasp.
We know in halls of marble
Play fountains icy cold;
On walls of alabaster
Hang pictures framed in gold;
That thro' the night time calling,
The bulbul’s notes are falling
Upon the ravished ear.
We kuow through thy dvoji vulleys
The purest streamlets tlow:
That ou thy southern hillsiden
The purplost vino-yaris glow;
That iu thy gule mouils rouping,
The l'uiront waids aru sweeping
Their sicklos 'round the grain.
Yo'l. never any neurir
Our vono comes to lanel,
Though by the porow-awaiting,
Right gerly we wland;
Though winds loluw never failing,
Still ever on we're sailing
To thee, (). Some Day Land!
O, wystic Land of Some Day,
Behold our sails spread wide,
As toward thy' azure mountuins
Verth softest skies we glide;
"Land ho!" the lowkout's calling,
Downı ours and sails are falling-
Forever, just ahead!
WHEN THE FRUIT TRKES BLOOM
When the fruit trvos bileww,
Pink of ponch and white of plum,
And the peur-troes' cones of snow
In the olad huck orchari blow-
Plantal Bfty years ago!
And the cherries' long white row
Gives the sweetest prophecy
Of the banquet that will be,
When the suns and winds of June
Shall bave kissed to fruit the bloom-
Then Falstaffian buible-becs
Drain the blossoms to the lees,
When the fruit trees bloom.
When the fruit trees bloom,
Pink the apple, white the plum,
Underneath the knotted boughs
I am holding full carouse:
Drunken with the wine that drips
Downwarıl from each blossoin's lips,
Wbile the cathird's strident calls
Seern the laugh of bacchanals
Ringing through these winy halls;
Serenadeel by the bees,
Lullabies in minor keys,
Soon I sink in drunken drowse",
When-the-fruit-trees-bloom.
0,8WEETHEART, SWERT
O, sweetheart, sweet of the Long Ago,
Maid of the blac, blue eyes;
You went ono day liko a Spring-time snow
And you loft mo hery, ah, long ago,
To dream of you there in Paraclisu,
My sweetheart, sweet of the Long Ago.
(), sweetheart, sweet, so long are the years,
Filled with a hud, sail pain;
There's little of laughter, much of tears,
So weak are lopes, so strong aru the fears,
So wuch of loss, xo little of guin
In the harvest of all the years!
But through my pain and thro' all my tears
One thing, sweethoart, I know:
When done with all the long, dreary years,
And shed the last of Life's bitter tears,
I shall find you, my sweetheart, I know.
Then shall I forget all the toilful years
And drown in the sea of love my fears,
My sweetheart, sweet of the Long Ago!

REINCARNATION
The clanging fire-bells slook the air,
The maddened orowd roared like the son
And hurled its human waves 'gainst me--
Then tbrough the smoke a fuce gleamed fair
A moment brief--and then the crnah
As chariot wheels together dash;
Mad horser rear and plunge and scream-
It all comes back, an old, old drenm,
The brutal shout that shakes the walls
As in tbe dust my chariot falls,
The yellow cloud of strangling dust
And I 'neath broken chariot thrust,
The cruel fuces from the tiers-
'Then through it all a face appears,
With pity sweet and white with fears,
There in the box where Cresar encers!
MY FRIENDS IN BOHEMIA.
Friends have I in Bohemia three-
My pipe, my dog, myself, you see
We make a jolly trinity-
We three are carcless Bohemians.
When editors reject my "stuff,
The larder's lean and things look “tough,"
My friend, the pipe, gives me a "pull"-
My friend number one in Bo-he-ini-a.
I look into iny dog's brown eyes,
He whines as if to sympathize,
That he's hungry you'd nc'er surmise,
My friend number two in Bohemia.
When I coine in I hear his bark
Shout welcome clown the stairwuy dark.
Just strike a match-yos, that's he-hark!
My friend number two in Bo-he mi-.
My pipe is more to me than maid,
It ne'er with my affections played,
Nor of my heart a football maule-
This friend number one in Bohemia.
My dog is more than man to ine',
lle never lied to me, you scc,
While man has lied to and on me
Gol save my friends in Bo-he-mi-a.
TWICE THE MAPLE BLUSHES.
I.
O, twice the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy red;
8be blushes in the Spring-time,
When aroused from Winter's sleep,
She finds herself all naked
And the gaping world apcep,
0, then the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy real.
II.
Once again the maple blushes, blushes may, rosy rod;
She bluslics in the Autumn,
Wben she lays her robes aside
For the long, long sleep of Wintor,
And finds naught ’neath which to hide,
O, then the maple blushes, blushes rosy, rosy redl.
A NIGHT IN JUNE.
1.
"What so rare as a day in June?"
() poet, bast thou never known
A NIGHT in rose-voluptuous June? .
High over all a broal, full moon,
Groy broken clouds that sink and swoou •
In foods of light,
Which down the sky's vast stoopness pour,'.
Ningara in all savo roar-
Sound lost in night!
II.
Now Herrmadon the midnight moun,
The beetle's drumu, the frog'm bassoon,
And ningled with those risos shrill
The piccolo of whip-mor-will
Played in the boceli just on yon bill,
Now inoon-gold crownoil;
Then tinkling notes of light guitar,
With voices softened from afar,
Night lost in sound!
QUATRAINS.
I.
The Earth, a leper foul with scars and morom,
Jay naked in most hideous pliglit,
When Borena tung down his orainod rolx.
And hid from man the wick'ning night!
II.
Iw wlioru Duouwbwr's wilown the doopuust luy,
The wheat of Juno thu brightst glou mm;
K'on nou deep sorrows when with putionou byrne,
Oft-timom 11011'21" Jonym logoned our brou now!

I bear thy wigling, monning:
Make concord wavi within my mul,
Ilm (muutlens silla atoning!
ECLIPSE.
Diana lay sleeping in the West,
Her snowy, lissome limbs were bare;
Her robe had slipped adown her breast
And Phæbus, 'raptured, saw her there.
The sleeper felt his look of flame
And restless, tossed her arms with grace;
Awoke—then blushing at her shame
Within bcr mantle hid her face!
A MEMORY TONE.
She played,
And gleaming fingers touched the keys,
As if upon their souls she played,
While the mad desire grew fierce to seize
Them in the Bastile, swiftly made
Of my strong hands.
She played,
And o'er white shoulder flung a look
That almost drove me mad with pain;
My love ran toward her as the brook
When bank-brimmed o'er with April rain
Runs swift to sea.
She played —
A brook went purling o'er a stone,
Its rhythmic lip was dripping song;
Upon its bank I stood alone,
With brook and soul in concord strong,
And life so young.
She played
The tinkling sheep-bells filled the glade,
A thrush's song was in the air;
The water elms threw speckled shade,
Wild flowers were blooming everywhere,
The wbile she played.
She ceased,
And wbile'wbite arms were 'round my neck
And kisses on my lips were hot,
And love stood waiting at my beck,
I only know, I recked it naught-
Life seeineel so old !
MY FISHER LASS.
I stood beside the Summer sea
And watched far out my Fisher Lass
Row swiftly in her boat to me,
And the sea shone like a glass.
She waved her strong, brown hand to me,
The boat flew swiftly in from sea,
The osprey laughed in wild, wild glee
To see her row so swift to me.
Laugh, laugh, sea-birds and glad, glad sea,
My soul laughs too in mad, mad glee;
I catch her in my waiting arms
And lose my fears of wrecks and storms;
I brush the sea-damp locks aside
And kiss the mouth she tries to hide.
I stand beside a Winter sea,
A storm-wrecked boat lies on the shore;
The sea moans sad an elegy,
For my lass rows in no more.
No more across the Summer sea
My Fisher Lass rows into me;
I wait each day upon the shore-
They say that she will come no more.
Moan, moan aloud, thou Winter sean
,
My Fisher Lass is lost to me!
The ships ride in, the ships ride out,
I hear their sailors' mournful shout,
Some day, I know, across the sea
My Fisher Lass will w to me.
BEFORE THE FIRE.
Before the wide-mouthed hearth I sit,
While rudely rours the wind outdoor;
Upon the walls strange shadows flit
Or dervish-like dance on the floor;
Now softened to a minor strain,
As if it came from far away,
As if the wail of souls in pain,
The long imprisoned sunbeams' lay.
For aeons since when young was Time,
And Earth still wore the flush of Youth,
Long ere the birth of Man and Crime,
And dark browed Hate and tear-stained Ruth,
The tyrant Sun imprisoned in
The heart of oak and ash his beams
To expiato some unknown sin-
Some woodsprite told me in my dreams.
The flames that up the chimney race
And clap with glee their red, red hands,
Or snap their fingers in my face,
Or 'sault the wall in storming bands,
Are sunbeams bright but now set free
From centuries of prison dark
A spirit moves cach fame I see,
A sunbeam's soul is in each spark.
RICHARD III.
I see thy smile; at times, May's warm, young sun,
At times, December's cold and threat'ning sky;
Thy woman's hand aplucking at thy sword,
The lightning lurking in thy deep-set eye.
Alone, thy face a stage whereon doth play
Ambition, Hate, Lust, Murder; flitting out
And in the gloomy wings of thy dark soul-
A fearsome and a most unboly rout!
And yet withal a kingly look oft-times
Conveys an air of high-born royalty
That overshadows all thine awful crimes
And stamps e'en them somewhat with majesty.
Liar, Traitor, Murd'rer through all thy life-
HERO and King at Bosworth's fatal strife!
MORS ET VITA.
Into the soil a seed is, sown,
Out of the soul a song is wrung,
Out of the shell a pearl is gone,
Out of the cage a bird is flown,
Out of the body, a soul!
Unto a tree the seed is grown,
Wide in the world the
song
is
sung
The pearl in a necklace gleams more fair,
The bird is flown to a sweeter air,
And Death is balf and Life is half,
And the two make up the whole!
COMPENSAZIONE.
O, rich young lord, thou ridest by
With looks of high disdain;
It chafes me not thy title high,
Thy blood of oldest strain.
The lady riding at thy side
Is but in name thy promised bride,
Ride on young lord, ride on!
Her father wills and she obeys,
The custom of her class;
'Tis Land not Love the trothing swayo
För Land he sells his lass.
Her fair white band, young lord, is thine,
Her soul, proud fool, her soul is mine,
Ride on young lord, ride on!
No title high my father bore;
The tenant of thy farm,
He left me what I value more:
Clean heart, clear brain, strong arm
And love for bird and beast and beo
And song of lark and hymn of sea,
Ride on young lord, ride on!
The boundless sky to me belongs,
The paltry acres thine;
The painted beauty sings thy songs,
The lavrock lilts me mine;
The hot-housod orchid blooms for thee,
The gorac and heather bloom for me,
Rido on young lord, ride on!
SERENADE SONG
Hist, Dolores, I am coming,
Gently my guitar I'm thrumming,
'Neath thy casement softly humming,
Dolores, 0, carissima!
All the world but me is sleeping,
Nothing but the stars is peeping,
Up to thee my soul is leaping,
Dolores, O, carissima!
Rise, and wide thy shutter flinging,
List, O list, my soul is singing,
All my soul to love's time swinging,
Dolores, O, carissima!
Outward from thy casement leaning,
Turn thine eyes upon me beaming,
Twin stars thro' the darkness gleaming,
Dolores, 0, carissima!
Nightly 'neath thy casement singing,
All my soul with passion ringing,
Up to thee my soul I'm flinging,
Dolores, 0, carissima!
Thro' the summer's roses hoping,
Thro' the autumn's dead leaves groping,
Where the vine's dead leaves are dropping,
Dolores, 0, carissima!
Still, my love, O still thou'rt sleeping,
While my soul for thee is weeping,
While Love's hand the strings is bwerping,
Dolores, O, carissima!
When, o, when, this long sleep breaking,
Will thy love, to life awaking,
On thy lips my kisses taking,
Know thy lover, me, Francisco?
AMICI TRES.
1.
Some friends I had, they numbered three--
Tom, Loo and Ben; staunch friends were we.
0, life was sweot and Ilfo was young,
And love filled all the songs wo sung.
Boy's love for boy is stronger than
The honeyed love of maid for man,
Like David's love for Jonathan.
Life's tide rolled on, we all grew up
And drained the lees of manhood's cup-
A sweetheart parted Ben and me,
A race for office drove off Lee,
And money loaned was Tom's sole plea-
The money that was loaned by me.
..
II.
Some friends I had, they numbered three-
My mother, wife, myself. You see
We made another trinity.
The first and second always true,
But shall I tell the truth to you?
I found the third, worst enemy.
More dangerous than the foe without,
Who rushes on with sword and shout,
Is Self, who never makes a din,
But, like a sapper, works within,
Until he undermines the wall
And sends it crashing to its fall!
III.
Again my friends they number throom
Wife, mother, CHRIST-great trinity!
When in the fiery furnace tried
I found these three walked at my side;
They faced the flercest furnace heat
That 'gainst my shrinking soul did beat,
Nor storm nor calm nor Joy nor grief,
Nor trials sore beyond belief.
Myself within, flerco foes without,
Dismuy them not with battlo shout.
Aguin I count my friends as three-
Wife, mother, Christ, the strongest three,
My all suflicing trinity!
THROUGH OCTOBER FIELDS
The startlod quail in oovies whir
Prom 'neath your feet as on you stray
Along the narrow thread-like path,
This cool October day.
The grouse's booming drum of bass
Peals t'rom the hollow on your right,
Till 'larumed by your near approach
He wheels in sudden flight.
And on the trunk of yon dead tree
The "flicker"'* beats his fierce tattoo,
Then hurls back from bis wave-like flight
Defiance slirill to you.
On every side the golden rod's
Long, graceful plumes of tawny gold.
And ageratum's purple bloom-
The banners of the wold.
The stubble of the June-reaped wheat
Stands up in bristling ranks of spears,
Its gold is covered now with frost,
Like warriors grey with ycars.
And over all the golden haze
Soft wraps the brown Earth in a dream,
While every breath across the fields
Rich draughts of rare wines seem.
•“Micker" is a local name in southern Ohio for the yellow hammer or
golden-winged woodpecker. He gets the name from his cry: "Micker!
Ticker! Flicker!"
His Night is undulatory.-AUTHOR.
There in the stream beneath the elmo,
The leaves, like ships of Lil'put, fair,
Drift down, sans rudders and sans sails
To ports that lie nowhere.
See in the field beyond the stream,
Pitched wide o'er all the bottom land,
An Indian village quaintly shown,
The cornslock wigwams stand.
Now, you are “near to nature's heart,"
You lie upon her tawny breast;
You feel her warm breath on your cheek
As in her arms you rest.
THE HAWK.
This pirate of the over sea,
No black-bulled brig he sails,
No blaok dag at the mizzen-peak
Flaunts death-heads to the gales.
Yet fiercer than the wild Corsair
This pirate of the upper air.
Watch how he listless drifts along,
His wings with winds at sport-
But look! a snil has hove in sight,
A dove has crossed to port.
Son how ho orowds on ov'ry sail
And sorcams his war-cry to the galo.
The frightened dove-&amp; merchantman
Has not a gun to give him fight;
With all her canvas to the wind,
She tacks to starboard, wild with fright.
Abli vain for her this tack to take,
Like Fate he follows in her wake!
She weakens in her useless flight,
The wind is beating in her face.
But watch him as he drives along,
His ev'ry motion—strength and grace-
She's overhauled! Her course is run!
A fierce, fierce scream, the chase is won!
MARY OF MAGDALA.
Poor harlot, Mary Magdalene,
Into the feast with trembling crept,
Past frowns that stabbed her with their bato
And falling at His feet she wept.
Self-righteous Simon spurned her there
And marveled that her sinful touch
Displeased Him not, but he forgave:
Though sinning sore she love'd much."
Brave, grateful Mary Magdalene,
When Peter all his faith had lost,
Pressed on through sworils of arme'd men
And knelt in grief beneath the cross;
She bathed the nail-pierced fout with tears
That mingled with His trickling bloou,
While Andrew, Matthew, James and all
Far off in abject terror stood.
SAVED, FAITUFUL MARY MAGDALENE
Through all that morning's doubt and gloom,
When Hope and Faith had fled the world,
Brought from that empty shattered tomb
The words that thrill a suve'd world
With flying feet and sobbing breath:
o The Christ is risen as he said,
Triumphant Lord of conquered Death!''
A LOVE DREAM.
I know 'twas a dream, yet sweet was the themo,
And I strive to rocall its splendor-
My soul upward leaps as Thought backward sweeps
To my dream so warm and so tender.
Where sea billows toss 'neath the bright Southern cross,
By the sea lay I idly dreaming,
While the stars burned a way from Night uuto Day
And the waves like helmets wore gleaming.
A maid came and stood at the neck of the wood
And her locks on the Night were streaming,
She was tall ns pines that rock in the winds,
And her oyos liko Orion wero glenming.
Sho camo to me there and caught up her hair
And spread it a mantle above mo-
U my soul grew sick and the hot air thick
As sho whispered: “Como sweet, now love me."
I kissod the red mouth of th' passionate South,
Till my lips with kissing grow husky,
I lookod in the eyes that woro storm-charged skies,
'Nonth tho cloud of hor thick locks dusky.
Tlion up the Dny cnmc with cohorts of flnme
And the Soul of the South Wind left me,
And Joy fled away with the Rise of the Day,
For Day, of my Lovo hnd beroft mo.
I know 'twas a dream, yot swout was the theme,
And I strive to recall its splendor-
My soul upward leaps as Thought backward sweeps
To my dream so warm and so tender.
A SONG.
Heigho for glass, heigho for a lase,
A drink and a kiss, I leave you;
Heigbo for a friend that sticks till the end
Good-bye, my lass, don't you griove you.
Hurrah for a song that is not too long,
With a Jolly roaring chorus,
While our cans boat time to the ringing rhyme
Till tho ceiling cracks up o'er us.
Hoigho for an eye as blue as the sky
And a mouth that's red and tondor;
For a cbin that's round and a check that's browa
As the oak leaves in November.
Hurrah for a horse on a wind.swept course
And a night as black as hell is,
And a gallop blind in faco o' the wind
To calm a soul that foll is.
Hoiglo for a glass, lioiglo for a lass,
A drink and a kiss, I leave you;
Heigho for a friond that sticks til!l the end-
Good-bye, my Inse, don't you grieve you.
THE POINT OF VIEW.
The poet stood in ecstasy
Before the field with daisies sweet
A waving sea of white and gold:
Well named," he said, Sweet Marguerite.
Fair as her own sweet self you are,
You reprosent her better part-
White as the newest snow without,
And deep within, all gold at heart."
Then, stooping low with eyes all soul,
He plucked one for his button-hole.
The farmer leaned across the fence,
A scowl was on his wrinkled brow
As on the marguerites be frowned:
"Gosh darn the luck, I'll du it naow;
Them consarned weeds ull taak the place,
They're baout tu rưn me off the farm;
Them air ox.eyes uv gut tu go
So they wont du the craps no harm."
Then pulling up an armful-big,
He threw them over to the pig !
BIRD-SONG.
Cheersen ! Cheewink ! O purety
We've come to stay, to stay.
Cheereen! Cheewink! You know it,
And smile as we pipe our lay.
Choorsea! Chcercon ! Cheewink! Cheereen!
Sce all the hillsides turning groon,
The sun is bright,
The sky is light,
Cheereen! Cheereen! Choereen !

We've come to play, to play.
Cheercen! Cheewink! You know it
O smile as we pipe our lay.

O list our notes, they rise, thoy sink
Upon the air,
So rich, so rare,
Cheereen! Cheereen! Cheereen !

'Tis time to work, to work.
The brook tells thce, the brawler,
'Tis time to conso to shirk.

Not of the toil but harvest think,
Bring out thy plow,
'Tis work time now,
Cheereen ! Cheereen! Cheereen!
THE PARIAH.
Owned her father all the fact'ries
Which their black’ning smoke sent up,
Miles and miles all 'round the country,
From the town by hills pent up.
Traced he back his proud ancestry
To the Rock on Plymouth's shore,
Traced I mine to Dutch ship landing
At Jamestown, one year before.
Thus was she of haughty lineage,
I of mongrel race had sprung;
O'er my fathers in the workfield
Whips of scorpions had been swung.
Years of freedom were her race's,
Years of cruel slavery mine;
Years of culture were her race's,
Years of darkest ign'rance mine.
She a lily sought by all men,
I a thistle shunned by all;
She the Brahmin, I the Pariah
Who must e'er before her crawl.
Fair was I as her complexion,
Honest came my fairness, too,
For my father and my mother
Were in wedlock banded true.
Yes, this mixing of the races
Had been years, long years ago,
That you could not trace the streamlet
To the fountain wbence the flow.
Like an eagle long imprisoned
Soared I into realms of light,
Scorning all the narrow valley,
Where my wings had plumed for diglat.
In the Sun of modern science
I had soaring bathed my wings,
And rose higher, higher, HIGHER,
'Bove a world of narrow things.
Then on proudly soaring pinions
I forgot my lowly birth,
When Caste's arrow, venom laden,
Struck mc, shot me down to Earth.
Kind and friendly had she ever
Seemed and acted unto me,
Till of late a cold restrainment
Seemed to bar her manners free,
Then my sens'tivo soul quick thinking
That the Pride of Casto was born
In her mind, grew cold and distant,
Though it pricked me like a thorn,
And my thoughts grew dark and bitter,
Bitter as the wild aloe.
I became a sncering cynic,
Deeming every man a foe,
Scorning books while scorning people.
In their pages naught I saw
But I libelled, but I censured,
Every sentence found a flaw;
Til one night the mad mob gathered,
Called in voices wild and loud
I should quickly come before them,
And address the raging crowd.
They werc strikers, who were workmen
For her father stern anıl proud,
And they threatened to destroy him
And his works in curses loud.
At the call I' stepped before them,
And they greeted wild and strong,
And my heart grew hot with batred
Of Oppression, Caste and Wrong,
While ihe words poured out like lava
From the crater of my brain-
Burning, seething, hissing, raging
With the years of pent-up pain.
They bad gathered by the great works,
With their blazing furnace doors,
And the lofty, flaming chimneys,
Up whose throats the hot blast roars;
And the furnace threw its hot light
'Pon their toilworn, svarthy faces,
While the flames from out the chimnies
Painted heaven with their blazes.
In their hands they held their weapons
Tools for toil, and not for war;
On the great mill rolled and thundered,
Shaking heaven with its jar.
And their brows were dark with hatred,
And their cheeks were hot with ruge,
And their voices low were growling,
Like wild beasts penned in a cage.
And the tiger rose within me
With a growl that was a curse,
And I breathed his breath of passion,
And I felt bis awful thirst.
But her Imago come boforo me,
With ber sad, reproaceful eyes,
And her locks of sunset splendor
When the summer daylight dies.
Then banished was hot Passion,
While Mercy pleaded low,
And I cooled their angry fury,
As hot iron is cooled in snow.
And she comes and stands before me
As I gaze into the stream,
And I see her, I behold ber
As some vision in a dream,
And the waves of love come surging
And they sweep my will away,
For I love her, 0 I love her-
Aye, forever and a day!
And I called her: “ Ediel Edie!”
As I'd called her oft before,
When as little guileless children
We plucked lilies from this shore.
Oh my voice sobbed like 8 barp string
When the rough hand breaks a chord,
And it wailed and moaned as sadly
As some broken-hearted lard.
And she came up to me quickly
When I thus wailed out her name,
All her soul rose in her blue eyes
There was ne'er a look of shame,
And she threw her arms up to me
And I caught her to my heart,
While the whole earth reeled beneath me
And the heavens fell apart !
Faint and trombling then I asked her
What the cruel world would say,
While she blashed but spoke out bravely:
"We'll forget the World to-day.
This I only know, I love you,
I have loved you all the while;
What care I then for your lineage
Or the barsh world's frown or smile.
Men are noble from their actions,
From their deeds and theirs alone,
Father's deeds are not their children's
Reap not that by others sown.
They are naught but dwarfish pigmies
Who would scorn you for your birth;
Who would scorn you for your lineage,
Raise they not their eyes from Earth.
What is blood? The human body?
Trace it back, it leads to dust,
Trace it forward, same conclusion,
Naught but vile dust find you must.
But the soul is sent froin heaven
And the Sculptor-Hand is God's
Part and parcel of his being,
While our bodies are but clods 1"

    Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so
    that no man went through thee, I will make thee an
    eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.

  MY MOTHER'S KISS.
  My mother's kiss, my mother's kiss,
     I feel its impress now;
  As in the bright and happy days
     She pressed it on my brow.
  You say it is a fancied thing
     Within my memory fraught;
  To me it has a sacred place--
     The treasure house of thought.
  Again, I feel her fingers glide
     Amid my clustering hair;
  I see the love-light in her eyes,
     When all my life was fair.
  Again, I hear her gentle voice
     In warning or in love.
  How precious was the faith that taught
     My soul of things above.
  (1)
  The music of her voice is stilled,
     Her lips are paled in death.
  As precious pearls I'll clasp her words
     Until my latest breath.
  The world has scattered round my path
     Honor and wealth and fame;
  But naught so precious as the thoughts
     That gather round her name.
  And friends have placed upon my brow
     The laurels of renown;
  But she first taught me how to wear
     My manhood as a crown.
  My hair is silvered o'er with age,
     I'm longing to depart;
  To clasp again my mother's hand,
     And be a child at heart.
  To roam with her the glory-land
     Where saints and angels greet;
  To cast our crowns with songs of love
     At our Redeemer's feet.
  A GRAIN OF SAND.
  Do you see this grain of sand
  Lying loosely in my hand?
  Do you know to me it brought
  Just a simple loving thought?
  When one gazes night by night
  On the glorious stars of light,
  Oh how little seems the span
  Measured round the life of man.
  Oh! how fleeting are his years
  With their smiles and their tears;
  Can it be that God does care
  For such atoms as we are?
  Then outspake this grain of sand
  "I was fashioned by His hand
  In the star lit realms of space
  I was made to have a place.
  "Should the ocean flood the world,
  Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled
  All the force they could employ
  Wouldn't a single grain destroy;
  And if I, a thing so light,
  Have a place within His sight;
  You are linked unto his throne
  Cannot live nor die alone.
  In the everlasting arms
  Mid life's dangers and alarms
  Let calm trust your spirit fill;
  Know He's God, and then be still."
  Trustingly I raised my head
  Hearing what the atom said;
  Knowing man is greater far
  Than the brightest sun or star.
  THE CROCUSES.
  They heard the South wind sighing
     A murmur of the rain;
  And they knew that Earth was longing
     To see them all again.
  While the snow-drops still were sleeping
     Beneath the silent sod;
  They felt their new life pulsing
     Within the dark, cold clod.
  Not a daffodil nor daisy
     Had dared to raise its head;
  Not a fairhaired dandelion
     Peeped timid from its bed;
  Though a tremor of the winter
     Did shivering through them run;
  Yet they lifted up their foreheads
     To greet the vernal sun.
  And the sunbeams gave them welcome.
     As did the morning air
  And scattered o'er their simple robes
     Rich tints of beauty rare.
  Soon a host of lovely flowers
     From vales and woodland burst;
  But in all that fair procession
     The crocuses were first.
  First to weave for Earth a chaplet
     To crown her dear old head;
  And to beautify the pathway
     Where winter still did tread.
  And their loved and white haired mother
     Smiled sweetly 'neath the touch,
  When she knew her faithful children
     Were loving her so much.
  THE PRESENT AGE.
  Say not the age is hard and cold--
     I think it brave and grand;
  When men of diverse sects and creeds
     Are clasping hand in hand.
  The Parsee from his sacred fires
     Beside the Christian kneels;
  And clearer light to Islam's eyes
     The word of Christ reveals.
  The Brahmin from his distant home
     Brings thoughts of ancient lore;
  The Bhuddist breaking bonds of caste
     Divides mankind no more.
  The meek-eyed sons of far Cathay
     Are welcome round the board;
  Not greed, nor malice drives away
     These children of our Lord.
  And Judah from whose trusted hands
     Came oracles divine;
  Now sits with those around whose hearts
     The light of God doth shine.
  Japan unbars her long sealed gates
     From islands far away;
  Her sons are lifting up their eyes
     To greet the coming day.
  The Indian child from forests wild
     Has learned to read and pray;
  The tomahawk and scalping knife
     From him have passed away.
  From centuries of servile toil
     The Negro finds release,
  And builds the fanes of prayer and praise
     Unto the God of Peace.
  England and Russia face to face
     With Central Asia meet;
  And on the far Pacific coast,
     Chinese and natives greet.
  Crusaders once with sword and shield
     The Holy Land to save;
  From Moslem hands did strive to clutch
     The dear Redeemer's grave.
  A battle greater, grander far
     Is for the present age;
  A crusade for the rights of man
     To  brighten history's page.
  Where labor faints and bows her head,
     And want consorts with crime;
  Or men grown faithless sadly say
     That evil is the time.
  There is the field, the vantage ground
     For every earnest heart;
  To side with justice, truth and right
     And act a  noble part.
  To save from ignorance and vice
     The  poorest, humblest child;
  To make our age the fairest one
     On which the sun has smiled;
  To plant the roots of coming years
     In mercy, love and truth;
  And bid our weary, saddened earth
     Again renew her youth.
  Oh! earnest hearts! toil on in hope,
     'Till darkness shrinks from light;
  To fill the earth with peace and joy,
     Let youth and age unite:
  To stay the floods of sin and shame
     That sweep from shore to shore;
  And furl the banners stained with blood,
     'Till war shall be no more.
  Blame not the age, nor think it full
     Of evil and unrest;
  But say of every other age,
     "This one shall be the best."
  The age to brighten every path
     By sin and sorrow trod;
  For loving hearts to usher in
     The commonwealth of God.
  DEDICATION POEM.
       Dedication Poem on the reception of the annex to
  the home for aged colored people, from the bequest of
  Mr. Edward T. Parker.
  Outcast from her home in Syria
     In the lonely, dreary wild;
  Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken,
     Sat a mother and her child.
  There was not a voice to cheer her
     Not a soul to share her fate;
  She was weary, he was fainting,
     And life seemed so desolate.
  Far away in sunny Egypt
     Was lone Hagar's native land;
  Where the Nile in kingly bounty
     Scatters bread with gracious hand.
  In the tents of princely Abram
     She for years had found a home;
  Till the stern decree of Sarah
     Sent her forth the wild to roam.
  Hour by hour she journeyed onward
     From the shelter of their tent,
  Till her footsteps slowly faltered
     And the water all was spent;
  Then she veiled her face in sorrow,
     Feared her child would die of thirst
  Till  her eyes with tears so holden
     Saw a sparkling fountain burst.
  Oh! how happy was that mother,
     What a soothing of her pain;
  When she saw her child reviving,
     Life rejoicing through each vein
  Does not life repeat this story,
     Tell it over day by day?
  Of the fountains of refreshment
     Ever springing by our way.
  Here is one by which we gather,
     On this bright and happy day,
  Just to bask beside a fountain
     Making gladder life's highway.
  Bringing unto hearts now aged
     Who have borne life's burdens long,
  Such a gift of love and mercy
     As deserves our sweetest song.
  Such a gift that even heaven
     May rejoice with us below,
  If the pure and holy angels
     Join us in our joy and woe.
  May the memory of the giver
     In this home where age may rest,
  Float like fragrance through the ages,
     Ever blessing, ever blest.
  When the gates of pearl are opened
     May we there this friend behold,
  Drink with him from living fountains,
     Walk with him the streets of gold.
  When life's shattered cords of music
     Shall again be sweetly sung;
  Then our hearts with life immortal,
     Shall be young, forever young.
  A DOUBLE STANDARD.
  Do you blame me that I loved him?
     If when standing all alone
  I cried for bread a careless world
     Pressed to my lips a stone.
  Do you blame me that I loved him,
     That my heart beat glad and free,
  When he told me in the sweetest tones
     He loved but only me?
  Can you blame me that I did not see
     Beneath his burning kiss
  The serpent's wiles, nor even hear
     The deadly adder hiss?
  Can you blame me that my heart grew cold
     The tempted, tempter turned;
  When he was feted and caressed
     And I was coldly spurned?
  Would you blame him, when you draw from
        me
     Your dainty robes aside,
  If he with gilded baits should claim
     Your fairest as his bride?
  Would you blame the world if it should press
     On him a civic crown;
  And see me struggling in the depth
     Then harshly press me down?
  Crime has no sex and yet to-day
     I wear the brand of shame;
  Whilst he amid the gay and proud
     Still bears an honored name.
  Can you blame me if I've learned to think
     Your hate of vice a sham,
  When you so coldly crushed me down
     And then excused the man?
  Would you blame me if to-morrow
     The coroner should say,
  A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn,
     Has thrown her life away?
  Yes, blame me for my downward course,
     But oh! remember well,
  Within your homes you press the hand
     That led me down to hell.
  I'm glad God's ways are not our ways
     He does not see as man;
  Within His love I know there's room
     For those whom others ban.
  I think before His great white throne,
     His throne of spotless light,
  That whited sepulchres shall wear
     The hue of endless night.
  That I who fell, and he who sinned,
     Shall reap as we have sown;
  That each the burden of his loss
     Must bear and bear alone.
  No golden weights can turn the scale
     Of justice in His sight;
  And what is wrong in woman's life
     In man's cannot be right.
  OUR HERO.
  Onward to her destination,
     O'er the stream the Hannah sped,
  When a cry of consternation
     Smote and chilled our hearts with dread.
  Wildly leaping, madly sweeping,
     All relentless in their sway,
  Like a band of cruel demons
     Flames were closing 'round our way
  Oh! the horror of those moments;
     Flames above and waves below--
  Oh! the agony of ages
     Crowded in one hour of woe.
  Fainter grew our hearts with anguish
     In that hour with peril rife,
  When we saw the pilot flying,
     Terror-stricken, for his life.
  Then a man uprose before us--
     We had once despised his race--
  But we saw a lofty purpose
     Lighting up his darkened face.
  While the flames were madly roaring,
     With a courage grand and high,
  Forth he rushed unto our rescue,
     Strong to suffer, brave to die.
  Helplessly the boat was drifting,
     Death was staring in each face,
  When he grasped the fallen rudder,
     Took the pilot's vacant place.
  Could he save us? Would he save us?
     All his hope of life give o'er?
  Could he hold that fated vessel
     'Till she reached the nearer shore?
  All our hopes and fears were centered
     'Round his strong, unfaltering hand;
  If he failed us we must perish,
     Perish just in sight of land.
  Breathlessly we watched and waited
     While the flames were raging fast;
  When our anguish changed to rapture--
     We were saved, yes, saved at last.
  Never strains of sweetest music
     Brought to us more welcome sound
  Than the grating of that steamer
     When her keel had touched the ground.
  But our faithful martyr hero
     Through a fiery pathway trod,
  Till he laid his valiant spirit
     On the bosom of his God.
  Fame has never crowned a hero
     On the crimson fields of strife,
  Grander, nobler, than that pilot
     Yielding up for us his life.
  THE DYING BONDMAN.
  Life was trembling, faintly trembling
  On the bondman's latest breath,
  And he felt the chilling pressure
  Of the cold, hard hand of Death.
  He had been an Afric chieftain,
  Worn his manhood as a crown;
  But upon the field of battle
  Had been fiercely stricken down.
  He had longed to gain his freedom,
  Waited, watched and hoped in vain,
  Till his life was slowly ebbing--
  Almost broken was his chain.
  By his bedside stood the master,
  Gazing on the dying one,
  Knowing by the dull grey shadows
  That life's sands were almost run.
  "Master," said the dying bondman,
  "Home and friends I soon shall see;
  But before I reach my country,
  Master write  that I am free;
  "For the spirits of my fathers
  Would shrink back from me in pride,
  If I told them at our greeting
  I a slave had lived and died;
  "Give to me the precious token,
  That my kindred dead may see--
  Master! write it, write it quickly!
  Master! write that I am free!"
  At his earnest plea the master
  Wrote for him the glad release,
  O'er his wan and wasted features
  Flitted one sweet smile of peace.
  Eagerly he grasped the writing;
  "I am free!" at last he said.
  Backward fell upon the pillow,
  He was free among the dead.
  "A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM."
  Only a little scrap of blue
     Preserved with loving care,
  But earth has not a brilliant hue
     To me more bright and fair.
  Strong drink, like a raging demon,
     Laid on my heart his hand,
  When my darling joined with others
     The Loyal Legion * band.
  But mystic angels called away
     My loved and precious child,
  And o'er life's dark and stormy way
     Swept waves of anguish wild.
  * The Temperance Band,
  This badge of the Loyal Legion
     We placed upon her breast,
  As she lay in her little coffin
     Taking her last sweet rest.
  To wear that badge as a token
     She earnestly did crave,
  So we laid it on her bosom
     To wear it in the grave.
  Where sorrow would never reach her
     Nor harsh words smite her ear;
  Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber
     Would ever shed a tear.
  "What means this badge?" said her father,
     Whom we had tried to save;
  Who said, when we told her story,
     "Don't put it in the grave."
  We took the badge from her bosom
     And laid it on a chair;
  And men by drink deluded
     Knelt by that badge in prayer.
  And vowed in that hour of sorrow
     From drink they would abstain;
  And this little badge became the wedge
     Which broke their galling chain.
  And lifted the gloomy shadows
     That overspread my life,
  And flooding my home with gladness,
     Made me a happy wife.
  And this is why this scrap of blue
     Is precious in my sight;
  It changed my sad and gloomy home
     From darkness into light.
  THE SPARROW'S FALL.
  Too frail to soar--a feeble thing--
  It fell to earth with fluttering wing;
  But God, who watches over all,
  Beheld that little sparrow's fall.
  'Twas not a bird with plumage gay,
  Filling the air with its morning lay;
  'Twas not an eagle bold and strong,
  Borne on the tempest's wing along.
  Only a brown and weesome thing,
  With drooping head and listless wing;
  It could not drift beyond His sight
  Who marshals the splendid stars of night.
  Its dying chirp fell on His ears,
  Who tunes the music of the spheres,
  Who hears the hungry lion's call,
  And spreads a table for us all.
  Its mission of song at last is done,
  No more will it greet the rising sun;
  That tiny bird has found a rest
  More calm than its mother's downy breast
  Oh, restless heart, learn thou to trust
  In God, so tender, strong and just;
  In whose love and mercy everywhere
  His humblest children have a share.
  If in love He numbers ev'ry hair,
  Whether the strands be dark or fair,
  Shall we not learn to calmly rest,
  Like children, on our Father's breast?
  GOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND.
  God bless our native land,
     Land of the newly free,
  Oh may she ever stand
     For truth and liberty.
  God bless our native land,
     Where sleep our kindred dead,
  Let peace at thy command
     Above their graves be shed.
  God help our native land,
     Bring surcease to her strife,
  And shower from thy hand
     A more abundant life.
  God bless our native land,
     Her homes and children bless,
  Oh may she ever stand
     For truth and righteousness.
  DANDELIONS.
  Welcome children of the Spring,
     In your garbs of green and gold,
  Lifting up your sun-crowned heads
     On the verdant plain and wold.
  As a bright and joyous troop
     From the breast of earth ye came
  Fair and lovely are your cheeks,
     With sun-kisses all aflame.
  In the dusty streets and lanes,
     Where the lowly children play,
  There as gentle friends ye smile,
     Making brighter life's highway
  Dewdrops and the morning sun,
     Weave your garments fair and bright,
  And we welcome you to-day
     As the children of the light.
  Children of the earth and sun.
     We are slow to understand
  All the richness of the gifts
     Flowing from our Father's hand.
  Were our vision clearer far,
     In this sin-dimmed world of ours,
  Would we not more thankful be
     For the love that sends us flowers?
  Welcome, early visitants,
     With your sun-crowned golden hair,
  With your message to our hearts
     Of our Father's loving care.
  THE BUILDING.
  "Build me a house," said the Master,
     "But not on the shifting sand,
  Mid the wreck and roar of tempests,
     A house that will firmly stand.
  "I will bring thee windows of agates,
     And gates of carbuncles bright,
  And thy fairest courts and portals
     Shall be filled with love and light.
  "Thou shalt build with fadeless rubies,
     All fashioned around the throne,
  A house that shall last forever,
     With Christ as the cornerstone.
  "It shall be a royal mansion,
     A fair and beautiful thing,
  It will be the presence-chamber
     Of thy Saviour, Lord and King.
  "Thy house shall be bound with pinions
     To mansions of rest above,
  But grace shall forge all the fetters
     With the links and cords of love.
  "Thou shalt be free in this mansion
     From sorrow and pain of heart,
  For the peace of God shall enter,
     And never again depart."
  HOME, SWEET HOME.
  Sharers of a common country,
     They had met in deadly strife;
  Men who should have been as brothers
     Madly sought each other's life.
  In the silence of the even,
     When the cannon's lips were dumb,
  Thoughts of home and all its loved ones
     To the soldier's heart would come.
  On the margin of a river,
     'Mid the evening's dews and damps,
  Could be heard the sounds of music
     Rising from two hostile camps.
  One was singing of its section
     Down in Dixie, Dixie's land,
  And the other of the banner
     Waved so long from strand to strand.
  In the land where Dixie's ensign
     Floated o'er the hopeful slave,
  Rose the song that freedom's banner,
     Starry-lighted, long might wave.
  From the fields of strife and carnage,
     Gentle thoughts began to roam,
  And a tender strain of music
  Rose with words of "Home, Sweet Home."
  Then the hearts of strong men melted,
     For amid our grief and sin
  Still remains that "touch of nature,"
   Telling us we all are kin.
  In one grand but gentle chorus,
     Floating to the starry dome,
  Came the words that brought them nearer,
     Words that told of "Home, Sweet Home."
  For awhile, all strife forgotten,
     They were only brothers then,
  Joining in the sweet old chorus,
     Not as soldiers, but as men.
  Men whose hearts would flow together,
     Though apart their feet might roam,
  Found a tie they could not sever,
     In the mem'ry of each home.
  Never may the steps of carnage
     Shake our land from shore to shore,
  But may mother, home and Heaven,
     Be our watchwords evermore.
  THE PURE IN HEART SHALL SEE GOD.
  They shall see Him in the crimson flush
     Of morning's early light,
  In the drapery of sunset,
     Around the couch of night.
  When the clouds drop down their fatness,
     In late and early rain,
  They shall see His glorious footprints
     On valley, hill and plain.
  They shall see Him when the cyclone
     Breathes terror through the land;
  They shall see Him 'mid the murmurs
     Of zephyrs soft and bland.
  They shall see Him when the lips of health,
     Breath vigor through each nerve,
  When pestilence clasps hands with death,
     His purposes to serve.
  They shall see Him when the trembling earth
     Is rocking to and fro;
  They shall see Him in the order
     The seasons come and go.
  They shall see Him when the storms of war
     Sweep wildly through the land;
  When peace descends like gentle dew
     They still shall see His hand.
  They shall see Him in the city
     Of gems and pearls of light,
  They shall see Him in his beauty,
     And walk with Him in white.
  To living founts their feet shall tend,
     And Christ shall be their guide,
  Beloved of God, their rest shall be
     In safety by His side.
  HE "HAD NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD."
  The conies had their hiding-place,
     The wily fox with stealthy tread
  A covert found, but Christ, the Lord,
     Had not a place to lay his head.
  The eagle had an eyrie home,
     The blithesome bird its quiet rest,
  But not the humblest spot on earth
     Was by the Son of God possessed.
  Princes and kings had palaces,
     With grandeur could adorn each tomb,
  For Him who came with love and life,
     They had no home, they gave no room.
  The hands whose touch sent thrills of joy
     Through nerves unstrung and palsied
        frame,
  The feet that travelled for our need,
     Were nailed unto the cross of shame.
  How dare I murmur at my lot,
     Or talk of sorrow, pain and loss,
  When Christ was in a manger laid,
     And died in anguish on the cross.
  That homeless one beheld beyond
     His lonely agonizing pain,
  A love outflowing from His heart,
     That all the wandering world would gain.
  GO WORK IN MY VINEYARD.
  Go work in my vineyard, said the Lord,
     And gather the bruised grain;
  But the reapers had left the stubble bare,
     And I trod the soil in pain.
  The fields of my Lord are wide and broad,
     He has pastures fair and green,
  And vineyards that drink the golden light
     Which flows from the sun's bright sheen.
  I heard the joy of the reapers' song,
     As they gathered golden grain;
  Then wearily turned unto my task,
     With a lonely sense of pain.
  Sadly I turned from the sun's fierce glare,
     And sought the quiet shade,
  And over my dim and weary eyes
     Sleep's peaceful fingers strayed.
  I dreamed I joined with a restless throng,
     Eager for pleasure and gain;
  But ever and anon a stumbler fell,
     And uttered a cry of pain.
  But the eager crowd still hurried on,
     Too busy to pause or heed,
  When a voice rang sadly through my soul,
     You must staunch these wounds that bleed.
  My hands were weak, but I reached them out
     To feebler ones than mine,
  And over the shadows of my life
     Stole the light of a peace divine.
  Oh! then my task was a sacred thing,
     How precious it grew in my eyes!
  'Twas mine to gather the bruised grain
     For the "Lord of Paradise."
  And when the reapers shall lay their grain
     On the floors of golden light,
  I feel that mine with its broken sheaves
     Shall be precious in His sight.
  Though thorns may often pierce my feet,
     And the shadows still abide,
  The mists will vanish before His smile,
     There will be light at eventide.
  RENEWAL OF STRENGTH.
  The prison-house in which I live
     Is falling to decay,
  But God renews my spirit's strength,
     Within these walls of clay.
  For me a dimness slowly creeps
     Around earth's fairest light,
  But heaven grows clearer to my view,
     And fairer to my sight.
  It may be earth's sweet harmonies
     Are duller to my ear,
  But music from my Father's house
     Begins to float more near.
  Then let the pillars of my home
     Crumble and fall away;
  Lo, God's dear love within my soul
     Renews it day by day.
  JAMIE'S PUZZLE.
  There was grief within our household
     Because of a vacant chair.
  Our mother, so loved and precious,
     No longer was sitting there.
  Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow,
     Our eyes with tears were blind,
  And little Jamie was wondering,
     Why we were left behind.
  We had told our little darling,
     Of the land of love and light,
  Of the saints all crowned with glory,
     And enrobed in spotless white.
  We said that our precious mother,
     Had gone to that land so fair,
  To dwell with beautiful angels,
     And to be forever there.
  But the child was sorely puzzled,
     Why dear grandmamma should go
  To dwell in a stranger city,
     When her children loved her so.
  But again the mystic angel
     Came with swift and silent tread,
  And our sister, Jamie's mother,
     Was enrolled among the dead.
  To us the mystery deepened,
     To Jamie it seemed more clear;
  Grandma, he said, must be lonesome,
     And mamma has gone to her.
  But the question lies unanswered
     In our little Jamie's mind,
  Why she should go to our mother,
     And leave her children behind;
  To dwell in that lovely city,
     From all that was dear to part,
  From children who loved to nestle
     So closely around her heart.
  Dear child, like you, we are puzzled,
     With problems that still remain;
  But think in the great hereafter
     Their meaning will all be plain.
  TRUTH.
  A rock, for ages, stern and high,
  Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,
  And never bowed his haughty crest
  When angry storms around him prest.
  Morn, springing from the arms of night,
  Had often bathed his brow with light.
  And kissed the shadows from his face
  With tender love and gentle grace.
  Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
  Smiled on him from the distant West,
  And from her throne the dark-browed Night
  Threw round his path her softest light.
  And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
  Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
  He bared his brow to every blast
  And scorned the tempest as it passed.
  One day a tiny, humble seed--
  The keenest eye would hardly heed--
  Fell trembling at that stern rock's base,
  And found a lowly hiding-place.
  A ray of light, and drop of dew,
  Came with a message, kind and true;
  They told her of the world so bright,
  Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
  And lured her from her hiding-place,
  To gaze upon earth's glorious face.
  So, peeping timid from the ground,
  She clasped the ancient rock around,
  And climbing up with childish grace,
  She held him with a close embrace;
  Her clinging was a thing of dread;
  Where'er she touched a fissure spread,
  And he who'd breasted many a storm
  Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
  A Truth, dropped in the silent earth,
  May seem a thing of little worth,
  Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
  It saps its pillars proud and strong,
  And o'er the fallen ruin weaves
  The brightest blooms and fairest leaves.
  DEATH OF THE OLD SEA KING.
  'Twas a fearful night--the tempest raved
     With loud and wrathful pride,
  The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds,
     And rode on the raging tide.
  The sea-king lay on his bed of death,
     Pale mourners around him bent;
  They knew the wild and fitful life
     Of their chief was almost spent.
  His ear was growing dull in death
     When the angry storm he heard,
  The sluggish blood in the old man's veins
     With sudden vigor stirred.
  "I hear them call," cried the dying man,
     His eyes grew full of light;
  "Now bring me here my warrior robes,
     My sword and armor bright.
  "In the tempest's lull I heard a voice,
     I knew 'twas Odin's call.
  The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed
     To lead me unto his hall.
  "Bear me unto my noblest ship,
     Light up a funeral pyre;
  I'll walk to the palace of the braves
     Through a path of flame and fire."
  Oh! wild and bright was the stormy light
     That flashed from the old man's eye,
  As they bore him from the couch of death
     To his battle-ship to die,
  And lit with many a mournful torch
     The sea-king's dying bed,
  And like a banner fair and bright
     The flames around him spread.
  But they heard no cry of anguish
     Break through that fiery wall,
  With rigid brow and silent lips
     He was seeking Odin's hall.
  Through a path of fearful splendor,
     While strong men held their breath,
  The brave old man went boldly forth
     And calmly talked with death.
  SAVE THE BOYS.
  Like Dives in the deeps of Hell
  I cannot break this fearful spell,
  Nor quench the fires I've madly nursed,
  Nor cool this dreadful raging thirst.
  Take back your pledge--ye come too late!
  Ye cannot save me from my fate,
  Nor bring me back departed joys;
  But ye can try to save the boys.
  Ye bid me break my fiery chain,
  Arise and be a man again,
  When every street with snares is spread,
  And nets of sin where'er I tread.
  No; I must reap as I did sow.
  The seeds of sin bring crops of woe;
  But with my latest breath I'll crave
  That ye will try the boys to save.
  These bloodshot eyes were once so bright;
  This sin-crushed heart was glad and light;
  But by the wine-cup's ruddy glow
  I traced a path to shame and woe.
  A captive to my galling chain,
  I've tried to rise, but tried in vain--
  The cup allures and then destroys.
  Oh! from its thraldom save the boys.
  Take from your streets those traps of hell
  Into whose gilded snares I fell.
  Oh! freemen, from these foul decoys
  Arise, and vote to save the boys.
  Oh, ye who license men to trade
  In draughts that charm and then degrade,
  Before ye hear the cry, Too late,
  Oh, save the boys from my sad fate.
  NOTHING AND SOMETHING.
  It is nothing to me, the beauty said,
  With a careless toss of her pretty head;
  The man is weak if he can't refrain
  From the cup you say is fraught with pain.
  It was something to her in after years,
  When her eyes were drenched with burning
        tears,
  And she watched in lonely grief and dread,
  And startled to hear a staggering tread.
  It is nothing to me, the mother said;
  I have no fear that my boy will tread
  In the downward path of sin and shame,
  And crush my heart and darken his name.
  It was something to her when that only son
  From the path of right was early won,
  And madly cast in the flowing bowl
  A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.
  It is nothing to me, the young man cried:
  In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride;
  I heed not the dreadful things ye tell:
  I can rule myself I know full well.
  It was something to him when in prison he lay
  The victim of drink, life ebbing away;
  And thought of his wretched child and wife,
  And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.
  It is nothing to me, the merchant said,
  As over his ledger he bent his head;
  I'm busy to-day with tare and tret,
  And I have no time to fume and fret.
  It was something to him when over the wire
  A message came from a funeral pyre--
  A drunken conductor had wrecked a train,
  And his wife and child were among the slain.
  It is nothing to me, the voter said,
  The party's loss is my greatest dread;
  Then gave his vote for the liquor trade,
  Though hearts were crushed and drunkards
        made.
  It was something to him in after life,
  When his daughter became a drunkard's wife
  And her hungry children cried for bread,
  And trembled to hear their father's tread.
  Is it nothing for us to idly sleep
  While the cohorts of death their vigils keep?
  To gather the young and thoughtless in,
  And grind in our midst a grist of sin?
  It is something, yes, all, for us to stand
  Clasping by faith our Saviour's hand;
  To learn to labor, live and fight
  On the side of God and changeless light.
  VASHTI.
  She leaned her head upon her hand
     And heard the King's decree--
  "My lords are feasting in my halls;
     Bid Vashti come to me.
  "I've shown the treasures of my house,
     My costly jewels rare,
  But with the glory of her eyes
     No rubies can compare.
  "Adorn'd and crown'd I'd have her come,
     With all her queenly grace,
  And, 'mid my lords and mighty men,
     Unveil her lovely face.
  "Each gem that sparkles in my crown,
     Or glitters on my throne,
  Grows poor and pale when she appears,
     My beautiful, my own!"
  All waiting stood the chamberlains
     To hear the Queen's reply.
  They saw her cheek grow deathly pale,
     But light flash'd to her eye:
  "Go, tell the King," she proudly said,
     "That I am Persia's Queen,
  And by his crowds of merry men
     I never will be seen.
  "I'll take the crown from off my head
     And tread it 'neath my feet,
  Before their rude and careless gaze
     My shrinking eyes shall meet.
  "A queen unveil'd before the crowd!--
     Upon each lip my name!--
  Why, Persia's women all would blush
     And weep for Vashti's shame!
  "Go back!" she cried, and waved her hand,
     And grief was in her eye:
  "Go, tell the King," she sadly said,
     "That I would rather die."
  They brought her message to the King;
     Dark flash'd his angry eye;
  'Twas as the lightning ere the storm
     Hath swept in fury by.
  Then bitterly outspoke the King,
     Through purple lips of wrath--
  "What shall be done to her who dares
     To cross your monarch's path?"
  Then spake his wily counsellors--
     "O King of this fair land!
  From distant Ind to Ethiop,
     All bow to thy command.
  "But if, before thy servants' eyes,
     This thing they plainly see,
  That Vashti doth not heed thy will
     Nor yield herself to thee,
  "The women, restive 'neath our rule,
     Would learn to scorn our name,
  And from her deed to us would come
     Reproach and burning shame.
  "Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand
     This stern but just decree,
  That Vashti lay aside her crown,
     Thy Queen no more to be."
  She heard again the King's command,
     And left her high estate;
  Strong in her earnest womanhood,
     She calmly met her fate,
  And left the palace of the King,
     Proud of her spotless name--
  A woman who could bend to grief,
     But would not bow to shame.
  THANK GOD FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.
  Thank God for little children,
     Bright flowers by earth's wayside,
  The dancing, joyous lifeboats
     Upon life's stormy tide.
  Thank God for little children;
     When our skies are cold and gray,
  They come as sunshine to our hearts,
     And charm our cares away.
  I almost think the angels,
     Who tend life's garden fair,
  Drop down the sweet wild blossoms
     That bloom around us here.
  It seems a breath of heaven
     Round many a cradle lies,
  And every little baby
     Brings a message from the skies.
  Dear mothers, guard these jewels.
     As sacred offerings meet,
  A wealth of household treasures
     To lay at Jesus' feet.
  THE MARTYR OF ALABAMA.
       "Tim Thompson, a little negro boy, was asked
  to dance for the amusement of some white
  toughs.  He refused, saying he was a church
  member. One of the men knocked him
  down with a club and then danced upon his
  prostrate form. He then shot the boy in the
  hip. The boy is dead; his murderer is still at
  large."--News Item.
  He lifted up his pleading eyes,
     And scanned each cruel face,
  Where cold and brutal cowardice
     Had left its evil trace.
  It was when tender memories
     Round Beth'lem's manger lay,
  (49)
  And mothers told their little ones
     Of Jesu's natal day.
  And of the Magi from the East
     Who came their gifts to bring,
  And bow in rev'rence at the feet
     Of Salem's new-born King.
  And how the herald angels sang
     The choral song of peace,
  That war should close his wrathful lips,
     And strife and carnage cease.
  At such an hour men well may hush
     Their discord and their strife,
  And o'er that manger clasp their hands
     With gifts to brighten life.
  Alas! that in our favored land,
     That cruelty and crime
  Should cast their shadows o'er a day.
     The fairest pearl of time.
  A dark-browed boy had drawn anear
     A band of savage men,
  Just as a hapless lamb might stray
     Into a tiger's den.
  Cruel and dull, they saw in him
     For sport an evil chance,
  And then demanded of the child
     To give to them a dance.
  "Come dance for us," the rough men said;
     "I can't," the child replied,
  "I cannot for the dear Lord's sake,
     Who for my sins once died."
  Tho' they were strong and he was weak,
     He wouldn't his Lord deny.
  His life lay in their cruel hands,
     But he for Christ could die.
  Heard they aright? Did that brave child
     Their mandates dare resist?
  Did he against their stern commands
     Have courage to insist?
  Then recklessly a man (?) arose,
     And dealt a fearful blow.
  He crushed the portals of that life,
     And laid the brave child low.
  And trampled on his prostrate form,
     As on a broken toy;
  Then danced with careless, brutal feet,
     Upon the murdered boy.
  Christians! behold that martyred child!
     His blood cries from the ground;
  Before the sleepless eye of God,
     He shows each gaping wound.
  Oh! Church of Christ arise! arise!
     Lest crimson stain thy hand,
  When God shall inquisition make
     For blood shed in the land.
  Take sackcloth of the darkest hue,
     And shroud the pulpits round;
  Servants of him who cannot lie
     Sit mourning on the ground.
  Let holy horror blanch each brow,
     Pale every cheek with fears,
  And rocks and stones, if ye could speak,
     Ye well might melt to tears.
  Through every fane send forth a cry,
     Of sorrow and regret,
  Nor in an hour of careless ease
     Thy brother's wrongs forget.
  Veil not thine eyes, nor close thy lips,
     Nor speak with bated breath;
  This evil shall not always last,
     The end of it is death.
  Avert the doom that crime must bring
     Upon a guilty land;
  Strong in the strength that God supplies,
     For truth and justice stand.
  For Christless men, with reckless hands,
     Are sowing round thy path
  The tempests wild that yet shall break
     In whirlwinds of God's wrath.
  THE NIGHT OF DEATH.
  Twas a night of dreadful horror,--
     Death was sweeping through the land;
  And the wings of dark destruction
     Were outstretched from strand to strand
  Strong men's hearts grew faint with terror,
     As the tempest and the waves
  Wrecked their homes and swept them downward,
  Suddenly to yawning graves.
  'Mid the wastes of ruined households,
     And the tempest's wild alarms,
  Stood a terror-stricken mother
     With a child within her arms.
  Other children huddled 'round her,
     Each one nestling in her heart;
  Swift in thought and swift in action,
     She at least from one must part.
  Then she said unto her daughter,
     "Strive to save one child from death."
  "Which one?" said the anxious daughter,
     As she stood with bated breath.
  Oh! the anguish of that mother;
     What despair was in her eye!
  All her little ones were precious;
     Which one should she leave to die?
  Then outspake the brother Bennie:
     "I will take the little one."
  "No," exclaimed the anxious mother;
     "No, my child, it can't be done."
  "See! my boy, the waves are rising,
     Save yourself and leave the child!"
  "I will trust in Christ," he answered;
     Grasped the little one and smiled.
  Through the roar of wind and waters
     Ever and anon she cried;
  But throughout the night of terror
     Never Bennie's voice replied.
  But above the waves' wild surging
     He had found a safe retreat,
  As if God had sent an angel,
     Just to guide his wandering feet.
  When the storm had spent its fury,
     And the sea gave up its dead
  She was mourning for her loved ones,
     Lost amid that night of dread.
  While her head was bowed in anguish,
     On her ear there fell a voice,
  Bringing surcease to her sorrow,
     Bidding all her heart rejoice.
  "Didn't I tell you true?" said Bennie,
     And his eyes were full of light,
  "When I told you God would help me
     Through the dark and dreadful night?"
  And he placed the little darling
     Safe within his mother's arms,
  Feeling Christ had been his guardian,
     'Mid the dangers and alarms.
  Oh! for faith so firm and precious,
     In the darkest, saddest night,
  Till life's gloom-encircled shadows
     Fade in everlasting light.
  And upon the mount of vision
     We our loved and lost shall greet,
  With earth's wildest storms behind us,
     And its cares beneath our feet.
  MOTHER'S TREASURES.
  Two little children sit by my side,
     I call them Lily and Daffodil;
  I gaze on them with a mother's pride,
     One is Edna, the other is Will.
  Both have eyes of starry light,
     And laughing lips o'er teeth of pearl.
  I would not change for a diadem
    My noble boy and darling girl.
  To-night my heart o'erflows with joy;
     I hold them as a sacred trust;
  I fain would hide them in my heart,
     Safe from tarnish of moth and rust.
  What should I ask for my dear boy?
     The richest gifts of wealth or fame?
  What for my girl?  A loving heart
     And a fair and a spotless name?
  What for my boy?  That he should stand
     A pillar of strength to the state?
  What for my girl?  That she should be
     The friend of the poor and desolate?
  I do not ask they shall never tread
     With weary feet the paths of pain.
  I ask that in the darkest hour
     They may faithful and true remain.
  I only ask their lives may be
     Pure as gems in the gates of pearl,
  Lives to brighten and bless the world--
     This I ask for my boy and girl.
  I ask to clasp their hands again
     'Mid the holy hosts of heaven,
  Enraptured say: "I am here, oh! God,
     "And the children Thou hast given."
  THE REFINER'S GOLD.
  He stood before my heart's closed door,
     And asked to enter in;
  But I had barred the passage o'er
     By unbelief and sin.
  He came with nail-prints in his hands,
     To set my spirit free;
  With wounded feet he trod a path
     To come and sup with me.
  He found me poor and brought me gold,
     The fire of love had tried,
  And garments whitened by his blood,
     My wretchedness to hide.
  The glare of life had dimmed my eyes,
     Its glamour was too bright.
  He came with ointment in his hands
     To heal my darkened sight.
  He knew my heart was tempest-tossed,
     By care and pain oppressed;
  He whispered to my burdened heart,
     Come unto me and rest.
  He found me weary, faint and worn,
     On barren mountains cold;
  With love's constraint he drew me on,
     To shelter in his fold.
  Oh! foolish heart, how slow wert thou
     To welcome thy dear guest,
  To change thy weariness and care
     For comfort, peace and rest.
  Close to his side, oh! may I stay,
     Just to behold his face,
  Till I shall wear within my soul
     The image of his grace.
  The grace that changes hearts of stone
     To tenderness and love,
  And bids us run with willing feet
     Unto his courts above.
  A STORY OF THE REBELLION.
  The treacherous sands had caught our boat,
     And held it with a strong embrace
  And death at our imprisoned crew
     Was sternly looking face to face.
  With anxious hearts, but failing strength,
     We strove to push the boat from shore;
  But all in vain, for there we lay
     With bated breath and useless oar.
  Around us in a fearful storm
     The fiery hail fell thick and fast;
  And we engirded by the sand,
     Could not return the dreadful blast.
  When one arose upon whose brow
     The ardent sun had left his trace,
  A noble purpose strong and high
     Uplighting all his dusky face.
  Perchance within that fateful hour
     The wrongs of ages thronged apace;
  But with it came the glorious hope
     Of swift deliverance to his race.
  Of galling chains asunder rent,
     Of severed hearts again made one,
  Of freedom crowning all the land
     Through battles gained and victories won.
  "Some one," our hero firmly said,
     "Must die to get us out of this;"
  Then leaped upon the strand and bared
     His bosom to the bullets' hiss.
  "But ye are soldiers, and can fight,
     May win in battles yet unfought;
  I have no offering but my life,
     And if they kill me it is nought."
  With steady hands he grasped the boat,
     And boldly pushed it from the shore;
  Then fell by rebel bullets pierced,
     His life work grandly, nobly o'er.
  Our boat was rescued from the sands
     And launched in safety on the tide;
  But he our comrade good and grand,
     In our defence had bravely died.
  BURIAL OF SARAH.
  He stood before the sons of Heth,
     And bowed his sorrowing head;
  "I've come," he said, "to buy a place
     Where I may lay my dead.
  "I am a stranger in your land,
     My home has lost its light;
  Grant me a place where I may lay
     My dead away from sight."
  Then tenderly the sons of Heth
     Gazed on the mourner's face,
  And said, "Oh, Prince, amid our dead,
     Choose thou her resting-place.
  "The sepulchres of those we love,
     We place at thy command;
  Against the plea thy grief hath made
     We close not heart nor hand."
  The patriarch rose and bowed his head,
     And said, "One place I crave;
  'Tis at the end of Ephron's field,
     And called Machpelah's cave.
  "Entreat him that he sell to me
     For her last sleep that cave;
  I do not ask for her I loved
     The freedom of a grave."
  The son of Zohar answered him,
     "Hearken, my lord, to me;
  Before our sons, the field and cave
     I freely give to thee."
  "I will not take it as a gift,"
     The grand old man then said;
  "I pray thee let me buy the place
     Where I may lay my dead."
  And with the promise in his heart,
     His seed should own that land,
  He gave the shekels for the field
     He took from Ephron's hand.
  And saw afar the glorious day
     His chosen seed should tread,
  The soil where he in sorrow lay
     His loved and cherished dead.
  GOING EAST.
  She came from the East a fair, young bride,
     With a light and a bounding heart,
  To find in the distant West a home
     With her husband to make a start.
  He builded his cabin far away,
     Where the prairie flower bloomed wild;
  Her love made lighter all his toil,
     And joy and hope around him smiled.
  She plied her hands to life's homely tasks,
     And helped to build his fortunes up;
  While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet,
     Were mingled and mixed in her cup.
  He sowed in his fields of golden grain,
     All the strength of his manly prime;
  Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees,
     Was as sweet as the dollar's chime.
  She toiled and waited through weary years
     For the fortune that came at length;
  But toil and care and hope deferred,
     Had stolen and wasted her strength.
  The cabin changed to a stately home,
     Rich carpets were hushing her tread;
  But light was fading from her eye,
     And the bloom from her cheek had fled.
  Slower and heavier grew her step,
     While his gold and his gains increased;
  But his proud domain had not the charm
     Of her humble home in the East.
  Within her eye was a restless light,
     And a yearning that never ceased,
  A longing to see the dear old home
     She had left in the distant East.
  A longing to clasp her mother's hand,
     And nestle close to her heart,
  And to feel the heavy cares of life
     Like the sun-kissed shadows depart.
  Her husband was adding field to field,
     And new wealth to his golden store;
  And little thought the shadow of death
     Was entering in at his door.
  He had no line to sound the depths
     Of her tears repressed and unshed;
  Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart
     Could be starving, but not for bread.
  The hungry heart was stilled at last;
     Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.
  A lonely man sat by the bier
     Of a corpse that was going East.
  THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE.
  From Rome's palaces and villas
     Gaily issued forth a throng;
  From her humbler habitations
     Moved a human tide along.
  Haughty dames and blooming maidens,
     Men who knew not mercy's sway,
  Thronged into the Coliseum
     On that Roman holiday.
  From the lonely wilds of Asia,
     From her jungles far away,
  From the distant torrid regions,
     Rome had gathered beasts of prey.
  Lions restless, roaring, rampant,
     Tigers with their stealthy tread,
  Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery,
     Met in conflict wild and dread.
  Fierce and fearful was the carnage
     Of the maddened beasts of prey,
  As they fought and rent each other
     Urged by men more fierce than they.
  Till like muffled thunders breaking
     On a vast and distant shore,
  Fainter grew the yells of tigers,
     And the lions' dreadful roar.
  On the crimson-stained arena
     Lay the victims of the fight;
  Eyes which once had glared with anguish,
     Lost in death their baleful light.
  Then uprose the gladiators
     Armed for conflict unto death,
  Waiting for the prefect's signal,
     Cold and stern with bated breath.
  "Ave Caesar, morituri,
     Te, salutant," rose the cry
  From the lips of men ill-fated,
     Doomed to suffer and to die.
  Then began the dreadful contest,
     Lives like chaff were thrown away,
  Rome with all her pride and power
     Butchered for a holiday.
  Eagerly the crowd were waiting,
     Loud the clashing sabres rang;
  When between the gladiators
     All unarmed a hermit sprang.
  "Cease your bloodshed," cried the hermit,
     "On this carnage place your ban;"
  But with flashing swords they answered,
     "Back unto your place, old man."
  From their path the gladiators
     Thrust the strange intruder back,
  Who between their hosts advancing
     Calmly parried their attack.
  All undaunted by their weapons,
     Stood the old heroic man;
  While a maddened cry of anger
     Through the vast assembly ran.
  "Down with him," cried out the people,
     As with thumbs unbent they glared,
  Till the prefect gave the signal
     That his life should not be spared.
  Men grew wild with wrathful passion,
     When his fearless words were said
  Cruelly they fiercely showered
     Stones on his devoted head.
  Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit,
     Victor in that hour of strife;
  Gaining in his death a triumph
     That he could not win in life.
  Had he uttered on the forum
     Struggling thoughts within him born,
  Men had jeered his words as madness,
     But his deed they could not scorn.
  Not in vain had been his courage,
     Nor for naught his daring deed;
  From his grave his mangled body
     Did for wretched captives plead.
  From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful,
     Ceased her sport in human gore;
  And into her Coliseum
     Gladiators came no more.
  SONGS FOR THE PEOPLE.
  Let me make the songs for the people,
     Songs for the old and young;
  Songs to stir like a battle-cry
     Wherever they are sung.
  Not for the clashing of sabres,
     For carnage nor for strife;
  But songs to thrill the hearts of men
     With more abundant life.
  Let me make the songs for the weary,
     Amid life's fever and fret,
  Till hearts shall relax their tension,
     And careworn brows forget.
  Let me sing for little children,
     Before their footsteps stray,
  Sweet anthems of love and duty,
     To float o'er life's highway.
  I would sing for the poor and aged,
     When shadows dim their sight;
  Of the bright and restful mansions,
     Where there shall be no night.
  Our world, so worn and weary,
     Needs music, pure and strong,
  To hush the jangle and discords
     Of sorrow, pain, and wrong.
  Music to soothe all its sorrow,
     Till war and crime shall cease;
  And the hearts of men grown tender
     Girdle the world with peace.
  LET THE LIGHT ENTER.
  The dying words of Goethe.
  "Light! more light! the shadows deepen,
     And my life is ebbing low,
  Throw the windows widely open:
     Light! more light! before I go.
  "Softly let the balmy sunshine
     Play around my dying bed,
  E'er the dimly lighted valley
     I with lonely feet must tread.
  "Light! more light! for Death is weaving
     Shadows 'round my waning sight,
  And I fain would gaze upon him
     Through a stream of earthly light."
  Not for greater gifts of genius;
     Not for thoughts more grandly bright,
  All the dying poet whispers
     Is a prayer for light, more light.
  Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
     Fading slowly from his sight;
  All the poet's aspirations
     Centre in that prayer for light.
  Gracious Saviour, when life's day-dreams
     Melt and vanish from the sight,
  May our dim and longing vision
     Then be blessed with light, more light.
  AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN.
  You can sigh o'er the sad-eyed Armenian
     Who weeps in her desolate home.
  You can mourn o'er the exile of Russia
     From kindred and friends doomed to roam.
  You can pity the men who have woven
     From passion and appetite chains
  To coil with a terrible tension
     Around their heartstrings and brains.
  You can sorrow o'er little children
     Disinherited from their birth,
  The wee waifs and toddlers neglected,
     Robbed of sunshine, music and mirth.
  For beasts you have gentle compassion;
     Your mercy and pity they share.
  For the wretched, outcast and fallen
     You have tenderness, love and care.
  But hark! from our Southland are floating
     Sobs of anguish, murmurs of pain,
  And women heart-stricken are weeping
     Over their tortured and their slain.
  On their brows the sun has left traces;
     Shrink not from their sorrow in scorn.
  When they entered the threshold of being
     The children of a King were born.
  Each comes as a guest to the table
     The hand of our God has outspread,
  To fountains that ever leap upward,
     To share in the soil we all tread.
  When ye plead for the wrecked and fallen,
     The exile from far-distant shores,
  Remember that men are still wasting
     Life's crimson around your own doors.
  Have ye not, oh, my favored sisters,
     Just a plea, a prayer or a tear,
  For mothers who dwell 'neath the shadows
     Of agony, hatred and fear?
  Men may tread down the poor and lowly,
     May crush them in anger and hate,
  But surely the mills of God's justice
     Will grind out the grist of their fate.
  Oh, people sin-laden and guilty,
     So lusty and proud in your prime,
  The sharp sickles of God's retribution
     Will gather your harvest of crime.
  Weep not, oh my well-sheltered sisters,
     Weep not for the Negro alone,
  But weep for your sons who must gather
     The crops which their fathers have sown.
  Go read on the tombstones of nations
     Of chieftains who masterful trod,
  The sentence which time has engraven,
     That they had forgotten their God.
  'Tis the judgment of God that men reap
     The tares which in madness they sow,
  Sorrow follows the footsteps of crime,
     And Sin is the consort of Woe.
  THEN AND NOW.
  "Build me a nation," said the Lord.
  The distant nations heard the word,
  Build me a nation true and strong,
  Bar out the old world's hate and wrong;
  For men had traced with blood and tears
  The trail of weary wasting years,
  And torn and bleeding martyrs trod
  Through fire and torture up to God.
  While in the hollow of his hand
  God hid the secret of our land,
  Men warred against their fiercest foes,
  And kingdoms fell and empires rose,
  Till, weary of the old world strife,
  Men sought for broader, freer life,
  And plunged into the ocean's foam
  To find another, better home.
  And, like a vision fair and bright
  The new world broke upon their sight.
  Men grasped the prize, grew proud and strong,
  And cursed the land with crime and wrong.
  The Indian stood despoiled of lands,
  The Negro bound with servile bands,
  Oppressed through weary years of toil,
  His blood and tears bedewed the soil.
  Then God arose in dreadful wrath,
  And judgment streamed around his path;
  His hand the captive's fetters broke,
  His lightnings shattered every yoke.
  As Israel through the Red sea trod,
  Led by the mighty hand of God,
  They passed to freedom through a flood,
  Whose every wave and surge was blood.
  And slavery, with its crime and shame,
  Went down in wrath and blood and flame
  The land was billowed-o'er with graves
  Where men had lived and died as slaves.
  Four and thirty years--what change since
        then!
  Beings once chattles now are men;
  Over the gloom of slavery's night,
  Has flashed the dawn of freedom's light.
  To-day no mother with anguish wild
  Kneels and implores that her darling child
  Shall not be torn from her bleeding heart,
  With its quivering tendrils rent apart.
  The father may soothe his child to sleep,
  And watch his slumbers calm and deep.
  No tyrant's tread will disturb his rest
  Where freedom dwells as a welcome guest.
  His walls may be bare of pictured grace,
  His fireside the lowliest place;
  But the wife and children sheltered there
  Are his to defend and guard with care.
  Where haughty tyrants once bore rule
  Are ballot-box and public school.
  The old slave-pen of former days
  Gives place to fanes of prayer and praise.
  To-night we would bring our meed of praise
  To noble friends of darker days;
  The men and women crowned with light,
  The true and tried in our gloomy night.
  To Lundy, whose heart was early stirred
  To speak for freedom an earnest word;
  To Garrison, valiant, true and strong,
  Whose face was as flint against our wrong.
  And Phillips, the peerless, grand and brave,
  A tower of strength to the outcast slave.
  Earth has no marble too pure and white
  To enrol his name in golden light.
  Our Douglass, too, with his massive brain,
  Who plead our cause with his broken chain,
  And helped to hurl from his bloody seat
  The curse that writhed and died at his feet.
  And Governor Andrew, who, looking back,
  Saw none he despised, though poor and black;
  And Harriet Beecher, whose glowing pen
  Corroded the chains of fettered men.
  To-night with greenest laurels we'll crown
  North Elba's grave where sleeps John Brown,
  Who made the gallows an altar high,
  And showed how a brave old man could die.
  And Lincoln, our martyred President,
  Who returned to his God with chains he had rent.*
  And Sumner, amid death's icy chill,
  Leaving to Hoar his Civil Rights Bill.
  And let us remember old underground,
  With all her passengers northward bound,
  The train that ran till it ceased to pay,
  With all her dividends given away.
  Nor let it be said that we have forgot
  The women who stood with Lucretia Mott;
  Nor her who to the world was known
  By the simple name of Lucy stone.
  A tribute unto a host of others
  Who knew that men though black were
        brothers,
  Who battled against our nation's sin,
  Whose graves are thick whose ranks are thin.
  Oh, people chastened in the fire,
  To nobler, grander things aspire;
  In the new era of your life,
  Bring love for hate, and peace for strife;
  Upon your hearts this vow record
  That ye will build unto the Lord
  A nobler future, true and grand,
  To strengthen, crown and bless the land.
  A higher freedom ye may gain
  Than that which comes from a riven chain;
  Freedom your native land to bless
  With peace, and love and righteousness,
  As dreams that are past, a tale all told,
  Are the days when men were bought and sold;
  Now God be praised from sea to sea,
  Our flag floats o'er a country free.
  MACEO.
  Maceo dead! a thrill of sorrow
     Through our hearts in sadness ran
  When we felt in one sad hour
     That the world had lost a man.
  He had clasped unto his bosom
   The sad fortunes of his land--
  Held the cause for which he perished
     With a firm, unfaltering hand.
  On his lips the name of freedom
     Fainted with his latest breath.
  Cuba Libre was his watchword
     Passing through the gates of death.
  With the light of God around us,
     Why this agony and strife?
  With the cross of Christ before us,
     Why this fearful waste of life?
  Must the pathway unto freedom
     Ever mark a crimson line,
  And the eyes of wayward mortals
     Always close to light divine?
  Must the hearts of fearless valor
     Fail 'mid crime and cruel wrong,
  When the world has read of heroes
     Brave and earnest, true and strong?
  Men to stay the floods of sorrow
     Sweeping round each war-crushed heart;
  Men to say to strife and carnage--
     From our world henceforth depart.
  God of peace and God of nations,
     Haste! oh, haste the glorious day
  When the reign of our Redeemer
     O'er the world shall have its sway.
  When the swords now blood encrusted,
     Spears that reap the battle field,
  Shall be changed to higher service,
     Helping earth rich harvests yield.
  Where the widow weeps in anguish,
     And the orphan bows his head,
  Grant that peace and joy and gladness
     May like holy angels tread.
  Pity, oh, our God the sorrow
     Of thy world from thee astray,
  Lead us from the paths of madness
     Unto Christ the living way.
  Year by year the world grows weary
     'Neath its weight of sin and strife,
  Though the hands once pierced and bleeding
     Offer more abundant life.
  May the choral song of angels
     Heard upon Judea's plain
  Sound throughout the earth the tidings
     Of that old and sweet refrain.
  Till our world, so sad and weary,
     Finds the balmy rest of peace--
  Peace to silence all her discords--
     Peace till war and crime shall cease.
  Peace to fall like gentle showers,
     Or on parchéd flowers dew,
  Till our hearts proclaim with gladness:
     Lo, He maketh all things new.
  "FISHERS OF MEN."
  I had a dream, a varied dream:
     Before my ravished sight
  The city of my Lord arose,
     With all its love and light.
  The music of a myriad harps
     Flowed out with sweet accord;
  And saints were casting down their crowns
     In homage to our Lord.
  My heart leaped up with untold joy,
     Life's toil and pain were o'er;
  My weary feet at last had found
     The bright and restful shore.
  Just as I reached the gates of light,
     Ready to enter in,
  From earth arose a fearful cry
     Of sorrow and of sin.
  I turned, and saw behind me surge
     A wild and stormy sea;
  And drowning men were reaching out
     Imploring hands to me.
  And ev'ry lip was blanched with dread,
     And moaning for relief;
  The music of the golden harps
     Grew fainter for their grief.
  Let me return, I quickly said,
     Close to the pearly gate;
  My work is with these wretched ones,
     So wrecked and desolate.
  An angel smiled and gently said:
     This is the gate of life,
  Wilt thou return to earth's sad scenes,
     Its weariness and strife,
  To comfort hearts that sigh and break,
     To dry the falling tear,
  Wilt thou forego the music sweet
     Entrancing now thy ear?
  I must return, I firmly said,
     The strugglers in that sea
  Shall not reach out beseeching hands
     In vain for help to me.
  I turned to go; but as I turned
     The gloomy sea grew bright,
  And from my heart there seemed to flow
     Ten thousand cords of light.
  And sin-wrecked men, with eager hands
     Did grasp each golden cord;
  And with my heart I drew them on
     To see my gracious Lord.
  Again I stood beside the gate.
     My heart was glad and free;
  For with me stood a rescued throng
     The Lord had given me.
  THE LOST BELLS.
  Year after year the artist wrought
     With earnest, loving care,
  The music flooding all his soul
     To pour upon the air.
  For this no metal was too rare,
     He counted not the cost;
  Nor deemed the years in which he toiled
     As labor vainly lost.
  When morning flushed with crimson light
     The golden gates of day,
  He longed to fill the air with chimes
     Sweet as a matin's lay.
  And when the sun was sinking low
     Within the distant West,
  He gladly heard the bells he wrought
     Herald the hour of rest.
  The music of a thousand harps
     Could never be so dear
  As when those solemn chants and thrills
     Fell on his list'ning ear.
  He poured his soul into their chimes,
     And felt his toil repaid;
  He called them children of his soul,
     His home a'near them made.
  But evil days came on apace,
     War spread his banner wide,
  And from his village snatched away
     The artist's love and pride.
  At dewy morn and stilly eve
     The chimes no more he heard;
  With dull and restless agony
     His spirit's depths was stirred.
  A weary longing filled his soul,
     It bound him like a spell;
  He left his home to seek the chimes--
     The chimes he loved so well.
  Where lofty fanes in grandeur rose,
     Upon his ear there fell
  No music like the long lost chimes
     Of his beloved bell.
  And thus he wandered year by year.
     Touched by the hand of time,
  Seeking to hear with anxious heart
     Each well remembered chime.
  And to that worn and weary heart
     There came a glad surcease:
  He heard again the dear old chimes,
     And smiled and uttered peace.
  "The chimes! the chimes!" the old man cried,
     "I hear their tones at last;"
  A sudden rapture filled his heart,
     And all his cares were past.
  Yes, peace had come with death's sweet calm,
     His journeying was o'er,
  The weary, restless wanderer
     Had reached the restful shore.
  It may be that he met again,
     Enfolded in the air,
  The dear old chimes beside the gates
     Where all is bright and fair;
  That he who crossed and bowed his head
     When Angelus was sung
  In clearer light touched golden harps
     By angel fingers strung.
  "DO NOT CHEER, MEN ARE DYING," SAID
  CAPT. PHILLIPS, IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR.
  Do not cheer, for men are dying
     From their distant homes in pain;
  And the restless sea is darkened
     By a flood of crimson rain.
  Do not cheer, for anxious mothers
     Wait and watch in lonely dread;
  Vainly waiting for the footsteps
     Never more their paths to tread.
  Do not cheer, while little children
     Gather round the widowed wife,
  Wondering why an unknown people
     Sought their own dear father's life.
  Do not cheer, for aged fathers
     Bend above their staves and weep,
  While the ocean sings the requiem
     Where their fallen children sleep.
  Do not cheer, for lips are paling
     On which lay the mother's kiss;
  'Mid the dreadful roar of battle
     How that mother's hand they miss!
  Do not cheer: once joyous maidens,
     Who the mazy dance did tread,
  Bow their heads in bitter anguish,
     Mourning o'er their cherished dead.
  Do not cheer while maid and matron
     In this strife must bear a part;
  While the blow that strikes a soldier
     Reaches to some woman's heart.
  Do not cheer till arbitration
     O'er the nations holds its sway,
  And the century now closing
     Ushers in a brighter day.
  Do not cheer until the nation
     Shall more wise and thoughtful grow
  Than to staunch a stream of sorrow
     By an avalanche of woe.
  Do not cheer until each nation
     Sheathes the sword and blunts the spear,
  And we sing aloud for gladness:
     Lo, the reign of Christ is here,
  And the banners of destruction
     From the battlefield are furled,
  And the peace of God descending
     Rests upon a restless world.
  THE BURDENS OF ALL.
  We may sigh o'er the heavy burdens
     Of the black, the brown and white;
  But if we all clasped hands together
     The burdens would be more light.
  How to solve life's saddest problems,
     Its weariness, want and woe,
  Was answered by One who suffered
     In Palestine long ago.
  He gave from his heart this precept,
     To ease the burdens of men,
  "As ye would that others do to you
     Do ye even so to them."
  Life's heavy, wearisome burdens
     Will change to a gracious trust
  When men shall learn in the light of God
     To be merciful and just.
  Where war has sharpened his weapons,
     And slavery masterful had,
  Let white and black and brown unite
     To build the kingdom of God.
  And never attempt in madness
     To build a kingdom or state,
  Through greed of gold or lust of power,
     On the crumbling stones of hate.
  The burdens will always he heavy,
     The sunshine fade into night,
  Till mercy and justice shall cement
     The black, the brown and the white.
  And earth shall answer with gladness,
     The herald angel's refrain,
  When "Peace on earth, good will to men"
     Was the burden of their strain.

ERE SLEEP COMES DOWN TO SOOTHE THE WEARY EYES
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    Which all the day with ceaseless care have sought
  The magic gold which from the seeker flies;
    Ere dreams put on the gown and cap of thought,
  And make the waking world a world of lies,--
    Of lies most palpable, uncouth, forlorn,
  That say life's full of aches and tears and sighs,--
    Oh, how with more than dreams the soul is torn,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    How all the griefs and heart-aches we have known
  Come up like pois'nous vapors that arise
    From some base witch's caldron, when the crone,
  To work some potent spell, her magic plies.
    The past which held its share of bitter pain,
  Whose ghost we prayed that Time might exorcise,
    Comes up, is lived and suffered o'er again,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    What phantoms fill the dimly lighted room;
  What ghostly shades in awe-creating guise
    Are bodied forth within the teeming gloom.
  What echoes faint of sad and soul-sick cries,
    And pangs of vague inexplicable pain
  That pay the spirit's ceaseless enterprise,
    Come thronging through the chambers of the brain,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    Where ranges forth the spirit far and free?
  Through what strange realms and unfamiliar skies
    Tends her far course to lands of mystery?
  To lands unspeakable--beyond surmise,
    Where shapes unknowable to being spring,
  Till, faint of wing, the Fancy fails and dies
    Much wearied with the spirit's journeying,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    How questioneth the soul that other soul,--
  The inner sense which neither cheats nor lies,
    But self exposes unto self, a scroll
  Full writ with all life's acts unwise or wise,
    In characters indelible and known;
  So, trembling with the shock of sad surprise,
    The soul doth view its awful self alone,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes,
    The last dear sleep whose soft embrace is balm,
  And whom sad sorrow teaches us to prize
    For kissing all our passions into calm,
  Ah, then, no more we heed the sad world's cries,
    Or seek to probe th' eternal mystery,
  Or fret our souls at long-withheld replies,
    At glooms through which our visions cannot see,
  When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes.
THE POET AND HIS SONG
  A song is but a little thing,
  And yet what joy it is to sing!
  In hours of toil it gives me zest,
  And when at eve I long for rest;
  When cows come home along the bars,
    And in the fold I hear the bell,
  As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,
    I sing my song, and all is well.
  There are no ears to hear my lays,
  No lips to lift a word of praise;
  But still, with faith unfaltering,
  I live and laugh and love and sing.
  What matters yon unheeding throng?
    They cannot feel my spirit's spell,
  Since life is sweet and love is long,
    I sing my song, and all is well.
  My days are never days of ease;
  I till my ground and prune my trees.
  When ripened gold is all the plain,
  I put my sickle to the grain.
  I labor hard, and toil and sweat,
    While others dream within the dell;
  But even while my brow is wet,
    I sing my song, and all is well.
  Sometimes the sun, unkindly hot,
  My garden makes a desert spot;
  Sometimes a blight upon the tree
  Takes all my fruit away from me;
  And then with throes of bitter pain
    Rebellious passions rise and swell;
  But--life is more than fruit or grain,
    And so I sing, and all is well.
RETORT
  "Thou art a fool," said my head to my heart,
  "Indeed, the greatest of fools thou art,
    To be led astray by the trick of a tress,
  By a smiling face or a ribbon smart;"
    And my heart was in sore distress.
  Then Phyllis came by, and her face was fair,
  The light gleamed soft on her raven hair;
    And her lips were blooming a rosy red.
  Then my heart spoke out with a right bold air:
    "Thou art worse than a fool, O head!"
ACCOUNTABILITY
  Folks ain't got no right to censuah othah folks about dey habits;
  Him dat giv' de squir'ls de bushtails made de bobtails fu' de rabbits.
  Him dat built de gread big mountains hollered out de little valleys,
  Him dat made de streets an' driveways wasn't shamed to make de alleys.
  We is all constructed diff'ent, d'ain't no two of us de same;
  We cain't he'p ouah likes an' dislikes, ef we'se bad we ain't to blame.
  Ef we 'se good, we need n't show off, case you bet it ain't ouah doin'
  We gits into su'ttain channels dat we jes' cain't he'p pu'suin'.
  But we all fits into places dat no othah ones could fill,
  An' we does the things we has to, big er little, good er ill.
  John cain't tek de place o' Henry, Su an' Sally ain't alike;
  Bass ain't nuthin' like a suckah, chub ain't nuthin' like a pike.
  When you come to think about it, how it 's all planned out it 's splendid.
  Nuthin 's done er evah happens, 'dout hit 's somefin' dat 's intended;
  Don't keer whut you does, you has to, an' hit sholy beats de dickens,--
  Viney, go put on de kittle, I got one o' mastah's chickens.
FREDERICK DOUGLASS
  A hush is over all the teeming lists,
    And there is pause, a breath-space in the strife;
  A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists
    And vapors that obscure the sun of life.
  And Ethiopia, with bosom torn,
  Laments the passing of her noblest born.
  She weeps for him a mother's burning tears--
    She loved him with a mother's deepest love.
  He was her champion thro' direful years,
    And held her weal all other ends above.
  When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust,
  He raised her up and whispered, "Hope and Trust."
  For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung
    That broke in warning on the ears of men;
  For her the strong bow of his power he strung,
    And sent his arrows to the very den
  Where grim Oppression held his bloody place
  And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.
  And he was no soft-tongued apologist;
    He spoke straightforward, fearlessly uncowed;
  The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist,
    And set in bold relief each dark hued cloud;
  To sin and crime he gave their proper hue,
  And hurled at evil what was evil's due.
  Through good and ill report he cleaved his way.
    Right onward, with his face set toward the heights,
  Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array,--
    The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites.
  He dared the lightning in the lightning's track,
  And answered thunder with his thunder back.
  When men maligned him, and their torrent wrath
    In furious imprecations o'er him broke,
  He kept his counsel as he kept his path;
    'T was for his race, not for himself he spoke.
  He knew the import of his Master's call,
  And felt himself too mighty to be small.
  No miser in the good he held was he,--
    His kindness followed his horizon's rim.
  His heart, his talents, and his hands were free
    To all who truly needed aught of him.
  Where poverty and ignorance were rife,
  He gave his bounty as he gave his life.
  The place and cause that first aroused his might
    Still proved its power until his latest day.
  In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right
    Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray;
  Wrong lived; his occupation was not gone.
  He died in action with his armor on!
  We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,
    And felt the magic of his presence nigh,
  The current that he sent throughout the land,
    The kindling spirit of his battle-cry.
  O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet,
  And place our banner where his hopes were set!
  Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,
    But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale!
  Thou 'st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar,
    And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.
  She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,
  She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,
  And, rising from beneath the chast'ning rod,
  She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!
LIFE
  A crust of bread and a corner to sleep in,
  A minute to smile and an hour to weep in,
  A pint of joy to a peck of trouble,
  And never a laugh but the moans come double;
          And that is life!
  A crust and a corner that love makes precious,
  With a smile to warm and the tears to refresh us;
  And joy seems sweeter when cares come after,
  And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter;
          And that is life!
THE LESSON
  My cot was down by a cypress grove,
    And I sat by my window the whole night long,
  And heard well up from the deep dark wood
    A mocking-bird's passionate song.
  And I thought of myself so sad and lone,
    And my life's cold winter that knew no spring;
  Of my mind so weary and sick and wild,
    Of my heart too sad to sing.
  But e'en as I listened the mock-bird's song,
    A thought stole into my saddened heart,
  And I said, "I can cheer some other soul
    By a carol's simple art."
  For oft from the darkness of hearts and lives
    Come songs that brim with joy and light,
  As out of the gloom of the cypress grove
    The mocking-bird sings at night.
  So I sang a lay for a brother's ear
    In a strain to soothe his bleeding heart,
  And he smiled at the sound of my voice and lyre,
    Though mine was a feeble art.
  But at his smile I smiled in turn,
    And into my soul there came a ray:
  In trying to soothe another's woes
    Mine own had passed away.
THE RISING OF THE STORM
    The lake's dark breast
    Is all unrest,
  It heaves with a sob and a sigh.
    Like a tremulous bird,
    From its slumber stirred,
  The moon is a-tilt in the sky.
    From the silent deep
    The waters sweep,
  But faint on the cold white stones,
    And the wavelets fly
    With a plaintive cry
  O'er the old earth's bare, bleak bones.
    And the spray upsprings
    On its ghost-white wings,
  And tosses a kiss at the stars;
    While a water-sprite,
    In sea-pearls dight,
  Hums a sea-hymn's solemn bars.
    Far out in the night,
    On the wavering sight
  I see a dark hull loom;
    And its light on high,
    Like a Cyclops' eye,
  Shines out through the mist and gloom.
    Now the winds well up
    From the earth's deep cup,
  And fall on the sea and shore,
    And against the pier
    The waters rear
  And break with a sullen roar.
    Up comes the gale,
    And the mist-wrought veil
  Gives way to the lightning's glare,
    And the cloud-drifts fall,
    A sombre pall,
  O'er water, earth, and air.
    The storm-king flies,
    His whip he plies,
  And bellows down the wind.
    The lightning rash
    With blinding flash
  Comes pricking on behind.
    Rise, waters, rise,
    And taunt the skies
  With your swift-flitting form.
    Sweep, wild winds, sweep,
    And tear the deep
  To atoms in the storm.
    And the waters leapt,
    And the wild winds swept,
  And blew out the moon in the sky,
    And I laughed with glee,
    It was joy to me
  As the storm went raging by!
SUNSET
  The river sleeps beneath the sky,
    And clasps the shadows to its breast;
  The crescent moon shines dim on high;
    And in the lately radiant west
      The gold is fading into gray.
      Now stills the lark his festive lay,
      And mourns with me the dying day.
  While in the south the first faint star
    Lifts to the night its silver face,
  And twinkles to the moon afar
    Across the heaven's graying space,
  Low murmurs reach me from the town,
  As Day puts on her sombre crown,
  And shakes her mantle darkly down.
THE OLD APPLE-TREE
  There's a memory keeps a-runnin'
    Through my weary head to-night,
  An' I see a picture dancin'
    In the fire-flames' ruddy light;
  'Tis the picture of an orchard
    Wrapped in autumn's purple haze,
  With the tender light about it
    That I loved in other days.
  An' a-standin' in a corner
    Once again I seem to see
  The verdant leaves an' branches
    Of an old apple-tree.
  You perhaps would call it ugly,
    An' I don't know but it's so,
  When you look the tree all over
    Unadorned by memory's glow;
  For its boughs are gnarled an' crooked,
    An' its leaves are gettin' thin,
  An' the apples of its bearin'
    Would n't fill so large a bin
  As they used to. But I tell you,
    When it comes to pleasin' me,
  It's the dearest in the orchard,--
    Is that old apple-tree.
  I would hide within its shelter,
    Settlin' in some cosy nook,
  Where no calls nor threats could stir me
    From the pages o' my book.
  Oh, that quiet, sweet seclusion
    In its fulness passeth words!
  It was deeper than the deepest
    That my sanctum now affords.
  Why, the jaybirds an' the robins,
    They was hand in glove with me,
  As they winked at me an' warbled
    In that old apple-tree.
  It was on its sturdy branches
    That in summers long ago
  I would tie my swing an' dangle
    In contentment to an' fro,
  Idly dreamin' childish fancies,
    Buildin' castles in the air,
  Makin' o' myself a hero
    Of romances rich an' rare.
  I kin shet my eyes an' see it
    Jest as plain as plain kin be,
  That same old swing a-danglin'
    To the old apple-tree.
  There's a rustic seat beneath it
    That I never kin forget.
  It's the place where me an' Hallie--
    Little sweetheart--used to set,
  When we 'd wander to the orchard
    So 's no listenin' ones could hear
  As I whispered sugared nonsense
    Into her little willin' ear.
  Now my gray old wife is Hallie,
    An' I 'm grayer still than she,
  But I 'll not forget our courtin'
    'Neath the old apple-tree.
  Life for us ain't all been summer,
    But I guess we 'we had our share
  Of its flittin' joys an' pleasures,
    An' a sprinklin' of its care.
  Oft the skies have smiled upon us;
    Then again we 've seen 'em frown,
  Though our load was ne'er so heavy
    That we longed to lay it down.
  But when death does come a-callin',
    This my last request shall be,--
  That they 'll bury me an' Hallie
    'Neath the old apple tree.
A PRAYER
  O Lord, the hard-won miles
    Have worn my stumbling feet:
  Oh, soothe me with thy smiles,
    And make my life complete.
  The thorns were thick and keen
    Where'er I trembling trod;
  The way was long between
    My wounded feet and God.
  Where healing waters flow
    Do thou my footsteps lead.
  My heart is aching so;
    Thy gracious balm I need.
PASSION AND LOVE
  A maiden wept and, as a comforter,
  Came one who cried, "I love thee," and he seized
  Her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath,
  That dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks.
  While evermore his boldly blazing eye
  Burned into hers; but she uncomforted
  Shrank from his arms and only wept the more.
  Then one came and gazed mutely in her face
  With wide and wistful eyes; but still aloof
  He held himself; as with a reverent fear,
  As one who knows some sacred presence nigh.
  And as she wept he mingled tear with tear,
  That cheered her soul like dew a dusty flower,--
  Until she smiled, approached, and touched his hand!
THE SEEDLING
  As a quiet little seedling
    Lay within its darksome bed,
  To itself it fell a-talking,
    And this is what it said:
  "I am not so very robust,
    But I 'll do the best I can;"
  And the seedling from that moment
    Its work of life began.
  So it pushed a little leaflet
    Up into the light of day,
  To examine the surroundings
    And show the rest the way.
  The leaflet liked the prospect,
    So it called its brother, Stem;
  Then two other leaflets heard it,
    And quickly followed them.
  To be sure, the haste and hurry
    Made the seedling sweat and pant;
  But almost before it knew it
    It found itself a plant.
  The sunshine poured upon it,
    And the clouds they gave a shower;
  And the little plant kept growing
    Till it found itself a flower.
  Little folks, be like the seedling,
    Always do the best you can;
  Every child must share life's labor
    Just as well as every man.
  And the sun and showers will help you
    Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
  Till you raise to light and beauty
    Virtue's fair, unfading flowers.
PROMISE
  I grew a rose within a garden fair,
  And, tending it with more than loving care,
  I thought how, with the glory of its bloom,
  I should the darkness of my life illume;
  And, watching, ever smiled to see the lusty bud
  Drink freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood.
  My rose began to open, and its hue
  Was sweet to me as to it sun and dew;
  I watched it taking on its ruddy flame
  Until the day of perfect blooming came,
  Then hasted I with smiles to find it blushing red--
  Too late! Some thoughtless child had plucked my rose and fled!
FULFILMENT.
  I grew a rose once more to please mine eyes.
  All things to aid it--dew, sun, wind, fair skies--
  Were kindly; and to shield it from despoil,
  I fenced it safely in with grateful toil.
  No other hand than mine shall pluck this flower, said I,
  And I was jealous of the bee that hovered nigh.
  It grew for days; I stood hour after hour
  To watch the slow unfolding of the flower,
  And then I did not leave its side at all,
  Lest some mischance my flower should befall.
  At last, oh joy! the central petals burst apart.
  It blossomed--but, alas! a worm was at its heart!
SONG
    My heart to thy heart,
      My hand to thine;
    My lip to thy lips,
      Kisses are wine
  Brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade;
  Let me drink deep, then, my African maid.
    Lily to lily,
      Rose unto rose;
    My love to thy love
      Tenderly grows.
  Rend not the oak and the ivy in twain,
  Nor the swart maid from her swarthier swain.
AN ANTE-BELLUM SERMON
  We is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs,
    In dis howlin' wildaness,
  Fu' to speak some words of comfo't
    To each othah in distress.
  An' we chooses fu' ouah subjic'
    Dis--we'll 'splain it by an' by;
    "An' de Lawd said, 'Moses, Moses,'
    An' de man said, 'Hyeah am I.'"
  Now ole Pher'oh, down in Egypt,
    Was de wuss man evah bo'n,
  An' he had de Hebrew chillun
    Down dah wukin' in his co'n;
  'T well de Lawd got tiahed o' his foolin',
    An' sez he: "I' ll let him know--
  Look hyeah, Moses, go tell Pher'oh
    Fu' to let dem chillun go."
  "An' ef he refuse to do it,
    I will make him rue de houah,
  Fu' I'll empty down on Egypt
    All de vials of my powah."
  Yes, he did--an' Pher'oh's ahmy
    Wasn't wuth a ha'f a dime;
  Fu' de Lawd will he'p his chillun,
    You kin trust him evah time.
  An' yo' enemies may 'sail you
    In de back an' in de front;
  But de Lawd is all aroun' you,
    Fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.
  Dey kin fo'ge yo' chains an' shackles
    F'om de mountains to de sea;
  But de Lawd will sen' some Moses
    Fu' to set his chillun free.
  An' de lan' shall hyeah his thundah,
    Lak a blas' f'om Gab'el's ho'n,
  Fu' de Lawd of hosts is mighty
    When he girds his ahmor on.
  But fu' feah some one mistakes me,
    I will pause right hyeah to say,
  Dat I 'm still a-preachin' ancient,
    I ain't talkin' 'bout to-day.
  But I tell you, fellah christuns,
    Things'll happen mighty strange;
  Now, de Lawd done dis fu' Isrul,
    An' his ways don't nevah change,
  An' de love he showed to Isrul
    Was n't all on Isrul spent;
  Now don't run an' tell yo' mastahs
    Dat I's preachin' discontent.
  'Cause I isn't; I'se a-judgin'
    Bible people by deir ac's;
  I 'se a-givin' you de Scriptuah,
    I 'se a-handin' you de fac's.
  Cose ole Pher'oh b'lieved in slav'ry,
    But de Lawd he let him see,
  Dat de people he put bref in,--
    Evah mothah's son was free.
  An' dahs othahs thinks lak Pher'oh,
    But dey calls de Scriptuah liar,
  Fu' de Bible says "a servant
    Is a-worthy of his hire."
  An' you cain't git roun' nor thoo dat,
    An' you cain't git ovah it,
  Fu' whatevah place you git in,
    Dis hyeah Bible too 'll fit.
  So you see de Lawd's intention,
    Evah sence de worl' began,
  Was dat His almighty freedom
    Should belong to evah man,
  But I think it would be bettah,
    Ef I'd pause agin to say,
  Dat I'm talkin' 'bout ouah freedom
    In a Bibleistic way.
  But de Moses is a-comin',
    An' he's comin', suah and fas'
  We kin hyeah his feet a-trompin',
    We kin hyeah his trumpit blas'.
  But I want to wa'n you people,
    Don't you git too brigity;
  An' don't you git to braggin'
    'Bout dese things, you wait an' see.
  But when Moses wif his powah
    Comes an' sets us chillun free,
  We will praise de gracious Mastah.
    Dat has gin us liberty;
  An' we 'll shout ouah halleluyahs,
    On dat mighty reck'nin' day,
  When we 'se reco'nised ez citiz'--
    Huh uh! Chillun, let us pray!
ODE TO ETHIOPIA
  O Mother Race! to thee I bring
  This pledge of faith unwavering,
    This tribute to thy glory.
  I know the pangs which thou didst feel,
  When Slavery crushed thee with its heel,
    With thy dear blood all gory.
  Sad days were those--ah, sad indeed!
  But through the land the fruitful seed
    Of better times was growing.
  The plant of freedom upward sprung,
  And spread its leaves so fresh and young--
    Its blossoms now are blowing.
  On every hand in this fair land,
  Proud Ethiope's swarthy children stand
    Beside their fairer neighbor;
  The forests flee before their stroke,
  Their hammers ring, their forges smoke,--
    They stir in honest labour.
  They tread the fields where honour calls;
  Their voices sound through senate halls
    In majesty and power.
  To right they cling; the hymns they sing
  Up to the skies in beauty ring,
    And bolder grow each hour.
  Be proud, my Race, in mind and soul;
  Thy name is writ on Glory's scroll
    In characters of fire.
  High 'mid the clouds of Fame's bright sky
  Thy banner's blazoned folds now fly,
    And truth shall lift them higher.
  Thou hast the right to noble pride,
  Whose spotless robes were purified
    By blood's severe baptism.
  Upon thy brow the cross was laid,
  And labour's painful sweat-beads made
    A consecrating chrism.
  No other race, or white or black,
  When bound as thou wert, to the rack,
    So seldom stooped to grieving;
  No other race, when free again,
  Forgot the past and proved them men
    So noble in forgiving.
  Go on and up! Our souls and eyes
  Shall follow thy continuous rise;
    Our ears shall list thy story
  From bards who from thy root shall spring,
  And proudly tune their lyres to sing
    Of Ethiopia's glory.
THE CORN-STALK FIDDLE
  When the corn 's all cut and the bright stalks shine
    Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;
  When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,
    And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;
  Then it's heigho! fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,
  For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.
  And you take a stalk that is straight and long,
    With an expert eye to its worthy points,
  And you think of the bubbling strains of song
    That are bound between its pithy joints--
  Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,
  With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.
  Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow
    O'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!
  And the music's flow never loud but low
    Is the concert note of a fairy band.
  Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle
  To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.
  When the eve comes on, and our work is done,
    And the sun drops down with a tender glance,
  With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,
    Come the neighbor girls for the evening's dance,
  And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle--
  More time than tune--from the corn-stalk fiddle.
  Then brother Jabez takes the bow,
    While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,
  Then Henry stops by Milly Snow,
    And John takes Nellie Jones's hand,
  While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,
  And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.
  "Salute your partners," comes the call,
    "All join hands and circle round,"
  "Grand train back," and "Balance all,"
    Footsteps lightly spurn the ground.
  "Take your lady and balance down the middle"
  To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.
  So the night goes on and the dance is o'er,
    And the merry girls are homeward gone,
  But I see it all in my sleep once more,
    And I dream till the very break of dawn
  Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle
  To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.
THE MASTER-PLAYER
  An old, worn harp that had been played
  Till all its strings were loose and frayed,
  Joy, Hate, and Fear, each one essayed,
  To play. But each in turn had found
  No sweet responsiveness of sound.
  Then Love the Master-Player came
  With heaving breast and eyes aflame;
  The Harp he took all undismayed,
  Smote on its strings, still strange to song,
  And brought forth music sweet and strong.
THE MYSTERY
  I was not; now I am--a few days hence
  I shall not be; I fain would look before
  And after, but can neither do; some Power
  Or lack of power says "no" to all I would.
  I stand upon a wide and sunless plain,
  Nor chart nor steel to guide my steps aright.
  Whene'er, o'ercoming fear, I dare to move,
  I grope without direction and by chance.
  Some feign to hear a voice and feel a hand
  That draws them ever upward thro' the gloom.
  But I--I hear no voice and touch no hand,
  Tho' oft thro' silence infinite I list,
  And strain my hearing to supernal sounds;
  Tho' oft thro' fateful darkness do I reach,
  And stretch my hand to find that other hand.
  I question of th' eternal bending skies
  That seem to neighbor with the novice earth;
  But they roll on, and daily shut their eyes
  On me, as I one day shall do on them,
  And tell me not the secret that I ask.
NOT THEY WHO SOAR
  Not they who soar, but they who plod
  Their rugged way, unhelped, to God
  Are heroes; they who higher fare,
  And, flying, fan the upper air,
  Miss all the toil that hugs the sod.
  'Tis they whose backs have felt the rod,
  Whose feet have pressed the path unshod,
  May smile upon defeated care,
    Not they who soar.
  High up there are no thorns to prod,
  Nor boulders lurking 'neath the clod
  To turn the keenness of the share,
  For flight is ever free and rare;
  But heroes they the soil who 've trod,
    Not they who soar!
WHITTIER
  Not o'er thy dust let there be spent
  The gush of maudlin sentiment;
  Such drift as that is not for thee,
  Whose life and deeds and songs agree,
  Sublime in their simplicity.
  Nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed.
  O singer sweet, thou art not dead!
  In spite of time's malignant chill,
  With living fire thy songs shall thrill,
  And men shall say, "He liveth still!"
  Great poets never die, for Earth
  Doth count their lives of too great worth
  To lose them from her treasured store;
  So shalt thou live for evermore--
  Though far thy form from mortal ken--
  Deep in the hearts and minds of men.
TWO SONGS
  A bee that was searching for sweets one day
  Through the gate of a rose garden happened to stray.
  In the heart of a rose he hid away,
  And forgot in his bliss the light of day,
  As sipping his honey he buzzed in song;
  Though day was waning, he lingered long,
    For the rose was sweet, so sweet.
  A robin sits pluming his ruddy breast,
  And a madrigal sings to his love in her nest:
  "Oh, the skies they are blue, the fields are green,
  And the birds in your nest will soon be seen!"
  She hangs on his words with a thrill of love,
  And chirps to him as he sits above
    For the song is sweet, so sweet.
  A maiden was out on a summer's day
  With the winds and the waves and the flowers at play;
  And she met with a youth of gentle air,
  With the light of the sunshine on his hair.
  Together they wandered the flowers among;
  They loved, and loving they lingered long,
    For to love is sweet, so sweet.
       *       *       *       *       *
  Bird of my lady's bower,
    Sing her a song;
  Tell her that every hour,
    All the day long,
  Thoughts of her come to me,
    Filling my brain
  With the warm ecstasy
    Of love's refrain.
  Little bird! happy bird!
    Being so near,
  Where e'en her slightest word
    Thou mayest hear,
  Seeing her glancing eyes,
    Sheen of her hair,
  Thou art in paradise,--
    Would I were there.
  I am so far away,
    Thou art so near;
  Plead with her, birdling gay,
  Plead with my dear.
  Rich be thy recompense,
    Fine be thy fee,
  If through thine eloquence
    She hearken me.
A BANJO SONG
  Oh, dere 's lots o' keer an' trouble
    In dis world to swaller down;
  An' ol' Sorrer 's purty lively
    In her way o' gittin' roun'.
  Yet dere's times when I furgit em,--
    Aches an' pains an' troubles all,--
  An' it's when I tek at ebenin'
    My ol' banjo f'om de wall.
  'Bout de time dat night is fallin'
    An' my daily wu'k is done,
  An' above de shady hilltops
    I kin see de settin' sun;
  When de quiet, restful shadders
    Is beginnin' jes' to fall,--
  Den I take de little banjo
    F'om its place upon de wall.
  Den my fam'ly gadders roun' me
    In de fadin' o' de light,
  Ez I strike de strings to try 'em
    Ef dey all is tuned er-right.
  An' it seems we 're so nigh heaben
    We kin hyeah de angels sing
  When de music o' dat banjo
    Sets my cabin all er-ring.
  An' my wife an' all de othahs,--
    Male an' female, small an' big,--
  Even up to gray-haired granny,
    Seem jes' boun' to do a jig;
  'Twell I change de style o' music,
    Change de movement an' de time,
  An' de ringin' little banjo
    Plays an ol' hea't-feelin' hime.
  An' somehow my th'oat gits choky,
    An' a lump keeps tryin' to rise
  Lak it wan'ed to ketch de water
    Dat was flowin' to my eyes;
  An' I feel dat I could sorter
    Knock de socks clean off o' sin
  Ez I hyeah my po' ol' granny
    Wif huh tremblin' voice jine in.
  Den we all th'ow in our voices
    Fu' to he'p de chune out too,
  Lak a big camp-meetin' choiry
    Tryin' to sing a mou'nah th'oo.
  An' our th'oahts let out de music,
    Sweet an' solemn, loud an' free,
  'Twell de raftahs o' my cabin
    Echo wif de melody.
  Oh, de music o' de banjo,
    Quick an' deb'lish, solemn, slow,
  Is de greates' joy an' solace
    Dat a weary slave kin know!
  So jes' let me hyeah it ringin',
    Dough de chune be po' an' rough,
  It's a pleasure; an' de pleasures
    O' dis life is few enough.
  Now, de blessed little angels
    Up in heaben, we are told,
  Don't do nothin' all dere lifetime
    'Ceptin' play on ha'ps o' gold.
  Now I think heaben 'd be mo' homelike
    Ef we 'd hyeah some music fall
  F'om a real ol'-fashioned banjo,
    Like dat one upon de wall.
LONGING
  If you could sit with me beside the sea to-day,
  And whisper with me sweetest dreamings o'er and o'er;
  I think I should not find the clouds so dim and gray,
  And not so loud the waves complaining at the shore.
  If you could sit with me upon the shore to-day,
  And hold my hand in yours as in the days of old,
  I think I should not mind the chill baptismal spray,
  Nor find my hand and heart and all the world so cold.
  If you could walk with me upon the strand to-day,
  And tell me that my longing love had won your own,
  I think all my sad thoughts would then be put away,
  And I could give back laughter for the Ocean's moan!
THE PATH
  There are no beaten paths to Glory's height,
  There are no rules to compass greatness known;
  Each for himself must cleave a path alone,
  And press his own way forward in the fight.
  Smooth is the way to ease and calm delight,
  And soft the road Sloth chooseth for her own;
  But he who craves the flower of life full-blown,
  Must struggle up in all his armor dight!
  What though the burden bear him sorely down
  And crush to dust the mountain of his pride,
  Oh, then, with strong heart let him still abide;
  For rugged is the roadway to renown,
  Nor may he hope to gain the envied crown,
  Till he hath thrust the looming rocks aside.
THE LAWYERS' WAYS
  I 've been list'nin' to them lawyers
    In the court house up the street,
  An' I 've come to the conclusion
    That I'm most completely beat.
  Fust one feller riz to argy,
    An' he boldly waded in
  As he dressed the tremblin' pris'ner
    In a coat o' deep-dyed sin.
  Why, he painted him all over
    In a hue o' blackest crime,
  An' he smeared his reputation
    With the thickest kind o' grime,
  Tell I found myself a-wond'rin',
    In a misty way and dim,
  How the Lord had come to fashion
    Sich an awful man as him.
  Then the other lawyer started,
    An' with brimmin', tearful eyes,
  Said his client was a martyr
    That was brought to sacrifice.
  An' he give to that same pris'ner
    Every blessed human grace,
  Tell I saw the light o' virtue
    Fairly shinin' from his face.
  Then I own 'at I was puzzled
    How sich things could rightly be;
  An' this aggervatin' question
    Seems to keep a-puzzlin' me.
  So, will some one please inform me,
    An' this mystery unroll--
  How an angel an' a devil
    Can persess the self-same soul?
ODE FOR MEMORIAL DAY
  Done are the toils and the wearisome marches,
    Done is the summons of bugle and drum.
  Softly and sweetly the sky over-arches,
    Shelt'ring a land where Rebellion is dumb.
  Dark were the days of the country's derangement,
    Sad were the hours when the conflict was on,
  But through the gloom of fraternal estrangement
    God sent his light, and we welcome the dawn.
  O'er the expanse of our mighty dominions,
    Sweeping away to the uttermost parts,
  Peace, the wide-flying, on untiring pinions,
    Bringeth her message of joy to our hearts.
  Ah, but this joy which our minds cannot measure,
    What did it cost for our fathers to gain!
  Bought at the price of the heart's dearest treasure,
    Born out of travail and sorrow and pain;
  Born in the battle where fleet Death was flying,
    Slaying with sabre-stroke bloody and fell;
  Born where the heroes and martyrs were dying,
    Torn by the fury of bullet and shell.
  Ah, but the day is past: silent the rattle,
    And the confusion that followed the fight.
  Peace to the heroes who died in the battle,
    Martyrs to truth and the crowning of Right!
  Out of the blood of a conflict fraternal,
    Out of the dust and the dimness of death,
  Burst into blossoms of glory eternal
    Flowers that sweeten the world with their breath.
  Flowers of charity, peace, and devotion
    Bloom in the hearts that are empty of strife;
  Love that is boundless and broad as the ocean
    Leaps into beauty and fulness of life.
  So, with the singing of paeans and chorals,
    And with the flag flashing high in the sun,
  Place on the graves of our heroes the laurels
    Which their unfaltering valor has won!
PREMONITION
      Dear heart, good-night!
  Nay, list awhile that sweet voice singing
    When the world is all so bright,
  And the sound of song sets the heart a-ringing,
    Oh, love, it is not right--
    Not then to say, "Good-night."
      Dear heart, good-night!
  The late winds in the lake weeds shiver,
    And the spray flies cold and white.
  And the voice that sings gives a telltale quiver--
    "Ah, yes, the world is bright,
      But, dearest heart, good-night!"
      Dear heart, good-night!
  And do not longer seek to hold me!
    For my soul is in affright
  As the fearful glooms in their pall enfold me.
    See him who sang how white
      And still; so, dear, good-night.
      Dear heart, good-night!
  Thy hand I 'll press no more forever,
    And mine eyes shall lose the light;
  For the great white wraith by the winding river
    Shall check my steps with might.
      So, dear, good-night, good-night!
RETROSPECTION
  When you and I were young, the days
    Were filled with scent of pink and rose,
    And full of joy from dawn till close,
  From morning's mist till evening's haze.
    And when the robin sung his song
    The verdant woodland ways along,
      We whistled louder than he sung.
  And school was joy, and work was sport
  For which the hours were all too short,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, the woods
    Brimmed bravely o'er with every joy
    To charm the happy-hearted boy.
  The quail turned out her timid broods;
    The prickly copse, a hostess fine,
    Held high black cups of harmless wine;
      And low the laden grape-vine swung
  With beads of night-kissed amethyst
  Where buzzing lovers held their tryst,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, the cool
    And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows
    When tumbling o'er the scented mows,
  Or stripping by the dimpling pool,
    Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face,
    Save where we 'd worn an ent'ring place.
      How with our shouts the calm banks rung!
  How flashed the spray as we plunged in,--
  Pure gems that never caused a sin!
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, we heard
    All sounds of Nature with delight,--
    The whirr of wing in sudden flight,
  The chirping of the baby-bird.
    The columbine's red bells were rung;
    The locust's vested chorus sung;
      While every wind his zithern strung
  To high and holy-sounding keys,
  And played sonatas in the trees--
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, we knew
    To shout and laugh, to work and play,
    And night was partner to the day
  In all our joys. So swift time flew
    On silent wings that, ere we wist,
    The fleeting years had fled unmissed;
      And from our hearts this cry was wrung--
  To fill with fond regret and tears
  The days of our remaining years--
    "When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young."
UNEXPRESSED
  Deep in my heart that aches with the repression,
    And strives with plenitude of bitter pain,
  There lives a thought that clamors for expression,
    And spends its undelivered force in vain.
  What boots it that some other may have thought it?
    The right of thoughts' expression is divine;
  The price of pain I pay for it has bought it,
    I care not who lays claim to it--'t is mine!
  And yet not mine until it be delivered;
    The manner of its birth shall prove the test.
  Alas, alas, my rock of pride is shivered--
    I beat my brow--the thought still unexpressed.
SONG OF SUMMER
  Dis is gospel weathah sho'--
    Hills is sawt o' hazy.
  Meddahs level ez a flo'
    Callin' to de lazy.
  Sky all white wif streaks o' blue,
    Sunshine softly gleamin',
  D'ain't no wuk hit's right to do,
    Nothin' 's right but dreamin'.
  Dreamin' by de rivah side
    Wif de watahs glist'nin',
  Feelin' good an' satisfied
    Ez you lay a-list'nin'
  To the little nakid boys
    Splashin' in de watah,
  Hollerin' fu' to spress deir joys
    Jes' lak youngsters ought to.
  Squir'l a-tippin' on his toes,
    So 's to hide an' view you;
  Whole flocks o' camp-meetin' crows
    Shoutin' hallelujah.
  Peckahwood erpon de tree
    Tappin' lak a hammah;
  Jaybird chattin' wif a bee,
    Tryin' to teach him grammah.
  Breeze is blowin' wif perfume,
    Jes' enough to tease you;
  Hollyhocks is all in bloom,
    Smellin' fu' to please you.
  Go 'way, folks, an' let me 'lone,
    Times is gettin' dearah--
  Summah's settin' on de th'one,
    An' I 'm a-layin' neah huh!
SPRING SONG
  A blue-bell springs upon the ledge,
  A lark sits singing in the hedge;
  Sweet perfumes scent the balmy air,
  And life is brimming everywhere.
  What lark and breeze and bluebird sing,
      Is Spring, Spring, Spring!
  No more the air is sharp and cold;
  The planter wends across the wold,
  And, glad, beneath the shining sky
  We wander forth, my love and I.
  And ever in our hearts doth ring
      This song of Spring, Spring!
  For life is life and love is love,
  'Twixt maid and man or dove and dove.
  Life may be short, life may be long,
  But love will come, and to its song
  Shall this refrain for ever cling
      Of Spring, Spring, Spring!
TO LOUISE
  Oh, the poets may sing of their Lady Irenes,
  And may rave in their rhymes about wonderful queens;
  But I throw my poetical wings to the breeze,
  And soar in a song to my Lady Louise.
  A sweet little maid, who is dearer, I ween,
  Than any fair duchess, or even a queen.
  When speaking of her I can't plod in my prose,
  For she 's the wee lassie who gave me a rose.
  Since poets, from seeing a lady's lip curled,
  Have written fair verse that has sweetened the world;
  Why, then, should not I give the space of an hour
  To making a song in return for a flower?
  I have found in my life--it has not been so long--
  There are too few of flowers--too little of song.
  So out of that blossom, this lay of mine grows,
  For the dear little lady who gave me the rose.
  I thank God for innocence, dearer than Art,
  That lights on a by-way which leads to the heart,
  And led by an impulse no less than divine,
  Walks into the temple and sits at the shrine.
  I would rather pluck daisies that grow in the wild,
  Or take one simple rose from the hand of a child,
  Then to breathe the rich fragrance of flowers that bide
  In the gardens of luxury, passion, and pride.
  I know not, my wee one, how came you to know
  Which way to my heart was the right way to go;
  Unless in your purity, soul-clean and clear,
  God whispers his messages into your ear.
  You have now had my song, let me end with a prayer
  That your life may be always sweet, happy, and fair;
  That your joys may be many, and absent your woes,
  O dear little lady who gave me the rose!
THE RIVALS
  'T was three an' thirty year ago,
  When I was ruther young, you know,
  I had my last an' only fight
  About a gal one summer night.
  'T was me an' Zekel Johnson; Zeke
  'N' me 'd be'n spattin' 'bout a week,
  Each of us tryin' his best to show
  That he was Liza Jones's beau.
  We could n't neither prove the thing,
  Fur she was fur too sharp to fling
  One over fur the other one
  An' by so doin' stop the fun
  That we chaps did n't have the sense
  To see she got at our expense,
  But that's the way a feller does,
  Fur boys is fools an' allus was.
  An' when they's females in the game
  I reckon men's about the same.
  Well, Zeke an' me went on that way
  An' fussed an' quarrelled day by day;
  While Liza, mindin' not the fuss,
  Jest kep' a-goin' with both of us,
  Tell we pore chaps, that's Zeke an' me,
  Was jest plum mad with jealousy.
  Well, fur a time we kep' our places,
  An' only showed by frownin' faces
  An' looks 'at well our meanin' boded
  How full o' fight we both was loaded.
  At last it come, the thing broke out,
  An' this is how it come about.
  One night ('t was fair, you'll all agree)
  I got Eliza's company,
  An' leavin' Zekel in the lurch,
  Went trottin' off with her to church.
  An' jest as we had took our seat
  (Eliza lookin' fair an' sweet),
  Why, I jest could n't help but grin
  When Zekel come a-bouncin' in
  As furious as the law allows.
  He 'd jest be'n up to Liza's house,
  To find her gone, then come to church
  To have this end put to his search.
  I guess I laffed that meetin' through,
  An' not a mortal word I knew
  Of what the preacher preached er read
  Er what the choir sung er said.
  Fur every time I 'd turn my head
  I could n't skeercely help but see
  'At Zekel had his eye on me.
  An' he 'ud sort o' turn an' twist
  An' grind his teeth an' shake his fist.
  I laughed, fur la! the hull church seen us,
  An' knowed that suthin' was between us.
  Well, meetin' out, we started hum,
  I sorter feelin' what would come.
  We 'd jest got out, when up stepped Zeke,
  An' said, "Scuse me, I 'd like to speak
  To you a minute." "Cert," said I--
  A-nudgin' Liza on the sly
  An' laughin' in my sleeve with glee,
  I asked her, please, to pardon me.
  We walked away a step er two,
  Jest to git out o' Liza's view,
  An' then Zeke said, "I want to know
  Ef you think you 're Eliza's beau,
  An' 'at I 'm goin' to let her go
  Hum with sich a chap as you?"
  An' I said bold, "You bet I do."
  Then Zekel, sneerin', said 'at he
  Did n't want to hender me.
  But then he 'lowed the gal was his
  An' 'at he guessed he knowed his biz,
  An' was n't feared o' all my kin
  With all my friends an' chums throwed in.
  Some other things he mentioned there
  That no born man could no ways bear
  Er think o' ca'mly tryin' to stan'
  Ef Zeke had be'n the bigges' man
  In town, an' not the leanest runt
  'At time an' labor ever stunt.
  An' so I let my fist go "bim,"
  I thought I 'd mos' nigh finished him.
  But Zekel did n't take it so.
  He jest ducked down an' dodged my blow
  An' then come back at me so hard,
  I guess I must 'a' hurt the yard,
  Er spilet the grass plot where I fell,
  An' sakes alive it hurt me; well,
  It would n't be'n so bad, you see,
  But he jest kep' a-hittin' me.
  An' I hit back an' kicked an' pawed,
  But 't seemed 't was mostly air I clawed,
  While Zekel used his science well
  A-makin' every motion tell.
  He punched an' hit, why, goodness lands,
  Seemed like he had a dozen hands.
  Well, afterwhile they stopped the fuss,
  An' some one kindly parted us.
  All beat an' cuffed an' clawed an' scratched,
  An' needin' both our faces patched,
  Each started hum a different way;
  An' what o' Liza, do you say,
  Why, Liza--little humbug--dern her,
  Why, she 'd gone home with Hiram Turner.
THE LOVER AND THE MOON
  A lover whom duty called over the wave,
    With himself communed: "Will my love be true
    If left to herself? Had I better not sue
  Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?
    But my friend might fail in my need," he said,
    "And I return to find love dead.
    Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,
    I will leave her in charge of the stable moon."
  Then he said to the moon: "O dear old moon,
    Who for years and years from thy thrown above
    Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,
  My heart has but come to its waiting June,
    And the promise time of the budding vine;
    Oh, guard thee well this love of mine."
    And he harked him then while all was still,
    And the pale moon answered and said, "I will."
  And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,
    And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:
    In isles of the south and in Orient lands,
  Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.
    But his star was high, so he braved the main,
    And sailed him blithely home again;
    And with joy he bended his footsteps soon
    To learn of his love from the matron moon.
  She sat as of yore, in her olden place,
    Serene as death, in her silver chair.
    A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,
  And the tint of a blush was on her face.
    At sight of the youth she sadly bowed
    And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.
    She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,
    But "How," spoke the youth, "have you kept your charge?"
  The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;
    The blush went out in her blanching cheek,
    And her voice was timid and low and weak,
  As she made her plea and sighed and wept.
    "Oh, another prayed and another plead,
    And I could n't resist," she answering said;
    "But love still grows in the hearts of men:
    Go forth, dear youth, and love again."
  But he turned him away from her proffered grace.
    "Thou art false, O moon, as the hearts of men,
    I will not, will not love again."
  And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face
    To the sea, and cried: "Sea, curse the moon,
    Who makes her vows and forgets so soon."
    And the awful sea with anger stirred,
    And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.
  And ever the moon wept down in rain,
    And ever her sighs rose high in wind;
    But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,
  And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.
    And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,
    The cries of a wraith through the thunder pierce;
    And the waves strain their awful hands on high
    To tear the false moon from the sky.
CONSCIENCE AND REMORSE
  "Good-bye," I said to my conscience--
    "Good-bye for aye and aye,"
  And I put her hands off harshly,
    And turned my face away;
  And conscience smitten sorely
    Returned not from that day.
  But a time came when my spirit
    Grew weary of its pace;
  And I cried: "Come back, my conscience;
    I long to see thy face."
  But conscience cried: "I cannot;
    Remorse sits in my place."
IONE
I
  Ah, yes, 't is sweet still to remember,
    Though 'twere less painful to forget;
  For while my heart glows like an ember,
    Mine eyes with sorrow's drops are wet,
    And, oh, my heart is aching yet.
  It is a law of mortal pain
    That old wounds, long accounted well,
    Beneath the memory's potent spell,
  Will wake to life and bleed again.
  So 't is with me; it might be better
    If I should turn no look behind,--
  If I could curb my heart, and fetter
    From reminiscent gaze my mind,
    Or let my soul go blind--go blind!
  But would I do it if I could?
    Nay! ease at such a price were spurned;
    For, since my love was once returned,
  All that I suffer seemeth good.
  I know, I know it is the fashion,
    When love has left some heart distressed,
  To weight the air with wordful passion;
    But I am glad that in my breast
    I ever held so dear a guest.
  Love does not come at every nod,
    Or every voice that calleth "hasten;"
    He seeketh out some heart to chasten,
  And whips it, wailing, up to God!
  Love is no random road wayfarer
    Who where he may must sip his glass.
  Love is the King, the Purple-Wearer,
    Whose guard recks not of tree or grass
    To blaze the way that he may pass.
  What if my heart be in the blast
    That heralds his triumphant way;
    Shall I repine, shall I not say:
  "Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!"
  In life, each heart holds some sad story--
    The saddest ones are never told.
  I, too, have dreamed of fame and glory,
    And viewed the future bright with gold;
    But that is as a tale long told.
  Mine eyes have lost their youthful flash,
    My cunning hand has lost its art;
    I am not old, but in my heart
  The ember lies beneath the ash.
  I loved! Why not? My heart was youthful,
    My mind was filled with healthy thought.
  He doubts not whose own self is truthful,
    Doubt by dishonesty is taught;
    So loved I boldly, fearing naught.
  I did not walk this lowly earth;
    Mine was a newer, higher sphere,
    Where youth was long and life was dear,
  And all save love was little worth.
  Her likeness! Would that I might limn it,
    As Love did, with enduring art;
  Nor dust of days nor death may dim it,
    Where it lies graven on my heart,
    Of this sad fabric of my life a part.
  I would that I might paint her now
    As I beheld her in that day,
    Ere her first bloom had passed away,
  And left the lines upon her brow.
  A face serene that, beaming brightly,
    Disarmed the hot sun's glances bold.
  A foot that kissed the ground so lightly,
    He frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,
    But loved her still though he was old.
  A form where every maiden grace
    Bloomed to perfection's richest flower,--
    The statued pose of conscious power,
  Like lithe-limbed Dian's of the chase.
  Beneath a brow too fair for frowning,
    Like moon-lit deeps that glass the skies
  Till all the hosts above seem drowning,
    Looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,
    With gaze serene and purely wise.
  And over all, her tresses rare,
    Which, when, with his desire grown weak,
    The Night bent down to kiss her cheek,
  Entrapped and held him captive there.
  This was Ione; a spirit finer
    Ne'er burned to ash its house of clay;
  A soul instinct with fire diviner
    Ne'er fled athwart the face of day,
    And tempted Time with earthly stay.
  Her loveliness was not alone
    Of face and form and tresses' hue:
    For aye a pure, high soul shone through
  Her every act: this was Ione.
II
  'T was in the radiant summer weather,
    When God looked, smiling, from the sky;
  And we went wand'ring much together
    By wood and lane, Ione and I,
    Attracted by the subtle tie
  Of common thoughts and common tastes,
    Of eyes whose vision saw the same,
    And freely granted beauty's claim
  Where others found but worthless wastes.
  We paused to hear the far bells ringing
    Across the distance, sweet and clear.
  We listened to the wild bird's singing
    The song he meant for his mate's ear,
    And deemed our chance to do so dear.
  We loved to watch the warrior Sun,
    With flaming shield and flaunting crest,
    Go striding down the gory West,
  When Day's long fight was fought and won.
  And life became a different story;
    Where'er I looked, I saw new light.
  Earth's self assumed a greater glory,
    Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.
    Then first I saw the need and might
  Of that fair band, the singing throng,
    Who, gifted with the skill divine,
    Take up the threads of life, spun fine,
  And weave them into soulful song.
  They sung for me, whose passion pressing
    My soul, found vent in song nor line.
  They bore the burden of expressing
    All that I felt, with art's design,
    And every word of theirs was mine.
  I read them to Ione, ofttimes,
    By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,
    And she looked deeply in mine eyes,
  And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.
  Her life was like the stream that floweth,
    And mine was like the waiting sea;
  Her love was like the flower that bloweth,
    And mine was like the searching bee--
    I found her sweetness all for me.
  God plied him in the mint of time,
    And coined for us a golden day,
    And rolled it ringing down life's way
  With love's sweet music in its chime.
  And God unclasped the Book of Ages,
    And laid it open to our sight;
  Upon the dimness of its pages,
    So long consigned to rayless night,
    He shed the glory of his light.
  We read them well, we read them long,
    And ever thrilling did we see
    That love ruled all humanity,--
  The master passion, pure and strong.
III
  To-day my skies are bare and ashen,
    And bend on me without a beam.
  Since love is held the master-passion,
    Its loss must be the pain supreme--
    And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.
  But pardon, dear departed Guest,
    I will not rant, I will not rail;
    For good the grain must feel the flail;
  There are whom love has never blessed.
  I had and have a younger brother,
    One whom I loved and love to-day
  As never fond and doting mother
    Adored the babe who found its way
    From heavenly scenes into her day.
  Oh, he was full of youth's new wine,--
    A man on life's ascending slope,
    Flushed with ambition, full of hope;
  And every wish of his was mine.
  A kingly youth; the way before him
    Was thronged with victories to be won;
  So joyous, too, the heavens o'er him
    Were bright with an unchanging sun,--
    His days with rhyme were overrun.
  Toil had not taught him Nature's prose,
    Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,
    And sorrow had not made him wise;
  His life was in the budding rose.
  I know not how I came to waken,
    Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;
  My heart by some vague thrill was shaken,--
    A thrill so true and yet so slight,
    I hardly deemed I read aright.
  As when a sleeper, ign'rant why,
    Not knowing what mysterious hand
    Has called him out of slumberland,
  Starts up to find some danger nigh.
  Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,
    But, having come, asserts his right;
  He will not be repressed nor hidden.
    And so my brother's dawning plight
    Became uncovered to my sight.
  Some sound-mote in his passing tone
    Caught in the meshes of my ear;
    Some little glance, a shade too dear,
  Betrayed the love he bore Ione.
  What could I do? He was my brother,
    And young, and full of hope and trust;
  I could not, dared not try to smother
    His flame, and turn his heart to dust.
    I knew how oft life gives a crust
  To starving men who cry for bread;
    But he was young, so few his days,
    He had not learned the great world's ways,
  Nor Disappointment's volumes read.
  However fair and rich the booty,
    I could not make his loss my gain.
  For love is dear, but dearer duty,
    And here my way was clear and plain.
  I saw how I could save him pain.
  And so, with all my day grown dim,
    That this loved brother's sun might shine,
    I joined his suit, gave over mine,
  And sought Ione, to plead for him.
  I found her in an eastern bower,
    Where all day long the am'rous sun
  Lay by to woo a timid flower.
    This day his course was well-nigh run,
    But still with lingering art he spun
  Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.
    The vines waved soft and green above,
    And there where one might tell his love,
  I told my griefs--I told her all!
  I told her all, and as she hearkened,
    A tear-drop fell upon her dress.
  With grief her flushing brow was darkened;
    One sob that she could not repress
    Betrayed the depths of her distress.
  Upon her grief my sorrow fed,
    And I was bowed with unlived years,
    My heart swelled with a sea of tears,
  The tears my manhood could not shed.
  The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,
    Disporting in the hour of doom.
  God made us men; times make the hero--
    But in that awful space of gloom
    I gave no thought but sorrow's room.
  All--all was dim within that bower,
    What time the sun divorced the day;
    And all the shadows, glooming gray,
  Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.
  She could not speak--no word was needed;
    Her look, half strength and half despair,
  Told me I had not vainly pleaded,
    That she would not ignore my prayer.
    And so she turned and left me there,
  And as she went, so passed my bliss;
    She loved me, I could not mistake--
    But for her own and my love's sake,
  Her womanhood could rise to this!
  My wounded heart fled swift to cover,
    And life at times seemed very drear.
  My brother proved an ardent lover--
    What had so young a man to fear?
    He wed Ione within the year.
  No shadow clouds her tranquil brow,
    Men speak her husband's name with pride,
    While she sits honored at his side--
  She is--she must be happy now!
  I doubt the course I took no longer,
    Since those I love seem satisfied.
  The bond between them will grow stronger
    As they go forward side by side;
    Then will my pains be jusfied.
  Their joy is mine, and that is best--
    I am not totally bereft;
    For I have still the mem'ry left--
  Love stopped with me--a Royal Guest!
RELIGION
  I am no priest of crooks nor creeds,
  For human wants and human needs
  Are more to me than prophets' deeds;
  And human tears and human cares
  Affect me more than human prayers.
  Go, cease your wail, lugubrious saint!
  You fret high Heaven with your plaint.
  Is this the "Christian's joy" you paint?
  Is this the Christian's boasted bliss?
  Avails your faith no more than this?
  Take up your arms, come out with me,
  Let Heav'n alone; humanity
  Needs more and Heaven less from thee.
  With pity for mankind look 'round;
  Help them to rise--and Heaven is found.
DEACON JONES' GRIEVANCE
  I 've been watchin' of 'em, parson,
    An' I 'm sorry fur to say
  'At my mind is not contented
    With the loose an' keerless way
  'At the young folks treat the music;
    'T ain't the proper sort o' choir.
  Then I don't believe in Christuns
    A-singin' hymns for hire.
  But I never would 'a' murmured
    An' the matter might 'a' gone
  Ef it was n't fur the antics
    'At I've seen 'em kerry on;
  So I thought it was my dooty
    Fur to come to you an' ask
  Ef you would n't sort o' gently
    Take them singin' folks to task.
  Fust, the music they 've be'n singin'
    Will disgrace us mighty soon;
  It 's a cross between a opry
    An' a ol' cotillion tune.
  With its dashes an' its quavers
    An' its hifalutin style--
  Why, it sets my head to swimmin'
    When I 'm comin' down the aisle.
  Now it might be almost decent
    Ef it was n't fur the way
  'At they git up there an' sing it,
    Hey dum diddle, loud and gay.
  Why, it shames the name o' sacred
    In its brazen wordliness,
  An' they 've even got "Ol' Hundred"
    In a bold, new-fangled dress.
  You 'll excuse me, Mr. Parson,
    Ef I seem a little sore;
  But I 've sung the songs of Isr'el
    For threescore years an' more,
  An' it sort o' hurts my feelin's
    Fur to see 'em put away
  Fur these harum-scarum ditties
    'At is capturin' the day.
  There 's anuther little happ'nin'
    'At I 'll mention while I 'm here,
  Jes' to show 'at my objections
    All is offered sound and clear.
  It was one day they was singin'
    An' was doin' well enough--
  Singin' good as people could sing
    Sich an awful mess o' stuff--
  When the choir give a holler,
    An' the organ give a groan,
  An' they left one weak-voiced feller
    A-singin' there alone!
  But he stuck right to the music,
    Tho' 't was tryin' as could be;
  An' when I tried to help him,
    Why, the hull church scowled at me.
  You say that's so-low singin',
    Well, I pray the Lord that I
  Growed up when folks was willin'
    To sing their hymns so high.
  Why, we never had sich doin's
    In the good ol' Bethel days,
  When the folks was all contented
    With the simple songs of praise.
  Now I may have spoke too open,
    But 'twas too hard to keep still,
  An' I hope you 'll tell the singers
    'At I bear 'em no ill-will.
  'At they all may git to glory
    Is my wish an' my desire,
  But they 'll need some extry trainin'
    'Fore they jine the heavenly choir.
ALICE
  Know you, winds that blow your course
    Down the verdant valleys,
  That somewhere you must, perforce,
    Kiss the brow of Alice?
  When her gentle face you find,
  Kiss it softly, naughty wind.
  Roses waving fair and sweet
    Thro' the garden alleys,
  Grow into a glory meet
    For the eye of Alice;
  Let the wind your offering bear
  Of sweet perfume, faint and rare.
  Lily holding crystal dew
    In your pure white chalice,
  Nature kind hath fashioned you
    Like the soul of Alice;
  It of purest white is wrought,
  Filled with gems of crystal thought.
AFTER THE QUARREL
  So we, who 've supped the self-same cup,
    To-night must lay our friendship by;
  Your wrath has burned your judgment up,
    Hot breath has blown the ashes high.
  You say that you are wronged--ah, well,
    I count that friendship poor, at best
  A bauble, a mere bagatelle,
    That cannot stand so slight a test.
  I fain would still have been your friend,
    And talked and laughed and loved with you;
  But since it must, why, let it end;
    The false but dies, 't is not the true.
  So we are favored, you and I,
    Who only want the living truth.
  It was not good to nurse the lie;
    'T is well it died in harmless youth.
  I go from you to-night to sleep.
    Why, what's the odds? why should I grieve?
  I have no fund of tears to weep
    For happenings that undeceive.
  The days shall come, the days shall go
    Just as they came and went before.
  The sun shall shine, the streams shall flow
    Though you and I are friends no more.
  And in the volume of my years,
    Where all my thoughts and acts shall be,
  The page whereon your name appears
    Shall be forever sealed to me.
  Not that I hate you over-much,
    'T is less of hate than love defied;
  Howe'er, our hands no more shall touch,
    We 'll go our ways, the world is wide.
BEYOND THE YEARS
I
  Beyond the years the answer lies,
  Beyond where brood the grieving skies
      And Night drops tears.
  Where Faith rod-chastened smiles to rise
      And doff its fears,
  And carping Sorrow pines and dies--
      Beyond the years.
II
  Beyond the years the prayer for rest
  Shall beat no more within the breast;
      The darkness clears,
  And Morn perched on the mountain's crest
      Her form uprears--
  The day that is to come is best,
      Beyond the years.
III
  Beyond the years the soul shall find
  That endless peace for which it pined,
      For light appears,
  And to the eyes that still were blind
      With blood and tears,
  Their sight shall come all unconfined
      Beyond the years.
AFTER A VISIT
  I be'n down in ole Kentucky
    Fur a week er two, an' say,
  'T wuz ez hard ez breakin' oxen
    Fur to tear myse'f away.
  Allus argerin' 'bout fren'ship
    An' yer hospitality--
  Y' ain't no right to talk about it
    Tell you be'n down there to see.
  See jest how they give you welcome
    To the best that's in the land,
  Feel the sort o' grip they give you
    When they take you by the hand.
  Hear 'em say, "We 're glad to have you,
    Better stay a week er two;"
  An' the way they treat you makes you
    Feel that ev'ry word is true.
  Feed you tell you hear the buttons
    Crackin' on yore Sunday vest;
  Haul you roun' to see the wonders
    Tell you have to cry for rest.
  Drink yer health an' pet an' praise you
    Tell you git to feel ez great
  Ez the Sheriff o' the county
    Ez the Gov'ner o' the State.
  Wife, she sez I must be crazy
    'Cause I go on so, an' Nelse
  He 'lows, "Goodness gracious! daddy,
    Cain't you talk about nuthin' else?"
  Well, pleg-gone it, I 'm jes' tickled,
    Bein' tickled ain't no sin;
  I be'n down in ole Kentucky,
    An' I want o' go ag'in.
CURTAIN
  Villain shows his indiscretion,
  Villain's partner makes confession.
  Juvenile, with golden tresses,
  Finds her pa and dons long dresses.
  Scapegrace comes home money-laden,
  Hero comforts tearful maiden,
  Soubrette marries loyal chappie,
  Villain skips, and all are happy.
THE SPELLIN'-BEE
  I never shall furgit that night when father hitched up Dobbin,
  An' all us youngsters clambered in an' down the road went bobbin'
  To school where we was kep' at work in every kind o' weather,
  But where that night a spellin'-bee was callin' us together.
  'Twas one o' Heaven's banner nights, the stars was all a glitter,
  The moon was shinin' like the hand o' God had jest then lit her.
  The ground was white with spotless snow, the blast was sort o' stingin';
  But underneath our round-abouts, you bet our hearts was singin'.
  That spellin'-bee had be'n the talk o' many a precious moment,
  The youngsters all was wild to see jes' what the precious show meant,
  An' we whose years was in their teens was little less desirous
  O' gittin' to the meetin' so 's our sweethearts could admire us.
  So on we went so anxious fur to satisfy our mission
  That father had to box our ears, to smother our ambition.
  But boxin' ears was too short work to hinder our arrivin',
  He jest turned roun' an' smacked us all, an' kep' right on a-drivin'.
  Well, soon the schoolhouse hove in sight, the winders beamin' brightly;
  The sound o' talkin' reached our ears, and voices laffin' lightly.
  It puffed us up so full an' big 'at I 'll jest bet a dollar,
  There wa'n't a feller there but felt the strain upon his collar.
  So down we jumped an' in we went ez sprightly ez you make 'em,
  But somethin' grabbed us by the knees an' straight began to shake 'em.
  Fur once within that lighted room, our feelin's took a canter,
  An' scurried to the zero mark ez quick ez Tam O'Shanter.
  'Cause there was crowds o' people there, both sexes an' all stations;
  It looked like all the town had come an' brought all their relations.
  The first I saw was Nettie Gray, I thought that girl was dearer
  'N' gold; an' when I got a chance, you bet I aidged up near her.
  An' Farmer Dobbs's girl was there, the one 'at Jim was sweet on,
  An' Cyrus Jones an' Mandy Smith an' Faith an' Patience Deaton.
  Then Parson Brown an' Lawyer Jones were present--all attention,
  An' piles on piles of other folks too numerous to mention.
  The master rose an' briefly said: "Good friends, dear brother Crawford,
  To spur the pupils' minds along, a little prize has offered.
  To him who spells the best to-night--or 't may be 'her'--no tellin'--
  He offers ez a jest reward, this precious work on spellin'."
  A little blue-backed spellin'-book with fancy scarlet trimmin';
  We boys devoured it with our eyes--so did the girls an' women.
  He held it up where all could see, then on the table set it,
  An' ev'ry speller in the house felt mortal bound to get it.
  At his command we fell in line, prepared to do our dooty,
  Outspell the rest an' set 'em down, an' carry home the booty.
  'T was then the merry times began, the blunders, an' the laffin',
  The nudges an' the nods an' winks an' stale good-natured chaffin'.
  Ole Uncle Hiram Dane was there, the clostest man a-livin',
  Whose only bugbear seemed to be the dreadful fear o' givin'.
  His beard was long, his hair uncut, his clothes all bare an' dingy;
  It wasn't 'cause the man was pore, but jest so mortal stingy;
  An' there he sot by Sally Riggs a-smilin' an' a-smirkin',
  An' all his children lef' to home a diggin' an' a-workin'.
  A widower he was, an' Sal was thinkin' 'at she 'd wing him;
  I reckon he was wond'rin' what them rings o' hern would bring him.
  An' when the spellin'-test commenced, he up an' took his station,
  A-spellin' with the best o' them to beat the very nation.
  An' when he 'd spell some youngster down, he 'd turn to look at Sally,
  An' say: "The teachin' nowadays can't be o' no great vally."
  But true enough the adage says, "Pride walks in slipp'ry places,"
  Fur soon a thing occurred that put a smile on all our faces.
  The laffter jest kep' ripplin' 'roun' an' teacher could n't quell it,
  Fur when he give out "charity" ole Hiram could n't spell it.
  But laffin' 's ketchin' an' it throwed some others off their bases,
  An' folks 'u'd miss the very word that seemed to fit their cases.
  Why, fickle little Jessie Lee come near the house upsettin'
  By puttin' in a double "kay" to spell the word "coquettin'."
  An' when it come to Cyrus Jones, it tickled me all over--
  Him settin' up to Mandy Smith an' got sot down on "lover."
  But Lawyer Jones of all gone men did shorely look the gonest,
  When he found out that he 'd furgot to put the "h" in "honest."
  An' Parson Brown, whose sermons were too long fur toleration,
  Caused lots o' smiles by missin' when they give out "condensation."
  So one by one they giv' it up--the big words kep' a-landin',
  Till me an' Nettie Gray was left, the only ones a-standin',
  An' then my inward strife began--I guess my mind was petty--
  I did so want that spellin'-book; but then to spell down Nettie
  Jest sort o' went ag'in my grain--I somehow could n't do it,
  An' when I git a notion fixed, I 'm great on stickin' to it.
  So when they giv' the next word out--I had n't orter tell it,
  But then 't was all fur Nettie's sake--I missed so's she could spell it.
  She spelt the word, then looked at me so lovin'-like an' mello',
  I tell you 't sent a hunderd pins a shootin' through a fello'.
  O' course I had to stand the jokes an' chaffin' of the fello's,
  But when they handed her the book I vow I was n't jealous.
  We sung a hymn, an' Parson Brown dismissed us like he orter,
  Fur, la! he 'd learned a thing er two an' made his blessin' shorter.
  'T was late an' cold when we got out, but Nettie liked cold weather,
  An' so did I, so we agreed we 'd jest walk home together.
  We both wuz silent, fur of words we nuther had a surplus,
  'Till she spoke out quite sudden like, "You missed that word on purpose."
  Well, I declare it frightened me; at first I tried denyin',
  But Nettie, she jest smiled an' smiled, she knowed that I was lyin'.
  Sez she: "That book is yourn by right;" sez I: "It never could be--
  I--I--you--ah--" an' there I stuck, an' well she understood me.
  So we agreed that later on when age had giv' us tether,
  We 'd jine our lots an' settle down to own that book together.
KEEP A-PLUGGIN' AWAY
  I 've a humble little motto
  That is homely, though it 's true,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  It's a thing when I 've an object
  That I always try to do,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  When you 've rising storms to quell,
  When opposing waters swell,
  It will never fail to tell,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  If the hills are high before
  And the paths are hard to climb,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  And remember that successes
  Come to him who bides his time,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  From the greatest to the least,
  None are from the rule released.
  Be thou toiler, poet, priest,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  Delve away beneath the surface,
  There is treasure farther down,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  Let the rain come down in torrents,
  Let the threat'ning heavens frown,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  When the clouds have rolled away,
  There will come a brighter day
  All your labor to repay,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  There 'll be lots of sneers to swallow,
  There 'll be lots of pain to bear,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  If you 've got your eye on heaven,
  Some bright day you 'll wake up there,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  Perseverance still is king;
  Time its sure reward will bring;
  Work and wait unwearying,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
NIGHT OF LOVE
  The moon has left the sky, love,
    The stars are hiding now,
  And frowning on the world, love,
    Night bares her sable brow.
  The snow is on the ground, love,
    And cold and keen the air is.
  I 'm singing here to you, love;
    You 're dreaming there in Paris.
  But this is Nature's law, love,
    Though just it may not seem,
  That men should wake to sing, love,
    While maidens sleep and dream.
  Them care may not molest, love,
    Nor stir them from their slumbers,
  Though midnight find the swain, love,
    Still halting o'er his numbers.
  I watch the rosy dawn, love,
    Come stealing up the east,
  While all things round rejoice, love,
    That Night her reign has ceased.
  The lark will soon be heard, love,
    And on his way be winging;
  When Nature's poets wake, love,
    Why should a man be singing?
COLUMBIAN ODE
I
  Four hundred years ago a tangled waste
    Lay sleeping on the west Atlantic's side;
  Their devious ways the Old World's millions traced
    Content, and loved, and labored, dared and died,
  While students still believed the charts they conned,
    And revelled in their thriftless ignorance,
  Nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond
    Old Ocean's dense, indefinite expanse.
II
  But deep within her heart old Nature knew
    That she had once arrayed, at Earth's behest,
  Another offspring, fine and fair to view,--
    The chosen suckling of the mother's breast.
  The child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine,
    Each fold a work of Nature's matchless art;
  The mother looked on it with love divine,
    And strained the loved one closely to her heart.
  And there it lay, and with the warmth grew strong
    And hearty, by the salt sea breezes fanned,
  Till Time with mellowing touches passed along,
    And changed the infant to a mighty land.
III
  But men knew naught of this, till there arose
    That mighty mariner, the Genoese,
  Who dared to try, in spite of fears and foes,
    The unknown fortunes of unsounded seas.
  O noblest of Italia's sons, thy bark
  Went not alone into that shrouding night!
  O dauntless darer of the rayless dark,
    The world sailed with thee to eternal light!
  The deer-haunts that with game were crowded then
    To-day are tilled and cultivated lands;
  The schoolhouse tow'rs where Bruin had his den,
    And where the wigwam stood the chapel stands;
  The place that nurtured men of savage mien
    Now teems with men of Nature's noblest types;
  Where moved the forest-foliage banner green,
    Now flutters in the breeze the stars and stripes!
A BORDER BALLAD
  Oh, I have n't got long to live, for we all
    Die soon, e'en those who live longest;
  And the poorest and weakest are taking their chance
    Along with the richest and strongest.
  So it's heigho for a glass and a song,
    And a bright eye over the table,
  And a dog for the hunt when the game is flush,
    And the pick of a gentleman's stable.
  There is Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yester-night,
    But he 's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh;
  'Twas the hand o' MacPherson that gave him the blow,
    And the vultures shall feast on his marrow.
  But it's heigho for a brave old song
    And a glass while we are able;
  Here 's a health to death and another cup
    To the bright eye over the table.
  I can show a broad back and a jolly deep chest,
    But who argues now on appearance?
  A blow or a thrust or a stumble at best
    May send me to-day to my clearance.
  Then it's heigho for the things I love,
    My mother 'll be soon wearing sable,
  But give me my horse and my dog and my glass,
    And a bright eye over the table.
AN EASY-GOIN' FELLER
  Ther' ain't no use in all this strife,
  An' hurryin', pell-mell, right thro' life.
  I don't believe in goin' too fast
  To see what kind o' road you 've passed.
  It ain't no mortal kind o' good,
  'N' I would n't hurry ef I could.
  I like to jest go joggin' 'long,
  To limber up my soul with song;
  To stop awhile 'n' chat the men,
  'N' drink some cider now an' then.
  Do' want no boss a-standin' by
  To see me work; I allus try
  To do my dooty right straight up,
  An' earn what fills my plate an' cup.
  An' ez fur boss, I 'll be my own,
  I like to jest be let alone;
  To plough my strip an' tend my bees,
  An' do jest like I doggoned please.
  My head's all right, an' my heart's meller,
  But I 'm a easy-goin' feller.
A NEGRO LOVE SONG
  Seen my lady home las' night,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,
  Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,
  An' a smile go flittin' by--
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  An' my hea't was beatin' so,
  When I reached my lady's do',
  Dat I could n't ba' to go--
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Put my ahm aroun' huh wais',
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Raised huh lips an' took a tase,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Love me, honey, love me true?
  Love me well ez I love you?
  An' she answe'd, "'Cose I do"--
   Jump back, honey, jump back.
THE DILETTANTE: A MODERN TYPE
  He scribbles some in prose and verse,
    And now and then he prints it;
  He paints a little,--gathers some
    Of Nature's gold and mints it.
  He plays a little, sings a song,
    Acts tragic roles, or funny;
  He does, because his love is strong,
    But not, oh, not for money!
  He studies almost everything
    From social art to science;
  A thirsty mind, a flowing spring,
    Demand and swift compliance.
  He looms above the sordid crowd--
    At least through friendly lenses;
  While his mamma looks pleased and proud,
    And kindly pays expenses.
BY THE STREAM
  By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass,
  How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass,
  And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads,
  Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads.
  And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go,
  For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show,
  And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries,
  When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.
THE COLORED SOLDIERS
  If the muse were mine to tempt it
    And my feeble voice were strong,
  If my tongue were trained to measures,
    I would sing a stirring song.
  I would sing a song heroic
    Of those noble sons of Ham,
  Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!
  In the early days you scorned them,
    And with many a flip and flout
  Said "These battles are the white man's,
    And the whites will fight them out."
  Up the hills you fought and faltered,
    In the vales you strove and bled,
  While your ears still heard the thunder
    Of the foes' advancing tread.
  Then distress fell on the nation,
    And the flag was drooping low;
  Should the dust pollute your banner?
    No! the nation shouted, No!
  So when War, in savage triumph,
    Spread abroad his funeral pall--
  Then you called the colored soldiers,
    And they answered to your call.
  And like hounds unleashed and eager
    For the life blood of the prey,
  Sprung they forth and bore them bravely
    In the thickest of the fray.
  And where'er the fight was hottest,
    Where the bullets fastest fell,
  There they pressed unblanched and fearless
    At the very mouth of hell.
  Ah, they rallied to the standard
    To uphold it by their might;
  None were stronger in the labors,
    None were braver in the fight.
  From the blazing breach of Wagner
    To the plains of Olustee,
  They were foremost in the fight
    Of the battles of the free.
  And at Pillow! God have mercy
    On the deeds committed there,
  And the souls of those poor victims
    Sent to Thee without a prayer.
  Let the fulness of Thy pity
    O'er the hot wrought spirits sway
  Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fell fighting on that day!
  Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom,
    And they won it dearly, too;
  For the life blood of their thousands
    Did the southern fields bedew.
  In the darkness of their bondage,
    In the depths of slavery's night,
  Their muskets flashed the dawning,
    And they fought their way to light.
  They were comrades then and brothers,
    Are they more or less to-day?
  They were good to stop a bullet
    And to front the fearful fray.
  They were citizens and soldiers,
    When rebellion raised its head;
  And the traits that made them worthy,--
    Ah! those virtues are not dead.
  They have shared your nightly vigils,
    They have shared your daily toil;
  And their blood with yours commingling
    Has enriched the Southern soil.
  They have slept and marched and suffered
    'Neath the same dark skies as you,
  They have met as fierce a foeman,
    And have been as brave and true.
  And their deeds shall find a record
    In the registry of Fame;
  For their blood has cleansed completely
    Every blot of Slavery's shame.
  So all honor and all glory
    To those noble sons of Ham--
  The gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!
NATURE AND ART
NATURE AND ART
To my friend, Charles Booth Nettleton
I
The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair,
Once on a time fell upon evil days.
From hearing oft herself discussed with praise,
There grew within her heart the longing rare
To see herself; and every passing air
The warm desire fanned into lusty blaze.
Full oft she sought this end by devious ways,
But sought in vain, so fell she in despair.
For none within her train nor by her side
Could solve the task or give the envied boon.
So day and night, beneath the sun and moon,
She wandered to and fro unsatisfied,
Till Art came by, a blithe inventive elf,
And made a glass wherein she saw herself.
II
Enrapt, the queen gazed on her glorious self,
Then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought,
Commanded that the skillful wight be brought
That she might dower him with lands and pelf.
Then out upon the silent sea-lapt shelf
And up the hills and on the downs they sought
Him who so well and wondrously had wrought;
And with much search found and brought home the elf,
But he put by all gifts with sad replies
And from his lips these words flowed forth like wine:
"Oh, queen, I want no gift but thee," he said.
She heard and looked on him with love-lit eyes,
Gave him her hand, low murmuring, "I am thine,"
And at the morrow's dawning they were wed.
AFTER WHILE

A Poem of Faith
------
I think that though the clouds be dark,
That though the waves dash o'er the bark,
Yet after while the light will come,
And in calm waters safe at home
The bark will anchor.
Weep not, my sad-eyed, gray-robed maid,
Because your fairest blossoms fade,
That sorrow still o'erruns your cup,
And even though you root them up,
The weeds grow ranker.
For after while your tears shall cease,
And sorrow shall give way to peace;
The flow'rs shall bloom, the weeds shall die,
And in that faith seen, by and by
Thy woes shall perish.
Smile at old Fortune's adverse tide,
Smile when the scoffers sneer and chide.
Oh, not for you the gems that pale,
And not for you the flowers that fail;
Let this thought cherish:
That after while the clouds will part,
And then with joy the waiting heart
Shall feel the light come stealing in,
That drives away the cloud of sin
And breaks its power.
And you shall burst your chrysalis,
And wing away to realms of bliss,
Untrammelled, pure, divinely free,
Above all earth's anxiety
From that same hour.
THE OL' TUNES
You kin talk about yer anthems
An' yer arias an' sich,
An' yer modern choir-singin'
That you think so awful rich;
But you orter heerd us youngsters
In the times now far away,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
There was some of us sung treble
An' a few of us growled bass,
An' the tide o' song flowed smoothly
With its 'comp'niment o' grace;
There was spirit in that music,
An' a kind o' solemn sway,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
I remember oft o' standin'
In my homespun pantaloons--
On my face the bronze an' freckles
O' the suns o' youthful Junes--
Thinkin' that no mortal minstrel
Ever chanted sich a lay
As the ol' tunes we was singin'
In the ol'-fashioned way.
The boys 'ud always lead us,
An' the girls 'ud all chime in,
Till the sweetness o' the singin'
Robbed the list'nin' soul o' sin;
An' I used to tell the parson
'T was as good to sing as pray,
When the people sung the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
How I long ag'in to hear 'em
Pourin' forth from soul to soul,
With the treble high an' meller,
An' the bass's mighty roll;
But the times is very diff'rent,
An' the music heerd to-day
Ain't the singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
Little screechin' by a woman,
Little squawkin' by a man,
Then the organ's twiddle-twaddle,
Jest the empty space to span,--
An' ef you should even think it,
'T is n't proper fur to say
That you want to hear the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
But I think that some bright mornin',
When the toils of life air o'er,
An' the sun o' heaven arisin'
Glads with light the happy shore,
I shall hear the angel chorus,
In the realms of endless day,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
In the ol'-fashioned way.
MELANCHOLIA
Silently without my window,
Tapping gently at the pane,
Falls the rain.
Through the trees sighs the breeze
Like a soul in pain.
Here alone I sit and weep;
Thought hath banished sleep.
Wearily I sit and listen
To the water's ceaseless drip.
To my lip
Fate turns up the bitter cup,
Forcing me to sip;
'Tis a bitter, bitter drink.
Thus I sit and think,--
Thinking things unknown and awful,
Thoughts on wild, uncanny themes,
Waking dreams.
Spectres dark, corpses stark,
Show the gaping seams
Whence the cold and cruel knife
Stole away their life.
Bloodshot eyes all strained and staring,
Gazing ghastly into mine;
Blood like wine
On the brow--clotted now--
Shows death's dreadful sign.
Lonely vigil still I keep;
Would that I might sleep!
Still, oh, still, my brain is whirling!
Still runs on my stream of thought;
I am caught
In the net fate hath set.
Mind and soul are brought
To destruction's very brink;
Yet I can but think!
Eyes that look into the future,--
Peeping forth from out my mind,
They will find
Some new weight, soon or late,
On my soul to bind,
Crushing all its courage out,--
Heavier than doubt.
Dawn, the Eastern monarch's daughter,
Rising from her dewy bed,
Lays her head
'Gainst the clouds' sombre shrouds
Now half fringed with red.
O'er the land she 'gins to peep;
Come, O gentle Sleep!
Hark! the morning cock is crowing;
Dreams, like ghosts, must hie away;
'Tis the day.
Rosy morn now is born;
Dark thoughts may not stay.
Day my brain from foes will keep;
Now, my soul, I sleep.
THE WOOING
A youth went faring up and down,
Alack and well-a-day.
He fared him to the market town,
Alack and well-a-day.
And there he met a maiden fair,
With hazel eyes and auburn hair--
His heart went from him then and there
Alack and well-a-day.
She posies sold right merrily,
Alack and well-a-day;
But not a flower was fair as she,
Alack and well-a-day.
He bought a rose and sighed a sigh
"Ah, dearest maiden, would that I
Might dare the seller too to buy,"
Alack and well-a-day.
She tossed her head--the coy coquette,
Alack and well-a-day.
"I'm not sir in the market yet"
Alack and well-a-day.
Your love must cool upon a shelf;
Tho' much I sell for gold and pelf
I'm yet too young to sell myself
Alack and well-a-day.
The youth was filled with sorrow sore
Alack and well-a-day;
And looked he at the maid once more
Alack and well-a-day.
Then loud he cried, "Fair maiden, if
Too young to sell, now as I live,
You're not too young yourself to give"
Alack and well-a-day.
The little maid cast down her eyes
Alack and well-a-day,
And many a flush began to rise
Alack and well-a-day.
"Why, since you are so bold," she said,
"I doubt not you are highly bred,
So take me!" and the twain were wed.
Alack and well-a-day.
MERRY AUTUMN
It's all a farce,--these tales they tell
About the breezes sighing,
And moans astir o'er field and dell,
Because the year is dying.
Such principles are most absurd,--
I care not who first taught 'em;
There's nothing known to beast or bird
To make a solemn autumn.
In solemn times, when grief holds sway
With countenance distressing,
You'll note the more of black and gray
Will then be used in dressing.
Now purple tints are all around;
The sky is blue and mellow;
And e'en the grasses turn the ground
From modest green to yellow.
The seed burs all with laughter crack
On featherweed and jimson;
And leaves that should be dressed in black
Are all decked out in crimson.
A butterfly goes winging by;
A singing bird comes after;
And Nature, all from earth to sky,
Is bubbling o'er with laughter.
The ripples wimple on the rills,
Like sparkling little lasses;
The sunlight runs along the hills,
And laughs among the grasses.
The earth is just so full of fun
It really can't contain it;
And streams of mirth so freely run
The heavens seem to rain it.
Don't talk to me of solemn days
In autumn's time of splendor,
Because the sun shows fewer rays,
And these grow slant and slender.
Why, it's the climax of the year,--
The highest time of living!--
Till naturally its bursting cheer
Just melts into thanksgiving.
WHEN DE CO'N PONE'S HOT
Dey is times in life when Nature
Seems to slip a cog an' go,
Jes' a-rattlin' down creation,
Lak an ocean's overflow;
When de worl' jes' stahts a-spinnin'
Lak a picaninny's top,
An' yo' cup o' joy is brimmin'
'Twell it seems about to slop,
An' you feel jes' lak a racah,
Dat is trainin' fu' to trot
When yo' mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.
When you set down at de table,
Kin' o' weary lak an' sad,
An' you'se jes' a little tiahed
An' purhaps a little mad;
How yo' gloom tu'ns into gladness,
How yo' joy drives out de doubt
When de oven do' is opened,
An' de smell comes po'in' out;
Why, de 'lectric light o' Heaven
Seems to settle on de spot,
When yo' mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.
When de cabbage pot is steamin'
An' de bacon good an' fat,
When de chittlins is a-sputter'n'
So's to show you whah dey's at;
Tek away yo' sody biscuit,
Tek away yo' cake an' pie,
Fu' de glory time is comin',
An' it's 'proachin' mighty nigh,
An' you want to jump an' hollah,
Dough you know you'd bettah not,
When yo' mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.
I have hyeahd o' lots o' sermons,
An' I've hyeahd o' lots o' prayers,
An' I've listened to some singin'
Dat has tuck me up de stairs
Of de Glory-Lan' an' set me
Jes' below de Mahstah's th'one,
An' have lef' my hea't a-singin'
In a happy aftah tone;
But dem wu'ds so sweetly murmured
Seem to tech de softes' spot,
When my mammy says de blessin'
An' de co'n pone's hot.
BALLAD
I know my love is true,
And oh the day is fair,
The sky is clear and blue,
The flowers are rich of hue,
The air I breathe is rare,
I have no grief or care;
For my own love is true,
And oh the day is fair.
My love is false I find,
And oh the day is dark.
Blows sadly down the wind,
While sorrow holds my mind;
I do not hear the lark,
For quenched is life's dear spark--
My love is false I find,
And oh the day is dark!
For love doth make the day
Or dark or doubly bright;
Her beams along the way
Dispel the gloom and gray.
She lives and all is bright,
She dies and life is night.
For love doth make the day,
Or dark or doubly bright.
THE CHANGE HAS COME
The change has come, and Helen sleeps--
Not sleeps; but wakes to greater deeps
Of wisdom, glory, truth and light,
That ever blessed her seeking sight,
In this low, long, lethargic night,
Worn out with strife
Which men call life.
The change has come, and who would say?
"I would it were not come to-day."
What were the respite till to-morrow--
Postponement of a certain sorrow,
From which each passing day would borrow?
Let grief be dumb,
The change has come.
COMPARISON
The sky of brightest gray seems dark
To one whose sky was ever white.
To one who never knew a spark,
Thro' all his life, of love or light,
The grayest cloud seems over bright.
The robin sounds a beggar's note
Where one the nightingale has heard,
But he, for whom no silver throat,
Its liquid music ever stirred,
Deems robin still the sweetest bird.
A CORN-SONG
On the wide veranda white,
In the purple failing light,
Sits the master while the sun is lowly burning;
And his dreamy thoughts are drowned
In the softly flowing sound
Of the corn-songs of the field-hands slow returning.
Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.
O'er the fields with heavy tread,
Light of heart and high of head,--
Tho' the halting steps be labored, slow, and weary;
Still the spirits brave and strong
Find a comforter in song,
And their corn-song rises ever loud and cheery.
Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.
To the master in his seat,
Comes the burden, full and sweet,
Of the mellow minor music growing clearer;
As the toilers raise the hymn,
Thro' the silence dusk and dim,
To the cabin's restful shelter drawing nearer.
Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.
And a tear is in the eye
Of the master sitting by,
As he listens to the echoes low-replying
To the music's fading calls
As it faints away and falls
Into silence, deep within the cabin dying.
Oh, we hoe de co'n
Since de ehly mo'n
Now de sinkin' sun
Says de day is done.
DISCOVERED
Seen you down at chu'ch las' night,
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
What I mean? oh, dat's all right,
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
You was sma't ez sma't could be,
But you couldn't hide f'om me.
Ain't I got two eyes to see!
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
Guess you thought you's awful keen;
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
Evahthing you done, I seen;
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
Seen him tek yo' ahm jes' so,
When he got outside de do' --
Oh, I know dat man's yo' beau!
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
Say now, honey, wha'd he say? --
Nevah min', Miss Lucy!
Keep yo' secrets -- dat's yo' way --
Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
Won't tell me an' I'm yo' pal --
I'm gwine tell his othah gal, --
Know huh, too, huh name is Sal;
Nevah min', Miss Lucy!
DISAPPOINTED
An old man planted and dug and tended,
Toiling in joy from dew to dew:
The Sun was kind and the rain befriended:
Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.
Then he said: "I will quiet my thrifty fears,
For here is fruit for my failing years."
But even then the storm-clouds gathered,
Swallowing up the azure sky;
The sweeping winds into white foam lathered
The placid breast of the bay, hard by;
Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air
Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.
The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,
Viewing the place the storm had swept;
And then with a cry from his soul despairing,
He bowed him down to the earth, and wept.
But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain:
"Arise, old man, and plant again!"
INVITATION TO LOVE
Come when the nights are bright with stars
Or when the moon is mellow;
Come when the Sun his golden bars
Drops on the hay-field mellow.
Come in the twilight soft and gray,
Come in the night or come in the day,
Come, oh Love, whene'er you may,
And you are welcome, welcome.
You are sweet, oh Love, dear Love,
You are soft as the nesting dove.
Come to my heart and bring it rest
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.
Come when my heart is full of grief,
Or when my heart is merry;
Come with the falling of the leaf
Or with the redd'ning cherry.
Come when the year's first blossom blows,
Come when the summer gleams and glows,
Come with the winter's drifting snows,
And you are welcome, welcome.
WE WEAR THE MASK
We wear the mask that grins and lies,
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--
This debt we pay to human guile;
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile
And mouth with myriad subtleties,
Why should the world be over-wise.
In counting all our tears and sighs?
Nay, let them only see us, while
We wear the mask.
We smile, but oh great Christ, our cries
To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile,
But let the world dream otherwise,
We wear the mask!
WHEN MALINDY SINGS
G'way an' quit dat noise, Miss Lucy-
Put dat music book away;
What's de use to keep on tryin'?
Ef you practice twell you're gray,
You cain't sta't no notes a-flyin'
Lak de ones dat rants an' rings
F'om de kitchen to de big woods
When Melindy sings.
You ain't got de nachel o'gans
Fu' to make de soun' come right,
You ain't got de tu'ns an' twistin's
Fu' to make it sweet an' light.
Tell you one thing now, Miss Lucy,
An' I'm tellin' you fu' true,
When hit comes to raal right singin',
'Tain't no easy thing to do.
Easy 'nough fu' folks to hollah,
Lookin' at de lines an' dots,
When dey ain't no one kin sence it,
An' de chune comes in, in spots;
But fu' real melojous music,
Dat jes' strikes yo' hawt and clings,
Jes' you stan' an' listen wif me
When Malindy sings.
Ain't you nevah heerd Malindy?
Blessed soul, take up de cross!
Look heah, ain't you jokin' honey?
Well, you don't know whut you los'.
Y'ought to heah dat gal a-wa'blin',
Robins, la'ks, an' all dem things,
Heish dey moufs an' hides dey faces
When Malindy sings.
Fiddlin' man, jes' stop his fiddlin',
Lay his fiddle on de she'f;
Mockin'-bird quit tryin' to whistle,
'Cause he jes' so shamed hisse'f.
Folks a-playin' on de banjo
Draps dey fingahs on de strings--
Bless yo' soul--fu'gits to move 'em,
When Malindy sings.
She jes' spreads huh mouf and hollahs,
"Come to Jesus," twell you heah
Sinnahs' tremblin' steps and voices,
Timid-like a-drawin' neah;
Den she tu'ns to "Rock of Ages,"
Simply to de cross she clings,
An' you fin' yo' teahs a drappin'
When Malindy sings.
Who dat says dat humble praises
Wif de Master nevah counts?
Heish yo' mouf, I heah dat music,
Ez hit rises up an' mounts--
Floatin' by de hills an' valleys,
Way above dis buryin' sod,
Ez hit makes its way in glory
To de very gates of God!
Oh, hits sweetah dan de music
Of an edicated band;
An' hits dearah dan de battle's
Song o' triumph in de lan'.
It seems holier dan evenin'
When de solemn chu'ch bell rings,
Ez I sit an' ca'mly listen
While Malindy sings.
Towsah, stop dat ba'kin', heah me!
Mandy, make dat chile keep still;
Don't you heah de echoes callin'
F'om de valley to de hill.
Let me listen, I can heah it,
Th'oo de bresh of angel's wings,
Sof' an' sweet, "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"
Ez Malindy sings.

POEMS BY Mary Weston Fordham, 
WITH INTRODUCTORY BY Booker T. Washington 
PRIN. TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE, 
TUSKEGEE, ALA. 
COPYRIGHT, 
December 10th, 1897. 
INTRODUCTORY 
        I give my cordial endorsement to this little “Book of Poems,” because I believe it will do its part to awaken the Muse of Poetry which I am sure slumbers in very many of the Sons and Daughters of the Race of which the Author of this work is a representative. 
        The Negro's right to be considered worthy of recognition in the field of poetic effort is not now gainsaid as formerly, and each succeeding effort but emphasizes his right to just consideration. 
        The hope, I have, is, that this Volume of “Poems” may fall among the critical and intelligent, who will accord the just meed of praise or of censure, to the end that further effort may be stimulated, no matter what the verdict. 
        The readers I trust will find as much to praise and admire as have I done. 
                                                                                Booker T. Washington, 
                                                      Prin. Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute.

PREFACE. 
        This little volume is launched on the doubtful sea of literature with the hope that the breezes of public opinion may give an impetus to its voyage. I hope that it will be kindly received as simply the harbinger of what may be expected from the generations to come; and shall consider its mission as being fulfilled if it should be the means of arousing and stimulating some of our youth to higher and greater efforts along this line. 
         Commending it to an intelligent and impartial criticism, 
                                                    I am, respectfully, 
                                                                                 The Author.

CREATION 
"The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handy work.”
O Earth, adore creative power, 
That made and gave to man as dower, 
      This world of beauty rare, 
With hills and vales of verdant green, 
With rills and brooks of crystal sheen, 
      Lovely beyond compare. 
O Sun, bright ruler of the day, 
When first thy power thou did'st display,
     Earth must have shrank in fear, 
When like a meteor burst thy light, 
Turning to day the long, long night,
     With radiance wondrous fair. 
Thou Moon, pale sister of the Sun, 
When he his daily work has done, 
     Thou comest forth a queen; 
A queen in silvery robe adorned, 
With tiara of jewels formed, 
       Of starry orbs unseen. 
Ye twinkling stars of milder light, 
Though now ye gleam like sapphires bright, 
      Across yon azure dome, 
The day will dawn, that last dread day, 
When from yon heaven you'll fall away,
      And man to Judgment come. 
Thunder and Lightnings burst and gleam, 
Frightful and fierce to us they seem 
      Rending the darkened sky. 
Like giants tread the thunder's peal, 
The vivid lightnings swiftly steal, 
      And men in terror fly. 
O filmy clouds, of purest white, 
With robes of gossamer cased in white, 
      Ye floating waters pure, 
Sometimes to burst in cooling showers, 
Sometimes to deluge wintry hours 
     With your relentless pour. 
Thou beauteous Rainbow bursting forth, 
With varied hues encircling earth; 
      The sign to Noah made. 
“I place amid the Clouds my Bow”
To show that I will nevermore 
      Deluge with angry flood. 
Mountains and Hills whose snow capped tops 
The vast horizon overlooks, 
      Pyramids strung and sure; 
Xor lightnings fierce nor earthquake shock 
Can ever sway, for firm as rock 
      Ye ever will endure. 
Thou Ocean vast, oftimes thy breast, 
Is calm and still as if at rest, 
      Like one in quiet sleep; 
But soon in anger thou mav'st roar, 
And madly toss from shore to shore, 
     And human harvest reap. 
Fountains and Rivulets so clear, 
That gush amid the valleys fair, 
      With soft and mellow ring; 
As coming forth from glade and wood 
Your babblings whisper “God is good,”
       Ye make the vales to sing. 
Now when all nature swells the song,
When beast and birds the strain prolong,
        Shall man from praise refrain? 
Then would the rocks and hills proclaim,
All nature crying out for shame,
They who their Maker's image wear, 
Should shout and sing till rent the air 
       With rhapsodies sublime. 
SHIPWRECK. 
Night and a starless sky, 
Ship on wild billows tost, 
With tattered sails and opening seams. 
And deck bestrewn with falling beams. 
       Swift plunging to her doom. 
Red lightnings round her flash, 
Loud thunders crash and roar, 
And the noble vessel mounts the crest 
Of the reeking waves, then sinks to rest 
      Mid carnival of woe. 
The Petrel soars aloft,
Trailing her hymn of death, 
And the dirge like sounds pierce the blackened sky, 
While the crew send forth one anguished cry, 
       Sinking to lowest depth. 
Some ships go out to sea 
That never more return, 
Souls that from heaven in infancy come, 
Tarnished and ruined by sin may become, 
Like the Dove to the Ark they never return, 
       But sink as ship to doom. 
THE WASHERWOMAN. 
With hands all reddened and sore, 
       With back and shoulders low bent,
She stands all day, and part of the night 
        Till her strength is well-nigh spent. 
With her rub — rub — rub, 
        And her wash, rinse, shake,
Till the muscles start and the spirit sinks, 
        And the bones begin to ache. 
At morn when the sunbeams scatter 
        In rays so golden and bright, 
She yearns for the hour of even, 
        She longs for the restful night. 
Still she rubs — rubs — rubs, 
        With the energy born of want, 
For the larder's empty and must be filled,—
        The fuel's growing scant. 
As long as the heart is blithesome. 
        Will her spirit bear her up, 
And kindness and love imparteth a zest 
         To sweeten hard life's bitter cup. 
But to toil—toil—toil, 
         From the grey of the morn till eve, 
Is an ordeal so drear for a human t o bear, 
         Which the rich can hardly conceive. 
What part in the world of pleasure? 
        What holidays are her own? 
For the rich reck not of privations and tears, 
         Saying, "she is to the manoi born.”
So dry those scalding tears 
        That furrow so deeply thy cheek,
For rest — rest — rest 
         Will come at the end of the week. 
Yes, even on earth there's a day 
         When labor and toil must cease, 
The world at its birth received the mandate 
         Of the seventh day of rest. 
When the sweet-toned Sabbath bells 
         Break o'er the balmy air, 
Then sing—sing—sing 
         That the morning stars may hear. 
For the frugal table spread, 
         For the crust and the humble bed, 
When He to whom all earth belongs 
         Had not where to lay His head, 
Then toil for thy daily bread, 
         Let thy heart like thy hands be clean, 
And rub—rub—rub 
         Till thy hones all ache, I ween. 
With hands all reddened and sore, 
         With back and shoulders bent low, 
Thou hast for thy comfort that rest, sweet rest, 
         Will be found on the other shore. 
Then they who've washed their souls 
         Will dip in the crystal tide 
Of the fountain clear that was oped to man 
         From the Saviour's wounded side. 
THE SNOWDROP. 
How comest thou, O flower so fair,
To bud and bloom while wintry air 
         Still hovers o'er the land? 
How comest from the cold, dark earth? 
That fostered thee and gave thee birth, 
         Studding thy brow with snow. 
Say, didst thou yearn for sunny bowers? 
To gladden with thy pure, pale flowers, 
         The valley and the hill? 
Down in the darkness whence thou came, 
Hear' st aught of passion, fashion, fame, 
         Or even greed for gold ? 
And when the old earth's bosom heaves, 
And scatters man like autumn's leaves. 
          With its low thundered voice,
Thou sleep' st serene with eyelids closed,
No earthquake shock breaks thy repose, 
         Till comes the breath of Spring. 
THE SAXON LEGEND OF LANGUAGE. 
The earth was young, the world was fair, 
And balmy breezes filled the air, 
Nature reposed in solitude, 
When God pronounced it "very good." 
The snow-capped mountain reared its head, 
The deep, dark forests widely spread, 
O'er pebbly shores the stream did play 
On glad creation's natal day. 
But silence reigned, nor beast nor bird 
Had from its mate a whisper heard, 
E'en man, God's image from above, 
Could not, to Eve, tell of his love. 
Where the four rivers met there strayed 
The man and wife, no whit afraid, 
For the arch-fiend expelled from heaven 
Had not yet found his way to Eden. 
But lo! a light from 'mid the tree, 
But hark! a rustling 'mongst the leaves, 
Then a fair Angel from above, 
Descending, sang his song of love. 
Forth sprang the fierce beasts from their lair, 
Bright feathered songsters fill the air, 
All nature stirred to centre rang 
When the celestial song began. 
The Lion, monarch of the plain, 
First tried to imitate the strain, 
And shaking high his mane he roared, 
Till beast and bird around him cohered. 
The little Linnet tuned her lay, 
The Lark, in turn, did welcome day, 
And cooing soft, the timid Dove 
Did to his mate tell of his love. 
Then Eve, the synonym of grace,
Drew nearer to the solemn place, 
And heard the words to music set 
In tones so sweet, she ne'er forgot. 
The anthems from the earth so rare, 
Higher and higher filled the air, 
Till Seraphs caught the inspiring strain, 
And morning stars together sang. 
Then laggard Adam sauntered near, 
What Eve had heard he too must hear, 
But ah! for aye will woman's voice 
Make man to sigh or him rejoice. 
Only the fishes in the deep 
Did not arouse them from their sleep, 
So they alas! did never hear 
Of the Angel's visit to this sphere. 
For have they ever said one word 
To mate or man, or beast or bird. 
THE CHRIST CHILD. 
On a starry, wintry night, 
       Frosty and cold was the air, 
And the lowly yale where Bethlehem stood, 
       Looked bleak, and barren and bare. 
Her streets deserted and dim, 
       Lit only by myriads of stars, 
That with shimm'ring light illumined the night,— 
       Among them was fiery Mars. 
Adown 'mid the yalley so drear 
      Knelt men, in wonder and fear, 
For lo ! in the distance a bright star had risen 
       Wondrously brilliant and clear. 
Then an Angel's yoice they heard 
       In heayenly tones it said, 
To yon I bring “glad tidings of joy," 
       “Fear not nor be dismayed." 
Go follow that star, 'twill lead 
      To the Christ-child's lowly bed, 
Though Israel's King, He sleeps in an "inn" 
      Where the cattle oft are fed.
 
Then oyer the humble place 
       Where the Royal Babe was laid, 
Did the “Star of the East,” blest Bethlehem’s star, 
       Irradiate no more to fade. 
O! brightest and best they cried,
       Our long promised Israel's King, 
Shine out from afar, thou bright morning star,
       To thee our offerings we bring. 
Bethlehem! blest city of old 
       Like pilgrims to Mecca we come, 
To thy hallowed site, on each Christmas night, 
        The Christ-child's humble home.
BELLS OF ST. MICHAEL. 
Come and listen to the chiming 
        Of St. Michael's merry bells, 
When the joyous Christmas morning, 
        All of Bethlehem's story tells. 
When they sweetly chime the anthem 
        "Glory to be to God on high," 
When the children swell the chorus, 
        Earth to heaven seems very nigh.
 
On the gladsome Easter morning, 
       When the earliest flow'rets bloom, 
Snowdrops pure and violets purple 
       Blend to scatter sweet perfume; 
Then your happiest notes are poured forth, 
       Then your Jubilee is heard, 
Pealing out in joyful accents, 
       Chiming, "God is very good." 
From that ancient lofty turret, 
        Overlooking land and sea, 
Peals of comfort have been wafted, 
        Sounds of gladness o'er the lea. 
Many a storm-tost, weary wanderer 
        Looked to thee as hope's bright star, 
Listened to thy mellow chiming, 
        Smiling as he crossed the bar. 
Ah! old bells, beneath your tolling, 
       Many a form lies buried low, 
‘Neath the green-sward of “God's Acre,” 
       Rest they, all their sorrows o'er. 
Softly wave the bending willows, 
       Sweetly sing the birds their lays,
Whilst thy dear old bells are clanging, 
       They are singing hymns of praise. 
Dear old bells your music thrills me, 
     Whether rung in joy or woe, 
They recall the joyous spring time 
      Of fond memory's “long ago”
Sweetly chime through all the ages; 
      As time's cycles swiftly move; 
Peal forth loudly, Grod is gracious; 
      Whisper softly, He is love. 
THE EXILE'S REVERIE. 
'Twas sunset's hour, the glorious day 
Had in its beauty passed away: 
      The sun had bathed in golden dyes 
      This Southern land of sunny skies; 
And crimson clouds, like birds of wing, 
Did o'er the earth their radiance fling; 
       While zephyrs sang amid the trees, 
        And song-birds warbled to the breeze; 
For Spring, just bursting into birth, 
Had come once more to gladden earth. 
Near Pensacola's margin, lay, 
Laved by its never ceasing spray,
      The exile, from his native land 
      The dweller on a foreign strand. 
And as he lay kind thoughts of home 
Like visions of the past did come; 
      And mem'ry's mirror pictured clear 
      The starlight of his boyhood there; 
The hopes that clustered round his brow, 
The shrine at which he loved to bow. 
He mused aloud, Oh! Italy! 
Land of the chivalric, the free! 
      Bruce may of Scotland tune his lyre. 
      But thee alone, can'st me inspire. 
Birthplace of beauty! never more 
Shall I behold thy vine-clad shore; 
       The sward where I in childhood play'd— 
       The haunts deep in the forest shade— 
The place where, mould' ring in decay,
The ashes of a sire lay. 
Why did I leave thee?    As spring flowers 
Return no more through summer hours 
        When once they blossom, bear and die, 
        No more will bloom neath sultry sky; 
So heart of man when hopes have fled, 
And love lies buried with the dead, 
        No second spring time sends one ray 
        To cheer his path through life's dark day; 
Hope's blossoms like the early dew 
Once passed away, naught can renew. 
Still I live on, and oft, at eve 
My isolated cot I leave; 
        Thence to this lonely nook I hie 
        To take a glance at days gone by. 
Each blue wave hastening to its goal 
(Fit type of the immortal soul) 
        In thrilling accents seems to say 
        Thou'rt nearing fast life's closing day; 
Thou soon wilt reach thy better home, 
The home where changes never come. 
THE SNOW STORM. 
Gentle as a maiden's dream, 
Softly as the gliding stream, 
      Falls the glittering, sparkling snow. 
With its wealth of crystal pearls— 
Shining, pure-white coronals, 
With its robe of silvery sheen, 
Decking earth like virgin queen. 
As the noiseless flakes descend,
As they downward quickly tend,
      Floating waves of downy snow. 
Garnered from the upper realms; 
Harvested by unknown hands, 
Gulfed from cloudland's brightest bower, 
Sent to earth as richest dower. 
Symbol pure, and emblem sweet! 
Type of purity! 'twere meet 
      That many swell the strain attuned. 
Clad with garb like angels wear— 
Robed in heaven's holiest gear— 
Pure, white snow, I welcome thee,
Hymning lays of minstrelsy. 
MAIDEN AND RIVER. 
Maiden—River, why in ceaseless flow 
                 Must yon ripple to and fro? 
                       Stop a while. 
                 Lonely on thy bank I stand, 
                 On your shining, pebbly strand, 
                 Canst thou not a moment stay 
                 Through the long, long summer day? 
                       Stop a while. 
River—Child of earth dost thou not know 
                Ne'er can cease my endless flow? 
                      I must go. 
                Onward till I reach my outlet, 
                Out beyond the golden sunset, 
                Seek not then to stay my flowing, 
                Onward still I must be going 
                      To my goal. 
Maiden—River, when the storms are raging, 
                 Wind and rain a warfare waging, 
                        Do you fear? 
                 When thy waves with whitened crest, 
                  Toss around in wild unrest,
                  Doth thy bosom shake with fear, 
                  Trembling, lest thy end is near? 
                        Say, O! say. 
River—Child, my race will ne'er be run 
                  Not till yonder blazing sun 
                        Fades away. 
                  Look t'wards the horizon's crest, 
                  See the mighty Ocean's breast, 
                  Now its billowy waves are still, 
                  He who says it is My will, 
                        Keepeth me. 
Maiden—River, should'st thou chance to see, 
                  On thy journey through the lea, 
                        Snow white sail? 
                  Reaching out towards the clouds, 
                  Quivering with its massive shrouds, 
                  Touch it gently with thy arms, 
                  Shield it safe from rude alarms, 
                       It is mine. 
River—Child of earth hast thou not heard? 
                  That He knows of beast and bird 
                        Every hair, 
                  Can He not then bring to thee 
                  Safe from o'er the murmuring sea. 
                  Mortal child O! ne'er despair, 
                  “Ship ahoy!” may greet thy ear, 
                        Soon, ay soon. 
Maiden — River, then glide sweetly on, 
                  Till thy goal is safely won,
                         Till at last 
                  Thou dost hear like thunder roar, 
                  Breaking from the golden shore, 
                  Awful words from saered lore, 
                  Time for thee shall be no more. 
                        River, farewell. 
CHICAGO EXPOSITION ODE. 
Columbia, all hail! 
      May thy banner ne'er be furled 
Till Liberty, with her beauteous rays, 
      Enlighten all the world. 
Columbia, to thee 
      From every clime we come, 
To lay our trophies at thy feet— 
      Our sunbright, glorious home. 
                       * * * 
'Twas a lovely autumn morn, 
      And the leaves were turning red, 
And the sturdy oaks and graceful pines
      Their branches over-spread; 
And the breezes softly swept 
      The hills and valleys o'er; 
And the dew-kissed earth with incense sweet, 
      Crowned forest, grove and flower. 
On a grassy knoll near by 
      Where the rustling leaves were piled, 
Knelt a mighty chief of a mighty tribe, 
      And his band of warriors wild. 
For the rising sun had shown 
      To the trained eyes of that band, 
That vessels three, like white- winged birds, 
      Were steering straight for land. 
Whence comes this stranger fleet? 
      Whence hails this Pale Face crew? 
And the chieftain's brow was wrapped in pain 
      As his tomahawk he drew. 
Then, with quivering voice, he said 
      Some evil may betide; 
From the land of the sky this host has come— 
      Let's haste to the river side. 
And the warriors started forth 
      Like fawns through the forest trees; 
When lo! what a wondrous, solemn sight— 
      “Pale Faces" on their knees! 
Before the Holy Cross, 
      Each with uncovered brow,
Prayed the mighty God, that His blessings e'er 
      Might this fair land endow. 
And the stalwart braves—awe-struck—, 
      With heads bowed low on breast 
As the veteran sailor proudly cried 
      San Salvador, the blest! 
And this first, grand solemn act 
      Has been chronicled in heaven; 
For, from East to West of this broad, fair land, 
      Has God's benison been given. 
Then hail! bright, sunny land! 
      Home of the free, the brave! 
From the eastern shores to the western plains, 
      Let thy banner proudly wave. 
Nations beyond the seas 
      Shall worship at thy shrine; 
Honor and wealth, and matchless power, 
      Columbia! be thine. 
ATLANTA EXPOSITION ODE. 
''Cast down your bucket where you are," 
From burning sands or Polar star 
From where the iceberg rears its head 
Or where the kingly palms outspread; 
'Mid blackened fields or golden sheaves, 
Or foliage green, or autumn leaves, 
Come sounds of warning from afar, 
“Cast down your bucket where you are." 
What doth it matter if thy years 
Have slowly dragged 'mid sighs and tears? 
What doth it matter, since thy day 
Is.brightened now by hope's bright ray. 
The morning star will surely rise,
And Ethiop's sons with longing eves 
And outstretched hands, will bless the day,
When old things shall have passed away. 
Come, comrades, from the East, the West! 
Come, bridge the chasm. It is best. 
Come, warm hearts of the sunny South, 
And clasp hands with the mighty North. 
Rise Afric's sons and chant with joy. 
Good will to all without alloy; 
The night of grief has passed away— 
On Orient gleams a brighter day. 
Say, ye that wore the blue, how sweet 
That thus in sympathy we meet, 
Our brothers who the gray did love 
And martyrs to their cause did prove. 
Say, once for all and once again, 
That blood no more shall flow in vain; 
Say Peace shall brood o'er this fair land 
And hearts, for aye, be joined with hand. 
Hail! Watchman, from thy lofty height; 
Tell us, O tell us of the night? 
AY ill Bethlehem's Star ere long arise 
And point this nation to the skies? 
Will psneans ring from land and sea 
Fraught with untrammelled liberty 
Till Time's appointed course be run,
And Earth's millenium be began? 
"Cast down your bucket," let it be 
As water flows both full and free! 
Let charity, that twice blest boon 
Thy watchword be from night to morn. 
Let kindness as the dew distil 
To friend and foe, alike, good will; 
Till sounds the wondrous battle-call, 
For all one flag, one flag for all. 
STARS AND STRIPES. 
Hail Flag of the Union! Hail Flag of the free! 
That floateth so proudly o'er land and o'er sea 
Thy Stars and thy Stripes, in grandeur doth wave 
O'er hearts that are true and hands that are brave. 
When first thy bright pennant was lifted on high, 
When first 'twas unfolded to patriot's eye; 
The ovation that greeted thee, rose through the air 
Like incense from altars of hearts true and dear. 
Hail Flag of our country, when thrown to the breeze 
Thy power is acknowledged, far over the seas. 
Thy influence so boundless, that none may deny, 
Thy potency reaches all lands, 'neath the sky. 
Should war like a dark cloud, encircle our land, 
With its threat 'ning besom o'ershadow the main. 
With head lifted high, thou would'st laugh them to scorn 
Who from thy tall flagstaff would try to pull down.
 
Long, long may thy Stripes and thy Stars proudly wave 
O'er hearts that are true and hands that are brave, 
And ne'er may thy children, resign to the foe 
The Flag that was baptized, in blood long ago. 
TO THE EAGLE. 
                  Fain would I rival thee 
                        Monarch of birds 
                  Soaring so loftily 
                        Up to the clouds! 
                  Spreading thy pinions 
                        And mounting on air,
                  Ethereally floating 
                        Divinely and fair. 
                  Where is thy resting place? 
                        Where dost thou dvrell? 
                  Is the mountain thy home 
                        Or the stern rock thy cell? 
                  Dost thou live in the desert? 
                        Is the forest thy lair? 
                  O, where is thy resting place? 
                        Eagle, say where? 
                  Always tending upward 
                        May this be my aim; 
                  Ne'er swerving from duty 
                        Or shrinking from pain. 
                  ‘Tis thus would I rival thee 
                        Monarch of birds, 
                  When soaring loftily 
                        Up to the clouds. 
THE CRUCIFICTION
"Why did the sun his beams conceal 
As if unwilling to reveal 
That deed of mankind on the day 
When Jesus, at the altar, lay 
      A willing sacrifice. 
Earth, too, in terror shook, when He 
The Mighty, died on Calvary; 
When for our sins He bowed His head, 
Gave up the ghost, and quickly sped 
      To regions of the dead. 
And some who had for ages long 
Been wrapped in slumber deep and strong, 
Awoke, and by their converse showed 
That death no more dominion had 
      In that He died. 
Why did He die?    Ah! blissful thought, 
When we near death and hell were brought, 
He left His Father's courts above— 
O, list to such amazing love— 
      And died to save. 
Why did He die?    'Twas love divine 
That caused Him all things to resign— 
A heavenly choir, celestial home, 
Exalted seat, seraphic song,
      And all to save. 
Blest thought! He reigns victorious now, 
To whom all earth will shortly how,
Let men below and saints above 
Wonder at such stupendous love,
      As caused their God to die. 
URANNE. 
In a far off hamlet near the sea 
Where billows oft, in days of storm, and 
Nights of darkness rush reckless to the shore; 
Where tall, white cliffs like watchmen keep 
A life-long vigil; Oft when the morning 
Sunbeams gild their lofty peaks they seem 
Like massive crystal vases adorned with 
Bays of gold. 
                  Hard-by those snowy cliffs,
Shielded safe from cutting winds and icy 
Blasts, stood an humble, unpretending cot, 
Its low, thatched roof of matted moss 
Glimmered, when the morning sun brightened 
Up the valley, and cast its rays aslant tli rough 
The tiny windows ignorant of glass.    Its well- 
Scrubbed floor shone like polished wood; 
And all around an air of quiet, peace and 
Love, prevailed. 
                  Within that cosy nest, there 
Dwelt three loving hearts, Nay, four, for on the 
Very morn when Christmas bells were 
Hinging o'er the land, When children of the rich 
And children of the poor alike, were talking 
Of the Christ-child, and his day, Unto them a 
Child was given, And this lovely babe, blest Christmas 
Gift, — was richly prized. E'en now she knew her 
Father's voice, and leaped with joy at his return. 
                                      * * * 
But ah! the cry of war, broke o'er the land.    Cruel 
War, that rends the households and the hearts; 
That makes fond bosoms bleed; and waters all 
The sod with tears, Salty, agonizing tears, which, 
When they dry, leave furrows never healing.— 
Sorrows, never ceasing. 
                  The mandate came.— 
Marco must go. What! leave the dear ones all 
Alone. The gray-haired sire sunning himself 
Without the cottage door? The little wife in 
Blooming womanhood? The cherub who in 
Human form had come to bless his home? 
Must he leave his treasures and away to 
Distant shores, perchance, lay clown to die? 
O! the thought was death itself.     Yet go he 
Must. Each day he'd wander through the glade, 
Where every blade and tuft of grass was dear, 
So dear. All his life from babe to manhood, 
Here was spent. Here he grew, and loved, 
And wedded. Here the precious Mother in her 
Green old age had yielded to the sharp scythe 
Of the Reaper Death.     Could he leave her? 
                  The day of 
Parting came. The sun was high when Marco 
Rose. The cheery little table decked with snowy 
Cloth was laid. Out from their frugal hoard 
Came every dainty Uranne could find. 
Naught was too good for him. The dear, the 
Faithful ! He who had done all in human power 
To make her life joyous.    Truly, she said, as tears 
Lingered in her eyes, "My lines in pleasant places 
Have been cast.”
                  "Well long they tarried o'er that 
Meal. It seemed as though 'twould never end, 
And yet they were not eating. At last the babe 
Stretched forth its chubby hands and with 
Infantile speech, broke up the silent meal. 
                  Marco arose,— 
Father, adieu. Take care of these as best thou 
Can 'st. I know the load is much too great for 
Thee. Whose silvery hairs are whitening o'er with age. 
Do all thou can'st and leave the rest to ki Him 
Who notes when e'en the sparrows fall." 
And now, Uranne ! truest and best, I can 
Not give thee any more my heart, for thou had'st 
It all long ago. Thy love to me has been like 
Silver lining 'mid the clouds of life. 
Has opened up my heart to kindlier feelings 
For all who on this earth have naught to cheer. 
To solace them in hours like these. 
                  But time doth 
Fly.    Whether the moments teem with joy or 
Flit in sorrow.    So Marco said, e're yet I go, 
Take this bunch of half -blown buds and place 
Upon your breast, near your heart, and wear 
Them till I come.    Let naught divide 'twixt 
Thee and them.    'Mid summer's glow or winter's 
Cold, loved one, wear them next thy heart. 
Their very name, Forget-Me-Not, will 'mind 
Thee of tliv lover-husband. 
                                      * * * 
                  Days, weeks, 
Months passed by.    No tidings yet had 
Come to them, in that lone village by the sea, 
Ofttimes the sire would hand-in-hand take 
Baby for a walk "by the sad, sea waves"— 
Then would the little one pick up shells 
And moss, and lisp so sweetly with 
Infantile grace, that the aged form would 
Straighten up, as if once more the fires of youth 
Burned brightly in his- veins; and his old 
Bereaved heart would leap for joy. 
                  Alas! when early 
Spring had come, and the little snowdrops 
Gleamed in the valley, little Bright-eyes 
Faded and was laid beneath them. 
O ! then the sun went down in blackness grim. 
And the whole world seemed devoid of life; 
Jfot worth living, the old man cried. And 
Then he, too, alas! was laid beside the babe. 
                  All through the long-, 
Long summer lonely Uranne dwelt. Her heart 
Low down beneath the Daisies. Uranne, the 
Pride of him who now, alas! was no more. Perchance 
He too was sleeping in that far-off land,
Without a kindly hand to smooth his aching 
Brow, or wipe from his cheeks the damp 
Death dews. 
                  One morning when the dew 
Had not yet left the sodden grass, 
She left the cot to look for her beloved. 
She sat her down 'mid the dingy rocks, which 
Girt the shore. The little ripples kissed her feet 
Caressingly. Long she looked for a white sail, 
To greet her tired eyes. 
                  Marco, dost hear Uranne's 
Call? Wilt thon no more return?    My heart is 
Breaking with its load. No longer can I wait,— 
But list! I'll whhisper in thine ear,— 
     The blue “Forget-Me Nots, 
     The sweet Forget Me Nots” which thou 
Did'st place upon my breast.    Thou wilt see them 
When thou com'st.    None shall them remove. 
Sweetheart, I keep them till you come. 
                  There they found her cold 
And stark.    With hand pressed close to heart 
Where lay her flowers.    The sounding sea seemed 
To forget to hurl its billows 'gainst the beach 
Now- white and shining.    E'en the little ripples 
Seemed to say, Uranne!     And the great 
Mountain rocks would echo back, Uranne! 
                  Years went by. The war, the 
Cruel war was at an end. And Peace with 
Flowing mantle had overspread the land;— 
With anxious heart, but willing feet, the 
Soldier started for his dear old cabin nestled 
So snugly in the valley.     Would he And them all? 
The dear old sire with his silvered hair—Perchance 
He had lain him down to sleep, beside the wife 
Who had left him in his prime. 
                  But she, the dear 
Uranne, she was there, no doubt of that.    A stronger, 
Healthier lass ne'er spun the dance. 
Then the baby, our baby.    How she must have 
Grown. "Wonder if she remembers me, her own dear 
Sire?    Who oft would soothe and rock to sleep. 
O yes; Uranne has taught her to love and lisp 
My name. 
                  When the proud vessel dropped her 
Anchor in the Bay, no prouder man, nor 
Hopeful, than was Marco.    Lightly he sprang 
Ashore. He looked to right, to left, no sign of 
His loved ones cheered his gaze. 
Uranne, he cried, What! no welcome for Marco? 
Xo outstretched arms to fold me in love's embrace? 
He tottered to the cot all overgrown with 
Weeds and trailing vines.    O ! stars above write 
On hardest stone, Desolate, forlorn—alone. 
Unconsciously he moved along the lane 
That led to the old church -yard.    The little 
Tuneful bell that had pealed so joyously 
On his marriage eve, was silent now. 
He saw no one, nor questions asked.    But 
Slowly crept to where three mounds were 
Raised all side by side. He closely scanned 
Them all, when lo! upon the longest grave, 
A beauteous tuft of blue Forget-Me-Xots— 
Aha! he cried, my bright, my blue Forget-Me-Nots! 
My flowers which I placed upon her breast, 
And bid her wear till we should meet again, 
My faithful one.    The seeds matured on thy 
Dear bosom, nourished by thine own mortality, 
Pushed their way to the sunlight of earth,    To 
Cheer and to 'mind of faithful love, 
Love which lasts even after the gates of 
Death are passed.    Then he wailed the whole 
Daylong: Come, O! come! Uranne, come! 
Like my flowers, leave your bed, too dark too 
Drear for thee.    Uranne, come to me! 
Or I will come to thee!
 
There they found him, there they laid him, 
With his flowers and Uranne. 
MAGNOLIA. 
Magnolia! "Pale city of the dead,”
Adown thy gravelled walks I tread, 
Thy marble pillars looming high, 
Thy polished shafts around me lie. 
With soft, mild rays, the winter sun 
Thy tortuous pathways doth illume,
The weeping-willow droops its head,
To crown the "City of the Dead.”
On every side death's tracks I see,
His footsteps grim encompass me,
The high-born here, the lowly there, 
The proud man there, the humble here. 
The rich has left his golden hoard, 
]S"o more he sits at festive board, 
He could not bribe relentless death, 
"With all his garnered stores of wealth. 
Here lies a maiden spotless fair, 
"Whose claim on life for many a year 
Seemed sure. Bur the grim Eeaper smiled, 
And bending, claimed her for his child. 
So lovingly they made her bed. 
And tenderly these garlands spread,
Bright emblems of a stricken flower, 
Xow blooming in a sunnier bower. 
And here an infant's grave I see,
Ere sin could stain its purity,
It plumed its wings and upward soared,
To live forever with its God. 
Though fair the earth, it would not stay, 
Much fairer still the land away. 
Restrain me not, for I would go
Where crystal fountains endless flow. 
With slow, sad steps I press me on 
To a majestic tower of stone. 
That tells me they who sleep around 
Had for their country's weal laid down 
Their lives. Ah ! many a widowed heart 
Hath bent and broke with sorrow's dart, 
For him who now beneath the sod,
Yielded his spirit to his God. 
And many a youth with trappings gay, 
'Mid martial music liveliest, lay, 
No more in life returned to bless 
Their loved ones with a fond caress, 
But laid them down to their last sleep 
In stranger land. Now angels keep 
A loving vigil o'er each grave, 
And bending branches o'er them wave. 
City of Shadows! fondly keep 
The loved who in thy bosom sleep, 
Shielded from every earthly care, 
They rest secure and free from fear. 
Let grasses green and flow'rets bright, 
Always illume thy paths with light, 
Till from the heavens loud and clear, 
Resounds the invitation dear, 
"Come up and meet me in the air, 
     My people."
 
TO MY MOTHER. 
I took up the burden of life anew 
     When she, the pure-hearted, died; 
When the golden cord was rent in twain, 
     And she faded from my side. 
When the eyes grew dim that were wont to glow 
     With the holy light of love, 
And the spirit, freed from earthly care, 
     Sped to its rest above. 
Oh, the dreary days! Oh, the weary nights! 
     Oh, the anguish, who can tell? 
When the light of my life went swiftly out, 
     And the shadow athwart me fell. 
For the wound was deep, and the woe was great, 
     And its poignancy will blight 
All the onward course of my future years, 
     Till my faith be turned to sight. 
I muse me now of the beautiful days, 
     The halcyon days of yore; 
And wonder if e'er on life's stormy sea 
     Such days I shall ever see more. 
The sky is as blue-tinted now as then, 
     And the sunlight just as bright; 
But they gladden me not as in other days 
     Ere she faded from my sight. 
The clouds with their purple and amber hues— 
     Their gossamer robes of snow— 
And the stars at the quiet twilight hour 
     In calm, clear beauty glow. 
And music sweet as Æolian harp 
     Is echoing far and wide— 
But, sure, naught gladdens my heart as before 
     She faded away from my side. 
O, Mother! in anguish I peer through the mists 
     Of a future, so dark without thee; 
The desert of life hath truly been blessed 
     "With an oasis sacred to thee. 
And oft to this green spot of beauty I turn, 
     My shrine of affection, my pride; 
For, surely, naught gladdens my heart as before 
     Thou fadedst away from my side. 
NESTLE-DOWN COTTAGE. 
As I sit by the ruddy oak fire, 
     And feel the grateful glow, 
Come memories sweet of a rustic cot, 
     That stood near the pebbly shore. 
With its porch so bright and sunny,
     Where the children loved to play, 
With the sounding shells, from the sandy beach, 
     All through the summer's day. 
Where, where are the blessed little ones 
     Whose childish voices sweet, 
Who made the sunny porch resound 
     With the patter of little feet? 
One where the South Seas wildly break, 
     And dash on the gleaming sand, 
Has made Him a home 'mid strangers, 
     Far, far from his native land. 
Another, the sweetest and dearest, 
     Has long 'neatli the daisies been laid, 
O! dark as a pall was the hour 
     When they whispered my darling was dead. 
The cottage still stands by the sea shore, 
     Our sunny, bright “Nestle-Down," 
But we ask so sadly where, O! where 
     Are the little children gone? 
MOTHER'S RECALL. 
Come back to me, O ye, my children: 
     Come back to the home as of yore; 
As my longing eye peers through the vista of years, 
     Comes the heart-throbbing more and more. 
I sit by the casement and listen 
     To the fall of the soft, sobbing rain, 
E'en the winds gently sigh as if loth to reply— 
     In vain, fond mother, in vain. 
Are ye gone for aye?    Shall I no more hear 
     The ring and the din of glee? 
Have my nestlings flown and left me alone? 
     Shall their faces, I no more see? 
I sit, and I wait while the days go by,
     And the months merge slow into years; 
Till the twilight deep and the mystic sleep, 
     And the hopes give place to fears. 
When the Christmas chimes with its holy rhymes 
     Ring out o'er the frosty plain, 
Then I sit, and sigh for the Li Sweet bye and bye"— 
     But the answer comes, wk Mother in vain." 
Each one of us, children, have gone forth 
     To fight out life's battles alone; 
And the future must prove if your labor of love. 
     Has, like bread on the waters, been thrown. 
So the twilight comes — and the fire burns low— 
     And the day is ebbing fast— 
Soon the merry chimes and the hallowed rhymes 
     Will be numbered with the Past. 
But with hopeful eyes I'll scan the skies, 
     Perchance, ere next Christmas-tide, 
Will my children come to their own dear home,
     And their place at mother's side. 
DEDICATED 
TO THE RIGHT REV'D D. A. PAYNE. 
Ohl! surely 'tis a theme sublime 
     That stirs my soul to-day; 
Awake then, muse nor slumber more, 
     Till sung the wondrous lay. 
My song shall be of one, whose youth 
     And strength were freely given 
To elevate, instruct, and lead 
     Benighted souls to heaven. 
My song shall be of him, whose hand 
     A mother's taste did mould; 
Whose precepts noble were to her 
     As apples of pure gold. 
I'll tell of one whose virtues rare 
     In modesty enshrined; 
Who bears a lasting laurel wreath 
     About his brow entwined. 
Who in the days that tried men's souls 
     Did ne'er from duty quail,
But wrought on ensign, lifted high,
     There's no such word as fail! 
Mem'ries so sweet are hov'ring round, 
     That I, with Psalmist, say 
“O! had I wings like turtle dove, 
     Quickly I'd fly away!”
Away, away beyond the hills 
     Where blooms the tree of life, 
Where limpid streams whose silent flow, 
     Ne'er stir the sea of strife. 
Oh! Bishop, Pastor, Friend, may'st thou 
     To green old age be spared; 
Then, like a fully ripened ear 
     Go to thy rich reward. 
OCTOBER. 
     Bright and beautiful art thou, 
     Autumn flowers crown thy brow, 
     Golden-rod and Aster blue, 
     Russet leaf with crimson hue. 
     Half stripped branches waving by, 
     Softly as a lullaby, 
     Tell of summer's days gone by, 
     Tell that winter's very nigh. 
     In the forest cool and chill, 
     Sadly moans the Whippoorwill, 
     Not as in the summer days, 
     When he gloried in his lays. 
     Lower-toned, but sweet and clear, 
     Like thy crisp and fragrant air, 
     Warbling forth with voice sublime,
     This is nature's harvest time. 
     Crickets chirp amid the leaves, 
     Squirrels hop among the trees,
     Brown nuts falling thick and fast,
     On the dewy, dying grass, 
     Glowing sun with softer rays,
     Harbinger of wintry days, 
     Tell the year is going by, 
     Sighing forth its lullaby. 
THE DYING GIRL. 
Sister darling, ope the window, let the balmy air once more 
Fan my flushed and throbbing brow as in the happy days of yore; 
I would gaze again in rapture on the brightly setting sun 
For I know, my gentle sister, that the goal is almost won. 
See the crimson clouds are hov'ring round the glorious orb of day, 
And the far-off hills are basking in its golden, garnished ray: 
Listen to yon forest warbler hymning sweet and joyous lay, 
Chanting forth its evening vespers to the sinking god of day. 
But sister, time is waning, after all it doth but seem 
That life is but a toilsome march, a weariness, a dream; 
And yet I do not murmur, for if all the joys of earth 
Had not faded from my vision ere they ripened into birth, 
If the shadows had not thickened as they clustered round my brow, 
Had I not turned from the altar, where I worshipped long ago, 
Perchance I might have reveled full too deep in human love, 
And forgotten God, my Maker, and my happy home above. 
So 'tis well, and now I'm going to join that spirit band, 
With their never-ceasing music, making glad that starry land; 
And I'm glad too, for I'm weary, and would rest me from my woe— 
Fain would land my stricken spirit on the banks of "Evermore." 
And O! my dearly loved one, when sorrows round thee press, 
Hurling each deadly missile on thy pure and youthful breast— 
Then think upon thy dear one, O! may ne'er thy footsteps rove! 
But meet me, surely meet me, in that happy home above. 
                                  * * *
Wight's shades huns* o'er the valleys and obscured the forest green— 
'Twas o'er; that happy spirit had been robed in spotless sheen,
So they laid her 'mong the flowers, and the zephyr's tuneful play 
Resounds a woodland recpiiem at the sunset of each clay. 
ALASKA. 
     With thy rugged, ice-girt shore,
     Draped in everlasting snow, 
          Thou'rt enthroned a queen. 
     Crown of moss and lichen grey, 
     Frosted o'er with ocean spray,
     All thy long, long wintry day,
          Dark and stern thy mien. 
     From the cloudland fresh and fair, 
     Falls the snow through crispy air, 
          Mantling vale and hill.
     Then old “Borealis" glows, 
     With his fiery light that shows,
     Frozen nature in repose.
          River, stream and rill. 
     On thy north the Polar Sea 
     Thunders forth in wild melee,
          'Mid gorges dark and steep
     Full many a ship with noble crew, 
     Lies low beneath thy waters bine, 
     Nor left behind a single clew,
          But sleep a dreamless sleep. 
     Beside the far famed Yukon stands 
     Hundreds of men from distant lands, 
          All with the same desire
     Gold, gold's the watchword, yellow ore, 
     That tempts him from his homestead door, 
     And Oh! alas he nevermore 
          May sit by household fire. 
     Ah! if men would only toil, 
     Dig and delve their own rich soil, 
          With vigor and with vim; 
     Forth would spring the golden corn, 
     Loud would ring the harvest song, 
     Life and health they would prolong, 
          All through nature's prime. 
     Under his own, his fruitful vine, 
     Beneath his laden fig tree green, 
          He, like a king, would reign. 
     Bending low with purple yield, 
     Rivalling fair Eschkol’s fields, 
     He'd a potent influence wield, 
          With his corn and wine. 
ON PARTING WITH A FRIEND. 
Can I forget thee?    No, while mem'ry lasts,
     Thine image like a talisman entwined, 
Around my heart by sacred friendship's ties 
     Remains unchanged, in love, pure love, enshrined. 
Can I forget thee?    Childhood's happy hours 
     Would like some flitting phantom mock and jeer; 
Life's sunny hours, would quickly lose their charm, 
     If Lethe's slumbrous waves but touched me there. 
Can I forget thee ? 'Tis a sad, sad thought, 
     That friend from friend should thus be ruthless riven— 
But list, methinks, a sweet voice whispers low, 
     Remember, no adieus are spoke in heaven. 
Can I forget thee ?    No, though ocean's waves 
     May madly leap and foam 'twixt you and me, 
Still o'er my stricken heart this yearning will remain, 
     Nor time estrange my love, dear one, from thee. 
And though on earth again we never more may meet, 
     In that bright Elysian where spirits, holy, dwell, 
May we in concert with that transported throng, 
     Unite, ne'er more (rapt thought) to say ''farewell!' 
TWILIGHT MUSINGS. 
I'm sitting by the hearthstone now, 
     And my heart is lone and drear; 
It seems as though the autumn blast 
     Had left its impress there. 
As memory, backward, wends its way, 
     Unfolding to my gaze 
Those joyful hours of “Auld Lang Syne,” 
     Those lights of by-gone days. 
I'm musing on the past, when I 
     In childhood's thoughtless play, 
Reveled in gladness, joy and mirth, 
     Nor deemed one saddening ray 
Should ever cloud my gladsome heart, 
     Or cause deep sorrow's moan— 
Ne'er dreaming of the time, alas! 
     When I'd be quite alone. 
I've listened to the morning's song 
     Of nature's feathered gems, 
Long ere Aurora's roseate hue 
     Illumined Orient's realms, 
And as their carols wafted high 
     On balmy zephyrs borne, 
'Tis then I muse, and sadly feel, 
     That I am quite alone. 
I've never heard the ocean's roar, 
     Or felt its quivering thrill; 
Nor, on stern Neptune's bosom been,
     When all was calm and still— 
But o'er my heart, at times, there are 
     Such stormy billows borne, 
That then I sadly, truly feel, 
     That I am quite alone. 
SONG TO ERIN. 
Oh! Erin my country, my ancestor's home! 
Impelled by my wants, I, from thee, had to roam; 
And now my heart yearneth, sore longeth for thee 
My dear native Ireland, my "gem of the sea." 
Oh! Erin my country, thou land of the brave! 
Who'll rescue from tyr'ny, who'll ransom and save? 
Thy despots so strong, are still wielding their power,
To bind thee in slavery both now and forever. 
Speak! speak! who will rescue our Emerald Isle? 
Now bowed by the oppressor in servitude vile! 
Her sons are all scattered, her daughters are gone, 
And she is left desolate, forlorn and alone. 
I‘ll sigh for thee Erin, when spring winds doth fan, 
With musical breathings, this far distant land; 
‘Twill remind me of youth's happy days on thy shore— 
Of days, mournful thought, I shall never see more. 
I'll weep for thee Erin, as tlie blue waters surge, 
Shall re-eclio my wailing, sliall chant the sad dirge; 
Of Ireland in slavery, once land of the free; 
Of Ireland, my country, my "gem of the sea." 
THE VALENTINE. 
     Lady with thine eyes of beauty 
          Rivaling cerulean flowers, 
     Where the love- beams seem to linger, 
          Throughout youth's bright, sunny hours. 
     With thy smile of witching sweetness 
          Like the magnet's mystic art, 
     Charming oft enchanting oft'ner, 
          Drawing to thee every heart. 
     But, fair lady, I'll no longer 
          Linger thus o'er nature's mould, 
     ‘Tis thy spirit's beauty charms me, 
          More than mines of Peru's gold. 
     Like an exile who hath wandered 
          Far from kindred and from home, 
     Pants and longs once more to greet them, 
          Never more on earth to roam;— 
     Like the tempest-tossed, the weary, 
          Who of earth ne'er had their part, 
     Fain would land their stricken spirits 
          Where heart answers unto heart;— 
     So this bosom when overflowing
          With some latent, deadly grief, 
     Loves to revel in the music 
          Of thy voice to find relief. 
     And when joys do hover 'round me, 
          Weaving chaplets rich and bright, 
     I'd away from pleasures turn me 
          To my beautiful "Starlight." 
     Lady! could I seal thy future, 
          All of bliss and love 'twould be; 
     And when time with us is ended, 
     Spend eternity with thee. 
LINES TO FLORENCE. 
I am sitting sad and lonely 
     Where I've often sat before, 
And I am musing, fondly musing 
     Of my Florence who pass'd o'er. 
Pass'd into the realms supernal, 
     Far 'bove cloud-lands lofty height; 
Yonder 'mid the fields Elysian, 
     Dwells my “Flor" ‘mong saints of light. 
'Twas when autumn leaves were falling, 
     'Twas when harvest days had come, 
That, King Death, the mighty reaper, 
     Came to take my darling home. 
When the winds were softly sighing, 
     Zephyrs breathing low and deep, 
Lulled to rest by such sweet music, 
     My bright treasure fell asleep. 
Closely clasped to mother's bosom 
     On the well-nigh bursting breast, 
Lay the early stricken floweret, 
     Lay the heart so near its rest. 
And those little eyes upturning, 
     Brimful with their wealth of love, 
Mutely, though with earnest language, 
     Said, I'm hastening up above. 
Well, ere long, they said my darling 
     Had this earth exchanged for heaven—
She had upward spread her pinions, 
     Leaving hearts with anguish riven. 
Yes;    the autumn's wind so plaintive, 
     With its music soft and deep, 
Woo'd my birdie from my bosom, 
     And she sweetly fell asleep. 
But when time with me is over, 
     When my fleeting years have passed, 
Oh ! I trust once more to greet her, 
     And this parting be the last; 
So, till then I wait expectant— 
     I, the Master's time doth ''bide”—
But to me the hour is precious, 
     That my little Florence died. 
"BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON." 
By the Rivers of Babylon we mournfully bent, 
With " harps on the willows” and vesture all rent, 
For burdened by sorrow and saddened by pain, 
We felt that we no more could strike them again. 
This, this is a strange land, we will not then sing 
One song of our Zion, the home of our King, 
No rather let right hand its cunning forget, 
Than we to our loved home as recreants act. 
O! City of God, though as captives we go, 
Jerusalem's weal we'll never forego, 
O! soon may the exiles of Israel return, 
To sing Zion's songs in their own holy land. 
THE PEN. 
Mightier than the sword thou art, 
Thou can'st pierce like venomed dart, 
Time and space count naught with thee, 
Leagues of land or leagues of sea. 
Thou can'st waves of passion calm, 
Griefs assuage like Gilead's balm, 
Bring sweet pleasure to the eye, 
Give sweet gladness for the sigh. 
When thy little point is prest, 
Oft it wounds some gentle breast, 
Filling chalice to the brim, 
Darkening life with sorrows grim. 
Learned sage in days gone by, 
Scanned thee with prophetic eye, 
Said to myriads then unborn 
Thou would 'st rule on many a throne.
 
Swords may stab with savage ire, 
Glistening out like rays of fire, 
They can ne'er thy power attain, 
O'er the sea or o'er the main. 
Mightier than the sword art thou, 
Lo! on many a regal brow 
Furrows which thy point has wrought, 
Troubles which thy work has brought. 
Mightier than the sword art thou, 
List! a maid records her vow, 
That so long as life shall last, 
Ne'er a doubt shall love o'ercast 
Naught of bliss or naught of woe, 
But thou can'st on man bestow, 
With thy tiny pointed prow, 
Mightier than the sword art thou. 
PASSING OF THE OLD YEAR.
Ah! the year is slowly dying,
And the wind in tree-top sighing, 
     Chant his requiem. 
Thick and fast the leaves are falling, 
High in air wild birds are calling, 
     Nature's solemn hymn. 
In the deep, dark forest lingers, 
Imprints of his icy lingers, 
     Chill, and dark, and cold. 
And the little streamlets flowing, 
Wintry sun so softly glowing, 
     Through the maple's gold. 
So, Old Year, gird on your armor, 
Let not age, nor fear, nor favor, 
     Hurry you along. 
List! the farewell echoes pealing, 
List! the midnight hour is stealing,
     Hark! thy dying song. 
Say, Old Year, ere yet your death knell 
Rings from out yon distant church bell, 
     Say, what have yon done? 
Tell of hearts you've sadly broken, 
Tell of love dead and unspoken, 
     Ere your course is run. 
Tell the mother who doth languish, 
O'er her graves in silent anguish, 
     She will see again. 
Blooming bright "beyond the river”
Living on for aye and ever, 
     Every bright-eyed gem. 
Ah! full many a spirit weary,
You have wooed from paths so dreary, 
     Wafted them above. 
Now they say Old Year we bless thee,
Raise thy head, we would caress thee 
     For this home of love. 
On thy brow lies many a furrow, 
And thy eyes tell many a sorrow 
     Hath its shadow cast. 
But thy task is almost ended, 
Soon the path which thou hast wended, 
     Will be called the "Past.”
Then, old dying year we hold thee, 
To our hearts we fondly fold thee, 
     Ere the midnight bell. 
Soon thy race will now be ende, 
With Eternity be blended, 
     So, Old Year, farewell. 
SONNET TO MY FIRST BORN. 
Oh! waves in the sunlight gleaming,
     Oh! billows w r ith ceaseless roar,
Bring back to this aching heart of mine, 
     The laddie you bore long ago. 
Far out on on your restless bosom, 
     Far away from his boy-hood's home, 
I charge you waves of the deep, blue sea 
     To bid my wanderer come. 
Oh! stars in the heavens twinkling 
     Like lamps hung up in the sky, 
Oh! moon look do wn through the darkness, 
     His try sting-place you may descry. 
Then tell him a fond heart is aching, 
     In love for the dear one she bore, 
Oh! surely to thee he will hearken, 
     And haste to his own cottage door. 
The winds of the autumn are sighing, 
     The leaves from the trees falling fast, 
The roses that erstwhile were blooming, 
     Say mournfully—Summer is past. 
The daisies have long ago slumbered, 
     Their blossoms I search for in vain; 
But surely for thee I will look, love, 
     Ere spring time brings them again. 
When the Frost-King's robe is glistening 
     O'er hill, and valley, and glen, 
When the bright sleigh-bells are jingling, 
     I know he'll come to me then. 
So sunlight, or starlight, or moonlight, 
     Wherever my truant you see, 
Just tell him you left me a-waiting 
     Far over the deep blue sea. 
LINES TO -------------- 
O come to me in my dreams love! 
     When the world is wrapped in sleep, 
And the silver moon like virgin queen, 
     Her lonely vigils keep. 
When all is hushed in calm repos — 
     The earth, and sky, and sea, 
Then hasten love to this far-off land, 
     And dwell one hour with me. 
O come to me in my dreams love! 
     And cheer me on my way; 
And bid me look to a higher land 
     For the dawn of a brighter day. 
Then breathe to heaven an earnest prayer 
     To bless, ere you depart, 
With perfect love and childlike faith, 
     This sad, despondent heart. 
O, do not forget to come, love, 
     But on rosy pinions haste, 
And deluge my willing ear, with 
     Mementoes of the past. 
And tell me, too, of that distant land, 
     Its sunshine and its flowers; 
And in return my strain shall be 
     Magnolia's bright bowers. 
Ah, do not fail to come love, 
     For I'll woo my slumber to-night; 
I'll lay me down to sweet repose, 
     And wait for thee and light. 
Then hie to my bower on wings of love, 
     Ah, linger not by the way, 
But solace this heart and bid it hope, 
     For the dawn of a brighter day. 
HIGHLAND MARY. 
Will you leave the hills of Scotland? 
     Your childhood's happy home, 
To brave the dangers of the deep, 
     In foreign lands to roam— 
Say, Mary, will you, for my sake 
     Leave yonder joyous cot— 
Your youthful friends and scenes so dear, 
     To share a soldier's lot? 
The battle's din, my Mary, 
     Has never met thine ear, 
The woodlands' songsters melody 
     Is all that thou dost hear. 
The vivid flash of musketry— 
     The cannon's thundering roar 
Must meet thine eye, burst on thine ear 
     Sounds never heard before. 
And now, fond one, I've told you all. 
     And I can say no more— 
“Will you go to the Indies, my Mary, 
     And leave old Scotia's shore?”
THE CHEROKEE. 
‘Twas a cloudless morn and the sun shone bright, 
     And dewdrops sparkled clear; 
And the hills and the vales of this Western land 
     Were wreathed with garlands rare. 
For verdant spring with her emerald robe 
     Had decked the forest trees; 
Whilst e'er and anon the vine-clad boughs 
     Waved in the playful breeze. 
All, all was still, not a sound was heard, 
     Save the music of each tree, 
As gracefully it bent and bowed 
     Its branches o'er the lea. 
But hark! a sound, 'tis the Red mail's tread, 
     Breaks on the silent air; 
And a sturdy warrior issues forth, 
     Robed in his native gear. 
And wandering on, he neared the brook; 
     Then sat him down to rest; 
'Twas a noble sight—that warrior free— 
     That Monarch of the West. 
He gazed around. O! a wistful gaze 
     Saddened his upturned brow, 
As he thought of those he'd fondly loved,
     Of those now laid so low. 
He mused aloud “Great Spirit!” list 
     To the Indian's earnest plea; 
And tell me why, from his own loved home, 
     Must the Indian driven be. 
When the "Pale Face" came to our genial clime, 
     We wondered and were glad; 
Then hied us to our chieftain's lodge,
     Our noble “Flying Cloud.” 
We told him all, and he calmly said 
     He'd gladly give them place; 
And if friends they proved, perchance, extend 
     The calumet of peace. 
But soon, alas! the dread truth rang 
     That the Pale Face was our foe; 
For he made our warriors bite the dust—
     Our children lie so low. 
So now, my own, dear, sunny land, 
     Each, woodland and each dell,
Once the Indian's home, now the Indian's grave, 
     I bid a last farewell. 
To the “Great Spirit's" hunting-ground, 
     To meet my long-lost bride,
My "Raven Wing" I gladly hie— 
     He said, then calmly died. 
RALLY SONG. 
Come, let us join this festal lay— 
     Hurra, Hurra, 
Come, let us join this festal lay, 
And let our anthems all be gay, 
And sing aloud for this glad day 
     Should brighten every heart:— 
We'll sing of heroes who have fought— 
     Hurra, Hurra, 
We'll sing of heroes who have fought, 
Who to their country's altar brought,
And on her sacred ensign wrought,
     The tree of liberty. 
We'll sing of martyrs who have died— 
     Hurra, Hurra, 
We'll sing of martyrs who have died, 
From severed ranks, as side by side 
They bravely stemmed the gory tide. 
     To ransom brother man. 
Our glorious banner's now unfurled— 
     Hurra, Hurra, 
Our glorious banner's now unfurled, 
May it soon wave o'er all the world, 
And every traitor standard hurled 
     From pinnacle to earth. 
With gifted leaders in our van— 
     Hurra, Hurra, 
With gifted leaders in our van, 
The bright and noblest of our land, 
Let patriots shout, as, hand in hand, 
     They welcome this glad day. 
SERENADE. 
     Sleep, love sleep, 
     The night winds sigh, 
     In soft lullaby. 
     The Lark is at rest 
     With the dew on her breast, 
     So close those dear eyes,
     That borrowed their hue 
     From the heavens so blue, 
     Sleep, love sleep. 
     Sleep, love sleep, 
     The pale moon looks down 
     On the valleys around, 
     The Glow Moth is flying, 
     Th South wind is sighing, 
     And I am low lying, 
     With lute deftly strung, 
     To pour out my song, 
     Sleep, love sleep 
THE COMING WOMAN. 
Just look, 'tis a quarter past six, love— 
     And not even the flies are caught; 
Well, you know I must be at the office— 
     But, as usual, the breakfast’ll be late. 
Now hurry and wake up the children; 
     And dress them as fast as you can; 
"Poor dearies,” I know they'll be tardy, 
     Dear me, “what a slow, poky man!” 
Have the tenderloin broiled nice and juicy— 
     Have the toast browned and buttered all right; 
And be sure you settle the coffee: 
     Be sure that the silver is bright. 
When ready, just run up and call me— 
     At eight, to the office I go, 
Lest poverty, grim, should overtake us— 
     “‘Tis bread and butter," you know. 
The bottom from stocks may fall out, 
     My bonds may get below par; 
Then surely, I seldom could spare you 
     A nickel, to buy a cigar. 
All ready? Now, while I am eating, 
     Just bring up my wheel to the door; 
Then wash up the dishes; and, mind now. 
     Have dinner promptly at four; 
For to-night is our Woman's Convention, 
     And I am to speak first, you know— 
The men veto us in private, 
     But in public they shout, “That's so." 
So "by-by"—In case of a rap, love, 
     Before opening the door, you must look; 
O! how could a civilized woman 
     Exist, without a man cook. 
ODE TO PEACE. 
     Come Peace, on snowy pinions,
          Come, nestle like a dove; 
     Encircle earth's dominions 
          With harmony and love. 
     Let anger, pride and malice, 
          And strife forgotten lie; 
     Nor from tlieir venomed chalice, 
          Quaff more bitter draughts and die. 
     Come Peace, with arms extended, 
          Come, brood o'er this fair land; 
     Let battle scenes be ended, 
          And heart be joined with hand. 
     Let fields now crimsoned over, 
          With the life-blood of the brave, 
     Loom as monuments of warning, 
          Shine, as beacon lights to save. 
     Come Peace, a welcome waits thee, 
          From many a stricken life; 
     And many a heart-crushed mourner, 
          Now weary of the strife; 
     Methinks e'en now a footfall 
          Breaks like music on my ear, 
     As the distant sound of gladness, 
          When 'tis borne on summer's air. 
     May the echoes prove prophetic; 
          May thy murmurs from afar 
     Shed a radiance as refulgent, 
          Beam as bright as Bethlehem's Star. 
     And the hearts that have been riven, 
          And the bosoms that have bled, 
     Soon will change their griefs to gladness, 
          Yield to God and earth their dead. 
A REVERIE. 
Yon may speak of a grave in a distant land, 
     Or of one 'neath ocean's foam, 
Where the dolphins play o'er the sunny spray,
     Far from the dear old home; 
"Where the coral peaks form a glorious tomb, 
     And the mighty waters lave, 
But there is naught in the wide world sought 
     Like the heart's deep anguished grave. 
You may tell of a grave 'neath the burning sands 
     Of the tropics fevered zone; 
Where silence reigns o'er the desert plains 
     So desolate, so forlorn. 
Where the lion's roar is the liveliest sound 
     That o'er that waste is heard— 
And the forest bird hymns a plaintive lay, 
     A requiem for the dead. 
Again you may tell of a grave unsought 
     Far from the home of youth; 
Where the willow weeps as the exile sleeps 
     Akin to Mother Earth. 
But O! methinks, there's not a woe 
     That can the bosom cleave, 
Or as deeply wound, as the lowly mound 
     O'er the heart's deep, anguished grave. 
SUNSET. 
     All hail! thou gorgeous sunset, 
          With thy gold and purple clouds, 
     Tinting the vast horizon, 
          Like shadowy, fleecy shrouds. 
     The mountain crests are glowing, 
          The hills are crimson dyed, 
     The very air seems blushing, 
          Bathed in thy amber tide. 
     Soon the twilight shadows falling 
          Will thy glory chase away, 
     And weary man will welcome 
          The closing of the day. 
     Then the moon in silvery brightness, 
          Will show her pale, sad face; 
     And the stars as her attendants, 
          Will stud infinite space. 
     Low down amid the valley 
          Soon we'll hear the night-bird's song, 
     Calling softly to the south wind, 
          That the day of toil is done. 
     Then hail! thou glorious sunset, 
          Who in fullness can portray 
     The varied, wondrous beauty 
          Of a summer's sunset day. 
THE PAST. 
The Past it is fraught with many a feeling 
     Of pleasure, of sadness, of joy, and of pain; 
And 'tis sweet of an eve when dewdrops are falling, 
     To reflect on the days that can ne'er come again. 
The Past, it is pleasant ! Ah, memory recalls 
     The period of childhood, when joyous and free, 
With innocence crowned, in purity robed, 
     We revelled in gladness and sported in glee. 
The Past, it is saddening ! full many a loved one 
     That joined in each pleasure, partook of each pain, 
Have passed on before, to the spirit land flown, 
     And left us below, till their prize we attain. 
The Past's irrevocable ! every word we've spoken, 
     Or action committed, been stamp 'd with its seal 
Immortal, enduring, 'twill stand sure forever, 
     As no time can efface, nor effulgence reveal. 
Then, then, should the Present be valued and used 
     As a boon from the Author and Giver of gifts; 
That so, when 'tis past, we could always enjoy 
     The pleasant assurance of its being well spent. 
MARRIAGE. 
     The die is cast, come weal, come woe, 
          Two lives are joined together, 
     For better or for worse, the link 
          Which naught but death can sever. 
     The die is cast, come grief, come joy. 
          Come richer, or come poorer, 
     If love but binds the mystic tie, 
          Blest is the bridal hour. 
FOR WHO? 
When the heavens with stars are gleaming 
     Like a diadem of light, 
And the moon's pale rays are streaming, 
     Decking earth with radiance bright; 
When the autumn's winds are sighing, 
     O'er the hill and o'er the lea, 
When the summer time is dying, 
     Wanderer, wilt thou think of me? 
When thy life is crowned with gladness. 
     And thy home with love is blest, 
Not one brow o'ercast with sadness, 
     Not one bosom of unrest— 
When at eventide reclining, 
     At thy hearthstone gay and free, 
Think of one whose life is pining, 
     Breathe thou, love, a prayer for me. 
Should dark sorrows make thee languish, 
     Cause thy cheek to lose its hue. 
In the hour of deepest anguish,
     Darling, then I'll grieve with you. 
Though the night be dark and dreary, 
     And it seemeth long to thee, 
I would whisper, “be not weary;” 
     I would pray love, then, for thee. 
Well I know that in the future, 
     I may cherish naught of earth; 
Well I know that love needs nurture, 
     And it is of heavenly birth. 
But though ocean waves may sever 
     I from thee, and thee from me,
Still this constant heart will never, 
     Never cease to think of thee. 
JUNE. 
     I am the month when roses 
          Bloom brightest o'er the glade, 
     I am the month when marriages 
          I lost happily are made. 
     Mine is the time of foliage,
          When hills and valleys teem 
     With buds and vines sweet scented, 
          All clothed in glowing green. 
     My nights are bright and starry, 
          My days are long and clear 
     And truly I'm the fairest, 
          Of all months in the year. 
     With night dews gently falling, 
          With bees upon the wing, 
     And tiny rills soft rippling 
          Amid the valleys sing. 
     The farmer with his ploughshare, 
          Swift turning up the sod, 
     His brawny arms at labor, 
          His soul with Nature's God. 
     The Lark with sweetest carol, 
          Doth greet the rising sun,
     The Mock-bird at the even, 
          Loud whistles day is done. 
     O! I'm the month of beauty, 
          The summer's crown I claim, 
     Now whisper to me softly, 
          And tell me what's my name. 
TRIBUTE TO A LOST STEAMER. 
O! sing ye a dirge for the loved and the lost, 
     That have found them a home 'neath the coral reefs deep; 
That have laid them to rest 'neath the murmuring surge, 
     Where the whistling wind wails o'er their sweet, but sad sleep. 
They have gone to their home—their last resting-place 
     The blue waves embraced and called them their own; 
While the depths of the sea and the billows thereof 
     Are mournfully sighing their sad requiem. 
Down, down through the mass of the waters they sped, 
     Amid the dark chambers so mystic, so drear; 
'Till perchance they selected some ruby-lit bed, 
     To sleep their last sleep 'mid jeweled gems rare. 
O! 'tis sweet now to ponder, though many have gone 
     To that far-off bourne whence no traveller returns, 
That the sea shall not always their bodies retain, 
     For Jehovah hath said, she must yield them again. 
One bright little jewel outlived the dark storm, 
     So fatal to many, yet—blissful to tell— 
His “Father in heaven" preserved him from harm, 
     O, parent rejoice! with your Louis 'tis well. 
A REQUIEM. 
O, insatiable monster! Could’st thou not 
In pity turn aside thy venom ed shaft 
From her my gifted, darling friend? 
Has sympathy within thy breast 
No trysting place? That thou must come 
At spring-time when the flowerets bloom 
To bear my loved one to the tomb? 
So young was she; life's woes had not yet dimmed 
The joyous sunshine of her girlhood's days; 
She did not quaff the dregs of time, 
But, like some rosebud prematurely culled, 
She sped away, and o'er her grave 
So peacefully the willows wave, 
And dewdrops, her calm bosom lave. 
Tread not the earth where sleeps my loved one's form; 
But place it lightly on her marble brow. 
Bid birdies sing at set of sun 
To gladden Fannie’s lowly home; 
Bid rippling springs with shining spray, 
And sylvan notes and songsters lay 
Unite, to chase the gloom away. 
Blest child! she did not tarry long, and yet,— 
O, happy thought—she did not live in vain, 
If truly she did seek and find 
The “Pearl of Price," that precious boon, 
Then ne'er to her could come too soon 
The summons to an early tomb. 
Blest child, rest! while gentle zephyrs breathe 
Their fragrance through the waving trees; 
All nature decked in gorgeous array 
Is reveling now, but soon alas! 
Like thee, 'twill fade.    The autumn's knell 
Will ere long peal like funeral bell 
Its dirge like sounds, "Friend, fare thee well." 
THE GRAFTED BUD. 
     Life's stormy surge had scarcely touched 
          Her blooming, beauteous brow. 
When rudely torn from earthly bliss, 
     A budded, broken flower. 
     Methinks I see her brilliant eye, 
          When smiles played softly there, 
     As gentle as the summer's breeze, 
          So radiant, sweet and clear. 
     But ah! frail nature gave away, 
          And she was doomed to die, 
     So young in years, so bright, so fair. 
          In the cold grave to lie. 
     So to the realms of light and life 
          Her uncaged spirit fled; 
     There to remain until the trump 
          Shall sound to wake the dead. 
     There with the Saviour she abides, 
          There tunes the sacred lyre, 
     Regardless of th' impending day, 
          And dreading not its ire. 
TO A LOVED ONE. 
          I'll think of thee, mine own, dear one 
                    As morn's first blushing ray 
          Diffuses light o'er the dim earth— 
                    Turns darkness into day. 
          I'll think of thee at eve, my love, 
                    When moon and star appear— 
          When in the horizon of my hope 
                    All, all is bright and clear. 
          I'll think of thee when joy doth cast 
                    Its gladness o'er my heart, 
          As peace, and love and happiness 
                    Seem new life to impart. 
          I'll think of thee when dark shades fall 
                    Athwart my fevered brow; 
          When low in death I hear thee lisp— 
                    "I'm waiting for thee now." 
          I'll think of thee, my darling one. 
                    While I have life and breath; 
          And seal the assurance fervently, 
                    I'll think of thee in death. 
THE NATIVITY. 
The gloom of night had overspread the land, 
Swaying its dread sceptre o'er every man; 
For superstition like a monarch reigned, 
And Adam's sons were fettered by its chain. 
When the fulfilment of the promise came, 
A Saviour! born to-day in Bethlehem; 
Gabriel, the news, the joyful news revealed 
By night, to some poor shepherds in the field.
 
Go now to Bethlehem, behold the Babe— 
Though Lord of all, He's in a manger laid! 
Among the horned cattle there you'll find 
The Prince of Peace, the Saviour of mankind. 
The Shepherds then in haste obeyed his word. 
Guided by flaming star to view their Lord; 
They entered in, when, judge of their surprise— 
An infant, a Redeemer, burst upon their eyes. 
Amazed, affrighted, trembling, they 
Gazed on the Babe as there He lay; 
Though in a manger yet He bore 
Rare tokens of Almighty power. 
TO THE MOCK-BIRD. 
Bird of the woodland, sing me a song, 
Fain would I list to thee, all the day long. 
Out from thy cosy nest, 'mid leafy bower, 
Lift high thy tuneful voice—'tis summer's hour. 
Bird of the forest, with voice sublime, 
Gladdening with thy music all summer time, 
E'en while the Autumn's winds bend low the trees, 
Sweetly still thy carols float with the breeze. 
Queen of the song-realm, what doest thou? 
Up amid the leaflets, rocking on the bough, 
Ah! little trickster, building thee a nest, 
Cosy, soft and warm, for thy wee ones to rest. 
Bird of the south-land, haste thee and bring 
Tributes of thy melody, welcoming the spring, 
Say to sombre winter—up and away, 
This my time of minstrelsy, bright, sunny May 
IN MEMORIAM
REV. SAMUEL WESTON. 
Oh! surely for thee were the gates ajar, 
     As thy chariot onward sped, 
When with brightened eye and youth renewed, 
     Triumphant thou did'st tread 
Through the gates of death, to the portals bright, 
     While the ransomed myriads sing, 
"Lift up your heads, ye Golden Gates," 
     Let the aged pilgrim in. 
No terrors for thee had the darksome vale, 
     For like the wise virgins of old, 
Thou keep'st thy lamp burning and trimmed from thy youth, 
     Till three-score and ten were well told. 
And oft, as a shepherd, that tends his flock, 
     Thou did'st then to still waters lead, 
And 'mid the green pastures of justified grace, 
     Thou lovedst thy children to feed. 
Then Pastor and Leader, fond Parent, adieu, 
     Till the last, grand trump shall sound, 
When shepherd and flock united once more, 
     Shall echo a long harvest home. 
TO REV. THADDEUS SALTUS. 
     Sleep, Christian warrior, sleep, 
          Life's fitful dream is o'er, 
     Thy pain-tossed bark is anchored 
          Safe on the golden shore. 
     ‘Neath the green sward we lay thee 
          Thus early to thy rest, 
     And press the sod thus lightly, 
          Upon thy gentle breast. 
     Though but in manhood's prime, 
          When the dread summons came, 
     To hush the voice so well attuned 
          To preaching  “In His Name." 
     Thou did'st not murmur, but with joy 
          Obeyed the Master's word, 
     And rapture crowned did'st enter 
          The palace of thy Lord. 
     Then sweetly sleep, dear Rector, 
          Thy grave we'll deck with flowers, 
     An earnest of that Better Land 
          Of ever blooming bowers. 
     Around this spot a halo twines, 
          While angels vigils keep, 
     And we rejoice that thus "He gives 
          To His beloved sleep." 
TRIBUTE TO 
CAPT. F.W. DAWSON
Carolina mourns to-day.    For he, the gifted 
Son of her adoption, is no more.    The voice 
That stirred the bosoms of her sons, and 
Made her ramparts ring from mount to 
Sea-board, is hushed in death.   His 
Noble form, and nobler mien that 
Never faltered 'mid the cannon's 
Roar, lies motionless. 
So Carolina weeps.     'Tis meet she should— 
Her chieftain lieth low.     In this 
Grand, old City by the Sea, this Venice 
Of the Southland.     The home he loved 
So well.     When the grey morn breaks, 
And when the twilight lingers, they 
Chant in low, sweet music, evening 
Vespers for his soul. 
Then, Carolinians, build a monument for him; 
But not on marble cold.     Not on 
Towering dome or polished shaft, 
Should his memory be engraved.     But 
In the hearts of those he loved and 
Served, should immortelles, perpetual, bloom; 
And incense, fragrant, ever rise 
To his memory. 
                          Requiescat in Pace. 
MRS. LOUISE B. WESTON. 
     My Mother! With the angels now, 
          Life's race completely run; 
     The Pilgrim's cross is laid aside, 
          The Christian's crown is won. 
     Full two-score years has thy frail bark 
          Relentlessly been driven, 
     Along the rugged shoals of time— 
          Now safely moored in heaven. 
      Some vision bright of Eden's land— 
          Some glimpse from Nebo's crest— 
     So ravished thy enraptured soul, 
          Then panting for its rest, 
     That when the City bathed in gold 
          Full burst upon your sight, 
     You would not tarry with us more; 
          Your spirit took its flight. 
     My Mother, when life's sands run low, 
          In love, in kindness come, 
     And take the spirit of thy child, 
          And bid her “welcome home.”
LINES TO MRS. ISABEL PEACE. 
'Tis said but a name is friendship, 
     Soulless, and shallow, and vain; 
That the human heart ne'er beats in response, 
     Or echoes sweet sympathy's strain. 
But to-day in "memory's mirror" 
     Came a dear and honored one. 
Whom in days gone by had lived and had loved. 
     Ere her heavenly goal was won. 
Her countenance beamed as of yore, 
     With radiant smiles of love,
And I felt that the friendship she lavished me here, 
     Had ripened in heaven above. 
I felt that her voice so winsome, 
     Attuned to holier rhymes, 
Would in soft cadence tell of friendship's truth, 
     Like harp of a thousand strings. 
Rise up and call her blest! 
     Ye children of her love, 
For a friendlier hand or a kindlier heart 
     Ne'er entered the mansions above. 
In Memoriam. 
ALPHONSE CAMPBELL FOKDHAM. 
Aged 6 Years, 2 Months, 20 Days. 
          Almost whose last words were 
          "We shall meet beyond the River." 
     Yes, my darling, when life's shadows 
          Over me do darkly fall, 
     Meet me surely at the river 
          As I haste to obey the call. 
     Gladly through the darksome valley, 
          Through its portals, grim and cold, 
     Will I hasten 'till my nestling 
          Meets me at the "Gates of Gold." 
     Sadly do I miss my wee one, 
          None can till thy vacant place, 
     Only in my dreams I fold thee, 
          Only then behold thy face. 
     See thee in thy childish beauty,
          Clasp thy little hand in mine, 
     Ever will those moments chain me, 
          Ever in my heart enshrined. 
     Little Heartsease, “bud of promise” 
          Broken off in early morn, 
     Now can sin no more pollute thee 
          In the angels' bosom borne. 
     In that land no pain or anguish 
          Ever can my child enfold, 
     Then my darling meet thy mother 
          Surely at the "Gates of Gold.”
MR. EDWARD FORDHAM. 
     When the Autumn's breezes 
          Were sweeping o'er the land,
     Came the mighty mandate 
          From the upper land. 
     Now from pain and anguish 
          Thou hast found relief,
     Passed through death's dark portal, 
          Left this world of grief. 
     Now thou’rt safely anchored 
          In the port aboye, 
     Gladly do we offer thee 
          Symbols of our loye. 
     When the welcome summons 
          Shall echo through the skies, 
     Then our ransomed brother 
           Will hear the word “Arise.”
Death of a Grandparent. 
MRS. JENNETTE BONNEU. 
Rest thee aged pilgrim, now thy toils are o'er; 
Peacefully thou'st landed over Jordan's shore; 
Safe from all the sorrows, free from all the strife, 
Thon hast passed death's portals, entered into life. 
Doubtless thou wert weary, tempest tossed so long; 
Doubtless thou wert longing to join the happy throng; 
Doubtless many loved ones on the other shore, 
Whispered to thee softly “Stay on earth no more.”
Whispered thee, come higher, where perennial bloom 
Shall with heightened luster its wonted sway resume. 
“Come where peaceful rivers quietly do flow— 
Hasten mother, hasten, from that world of woe." 
Then to fields Elysian she joyfully did soar, 
In the blest land of Canaan to dwell forever more; 
All through the “Golden City” she happily doth roam, 
Oft wondering why she stay'd so long away from home. 
So 'neath the bending willows we've laid thee down to rest, 
Well knowing thou'rt reposing secure on Jesus' breast; 
Well knowing that one day will come, the welcome word Arise, 
Come up, thou ransomed mortal, to thy Saviour in the skies. 
QUEENIE. 
For one brief day, did Queenie stay 
     To brighten each, fond heart, 
Then sped like dove to realms above, 
     Ne'er more to feel death's dart. 
O! in that land, where infants stand 
     Arrayed in spotless sheen, 
No griefs to share, nor sorrows bear, 
     No death to intervene. 
We would not care, nay, would not dare 
     To wish thee back again, 
Nay, rather say, ''Queenie, good day, 
     Till we your rest attain." 
TO AN INFANT. 
Just as the twilight's holy hour 
     In quietude so deep, 
Was hushing nature to repose, 
     Our "Charlie" fell asleep. 
Just in the bloom of infancy, 
     We laid him to his rest, 
Well knowing that our angel boy 
     Was numbered with the blest. 
Well knowing that the Saviour said 
     Oh! suffer such to come, 
“Forbid them not," for they are Mine, 
     And heaven is their home. 
So bow we to God's gracious will, 
     For he was lent, not given; 
And let this cheer our drooping hearts, 
     Our Charlie is in heaven. 
In Memoriam. 
SUSAN EUGENIA BENNETT. 
When the Sabbath was declining, just at twilight's mystic hour, 
Left the u Upper Courts" an angel, sent to cull our sweetest flower, 
Not in judgment, not in anger, did this white-winged seraph come, 
But to lead a little Pilgrim through Death's Portal to her home. 
And our angel child was ready, aye, and anxious to depart— 
Not the slightest doubt o'ershadowed her trusting little heart; 
But with a brow as radiant as rainbow in the sky, 
She whispered softly "Mother, I'm not afraid to die." 
When shall these little, weary limbs lie down to sweet repose, 
'Mid the green, the verdant pastures where the limpid water flows; 
When shall I the Golden City sparkling in its beauty see, 
"When shall it be, my Saviour, O! when shall I be free?”
Ere the week-day with its labors, its duties and its care— 
Was ushered in, our darling was found on earth no where; 
But with the saints in glory, and the Saviour she adored, 
She's happy and at rest, for aye and ever with the Lord. 
MRS. REBECCA WESTOX. 
"For so He giveth His beloved sleep." 
     She is not dead, but sleepeth;— 
          Ere long will the morning break, 
     When those we love who sleep in Him, 
          Shall from the dust awake. 
     She is not dead, but sleepeth;— 
          Soon, soon will the ransomed sing 
     O! grave, where is thy victory? 
          O! death, where is thy sting? 
MRS. E. COHRS BROWN.
Tread not the earth where lies her youthful form, 
Grow violets, sweet violets, above that cherished mound; 
Bid zephyrs softly whisper in accents sweet and low, 
Not dead, not lost, but only gone a little while before. 
So, I, though bowed in anguish, yield her spirit to its God, 
And meekly clasp the smiting hand, and kiss the chast'ning rod; 
May I, when time is over, greet thee on the other shore, 
To live and love for aye and aye, where partings are no more. 
MRS. MARY FURMAN WESTON BYRD. 
Obituary. 
     BYRD. — "As one who wraps the drapery of his 
couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams, ' ' thus 
sweetly passed from earth to glory, on the morning of 
the 19th of February, 1884, Mrs. Mary Furman 
Weston Byrd, in the 92d year of hex age, leaving two 
children, twelve grand-children, and twenty great- 
grandchildren, to mourn her irreparable loss. 
     "Rising up they call her blessed." Another 
ancient landmark has been gathered to her 
Fathers. With her death a link is severed which 
bound two centuries together. The venerable subject 
of this notice was born in 1792, of parents who were 
both e riles from their native land; one being born in 
Morocco, Barbary States, the other in Marseilles, 
France. During her eventful life she passed throng 
three wars; that of 1812 in her girlhood, after the 
Mexican and the late Civil Wars. Possessed of a 
loving heart and cheerful disposition, charity was the 
guiding star of her life. Her widow's mite was never 
faund wanting. In her the distressed and the needy 
met always a ready response. She died as she lived, 
beloved and venerated by legions to whom her very 
name was a household word. So then, 
 
     Though no blossoms cluster 
          Above thy aged brow, 
     Though winter winds are breathing 
          A requiem soft and low, 
     We look beyond earth's shadows, 
          Beyond death's misty plain. 
     And though we sadly miss thee,
          Will not wish thee back again. 
     Could we but see thee, dear one, 
          In the Palace of thy Lord, 
     With thy robe of snowy whiteness,
          And with more than youth renewed. 
     No more on bended willows 
          Would our broken harps remain, 
     Take us beauty for our ashes, 
          Take us gladness for our pain.

 Dedicated 
 
 FIRST. 
 
 To the memory 
 Of that angelic woman, 
 
 Who claimed me as her son ; 
 Of that majestic woman, 
 
 Whose race on earth was run 
 Long before I was old enough, 
 
 To reason right from wrong; 
 Long before I listened to 
 
 Redemption's saving song. 
 Of that Christ loving woman, 
 
 Who's now at Jesus' home, 
 Who sits and talks with angels, 
 
 And with archangels roam. 
 
 SECOND. 
 To the conscience of the nation, 
 
 With the hopes that it may rise 
 To the point of elevation 
 
 That will open up its eyes, 
 And lend to us a list'ning ear, 
 
 For the pitiful tale of woe, 
 That Ajax* cannot sleep at night 
 
 For lynchers are aglow. 
 They burn poor Ajax at the stake, 
 
 They hang him to a tree ; 
 They chop him up like sausage meat, 
 
 From home they make him flee. 
 
 *The latter part of this volume will explain 
 who Ajax is.
 
 Preface. 
 
 Brief is our life here, precious is the time, 
 and great the work to do, and a few thoughts 
 in print has the possibility of a longer life than 
 a man. " The night cometh when no man can 
 work." 
 
 How sweet, if it might be, that when the 
 day is ended, we may have left some watch 
 words still ringing in the ears of those who 
 come after us. And I may be permitted to 
 hope that these meditations may have such 
 power, in their modest way. They will be 
 easily passed by but may have a message for 
 hearts that will look and listen. 
 
 There is, certainly in this age, a want of 
 writing that shall restand brace the mind. It 
 is well to extend natural and spontaneous 
 thoughts, especially that which the heart has 
 laid by in store. We must be militant here on 
 earth, militant against every form of error. 
 
 If, during the period of American Slavery, 
 any Anglo-Saxon raised his voice or moved 
 his pen in the interest of the stolen and op 
 pressed African, thai man was marked, reviled 
 and ostracised as if he was affected with the 
 leprosy. No historian could write a true re-
 
 In this age ideal frivolity supersedes stern 
 reality. In most of our large cities in the 
 South outside of the college societies there 
 are no permanent, genuine literary organiza 
 tions among our so called intelligent people 
 for elevation. 
 
 They meet socially with no definite purpose 
 to social elevation. They meet religiously 
 with their souls on fashion and God as secon 
 dary. They never meet intellectually. These 
 talents grow up in thorns and thistles. Noth 
 ing to inspire our youths to merit. Position, 
 irrespective to character or ability, reigns su 
 preme. Thousands of youths grow up under 
 this poisonous atmosphere in the large cities. 
 But it is encouraging to see that, from the 
 smaller towns, the college walls(our safe 
 guards) are filled with youths preparing them 
 selves to meet the demands of future times. 
 
 What is the worth of fashion, style, and 
 social ethics if it does not add to the world 
 better, nobler, truer, sounder, more reliable 
 men from its factory? Time will not attempt 
 to test their logic but will, eventually, weigh 
 the results. AUTHOR.
 
 At My Mother's Grave. 
 
 I never see the burial place, 
 Where my dear mother lies ; 
 But that I think I see her face, 
 Peak at me through the skies. 
 
 I stand around her sacred mound, 
 And think she knows I'm there; 
 I kneel upon the sacred ground 
 And lisp her evening prayer. 
 
 Her fav'rite hymn I then repeat, 
 With accents all her own ; 
 We seem to meet at Jesus' feet, 
 And linger near His throne. 
 
 She sleeps within her narrow cot, 
 Safe "tucked in" from the night; 
 Resigned, I leave the solemn spot, 
 "God doeth all things right."
 
 12 OUR COUNTRY. 
 
 What an hour it must have been 
 For a woman's tender heart, 
 
 When the pityless, rough lynchers, 
 Tore she'nd her husband apart. 
 
 And while the mother clasped her hands 
 And the children wept and prayed ; 
 
 The whole family made struggles, 
 And shrieked to heaven for aid. 
 
 The atrocities of Russia 
 
 Against the thriving Jew, 
 And the horrors of Liberia, 
 
 Would disappear from view. 
 
 Mob violence against China, 
 
 And all the heathen lands; 
 Is far surpassed by lynch law, 
 
 In this, our Southern land. 
 
 If we ask ourselves the question 
 "Why do they lynch the Negro?" 
 
 Our hearts respond full sadly, 
 "They, nor we, do not know." 
 
 We've asked the wise in every age, 
 And searched the universe around ; 
 
 But neither scientist nor sage, 
 
 An answer to the quest has found.
 
 Is it God's will, what seer can tell? 
 
 (Thus do our anxious thoughts revolve) 
 Or is there not borne oracle, 
 
 That can or will the problem solve? 
 
 Are we but phantoms, with no cause, 
 But chance from cradle to the grave; 
 
 Or those inexorable laws 
 
 Of which agnostics boast and rave? 
 
 Or are we orphans with no home, 
 With none whom we can father call ; 
 
 As outcasts here a while to roam, 
 
 And then pass off with " death ends all?" 
 
 No ! let us not discouraged be 
 
 But hope and ever pray 
 That wrong and inhumanity, 
 
 May cease to be some day. 
 
 While the storms of life are raging 
 
 Lynching wild in our land, 
 Can we find a better refuge 
 
 Than the shadow of God's hand? 
 
 But what shall cleanse our country 
 
 From all this painful guilt, 
 The blood of freemen shed by freemen, 
 
 Upon her bosom spilt?
 When the pilgrim fathers came 
 
 From far across the sea ; 
 Their purposes were nobler than 
 
 The lynching of the free. 
 
 W r hen Washington at Valley Forge 
 
 Endured the winter's pain, 
 And when he crossed the Deleware 
 
 'Twas all for freedom's name. 
 
 He knew not that a cent'ry hence, 
 The flag for which he fought ; 
 
 W r ould be disgraced by lynching men, 
 By taking life for naught. 
 
 When Lincoln gave that mighty stroke, 
 When Sherman reached the sea, 
 
 When Grant took Appomatax, 
 Their cry was liberty. 
 
 When John Brown laid his body down 
 And his soul went marching on, 
 
 He knew not that his cause would be 
 Disgraced by this great wrong. 
 
 Could these great men speak back today 
 
 From their resting domain; 
 They'd whisper all in one accord, 
 
 "Our blood was spilt in vain."
 
 Dear native land, a newer page 
 
 Must turn as time moves by ; 
 Shall that page be brighter, 
 
 Or shall thy greatness die? 
 
 Thou hast a noble government, 
 
 And 'tis with trembling heart, 
 That we see what thou appearest 
 
 And look on what thou art. 
 
 We've wept till we could not weep, 
 And the pain of our burning eyes 
 
 Has gone into our aching hearts, 
 And now the nation cries. 
 
 Earth uplifts a general cry, 
 
 For all this guilt and wrong; 
 And heaven's ears are listening 
 
 To the suff'rers' wailing song. 
 
 Who'll interpret this mystery? 
 
 Even the common dust 
 Under the feet of the guilty 
 
 Cries out "this crime's unjust." 
 
 But we shall see the day, 
 
 When risrht shall surely reign ; 
 When at the bar of conscience, 
 
 The guilty sljall be slain.
 
 -OUR COUNTRY. 
 
 It may be when Ida Wells' lessons have been learned  
 The lynchers sun forever more has set, 
 The things which our weak judgment here have spurned, 
 The things o'er which we've grieved with lashes wet, 
 
 Will flash before them out of life's dark night 
 As stars shine most in deeper tints of blue. 
 And they shall see how all her plans were right 
 And how what seemed reproof was love most true; 
 
 And when those nations far across the sea 
 Begin to point o'er here the finger of shame, 
 And show our state the depth of all these crimes, 
 I think she will take steps to stop the same. 
 
 You know that prudent parents disallow 
 Too much of sweet to craving babyhood ; 
 So God, perhaps, is holding from us now 
 Life's sweetest things because it seemethgood, 
 And they shall shortly know that lengthened breath 
 Is not the sweetest gift Godsends His friends,
 And that sometimes the sable pall of death 
 Conceals the fairest boon His love can send. 
 And if through all this strife we live to stand 
 Where ourmindsfromlynchingnews may rest, 
 Then we shall clearly know and understand ; 
 1 think that all will say "God knew the best." 
 
 Only. 
 
 Only Afric's jungles 
 Satisfied his mind, 
 While the happy Negro 
 On his couch reclined. 
 
 Only a human trading ship 
 Coasting along the shore, 
 The Negro knew not whither 
 Still he had to go. 
 
 Only a "Star Spangled banner," 
 The Negro saw it wave, 
 But he saw not "land of free" 
 Neither "home of brave." 
 
 Only slavery's hardships 
 The Negro bore for years, 
 On through the wilderness 
 With headaches and tears.
 
 Only John Brown's body 
 Is moulding in the clay, 
 Yet his soul is marching, 
 Showing us the way. 
 
 Only Bull Run's battle, 
 Up sprang General Grant, 
 Four long years of bloodshed, 
 Freedom was the chant. 
 
 Only Abraham Lincoln 
 Gave the mighty stroke, 
 And four million Negroes 
 Lost the slavish yoke. 
 
 Only an education, 
 That is what he wants, 
 And to be a citizen 
 But they say he can't. 
 
 Only abiding by the law 
 Of our God and man, 
 And on all public questions 
 For the right, he tries to stand. 
 
 Only to suit the appetites 
 Of other wicked men, 
 Our race is mobb'd and lynch'd 
 Isn't that a sin? 
 
 Only proud America 
 Detests human strife, 
 Still has not courage to 
 Protect human life. 
 
 Only that coming day, 
 'Pointed hour make haste, 
 She must stand 'fore her God, 
 Past that solemn test. 
 
 Mother's Songs. 
 
 The summer's sun was beaming hot, 
 The boys had played all day ; 
 
 And now beside a rippling stream, 
 Upon the grass they lay. 
 
 Tired of games and idle jest, 
 
 As swept the hours along, 
 They called on one who mused at times, 
 
 "Come pard, give us a song." 
 
 "I fear I cannot please," he said, 
 
 "The only songs I know 
 Are those my mother used to sing 
 
 To me long years ago."
 
 "Sing oneof those," arough voice said, 
 "There's none but true men here; 
 
 Toev'ry mother's son of us 
 A mother's song is dear." 
 
 Then sweetly rose the singer's voice, 
 
 Amid unwonted calm: 
 "Am I a soldier of the cross 
 
 A follower of the lamb." 
 
 "And shall I fear to own his cause" 
 
 Every heart seemed stilled, 
 And hearts that never throbbed with fear, 
 
 With tender thoughts were tilled. 
 
 As the singer closed he said, 
 " Boys, we must face the foes" 
 
 Then thanking them for their invite 
 Upon his feet he rose. 
 
 " Sing us one more the young men said, 
 
 The singer hung his head, 
 Then glancing 'round with smiling lips, 
 
 "You'll join with me," he said. 
 
 We'll sing that old familiar air, 
 
 Sweet as the bugle call ; 
 "All hail the power of Jesus name, 
 
 Let Angels prostrate fall." 
 And wondrous was the old tune's spell, 
 
 As on the singer sang ; 
 Man after man fell into line, 
 And loud their voices rang. 
 
 One cried out "my mother sings 
 
 'Just as I am though tossed about;' 
 
 And the crowd picked up the anthem 
 "With many a conflict, many a doubt." 
 
 The next said "I seem to hear, 
 'It's rock of ages cleft for me,' 
 
 And the boys joined in with feeling 
 "Let me hide myself in thee." 
 
 Another said "I'm an outcast, 
 But when I've nowhere to roam, 
 
 I think of mother and the city 
 Which, long since she's made her home." 
 
 The next one said with tearful eyes 
 
 "My mother's in eternity, 
 Her song was 'O rock of ages 
 
 In thy cleft hidethou me.' 
 
 Hush'd are her lips, the song's ended, 
 
 The singer sleeps at last ; 
 While I sit here in deep wonder, 
 
 Arid think of days, long past.
 The room still echoes with music, 
 
 As singing soft and low, 
 Those grand sweet Christian carols, 
 
 They rock her too and fro. 
 
 Safe hidden in the "Rock of Ages" 
 
 She bade farewell to fear ; 
 Sure that her Lord'd always lead her 
 
 " She read her title clear." 
 
 Dear Saint in mansions long folded, 
 Safe in God's fostering love, 
 
 She joins in the blissful chorus, 
 Of those bright choirs above. 
 
 There she knows not pain, nor sorrow, 
 
 Safe beyond Jordan's roll 
 She lives with her blessed Jesus 
 
 The lover of her soul. 
 
 These boys are men, the stream still runs, 
 
 Those songs, they still are heard ; 
 And oh! the depth of every soul, 
 By those old hymns is stirred. 
 
 And up from many a bearded lip, 
 
 In whispers soft and low ; 
 Rises the songs the mother taught 
 
 The boy long years ago.
 
 Spotless. 
 
 (James 1:21) 
 
 Spotless, spotless, spotless, spotless, 
 At the sounding of that word, 
 
 All my soul turned up to heaven, 
 All my heart within me stirred. 
 
 Would that I could stand out spotless, 
 Lord, I know that Thou hast died, 
 
 Thou hast stood for ages spotless 
 Bidding men come and abide. 
 
 Lord, build up for me a ladder, 
 
 Reaching into perfect day, 
 That my hopes this word may grapple, 
 
 Showing me the right of way. 
 
 Blooming flowers all seem spotless, 
 On the spotless hill and dell, 
 
 Oh, how beautiful they all are, 
 And how fragrant too they smell. 
 
 The spotless birds, they spring along, 
 And chirp the song of jubilee; 
 
 I like to hear their spotless songs, 
 They make my melancholy flee.
 
 I wish that I could so be found, 
 While traveling life's brief way, 
 
 A spotless light to every one, 
 Where'er my footsteps stray. 
 
 Once a woman tried to show me 
 
 Something spotless, bright and new, 
 
 And she pick'd for illustration 
 Objects of the dirtiest hue. 
 
 "Lady" said I, eager, anxious, 
 
 "Why do you choose things so vile?" 
 
 "Just to show the cleansing process," 
 Said the lady with a smile. 
 
 Then she said " these dirty colors, 
 
 Hardest to remove of all, 
 Can be made by constant rubbing 
 
 White as snowflake in its fall." 
 
 These words struck my heart with power, 
 Made my soul within me throb, 
 
 "Dirty colors" "white as snowflake" 
 Can this woman? Cannot God? 
 
 Lord, I long to be made spotless, 
 What lack I to make me thine ? 
 
 Not in name but spotless truly, 
 Would I have thy ways, not mine.
 
 Is there anything not spotless 
 That I cherish more than Thee, 
 
 Loved ones, money, fame or talent? 
 Lord reveal them now to me. 
 
 Lord I think how Thou, though spotless, 
 Left thy Heavenly home on high, 
 
 Gave up all Thy spotless glory, 
 Came to earth for us, to die. 
 
 Jesus spoke from out His mansion : 
 "Thou, as I, can spotless be, 
 
 Vilest hearts have been made precious, 
 Simply trust and follow me." 
 
 Then I cried, "O Jesus take me, 
 Give me spotless, crimson wings, 
 
 Stamp my name upon thy roll book, 
 Take it to the spotless King." 
 
 Oh, what spotless, rapturous music ! 
 
 Heaven's gates seemed open wide, 
 And I stood there clear and spotless, 
 
 Near the Saviour's spotless side. 
 
 Spotless in God's spotless mansions! 
 
 Spotless in His spotless light ! 
 
 God's own love, majestic, spotless, 
 Made me crimson, spotless white!
 
 Motherly Emotions. 
 
 A mother* came passing by my door, 
 Her son was near by my side ; 
 
 "Howdy mama" was her son's adore, 
 "Howdy my son" she replied. 
 
 And as I gazed upon that mother, 
 The tears rushed to my eyes ; 
 
 My heart's affections began to swell, 
 My mind went to paradise. 
 
 While there it found that one model, 
 Who, sixteen long years ago, 
 
 By the blessed Saviour's command, 
 Left all earth's sorrows below. 
 
 " What word is sweeter than mother, 
 What place is dearer than home?" 
 
 These words are our associates 
 Wherever in life we roam. 
 
 Napoleon was a worldly man, 
 Yet one great thing he uttered, 
 
 When from conscience clear he said, 
 " What France most needs is mothers."
 Home, that sanctuary of love, 
 That stamps impressions for life, 
 
 Who's the heart of affection there? 
 It is the mother, the wife. 
 
 A mother's love! oh, no one knows 
 How much of life's feelings lies, 
 
 In those sweet words, the fears, the hopes, 
 And daily strengthening ties. 
 
 It wakes ere yet the infant dreams 
 
 It's earliest vital breath ; 
 And fails but when the mother's heart 
 
 Chills in the grasp of death. 
 
 Who knows the worth of mother? 
 
 Not those who see her daily; 
 But those who watch that vacant chair 
 
 Whose days are dark and dreary. 
 
 But when I am tossed and driven, 
 
 And feel like I'm all alone; 
 I think of mother and that city, 
 
 Which long since she's made her home. 
 
 Mother, while playing at thy knees, 
 
 Within my youthful heart; 
 There dwelt no secret consciousness, 
 
 That thou would e'er depart.
 
 Since thou hast gone I now have learned 
 
 To bow my stubborn will, 
 The power that calms the raging sea 
 
 My rebel heart has stilled. 
 
 So I can look with fearless eyes 
 
 On all these earthly fates, 
 But how coulds't thou afford to die 
 
 And leave me desolate ? 
 
 I should not weep for thee, dear one, 
 While with the saints thou art, 
 
 But how can I in coldness check 
 The burning tears that start? 
 
 My thoughts to thee must ever turn 
 
 As in my infant days, 
 While in my heart thine image shall 
 
 Lead me through life's rough ways. 
 
 Rest, dearest one, may angel host 
 Their vigils o'er thee keep, 
 
 How can I breath thy saintly name 
 And yet forbear to weep? 
 
 I stand heartbroken on dull earth 
 And gaze on the vacant skies, 
 
 Mother I cannot see thy face, 
 Dost thou hear thy son's cry?
 
 If in God's likeness 1 may awake 
 And shine in pure image by thee, 
 
 I'll be satisfied when I can break 
 The fetters of flesh and be free. 
 
 *Mrs. L. E. S. 
 Consolation. 
 
 Friends can't you tell me something? 
 
 I am weary and worn tonight. 
 The day has gone like a shadow 
 
 And only the evening is light. 
 
 Tell me about the Master, 
 
 Of the burdensome hills he trod, 
 
 When the tears and blood from his an 
 guish 
 Dropped down on Judea's sod. 
 
 Tell me about the Master, 
 
 Of the wrongs he freely forgave, 
 
 Of His love and His tender compassion, 
 Of His love that is mighty to save. 
 
 For my heart is restless and weary 
 Of the woes and temptations of life, 
 
 Of all the treacherous conflicts 
 
 Of falsehood, and malice, and strife.
  
 So tell me the sweet old story 
 
 That falls on each wound like a balm, 
 
 And my heart now bruised and broken, 
 Shall grow patient, strong, and calm. 
 
 Life What We Make It. 
 
 My life is a wearisome journey; 
 
 I'm sick with the times and the heat, 
 The rays of the sun beat upon me ; 
 
 Life's briars are wounding my feet. 
 
 There are so many hills leading upwards 
 It keeps me a longing for rest, 
 
 But he who appoints me my journey, 
 Knows just what is needful and best. 
 
 He loves me too well to forsake me, 
 Or give me one trial too much, 
 
 And the toils of my road will seem noth 
 ing 
 When e'er I receive his kind touch. 
 
 When the last feeble step has been taken 
 And the gates of the city appear, 
 
 The beautiful songs of the angels 
 Will float out on listening ears.
 
 Though now I am foot-sore and weary, 
 I'll rest when I'm safely at home, 
 
 I know I'll receive a glad welcome 
 For the Saviour Himself has said : * * come. ' ' 
 
 So when I am weary in body 
 And sinking in spirit, I say, 
 
 All the toils of the road will seem noth 
 ing 
 When I get to the end of the way. 
 
 Then I'll try to press hopefully on 
 ward, 
 Thinking often through each weary day, 
 
 The toils of the road will seem nothing 
 When I get to the end of my way. 
 
 Frances E. Harper. 
 Tribute. 
 
 Dear friend, to me one vision craved, 
 Alas ! has been denied ; 
 But thy strong words on page of book 
 My mind anew inspires, 
 Thy noble soul has lifted mine, 
 As rippling waves are drawn; 
 My spirit heard thy words sublime, 
 About the woman's dawn.
 
 Some mysteries of Afric's race, 
 Were left for thee to prove ; 
 Thy lucid voice, thy pen of grace, 
 Filled up with hope and love 
 Woke the dead pulse of joy supreme, 
 In our discouraged hearts, 
 Dispells the long delusive dream, 
 Makes new ambitions start. 
 
 The rebels who pronounce us brutes, 
 With conscience all at rest ; 
 Feel the great throb of Afric's truth, 
 That stirs from out thy breast ; 
 Maid of a higher, nobler cause, 
 Thou queen of ancient night; 
 Defender of the virtuous laws 
 Of our young woman's rights. 
 
 Thy name has spread like night's domain, 
 When all her glittering lamps 
 Illume the vast and level plains 
 Into the peaceful camps 
 Where martyrs keep the righteous post 
 Doubting our freedom yet, 
 And speed the faithfuf, onward host, 
 
 With eyes on justice set.
 They are not dead, those who have died, 
 Like holy angels come 
 To mortals in their faithful strides 
 For country, love and home; 
 Thou knowest the psalms by sages wrought, 
 Through shaky, mythic phrase; 
 Thou nobler psalms than they have taught, 
 
 Yet they have all the praise. 
 The time will come when this great state, 
 With conscience clear and true, 
 Will feel the strain of human fate, 
 Revealed to them by you ; 
 And from her high esteemed estate, 
 She will throw open wide 
 The portal of her royal gate. 
 
 So long to us denied. 
 Continue in thy noble work, 
 O, faithful sister great, 
 Until thy mind redeeming words, 
 Are spread in every state; 
 Bring womanhood her honors due, 
 Heal up these long disgraces ; 
 The time has come when woman must 
 March out and lead the races.
 
  
 Cain and Abel. 
 
 "To thine ownself be true, 
 
 And it must follow as the night the day, 
 
 Thou canst not then be false to any man.' 
 
 Cain was not true to Abel, 
 
 Neither true to himself, 
 Because Abel was true to both, 
 
 He put his brother to death. 
 
 I think how many a hundred 
 Of innocent Negro men. 
 Each trying to do like Abel, 
 
 Have died his death since then. 
 
 Voice From The South. 
 
 To Mrs. Annie Julia Cooper. 
 
 I read that book, "Voice from the South," 
 I read it o'er again ;
 I re-read, heart leaped up to mouth 
 At its triumphant aim. 
 
 It 'rouses those noble feelings, 
 Which partly are obscure ; 
 It makes us see as we are seen, 
 And fits us to endure.
 
 It pictures a steadfast purpose, 
 A brave and daring will, 
 A human-needed promise that 
 We hope the years will fill. 
 
 Noble woman, grandly gifted, 
 Sent to tell the world true facts; 
 Sure the race will be uplifted 
 By thy words, thy deeds, thy acts. 
 
 Thy dauntless words are great and bold, 
 At times they seem to be 
 Like John Brown's in dark slavery's days, 
 While battling for the free. 
 
 Earth's grandest hearts uplift to thee, 
 They feel thy spreading fame ; 
 And children that are yet to be 
 Will "hallowed be thy name." 
 
 From thy book, those worthy pages, 
 All our anxious hearts entreat; 
 All true trophies of the ages, 
 Are enshrined at thy dear feet. 
 
 Oh! wished for, hoped for, happy time, 
 When I can have the grace, 
 To grasp thy hand, and more sublime, 
 Upon thy statue gaze.
 
 When e'er I 'tempt to write of thee, 
 Love takes my thoughts away ; 
 Thy dazzling fame makes all that flee, 
 Which most I long to say. 
 
 If thou hadst hearing in thy heart, 
 To know how others beat; 
 Then thoushouldst walk where'er thou art, 
 Where throbbing millions greet. 
 
 O ye whose noble, lucid pen, 
 Forever filled with ink; 
 To touch the hearts and minds of men, 
 And make whole nations think. 
 
 It may be that in this cold world, 
 You will be ostracised 
 For noble truths which you have hurled 
 At those who right despise. 
 
 But Christ was ostracised by men, 
 He conquered every one ; 
 Brave Luther faced the Papal den, 
 And he the victory won. 
 
 So while within this vale of tears, 
 Where sins and woes are rife ; 
 words will prove, in coming years, 
 The gift of mortal life. 
 Since we are scattered as a race, 
 And thou hast power to write; 
 While God prolongs thy days of grace, 
 Cry to the race "unite." 
 
 Thou hast been writing, noble one, 
 Thou dost not write in vain ; 
 Thy words, methink, are pressing on, 
 They shall be entertained. 
 
 Thy writing has a dwelling place, 
 Above this lynching ken; 
 We hope thy spirit will never trace 
 Such wicked haunts of men. 
 
 In some far off diviner land, 
 There stands a giant Mast ; 
 It waves to you a cheering hand, 
 From heroes of the past. 
 
 Thy 'lectric voice, whose strong control, 
 As with an angel's breath 
 Can stir the fountain of the soul, 
 And cheer the long bereft. 
 
 Write on, and may thy words still strike 
 The conscience of the nation ; 
 And show that all men are alike, 
 And have been since creation.
 
  
 Bishop Daniel A. Payne. 
 
 (Deceased). 
 
 He has gone forth in the light of light, 
 Out of the long watch and the heavy night, 
 Out of the life that was so hard to bear, 
 Crowded by sorrow and perplexed by care. 
 
 Love was the life which pulsed his being 
 
 through, 
 
 No task too hard, if set by love to do, 
 No pain too sharp, if love called to endure, 
 No weariness he knew if love was true. 
 
 Heaven has received him as a welcome guest, 
 Balming earth's tie with compensating rest, 
 Healing earth's grievous wound with sure 
 
 content, 
 The sense of home after long banishment. 
 
 But more to him than smile of vanished kin, 
 Or hands outstreched to greet and draw him in, 
 
 Or "bonded walls" of amethyst unpriced 
 Is the clear vision of the face of Christ. 
 
 The face divine, which, in his boyhood days, 
 Seeing he loved and never looked away, 
 Which, like a star in the dim firmament, 
 Guided his steps and moved where' er he went .
 Out of the life that was not always sweet, 
 Out of the puzzle and the day's defeat, 
 Out of earth's hindering and alien zone, 
 The Lord of love has led him to his own. 
 
 Douglass Dead? 
 
 Across the nation's broad domain, 
 On every hill, and every plain, 
 Peals out the muffled, sad refrain, 
 That Douglass is dead. 
 
 O no, not dead ! for every heart 
 In every state must surely start 
 As freedom's great, uprisi ig mart, 
 If Douglass is deud ! 
 
 And far across the deep blue sea, 
 Those nations that love liberty, 
 Their minds will be a mournful lea, 
 For Douglass' death. 
 
 Once freedom's great, uprising host, 
 From Maine to California's coast, 
 Of this great man could truly boast, 
 And now he's dead!
   
 In every heart of all the race, 
 He'll ever have a sacred place, 
 His name can never be erased, 
 He is not dead ! 
 
 He's with Lincoln, John Brown, Grant, 
 With Bishop Payne and Price he chants, 
 With such surrounding host we can't 
 Say he is dead ! 
 
 The Easter Man. 
 
 So crushed by sinful oppression. 
 Through the ages long and drear, 
 
 Men began to doubt and question, 
 Whether Shiloh would appear. 
 
 The Jewish doctors pondered, 
 And Gentile sages dreamed, 
 
 While on their weary vision 
 No assuring light yet gleamed. 
 
 But while time's dial was still moving:, 
 
 God, in a mysterious way, 
 Let man go in his wonder, 
 
 He knew thedimenand the day.
 And the Watchman he stood mourning, 
 Over Judah's seer that day ; 
 
 As up on Bethlehem's hillside, 
 They wound their weary way. 
 
 And the watchman cried "O Israel, 
 
 How long are we to stand, 
 Under the great oppressor's yoke, 
 
 To be moved by Shiloh's hand?" 
 
 When heaven and earth were silent, 
 When the Lord's will would be done, 
 
 The cry went from out Bethlehem, 
 "A man child there is born." 
 
 Then burst the rapturous anthem ; 
 
 " Glory to God be given, 
 Good will among the sons of Men 
 
 Peace on earth and in heaven." 
 
 While there in his manger cradle, 
 The unconscious monarch lay, 
 
 The babe of Bethlehem now born, 
 To have universal sway. 
 
 The human sea became restless, 
 
 Earth's kingdoms began to shake, 
 And the universal cry was 
 > ,'*^*er,inuw like that inan spake."
  
 When He began his active work, 
 For three long toilsome years, 
 
 He climbed degradation's mountain, 
 Wading through heart-aches and tears . 
 
 But Jesus buried these sorrows, 
 Knowing the world had its share; 
 
 He opened a crystal fountain, 
 To wash away sinful snares. 
 
 The more he spread his mission, 
 The more he became despised, 
 
 He forgave men this wickedness, 
 And yet he was crucified. 
 
 Nineteen centuries have passed and gone, 
 Since " it is finished" was cried, 
 
 Every day during that time, 
 The Savior's been crucified. 
 
 If we ask ourselves the question, 
 " Why crucify one so dear?" 
 
 Our hearts will respond full sadly, 
 44 The answer is not here." 
 
 The still, small voice from Calvary 
 Cries " I did all this for thee," 
 
 And from the ear of faith we hear, 
 44 What art thou doing: for me-"
 
 Silence reigned in Jerusalem, 
 Men became bothered in mind, 
 
 Questions were asked about Jesus, 
 To answer wise men declined. 
 
 On that lovely Easter morning, 
 Mary and others came near, 
 
 The angel solved the mystery, 
 " He's risen, He is not here." 
 
 He spent forty days sojourning, 
 To many he made himself known, 
 
 He told of a city called Heaven, 
 
 Entreated them to make it their home. 
 
 He melted down satan's mansions, 
 He made intercession for man, 
 
 He gave his peace to the nations, 
 And gave the disciples command. 
 
 And then along the silent path, 
 
 By viewless spirits trod, 
 He left the blights of this sad earth, 
 
 And went to dwell with God. 
 
 Gates of Heaven all stood ajar, 
 Bells of Heaven were ringing, 
 
 Angels stood around the gate, 
 Waiting, watching, singing.
 
  
 And as the Savior entered in, 
 They did not close the view, 
 
 But left the gate standing ajar 
 That we might enter too. 
 
 Heaven's orchestra uttered aloud, 
 "Worthy the Lamb that was slain 
 
 To receive honor, glory, power, 
 Blessings, world without end." 
 
 For every thorn that gave a wound, 
 A rose in Heaven was given, 
 
 And joy. that there no roses found 
 With rosy wreaths were riven. 
 
 In paradise where breezes blow, 
 To cool the heart's hot fever, 
 
 The pangs and pain He felt below, 
 Were waft away forever. 
 
 To look at Thee, O Lord, as Thou art, 
 From this mortal perishing clay, 
 
 The spirit immortal in peace would de 
 part, 
 And joyous mount up her bright way.
 
 I know our stained tablets must first be 
 
 washed white, 
 
 To let Thy bright features be drawn. 
 We know we must suffer the darkness of 
 
 night, 
 To welcome the coming of dawn. 
 
 But we shall be satisfied when we can 
 cast 
 
 The shadow of nature all by, 
 When the cold, heavy world from our 
 vision has passed 
 
 To let the soul open her eye. 
 We come together in Easter service, 
 
 To sing praises unto His name. 
 Let every day be Easter in which 
 
 W r e will sing His praises the same. 
 Man's Imperfections. 
 
 O life why so imperfect? 
 
 And life cried in elation, 
 Don't fault my God nor me correct, 
 
 Hut man and his ovation.
  
 The little bird enjoys his life, 
 The ant improves his time; 
 
 Its only man's abusive strife, 
 That wrecks this holy clime. 
 
 The rippling stream goes swiftly by, 
 The plants grow undistubed; 
 
 And only man fills life with sighs, 
 And makes crime reign superb. 
 
 The sun and moon and stars are bright. 
 
 This earth's a paradise; 
 But man stands in his own sunlight, 
 
 As imperfection's vice. 
 My Sweetheart. 
 
 I went to bed the other night, 
 My sleep was sweet in part ; 
 
 I dreamed I saw a lovely sight, 
 It was my dear sweetheart. 
 
 She sat in the window watching, 
 As I wjnt down the street; 
 
 I threw a kiss back to her, 
 
 Her face seem' d blossom sweet.
 
 My sweetheart's image was with me, 
 
 Whichever way I went, 
 It banished all temptations, 
 
 And gave me good intent. 
 
 When the world seems full of trouble, 
 
 When things seem to go wrong: 
 
 My sweetheart's image is with me, 
 
 And makes me brave and strong. 
 
 I return 'd by early twilight, 
 And as I latched the gate ; 
 
 I saw from the shaded window, 
 My sweetheart still did wait. 
 
 I hastened toward the window, 
 I saw my sweetheart's eyes 
 
 Sparkle with a smiling welcome, 
 As the stars up in the skies. 
 
 "Finback again, dear sweetheart," 
 I said, and stoop'd to kiss 
 
 My sweetheart' s face that was lifted, 
 It seem'd that all was bliss. 
 
 You all have sweethearts like this one. 
 
 Babies, sisters and brothers ; 
 This sweetheart gives us lots of fun, 
 
 My sweetheart was my mother.
 
  
 What do you think of my sweetheart? 
 
 I shall not go any further ; 
 Can you blame a boy my size because 
 
 He's dead in love with mother? 
 
 The angel who unfetter'd St. Peter, 
 When bound in Jerusalem's jail ; 
 
 Is no greater than the angel Lincoln 
 Who heeded the Negro's wail. 
 And never in all ages, 
 
 Since John on Patnius wrote; 
 Have words been put on pages 
 
 As great as Lincoln spoke. 
 
 Lincoln's Call. 
 
 You know 'twas eighteen sixty-one, 
 The civil war had just begun, 
 The ship of state was at the place, 
 To picture up the South's disgrace; 
 And Lincoln quickly saw the point, 
 Where he could knock things out of joint ; 
 And all the sight which he had seen, 
 Before his mind began to gleam. 
 He thought of countless human slaves, 
 Murdered, buried without a grave; 
 He thought of the wicked overseer, 
 Whose cruelty could have no peer; 
 He thought of the master's snarling cry 
 "That Negro's worthless, let him die." 
 Rethought of the Southern auction block, 
 Where human beings sold as stock; 
 He thought of mother's wailing cry, 
 When wicked men her child would buy ; 
 He thought how cruel they could be,
 To counteract the mother's plea; 
 He thought how men were sold like mules, 
 And left their wives with wicked fools; 
 He thought of Christian mother's weep, 
 To see her child drove off like sheep ; 
 He thought of mother's vain distress, 
 To have a babe sold from her breast ; 
 And worst of all since God's creation, 
 He thought of that abomination 
 Amalgamation of the races, 
 On terms that give us blushing faces ; 
 He thought of masters who had slaves, 
 Whose virtue they would often crave ; 
 And she, no matter how she feel, 
 To master's wicked lust must yield; 
 These sights as dark as dark midnight, 
 Made angels shudder in their flight; 
 The goddess of the angry deep, 
 These horrors made her conscience weep; 
 The gladiator drop'd his sword, 
 At sight of Southern festive boards. 
 Diana said with heart aglow, 
 Such sights have never reign'd before; 
 These things weighed Lincoln's heart with  grief, 
 And when the nation made him chief
 He gave a long, tremendous call, 
 From out the nation's senate hall, 
 And all the North heard his appeal, 
 And marched out on ihe battle field; 
 The Pilgrim Fathers, dead and gone, 
 Pushed brave New England in the throng, 
 Good William Perm said from his grave: 
 " My Quakers join the Lincoln wave." 
 The father of the country said 
 "March en, it is the rightful tread !" 
 The heroes of Thermopylae 
 Heard Lincoln's call for liberty, 
 And cried from out their distant graves, 
 "If you must die, men's freedom save." 
 Crispus Attucks, whose blood ran down, 
 When Washington was in renown, 
 His blood cried out "if you'd be free, 
 All strike at once for liberty !" 
 Sojourner Truth, her voice was heard, 
 *' March on !" was the commanding word, 
 Nat Turner screamed out from the sod; 
 ** I would thou precious, alhvise God, 
 Had spared my life upon the land 
 To follow Lincoln's brave command, 
 Then I could quickly do my part, 
 For poor down-trodden, human hearts,
 I'd help to strike that mighty blow, 
 To let my bondaged people go ! " 
 John Brown's bleeding body cried: 
 "This is the cause for which I died!" 
 Frederick Douglass, grand old man, 
 Who aided John Brown in his plans, 
 Who stood with Lincoln and conversed, 
 Was ready now to stand the worst. 
 He used his voice, his pen, his mind, 
 And men who heard him fell in line. 
 These voices echoed Lincoln's sound. 
 And stirred the people all around ; 
 From Maine to California's coast, 
 Rose freedom's great advancing host. 
 Men speaking in the senate hall, 
 Responded to the noble call ; 
 The Gov'nors left the state affairs, 
 The writer left his easy chair, 
 The lawyer quit the city bar, 
 And left his office door ajar; 
 The bus' ness man went out his store, 
 Perhaps to enter there no more ; 
 The teacher left his tutorship, 
 And gave his gun a lasting grip. 
 The student left his study desk, 
 And marched with teacher breast abreast,
 The hunter left the stag at bay, 
 For Lincoln's call he must obey; 
 "The plow was in the furrow staid, 
 The herds without a keeper stray'd," 
 The fish' man left his pole and line, 
 The blacksmith drop'd his red hot iron, 
 The artist let go paint and brush, 
 And to the army made a rush. 
 Husbands kissed their wives good-bye, 
 Left the children, went to die; 
 Mothers told sons to heroes be, 
 In the cause of liberty; 
 The young man in the prime of life, 
 Left his newly wedded wife; 
 The lover left his loved one's side 
 Whom he had vowed to make his bride, 
 He loved his girl with all his heart, 
 But country's love was now his part; 
 Each son and father rushed to arms, 
 At Lincoln's signals of alarm. 
 The war began, brave Lincoln stood, 
 As pilot in the human flood ; 
 Again he made a long appeal, 
 More men were needed in the field. 
 His voice was heard all o'er the land, 
 A million men obeyed command.
  
 At Gettysburg, brave Lincoln stood, 
 And he was in a better mood ; 
 He saw the cause for which he fought, 
 Was plain before the people brought; 
 And on that bloody battlefield, 
 The enemies began to yield ; 
 And Lincoln, with his God push'd pen, 
 Wrote these words on the hearts of men : 
 "All human beings claimed as slaves 
 Are placed upon great freedom's wave." 
 And angels echoed around the throne ; 
 "Rejoice thy freedom is thy own !" 
 The Negro left his master's farm, 
 For he had heard the last alarm, 
 But half in doubt and half in stress, 
 He wondered which would be the best 
 "If massa ketch me gwine away, 
 He'll Mil dis n----- shur as day ; 
 But whats de use to stay back herr, 
 He's killing n------ ebry yerr, 
 Boss Lincoln says dat I am free,  
 I'll strike a blow for liberty!" 
 He marched out like a soldier man, 
 And joined the host of freedom's van. 
 The war moved on for two more years, 
 And brave men fought without a fear,
 Till Sherman's host had reached the sea, 
 And Grant had captured noble Lee, 
 Then men laid down their arms of yore, 
 And peace did reign from shore to shore, 
 Now Lincoln's work was bravely done, 
 The confidence of Men he'd won, 
 His enemies he'd conquered well, 
 And they before him prostrate fell. 
 He'd kept the faith, he'd fought his fight, 
 And in the stillness of the night 
 When he least look'd for any strife, 
 A demon struck him for his life. 
 He fell a corpse to mortal man, 
 In this down trodden, sinful land; 
 His soul had heard the angel's cry; 
 "Thy work's complete, thy home's on high," 
 
 So when the general roll is called, 
 Including, Wickliffe. Luther, Paul ; 
 Men who have died to set men free, 
 Lincoln's name on the list will be. 
 And men who dwell upon the earth, 
 Will yet concede to Lincoln's worth, 
 And burn his birthday in the minds, 
 Of children 'till the end of time. 
 As long as there remains a trace 
 Of Afric blood in mortal face, 
 So long will Lincoln honored be, 
 His virtues suns: from sea to sea. 
 
 Hurrah for McKinley! 
 
 Hurrah for McKinley ! 
 Hurrah for Hobart !

 To help, keep a Negro 
 
 From the dreadful lynching fate. 
 Negroes rally, etc. 
 
 Hurrah for McKinley ! 
 
 Who said he'd have no wine, 
 And those at the inaugural 
 
 To drink had to decline, 
 Temperance rally, etc.
 
  
 The Call All Must Obey. 
 
 A voice whispered to an infant, 
 Sitting on its mother's knees, 
 "Leave that place for a moment, 
 I want you to go with me," 
 " How can I leave my mamma's lap, 
 And do without her sweet smiles, 
 How can 1 live without her aid ?' ' 
 Replied the innocent child. 
 
 The same voice whispered to a child, 
 Who knew not the right from wrong, 
 " Comechild, leave your play forawhile, 
 And join this mighty throng," 
 The child replied in earnest tones, 
 " I cannot go with you now 
 You see what I have here to do, 
 My play house is all torn down." 
 
 " Come," said the stern voice to a youth, 
 
 While plodding along his way, 
 
 And many youths were with him there, 
 
 All cheerful and full of play . 
 
 " How can I come," replied the youth, 
 
 " I'm hastening on to school, 
 
 A.nd if I'm late," my mother says, 
 
 "Its against the teacher's rule."
 
 "Come," the voice said to a maid, 
 Just in her twentieth year, 
 While men were passing too and fro, 
 Some in hope and some in fear; 
 "How can I come," replied the maid, 
 "While all of life's temptations 
 Surround my head, and I must be 
 A factor to the nation." 
 
 The voice approached a bright young man 
 
 Just entering the prime of life, 
 
 " Come, "said the voice, theyoungman 
 
 stopped, 
 
 As if in a human strife. 
 " How can I come? My days are brief, 
 The responsibility 
 That rests upon my shoulders, 
 Is spread from sea to sea." 
 
 The voice then sought a poet's abode, 
 
 Who was seeking after a rhyme, 
 
 And the poet had an answer 
 
 Both elusive and sublime. 
 
 " How can you ask for me to come, 
 
 Leave me to myself I pray, 
 
 For the verse which I am writing 
 
 The hearts of men will sway."
 
  
 "Come," said the voice to a songster 
 As she raised her alto voice, 
 And the music sent forth by her, 
 Made the hearts of men rejoice. 
 "How can I come," said the songster, 
 "This world is sinking in sin, 
 And I am to sing God's mercies 
 Into the hearts of men." 
 
 "Come," said the voice to a statesman, 
 
 While speaking in the senate hall, 
 
 And his voice aroused the senate 
 
 Like troops at a bugle call. 
 
 "How can I come," said the statesman, 
 
 While our dear ship of state, 
 
 Is hanging, trembling, weakening, 
 
 At the sight of future fate?" 
 
 "Come," said the voice to a mother, 
 
 W T ith her children at her side, 
 
 And she made the home a haven, 
 
 For her husband to abide. 
 
 "Oh, I can't come," the mother said, 
 
 " [ pray you let me stay, 
 
 For how can I leave my darlings 
 
 To wander from me astray?"
 
 The voice sent out no more appeals, 
 
 The baby left its mother, 
 
 The child with a torn down play house 
 
 Didn't stop to build another; 
 
 Theyouth, returning home from school, 
 
 Responded to the call, 
 
 And the maiden with her beauty 
 
 Had to enter in the thrall. 
 
 And the young man meditated, 
 For he was just in his prime, 
 But he joined the great procession 
 When the voice called, it was time; 
 And the poet, with his meekness, 
 Had to (juit his composition ; 
 For the voice had called him hither, 
 It was due a recognition. 
 
 The songster's voice was heard no more, 
 The world still had its sins, 
 The statesman left the senate floor, 
 And was heard no more by men ; 
 And the mother left her children, 
 And they cried with sobbing breath. 
 But the voice which spoke men must 
 
 obey, 
 It was the voice of death.
 Harriet Beecher Stowe's Works. 
 "Uncle Tom's Cabin." 
 
 That grand and noble woman dear, 
 Called Harriet Beecher Stowe, 
 The book she wrote without a fear 
 Drove slavery from our shore. 
 To know her works, to feel her worth, 
 Go read that noble book 
 And see what dauntless words she wrote, 
 What fearful risks she took. 
 
 It struck a blow to slavery's tree, 
 That burned its very life; 
 It scorched the undergrowth around, 
 And left it in a strife ; 
 It parched the branches to a crisp, 
 Withered the leaves in twain, 
 It drove the sap into the ground 
 To never rise again. 
 
 Dark slavery rested on the base, 
 That Africans were brutes, 
 That they should be a white man's slave 
 Or dwell in destitute ; 
 It said his sensibility 
 Was not of human kind, 
 And if he loved, ''twas not the love 
 Which with the heart combines.
 
 And hence the children could be sold, 
 Husband and wife untied, 
 And with a mind all full of glee, 
 In distant parts abide ; 
 No matter what the master did 
 To slaves w r ho were akin, 
 'Twas just the same as with a mule, 
 The master didn't sin. 
 
 These doctrines were supported by 
 Religion, law and science, 
 The preacher who preached otherwise, 
 Was held up in defiance; 
 The surgeon taught that Negro flesh 
 Under the whip and knife, 
 Was not affected like white men, 
 Hence 'twas not human strife. 
 
 Politicians said that it was 
 Fixed as the lasting hills, 
 And God considered it as pure 
 As nature's rippling rills ; 
 The statesman, judge and governor 
 Said that it was a rule,
 The Negro slave should have the same 
 As oxen, horse and mule.
 
 Men divine, wrote book upon book, 
 Forcing restitution, 
 And tried to prove that slavery was 
 A God sent institution. 
 To speak, to write, to think against 
 This inhumanity, 
 Was nothing but a case of what 
 Was called insanity. 
 
 It was at such a time as this 
 That Harriet Beecher Stowe, 
 Called "Uncle Tom" upon the scene, 
 And made him walk before 
 The gaze of all the countries 'round, 
 She made him speak and cry, 
 In twenty different languages 
 She made him pray and sigh. 
 
 She then asked all the world who heard 
 His wild distressing prayer, 
 If 'twas not likely that a heart 
 Humane is stationed there; 
 She brought forth George and showed his grand 
 Affections for his wife, 
 His love for liberty, and how 
 He fought the slavish strife.
 
 She brought Haley, the Negro trader, 
 Who had no human heart, 
 Who stole the virtue of his slaves, 
 And then the lash impart; 
 Who took a newly wedded wife 
 Before her husband's gaze, 
 Could the devil have seen all this, 
 He would have stood amazed. 
 
 She then showed forth the Christian heart 
 Of Mister Shelby's wife, 
 Who sympathized with all the slaves 
 In their discouraged strife ; 
 Who wept when she first heard the news 
 From her dear husband bold, 
 When she asked where was Uncle Tom, 
 He said "the brute is sold." 
 
 These things and hundreds, thousands more,  
 This noble book had shown, 
 And there stood Harriet Beecher Stowe, 
 Between pulpit and throne; 
 She stood nearer the Throne of God, 
 Than all false priests before, 
 And turned the search light on to show 
 The heartache and the woe.
 She wrote brave words and spead them, 
 Upon the human breeze, 
 That made pro-slav'ry clergymen, 
 Draw in their breath and sneeze; 
 Her shafts were sent hilt deep into 
 The tender, human heart, 
 Just like the shepherd boy who smote 
 The giant with his dart. 
 
 This book had made the world grow mad, 
 With slavery and its crime, 
 Before the bloody battlefield, 
 With marching tread did chime; 
 Before John Brown had died to save, 
 Before great Lincoln's call, 
 Before brave Sherman reached the sea, 
 Before Grant captured all. 
 
 She called from out its slumb'ring tomb, 
 Affections of the soul, 
 She armed them with eternal light, 
 And sent them forth so bold 
 Against the greed, the gain, the lust, 
 That these two forces fought, 
 Like Wolfe and Montcalm on the plain, 
 Till right had error wrought.
 
 Harriet Beecher Stowe's Monument. 
 
 She has builded a human monument 
 The walls of which will stand, 
 Long after she's departed from 
 The dwellers in the land, 
 Long after buildings have crumbled, 
 That are planted on the sand. 
 
 She decided to build for others, 
 And the building sheltered her not, 
 And some who dwell within there, 
 Through all time shall know her not, 
 And beneath the roof of the building 
 She'll have no lot or part. 
 
 And yet when the days shall have ended, 
 And beneath the roof tree's shade, 
 The children and grand children, 
 In childish ways have played, 
 And passed from under the building, 
 And vanished into the shade; 
 
 Some dweller beneath the building, 
 Thinking of when it was new, 
 May say as his heart turns backward, 
 Keeping his a;e in view, 
 The woman who built this building, 
 Builded better than she knew.
 And she, though she has passed onward, 
 Hearing the Master's call, 
 May say, though it may not matter 
 To her what the building befall, 
 That it's better to build for others, 
 Than to have no building at all. 
 
 Sonnet, October. 
 
 Here in sweet Nature's lonely gale, 
 
 The leaves are gone ; 
 The autumnal woods, all 'round our vale, 
 
 Have glory on. 
 
 I roam these woods that nature crowns 
 
 With splendor's glow; 
 Where the company of trees look down 
 
 On fields below. 
 
 This month is the gloomiest and saddest 
 
 Of all the year ; 
 For in it nature's summer gladness 
 
 All disappear. 
 
 Nature all around serene elates 
 
 Us from the sod ; 
 And points the heart and mind of man, 
 
 Towards the throne of God.
 
 Maceo Cuba's Liberator. 
 
 While Washington at Valley Forge, 
 Endured the winter's pest; 
 And while he was taking Yorktown 
 Dear Cuba was oppressed.
 When England tried the second time, 
 To rule this country great; 
 Brave Cuba, although in her prime, 
 Had not a ship of state. 
 
 When Winfield Scott took Mexico, 
 And captured Vera Cruz, 
 Brave Cuba and young Maceo 
 Were punished and abused. 
 
 When John Brown died that we might live, 
 When Lincoln called for men ; 
 Brave Cuba was surrounded with 
 The untold Spanish sins. 
 
 When Grant and Meade fought for dear  life, 
 When Lincoln said "you're free," 
 Brave Cuba, under Spanish strife. 
 Said "give me liberty?" 
 
 Thus time moved on, God was invoked, 
 And year succeeded year ; 
 Brave Cuba fought sometime with hope, 
 And sometime full of fear.
 
 But God who's always here with men, 
 Had Him a man in store; 
 And at the heights of Spanish sins, 
 He called forth Maceo. 
 
 When Maceo with courage strong 
 Took charge of battle fields ; 
 Like withered leaves in wintry storms, 
 The enemies did yield. 
 
 He gave this dauntless, brave command, 
 "We must have liberty 
 And in the name of God and man, 
 Our Cuba must be free!" 
 
 At this appeal the Island shook, 
 The natives said they would ; 
 And Maceo with anxious looks, 
 As firm as fossils stood. 
 
 The natives all were 'lectrified, 
 At sight of Maceo's form; 
 And they would stand and do or die, 
 At Maceo's alarm. 
 
 The Spaniards, anxious to succeed, 
 Discarded warring rules; 
 Resorted to the foulest deeds, 
 Of all the crim'nal schools.
  
 They used man's wicked, cunning ways, 
 They gave him friend's salute; 
 They falsified to ambush him, 
 They took his life like brutes. 
 
 But e'er he died he told his men, 
 That Cuba must be free ; 
 The death he died has given them 
 The price of liberty. 
 
 Arnold became his country's foe, 
 Judas betrayed his Christ; 
 The Spaniards entrapped Maceo 
 At manhood's sacrifice. 
 
 They crucified the Son of man. 
 His cause still moves the world; 
 They burned John Huss and yet he stands, 
 Before us as a pearl. 
 
 They killed good Abr'am Lincoln, 
 The cause for which he died 
 Still moves the world, still cheers men's hearts, 
 With men he still abides. 
 They killed the noble Maceo, 
 The world's in sympathy; 
 It says that foul yet implores 
 That Cuba must be free.
 The God of Israel's Maceo, 
 Of Lincoln's liberty. 
 Has written "let my people go," 
 Dear Cuba shall be free. 
 
 Dear Cuba, for a host of years, 
 "Queen of the Antilles," 
 Thy Maceo without a fear, 
 Has died to set thee free. 
 Y. M. C. A. Founder. 
 SirGeo. Williams. 
 
 Sir George Williams, noble man, 
 Half 'cent'ry 've passed away, 
 Since thou first didst raise thy hand 
 To start the Y. M. C. A. 
 
 One little room marked the spot, 
 A few common chairs therein ; 
 And now all o'er the universe, 
 Its sifting the souls of men. 
 
 A few young men, only a few, 
 Paid any heed to thee, 
 Today thou'rt heard in all the lands, 
 Thou'rt spread from sea to sea.
 
  
 I think how many a thousand, 
 Of reckless, wayward men, 
 Have caught the inspiration, 
 And moved off from their sins. 
 
 I think of countless mothers, 
 Whose hearts have leaped with joy, 
 Because this, thy noble work, 
 Has saved their reckless boy. 
 
 I think of unborn millions, 
 Who yet must take the stage, 
 W T ho, only through this noble work 
 Can face the future age. 
 
 "Forever and forever, 
 As long as life has woes," 
 Thy name shall be re-echoed 
 On time's terrestrial shores. 
 
 If only I might see thee, 
 
 To gaze upon thy face, 
 
 To grasp thy hand, to hear thee speak, 
 
 Then I could be embraced. 
 
 I think I could go forward, 
 With brave and joyful heart, 
 Though every step should pierce me, 
 With untold fiery dart.
 
 But I must be contented, 
 With thy likeness and thy name, 
 For countless millions now rejoice, 
 Upon thy spreading fame. 
 
 And I am left to wonder, such 
 That I may stretch my hand, 
 To some still wearier traveler 
 In this same shadow land. 
 
 I gaze upon thy likeness, 
 As young men's earthly sage, 
 Thv work is old and thriving, 
 
 y O ' 
 
 But thou show'st not thy age.. 
 
 Dear sir, thou art not old, 
 Though half a century now, 
 May write its ragged wrinkles, 
 Up and down thy brow. 
 
 And even sorrow may with 
 A shroud thy heart enfold, 
 Thou art not now, and no, 
 Thou never will be old. 
 
 Best Thing in the World. 
 
 What is the best thing in the world? 
 This question to a crowd was hurled.
 
  
 A preacher said "that grand old Book 
 Which beats all men e'er undertook." 
 
 The monk, he said, "the best of all, 
 Is time alone within my walls.*' 
 
 The sage, he whispered in a chime, 
 "The best is the right use of time." 
 
 The fool and idler both did sing, 
 "Pleasure is the best of things." 
 
 Then the soldier cried aloud, "fame," 
 Spoke the statesman, "mine is the same." 
 
 Then a maid told her selection, 
 "Why of course its my complexion." 
 
 Said a young man, "there are two things, 
 A woman's beauty, and how she sings." 
 
 A mother, playing with some curls, 
 Said that "the best thing in the world; 
 
 Is this darling here in my arms, 
 Which we and angels hold as charms." 
 
 Then the wee baby gave its choice, 
 And it seemed like an angel's voice; 
 
 "The bes ting dat eber was or is, 
 Is when my mama dives me a tiss."
 
 Conscience whispers and this is heard, 
 "Kindness, kindness, that is the word." 
 From Degradation Through Supplication to Education, 
 
 The Negro. 
 
 I was once far from civilization, 
 As vile as a Negro could be ; 
 I wondered if all the creation, 
 Could save a poor Negro like me. 
 
 I wandered on in the darkness, 
 Not a ray of light could I see; 
 And it filled my heart with sadness, 
 No hope for a Negro like me. 
 
 But by the wondrous work of God, 
 The world's second Moses came; 
 And through the sea of civil strife, 
 Brought liberty instead of shame. 
 
 From then I started out in life, 
 To make a race pride mark ; 
 But prejudice from my enemies, 
 Kept holding me in the dark.
 
  
 And yet within that self same race, 
 There are some valiant men ; 
 Who gave both their time and means, 
 To remove this dreadful sin. 
 
 My enemies both reared and kicked, 
 I could only wait and trust ; 
 But good men defended my cause, 
 Like Doctors Hartzell and Rust. 
 
 "Shall the Negro be educated?" 
 Is being discussed by some; 
 But while they are discussing, 
 The good work's being done. 
 
 No longer in darkness I wander, 
 Education is shining on me; 
 And unto my brothers I'm trying, 
 To give an education free. 
 
 Dear Lord, I'll e'er give thanks to Thee, 
 For Thy unspeakable gift, 
 In bringing me out of darkness, 
 And allowing a chance to lift. 
 
 And with my thanks I ask Thy aid, 
 For those in degradation, 
 That they may share e'en with me, 
 In Christian education.
 The Model Girl. 
 
 ToS 
 
 A model girl, pure from her birth, 
 No one can estimate her worth, 
 And on this dark and sinful earth 
 She's needed. 
 
 She goes to church and Sunday school, 
 The Bible is her vestibule, 
 And fam'lv prayers, her mother's rule 
 She loves them. 
 
 She always tries to do the right, 
 And if you try to blur and blight, 
 She'll hit you with the Christian light 
 She's candid. 
 
 Sometimes, before she thinks, she speaks. 
 You know in this a woman's weak, 
 Hut if you will explain the freak 
 She'll listen. 
 
 And if she sees immoral trash, 
 She treats it very cool and rash, 
 And all her soul seems in a flash 
 She shuns it.
 
  
 She knows the evils of the land, 
 She knows the wicked ways of man, 
 She takes a high and lofty stand 
 She dreads them. 
 
 She knows if woman stands aloft, 
 The wicked men will scorn and scoff, 
 And yet when they desire betroth 
 She charms them. 
 
 She knows that if she mingles low, 
 The evil class will treat her so, 
 And those who try to upward soar 
 Will shun her. 
 
 She's never wrecked herself at all, 
 At these low dissipating balls 
 Where women dance and virtue falls 
 She scorns them. 
 
 She never goes in public places, 
 Where men and women's evil faces 
 Are ever looking for disgraces 
 She fears them. 
 
 She never strolls the streets alone, 
 Whene'er the sun has ceased to roam 
 And all the stars so brightly shone 
 She waives it.
 
 When men put on an outside show, 
 To see if woman won't adore, 
 While to virtue his heart's a foe 
 She's vex-ed. 
 
 She gives pleasure a reverent touch, 
 She never tries to know too much 
 Of foolishness, gab and all such 
 She's seen these. 
 
 Pure literature attracts her eyes, 
 Trash novels she detests, despise, 
 She sees the future, hears its cries 
 "Protect us!" 
 
 She knows contentment is decay, 
 That discontent brings brighter days 
 By men and women's thriving ways 
 She's busy. 
 
 She knows that early fragrance flees, 
 The deepest cup hath still its lees, 
 And she thinks there's a "yet to be" 
 She's hopeful. 
 
 She sometimes walks in slip'ry places, 
 But pride with all its charming graces, 
 Makes all the evil-minded fices 
 Respect her.
 
  
 Sometimes her mind is fluctuation, 
 Sometimes her soul is detestation, 
 Sometimes her heart is admiration 
 She usurps. 
 
 You see her as she skips along, 
 She has not thought of any wrong, 
 She's firm for right, well tried and strong 
 She's dauntless. 
 
 She never has that vain belief 
 That someone's watching her as chief 
 And asking every one in brief 
 "Who is she?" 
 
 There's a secret she calls her own, 
 
 A myst'ry to most young girls unknown, 
 
 And 'gainst the outside worldly tone 
 
 It cheers her. 
 
 She knows the rock once cleft for all, 
 She stands where'er its shadows fall, 
 And when she leans upon its walls 
 She's strengthened. 
 
 It makes the blessed Savior smile 
 To see a trusty, faithful child 
 Go through the world pure, undefined- - 
 She knows it.
 
 The eye may try to be a charm, 
 But from the heart's imperial throng, 
 Come penciled lines of right and wrong 
 She's cautious. 
 
 Time's etching gives her tone of thought, 
 God's etching shows divinely bought 
 Soul stenciled by the spirit taught 
 She's fix-ed. 
 
 Her sisters all should imitate, 
 Her brothers should appreciate, 
 Her father should reconsecrate 
 And mother. 
 
 I hope her Christian spirit bold 
 Will dwell where summer seasons roll, 
 And cheerful hearts will ne'er grow old 
 She'll like it. 
 
 And when time's clouds have all gone by, 
 And she has quit the world of sighs, 
 I hope the place beyond the skies 
 Will take her. 
 
 Now some of you who read these lines, 
 May try to form within your minds, 
 The reason why I write this rhyme 
 I like her.
 
  
 Well I guess that it must be true, 
 And if you knew her as I do, 
 I think you'd kinder like her too- 
 She earns it. 
 
 Oh, somewhere in this shadowed land, 
 
 A host of shining angels stand ; 
 
 Somewhere the sun is shining bright, 
 
 And hearts are made of burdens, light ; 
 
 Somewhere the little children shout 
 
 And walk the streets, their hearts are stout; 
 
 Somewhere the evil hearts of men 
 
 That tempt the little ones to sin 
 
 Are counted as a wicked shame, 
 
 And wicked men will be refrained 
 
 From doing evil, dirty work, 
 
 Which, from the young ones, virtue jerk ; 
 
 Somewhere good people congregate 
 
 And leave off those who dissipate 
 
 And make them have a strong desire 
 
 To quit their ways and come up higher: 
 
 Somewhere young men appreciate 
 
 The girl who shuns all future fates; 
 
 Somewhere good deeds are recognized, 
 
 And virtue counted as a prize; 
 Somewhere the angels hover 'round 
 To dedicate the earthly town 
 Because it tries to do the right 
 And keep the Lord's will e'er in sight; 
 Oh, somewhere there's security 
 To live a life of purity, 
 Not our town. 
 
 Love's Labor Lost. 
 
 Sweetheart, you know what true love is, 
 You know we have loved each other, 
 You know that we have sometimes felt 
 As near as sister and brother. 
 
 You know, my dear, the time has been 
 When to be in each other's sight 
 And to talk, and hear each other talk 
 To both our hearts was delight. 
 
 You know it has not been so long 
 Since we, in saying good night 
 Would fondly hug and kiss each other, 
 Oh my! what a change tonight! 
 
 Can it be true that some one else 
 Hah entered into your heart, 
 And tells me that from this time on 
 I shall have no lot or part?
 
 Can it be true that all my love, 
 Of which I so proudly boast, 
 Is drift-wood on the restless sea 
 And my task, "Love's labor lost ?" 
 
 Deception. 
 
 Well, dearest one, I hope my heart 
 
 Will stop its bitter sigh, 
 
 Because it never more can share 
 
 Thy glorious destiny; 
 
 My love has never sought reward, 
 
 'Twas joy enough for me 
 
 To dwell alone at certain times 
 
 And cherish thoughts of thee. 
 
 My mother to her child once gave 
 
 Affection's untold wealth, 
 
 Since then I've seen the swift decay 
 
 Of hope, and joy, and health ; 
 
 1 murmured not, at heaven's decree, 
 
 Though thus of all bereft, 
 
 When you and I began to love 
 
 A world of bliss was left.
 
 Though other ties thy heart now bind 
 
 While we but drift apart, 
 
 Yet, am I sinning if I hide 
 
 Thine image in my heart? 
 
 So sweet, so holy was the spell 
 
 By love around me cast 
 
 That I am blinded to all love 
 
 Since this, my charm, has past, 
 
 I feel that you another love, 
 Yet there's a heavy trace, 
 And all the love of others 
 Those bright tints can't efface. 
 I hope his lot a joyous one 
 If you his fate control, 
 I'll try to seek a higher fate 
 The union of the soul. 
 
 The time was, when I looked on thee 
 
 As God sent future bride, 
 
 And had a longing in my heart 
 
 To thus be satisfied; 
 
 But it is best for you and I 
 
 If we are not to wed, 
 
 To know before we go too far 
 
 Upon the lover's tread.
 
 LOVE HKGATNED, 
 
 Farewell, beloved one, when thy brow 
 
 The etipid crown shall bind, 
 
 And when, somewhere in life's abode 
 
 You and someone combine, 
 
 Then think of one who looked on thee 
 
 With more than human pride, 
 
 And glories in the thought that you 
 
 Are someone's rightful bride. 
 
 Love Regained 
 
 If it is really true that I have grieved thee, 
 You whom my soul has always loved the best, 
 Can you not come to me once more forgiving, 
 And lay your head again upon my breast? 
 
 Last night when I in grief and sorrow left you, 
 And heajtd the rapid slam of your screen door ; 
 I felt that I toward my doom was going, 
 And love and joy would be mine nevermore. 
 
 The thought that caused my heart to bleed 
 
 most freely: 
 
 I've always tried to go the true love's route, 
 And then to think my only heart's affection, 
 Myself and word did disbelieve and doubt.
 
 And then I felt that sill my earthly efforts, 
 Were wasted and what we call human life, 
 Was nothing but a sea of disappointment, 
 Of myth and pain, of sorrow, grief and strife. 
 
 Hut since I have received from you a letter, 
 Which says that you have called me back 
 
 again, 
 
 A heavy mist has gathered up before me, 
 When it is gone F hope there'll be no pain. 
 
 If I had known how sadly I should grieve you, 
 
 If I had thought that it was the last, 
 
 There's njthin* in the world had made me 
 
 leave you, 
 And now, dear heart, I hope the gloom is past. 
 
 Can you not see how I have missed you, dear 
 est, 
 
 How I regret I ever gave you pain ; 
 How heretofore I held you first and nearest f 
 
 love, may I say you are mine again? 
 
 1 will be kinder to you. I was fretful; 
 Life had so much that was too hard to bear, 
 I did not understand how self -forgetful, 
 Your love had lightened every pain and care.
 
  
 We grow too sure of those who never give us 
 A single anxious thought; they are our own: 
 I did not dream how much I really loved you, 
 Until I thought my priceless treasure gone. 
 
 I hate to think of sorrow's painful palace, 
 I could not stand to think that you were there; 
 I felt that you w r ere passing, while I love you, 
 Beyond me, among men that you could bear. 
 
 Yet, if 'tis true that you are still my lover, 
 Your own pure life no mocking chance has 
 
 known ; 
 
 Can you not now sweet consolation give me, 
 For grief and doubt that have so bitter grown ? 
 
 Can you not just for my sake once more kiss me ; 
 
 And we'll forget the words that gave us pain, 
 
 They haunt me now, and that you love and 
 miss me, 
 
 May we now call our doubts true love regain 
 ed? 
 
 Love and Pear Contest. 
 
 They say that in each human heart, 
 There is an unseen battle-field, 
 
 Ton which two fighting forces meet, 
 And neither one consents to vield.
 
 LOVE AND FEAR CONTEST. 98 
 
 I don't know who those forces are, 
 
 There's love and hatred, hope and fear, 
 
 There's laughter with his great bazaar, 
 There's sorrow with its bitter tear. 
 
 Once love stepped out upon my breast, 
 And gazing at the vacant skies; 
 
 Had thoughts of one it thinks the best, 
 And this is what, aloud it cried: 
 
 Just thoughts of her is music sweet, 
 Dear A. V. : Oh be still my heart; 
 
 And darling with what joy it speaks. 
 Oh, how it makes my senses start. 
 
 I must confess it rolls along, 
 In scintillating streams of bliss ; 
 
 Until it mingles with my song 
 And thrills me like a pulsing kiss. 
 
 Then fear came forth upon the scene, 
 And said "beware of passive bliss; 
 
 For things are not just what they seem," 
 Then love replied in words like this: 
 
 I recognize the Christian plan, 
 This earthly life is built upon ; 
 
 It gives a wife toev'ry man, 
 And I'll be satisfied with one.
 
  
 Yes surely I'll be satisfied, 
 
 If I can get the one I love ; 
 The one who's taken away my heart, 
 
 And carries it where'er she roves. 
 
 But fear, I trembled at one thought; 
 
 If she consents to be my bride, 
 What, oh what, if I can't supply 
 
 The things to make her satisfied. 
 Could I be happy? No, not I, 
 
 I'd rather be adrift at sea, 
 With the storms around me raging, 
 
 And no one there to care for me. 
 
 But I will do the best I can, 
 The noblest precepts to obey ; 
 
 But sometimes tides of fierce desires, 
 Around my heart doth surge and sway. 
 
 I must restrain the thoughts I feel, 
 Now glowing in my fervent breast; 
 
 They're not conducive to my weal, 
 Simply a love and fear contest. 
 
 Fixed Love. 
 
 You know that I love you, yet bid me adieu, 
 Can happiness live when absent from you? 
 Will sleep on my eyelids e'er sweetly alight 
 When greeted no more by a tender good night?
 Oh, never, for deep is the record enshrined, 
 Thy look' and thy voice will survive in my mind ; 
 Though age may the treasure of memory remove 
 Unshaken shall flourish the thought that 1 love. 
 
 Through life's winding valley, in anguish, in rest, 
 Exalted in joy, or by sorrow depressed; 
 Just place in the mirror that lies on my heart 
 Thine image shall never one moment depart. 
 
 When time, life, and all that we mortals hold 
 dear, 
 
 Like visions, like dreams, shall at last disap 
 pear, 
 
 Though raised among seraphs to realms above, 
 
 Unshaken shall flourish thethought that Hove. 
 
 New Year's Greeting. 
 
 To a loved one. 
 
 As this is the first of the year, 
 
 And I am all alone, 
 I thought I'd try to draw me near 
 
 To thee, my dear, my own. 
 
 Yes, I'm alone, and don't you know 
 
 I do not like to speak, 
 Yet I will, as 'tis fitting now, 
 
 My wanted silence break.
 
  
 There is a love that in my soul 
 Burns silent and alone; 
 
 It kindles flames around my heart, 
 You know that heart's your own. 
 
 The dearest idol I have known 
 Is my dear Lord above; 
 
 The next one which I long to own 
 Is you, my precious love. 
 
 I call myself both chaste and pure, 
 And free from passions low ; 
 
 Hence I know what I say is true, 
 For conscience speaketh so. 
 
 Thy Christian spirit I do prize, 
 For this I've surely seen ; 
 
 For this thou'rt precious to my eyes 
 As gold and jewels sheen. 
 
 Thy sweet face I esteem indeed, 
 So modest and so kind; 
 
 Its presence I forever need, 
 May I call that face mine ? 
 
 I've never written such a poem 
 
 To mortal girl before, 
 Because I've never loved a woman 
 
 As the one I now adore.
 
 During the year that's past and gone, 
 I've launched in a new field: 
 
 That tender chord broke with a song, 
 And now to love I yield. 
 
 As I review my past year's work, 
 Some things I've left undone; 
 
 And yet I feel that I have gained, 
 If your confidence I've won. 
 
 I hope that I have not done that 
 
 To bring thee any pain ; 
 For all I've done was done in love, 
 
 Dear, is my love in vain? 
 
 Throughout the year of ninety 
 
 If lovers still we be; 
 Let's have that love that warms both 
 hearts 
 
 And let our minds be free. 
 
 Miss Snow Flake and the Lovers. 
 
 Little Miss Snow Flake came to town 
 All dressed up in a velvet gown ; 
 
 And nobody looked so fresh and fail- 
 As little Miss Snow Fl.-iUc, I declare.
 
  
 Out of the cozy cloud she stepped, 
 
 Where most all of the snowflakes slept ; 
 She thought her beauty would ne'er be known 
 
 tf 
 
 If in a crowd, so she came alone. 
 
 All alone from the great blue sky 
 
 Where the swift clouds went scudding by, 
 
 All the way from the bright abode 
 Down somewhere near the city road. 
 
 There she rested near out of breath, 
 And there she speed'ly met her death; 
 
 And nobody could exactly tell 
 
 .lust where little Miss Snow Flake fell. 
 
 But a very prominent young man, 
 
 Both for love and his heart's command 
 
 Was out that night to see his girl, 
 
 Whenthe Miss Snow Flake gave her twirl. 
 
 So when the young man said he'd go, 
 He op'd the door and cried out "O!" 
 
 And he fell back most out of breath 
 And almost scared his girl to death. 
 
 That Miss Snow Flake of whom we speak, 
 Had struck the young man on the cheek; 
 
 His shoes were of the patent kind, 
 His overcoat he'd left behind.
 
 And s"he says: "What's the matter dear?" 
 He says, "See how it snows out here," 
 
 And if I have to go out doors, 
 I'll get frost bitten on the nose." 
 
 These two did love from depth of heart; 
 
 In danger's realm they could not part; 
 And now I ask both men and maids, 
 
 Whether this man went home or stayed. 
 
 The Trip I Would Like to Take. 
 
 Man has a curious appetite, 
 He's all the time wishing to go; 
 And if he had the wings of a kite, 
 He'd travel this wide world o'er. 
 
 Sometime I'd like to go away, 
 Far over the Rocky Mountains ; 
 Where the rainbows dance on silvry 
 
 rays, 
 Of California's fountain. 
 
 In the rocks below, in the trees above, 
 In the brooklet and the river 
 I could read and know that God is love, 
 And of all good things the giver.
 
  
 I would like to go to the Yellowstone, 
 And witness the giant geysers; 
 To see its grandure there alone, 
 Would surely make me wiser. 
 
 For in the roar the hissing stream, 
 As it issues from the crater; 
 I could there learn more of the bound 
 less theme, 
 Of a kind and wise Creator. 
 
 Then I would go to the great Black Hills, 
 Across the plains of Dakota; 
 And take a stroll to the rippling rills, 
 And lakes of Minnesota. 
 
 I would sit on lake Itaska's shore 
 Where the Mississippi rises; 
 And Minnehaha's laughing roar 
 Would till me with glad surprises. 
 Id go to the ' Dreaaiy city," 
 Well yes, and while I was there ; 
 I'd make myself a committee, 
 To witness the ruins of the fair. 
 I would journey then to Southern climes, 
 'Mid Florida's blooming bowers; 
 There to sea God's work sublime, 
 In the beautiful, fragrant flowers.
 
 From there I'd make a flying trip, 
 To the gateway city of the east; 
 And from its great exhibits, 
 And Negro arts I'd feast. 
 
 And then a little cruise I'd take, 
 Along the Atlantic Ocean ; 
 To where the earth with a powerful quake 
 Put Charleston in wild commotion. 
 
 I would still continue on my way. 
 Through the Shenandoah valley, 
 Where the ' boys in blue and the boys 
 
 in gray," 
 Would waver again to rally. 
 
 Then I'd go to Niagara's Falls, 
 And there I would learn and wonder, 
 For God can teach in a voice that calls 
 From the cataract's deafening thunder. 
 I'd wander over into Texas, 
 To visit a loving sister, 
 I'd talk of the days gone and past, 
 And tell her how I had missed her. 
 I would then cross into Mexico, 
 And vi-it those ancient mounds; 
 That were built hundreds of years ago, 
 Whose mystery man has not found.
 
  
 I'd go to Italy's sunny climes, 
 
 To the "city of seven hills," 
 
 And from its structure of ancient times, 
 
 And grandure I'd be filled. 
 
 I'd go to the unspeakable Turk, 
 
 Among the Armenian strife ; 
 
 And ask them how from conscience 
 
 clear, 
 They still took human life. 
 
 I'd go before the courts of France, 
 Where Waller was in jail ; 
 I'd prick theirears with facts, and make 
 Their conscience go his bail. 
 
 Then I would journey to the North, 
 To see that Shakespearian land ; 
 Where Hamlet said from conscious wrath 
 "What a piece of work is man." 
 
 I would then go to the Holy Land, 
 Where the Saviour was crucified, 
 Then I could better keep His commands, 
 Seeing the place where He died. 
 I'd traverse all the paths of Paul, 
 Among the various nations; 
 Then I'd go where man had his fall, 
 And view the land of creation.
 
 I'd then go into Egypt land, 
 Where Joseph was sent by God, 
 I'd stand where Moses gave command, 
 I'd tread where Israel trod. 
 
 I'd go into Africa's Jungles. 
 Where the Bible has never been, 
 And attempt God's word to mumble, 
 In the hearts of heathen men. 
 
 I'd visit then the Isles of the sea, 
 And view those novel scenes, 
 I'd tell the people what to be, 
 And not what they should seem. 
 
 If I was able Christian friends, 
 To travel this journey through, 
 It would not be for sights or scenes, 
 But teaching men to be true. 
 
 And if I could on this journey roam, 
 My trip would not be ended; 
 I'd like to view the eternal home, 
 And there be recommended.
 
  
 Alone with Jesus. 
 
 Over the hills and dales, Jesus, that I strolled 
 in the long ago, 
 
 I am wandering once again my Lord, where 
 dame nature's teachings glow; 
 
 And I pause by the \\py to whisper, Lord, to 
 the blossoms sweet and fair, 
 
 A poor little fudacl sorrow, Lard, there's no 
 body else to care. 
 
 Springtime with all its joys, Jesus, is out on 
 
 the old highway, 
 But the breezes sigh as the} r pass me by and 
 
 over the meadows stray ; 
 Mournfully sigh the breezes, Lord, as they 
 
 pass me standing there, 
 By the pine tree row where the daises grow, 
 
 and nobody for me cares. 
 
 Standing alone with the trees, my Lord, I am 
 
 lost in a pensive dream, 
 I am floating away through the happy day, 
 
 when my youthful conscience gleam, 
 The conscience that .-ha red my love for you, 
 
 The conscience that smiled as fair, 
 As the promise true I was glad to view, with 
 
 nobodv else to care.
 
 Over the hills and dales, Jesus, in the shadow 
 
 ing rool of dav, 
 COMICS the echo low of long ago the tendorest 
 
 things to say. 
 And I smile anew as the twilight conies to ban 
 
 ish 1113- long despair 
 With a thought of You that is sweet and pure 
 
 and wonder if You will care. 
 
 Something speaks to me, Jesus, the breex- 
 
 es are singing low, 
 Something that thrills the conscience, Lord, 
 
 and gives them a brighter glow; 
 Something that soothes the pinching pain I 
 
 have patiently learned to wear, 
 Through the endless day on the sweet high 
 
 way, it seems, Lord, that you are there. 
 
 Then Jesus said "I'm with you now, and 
 
 will be with you always, 
 We'll go together and make things better 
 
 along the sweet highway," 
 We strolled through the meadows together, 
 
 the days seemed endless fair, 
 lie told me of His home on high and the 
 
 inanv mansions there.
 
  
 My Bible. 
 
 From Santa Glaus' most sacred nook, 
 Came forth this little prayerful book, 
 On Christmas day. 
 
 As the old year is past and gone, 
 And the new year begins with song, 
 I'll read its ray. 
 
 As we look back o'er our past lives. 
 And see from whence blessings derived, 
 We all should pray. 
 
 Oh ! who so brave with earthly care, 
 As not to give an humble prayer, 
 Some part of day ? 
 
 What heart so clear, so pure within, 
 That needeth not some check from sin, 
 Needs not to pray ? 
 
 Mid each day's anger, what retreats, 
 More needful than the mercy seat, 
 On that last day ? 
 
 What thoughts more dear than that our 
 
 O 
 
 God, His face should hide 
 And say through life's swelling tide, 
 No time to hear?
 
 You have launched your boat on life's gid- 
 
 * dy sea, 
 
 And your ;ill is afloat for eternity, 
 When you have no time to pray. 
 
 You have chosen the world, with its mis 
 named pleasures; 
 
 You have chosen the world before heav 
 en's own treasures, 
 If you have no time to pray. 
 
 When the stars are concealed, the rudder 
 
 gone, 
 Heaven will be sealed to the wandering 
 
 one, 
 Who ha* no time to pray. 
 
 The grave shall yield its prize when from 
 
 the wondering skies, 
 Christ shall with wondering angels come, 
 
 to wake those sleeping in the tomb, 
 Then you'll have no time to pray. 
 
 Oh ! may it ever be said, that this book, 
 by us, shall be read, 
 
 And, may we all together meet, Embrac 
 ing the Redeemer's feet, 
 For we have time to pray.
 
  
 Fashion. 
 
 Master of the woman's kingdom. 
 What is this men say of thee? 
 
 Thou art what the woman honors, 
 Thou art all some care to be! 
 
 And they say, you're loved by many, 
 Loved too often, loved too well, 
 
 Just as if there could be any 
 Over loving in thy swell. 
 
 Sir, no doubt these dear good people, 
 
 Were you not their earthly God, 
 Could fruild them a Christian steeple 
 
 Up to heaven, without a hod. 
 _ Toa and Solomon the wise man, 
 
 Are two fellows of a kind, 
 Just to please the wants of woman, 
 
 You would leave your soul behind. 
 And those sisters that can't catch you, 
 
 What a plight they must be in ! 
 For the song you sing oft leads them 
 
 To commit an awful sin. 
 Now all wicked aspirations, 
 
 Do not spring from souls depraved 
 Into fashion.- Its elation 
 
 Is the sanctity it craved.
 
 19 
 
 In the world's long reign of struggles, 
 Thou hast played an active part ; 
 
 Hast thou during all thy journey, 
 Mended up a broken heart? 
 
 Thou hast found some so despondent, 
 Who the name of God despise; 
 
 Hast thou tried to once control by 
 Pointing over to Paradise? 
 
 When thou tindest men and women, 
 Struggling for the higher life, 
 
 Dost thou lend a hand to help them? 
 No, thou causest human strife ! 
 
 Woman tries to be thy servant, 
 Disobeys dame Nature's laws, 
 
 Ere she reaches thirty summers, 
 Shattered frame and sunken jaws. 
 
 Ere she comes to age of duty, 
 
 Her own grave she's quickly dug, 
 
 Simply 'cause thy longing beauty. 
 Keeps her body in a shrug. 
 
 You go with them to the church house, 
 They do not hear the preacher; 
 
 You are all their heart's elation, 
 You are their Sunday teacher.
 
  
 Thou hast seized the cross of Jesus, 
 Loaded it with new born sins ; 
 
 Overloaded it with folly, 
 Placed it on His back again, 
 
 Thou, in thy domain of pleasure, 
 
 Crush the thorns through Jesus' crown; 
 
 Making men laugh at His passions, 
 And the blood that's trickling down. 
 
 Thou art in the great theatres, 
 Thou art on the ball room floor; 
 
 Thou art in the gambler's dungeon, 
 Thou dost all men's sorrows know. 
 
 Thou hast severed many fam'lies, 
 
 Children off from home have strayed ; 
 
 Father sits there broken hearted, 
 Mother joined thy great parade. 
 
 Well, no doubt you had your troubles, 
 Devils blue that fought your hopes ; 
 
 But you have it back in double, 
 Woman's kingdom in a lope. 
 
 If your lady love stuck by you, 
 
 In the mediaeval day, 
 Ah ! dear fashion, here is to you, 
 
 In these times that is the way.
 
 Always sure you have your glory, 
 
 It increases and takes well; 
 What the end is of thy story, 
 
 There's no paragraph to tell. 
 
 At thy feet a million people 
 
 Lie today without a breath ; 
 Who, in worshiping thy steeple, 
 
 Found an everlasting death. 
 
 Strong Drink. 
 
 There is a crime upon this land, 
 That works both night and day, 
 
 It gives its wicked, dark command, 
 The hearts of men it swaya. 
 
 It brings men from all ranks of life, 
 Down to the brutish tribe, 
 
 Where everything is war and strife, 
 And wickedness abide. 
 
 It goes into the sacred homes, 
 Where peace and love should be ; 
 
 It makes the children long to roam, 
 And home affections flee.
 
  
 It knocks the noble mother clown, 
 
 It kicks her on the floor, 
 And makes her husband give her frown, 
 
 Which follows with a blow. 
 
 Sometimes it curses mother dear, 
 And stabs her bleeding heart, 
 
 And, filled with sorrow, love, and fear, 
 From husband's face departs. 
 
 It strips the children naked and 
 Leaves them without their food; 
 
 It breaks the fam'ly coral strand, 
 And leaves things dark and rude. 
 
 It takes the young man in his prime, 
 And makes him curse his mother, 
 
 But this is the beginning crime, 
 It takes him even further. 
 
 It makes him take the spotless heart 
 Of some bright, prosperous maid, 
 
 And take it to the demon mart, 
 And there has it arrayed. 
 
 It makes her break the marriage vow, 
 
 While in her honey moon, 
 And long from his demoniac rows, 
 
 To roam and cure her swoons.
 
 It makes the young man poison all 
 
 The tissues of her system, 
 And various diseases make 
 
 This maid their deathly victim. 
 
 He soon vacates this world himself, 
 And leaves a weeping widow, 
 
 With mind, and soul, and heart bereft, 
 A past all dark and bitter. 
 
 He leaves with her an infant child, 
 
 With an intemperate birth ; 
 To, if it lives, go and defile 
 
 Some other one of worth. 
 
 This demon takes a million youths 
 
 In every passing year, 
 And makes them disregard the truth, 
 And give to right a jeer. 
 
 It strikes a million mothers' hearts, 
 That should be filled with joy, 
 
 And makes their inner senses start 
 With ' Where's my precious boy?*' 
 
 It takes a million mid-life men, 
 From out the state and church, 
 
 And takes them to its wicked den 
 Where conscience walks with crutch.
 
  
 It takes the old retiring sage, 
 Who should give good advice, 
 
 And makes him, in his ripe old age 
 Detest the living Christ. 
 
 Tt makes the leaders of the state 
 Forget that man needs limit, 
 
 And names this crime incjustrv great, 
 Because there's money in it. 
 
 It fills our penitent'ry walls, 
 
 It runs the county farms; 
 It overflows the prison stalls, 
 
 With all its death-like charms. 
 
 Its fruits are the asylums, and 
 Poor-houses, and hospitals, 
 
 The gambling hell, the ill famed house, 
 Where satan plays the fiddle. 
 
 It wrecks the system of a man, 
 
 Promotes arterial action, 
 Inflames the liver and it stands 
 
 Amidst diseases' factions. 
 
 This prej's upon the active lungs, 
 Which paints the hectic cheek, 
 
 And prophecies a sepulcher 
 For a consumptive freak.
 
 This follows on the fatal train, 
 
 Promoting untold sadness, 
 Until it strikes upon the brain, 
 
 Which brings distressing madness. 
 
 The victim feels himself in hell 
 
 While he's with living men; 
 And he could whet the dagger well, 
 
 To take the life of friends. 
 
 His wicked passions are inflamed, 
 With crime, with lust, with anger, 
 
 And drops his heart in human shame 
 Beneath all human candor. 
 
 He seeks to hold relentless war, 
 
 With God, or man, or self; 
 All men to him are at a par, 
 
 His mind is all bereft. 
 
 This crime is universal, 
 
 It travels this wide world o'er, 
 
 It makes men's hearts reversal, 
 And puts conscience out the door. 
 
 It has swallowed generations, 
 And made whole nations shrink ; 
 
 Its mission is damnation, 
 
 This crime is named "Strong Drink."
 
  
 Sam Jones. 
 
 Who is it for the last two weeks 
 
 Has been in our town. 
 And on the end of every tongue 
 
 We hear his name resound? 
 
 Who is it every night and day, 
 Would draw a mighty crowd, 
 
 And from the depth of his own heart, 
 Poured forth God's truth aloud? 
 
 Who was it that appealed to all, 
 
 To every class of men, 
 And showed the dreadful wickedness, 
 
 In their indulging sins? 
 
 Who was it called the children out 
 
 And told them what to do, 
 And told them what they must forbid, 
 
 To be God's children true? 
 
 Who touched that little tender chord 
 Within their youthful hearts, 
 
 And deep down in their youthful souls 
 Did God's own word impart?
 
 Who called (he mothers out one day 
 
 And opened to their view, 
 The way they must through life's conflicts 
 
 Lead their dear children through? 
 
 Who told them that their mission was 
 
 More sacred than them all, 
 That they built up a platform where 
 
 The child would stand or fall? 
 
 Who told the wives that selfsame day 
 
 What was their sacred duty, 
 And told the daughters, young and old, 
 
 That character was beauty? 
 
 Who told the young men that the world 
 
 Was hanging on its fate, 
 And waiting for some noble men 
 
 To fill the church and state ? 
 
 And then who told the fathers dear 
 
 That they too had a hand, 
 That on the fam'ly's record book 
 
 Were traces of their hands ? 
 
 Who told them that the faithful wife, 
 Who was the queen of home, 
 
 Were due all his affections, that 
 He had no time to roam?
 
  
 Who told them that those children dear 
 
 Now playing at mother's knee, 
 Depended on their father's strength, 
 
 They'd be what father'd be? 
 Who called men from the gambling hell, 
 
 And told them that the cards, 
 That they had pushed from day to day 
 
 Would their own child retard? 
 Who called men from the low saloons 
 
 And told them that the cup 
 Would cause their sons to be like them, 
 
 No better than a pup. 
 Who drew the tears to Christian eyes, 
 
 And caused their souls to weep; 
 Who made some sinners cry aloud, 
 
 ''I'll try God's word to keep?" 
 But time is brief and I must stop, 
 
 Do you all understand ; 
 Excell and Steward both were there, 
 
 But Sam Jones was the man. 
 
 A Human Artist. 
 
 Would that I were an artist 
 And while I stand in time 
 I could show our youths eternity, 
 WVile they are in their prime.
 -Would that I were an artist, 
 And to this American nation 
 I'd picture out the lynching crime 
 And show its revelation. 
 
 Would that I were an artist, 
 I would draw a human heart, 
 I'd show to men and women 
 The effects of corrupted parts. 
 
 And then I'd outline Paradise, 
 And give a celestial view, 
 I'd show to men their future home, 
 If while on earth they're true. 
 
 Maid and Mosquito. 
 
 A maiden sat at midday hour, 
 Beneath a shady tree, 
 She heard a noise within her bower, 
 ** My soul, what can it be?" 
 
 She looked around, but looked in vain, 
 For nothing met her gaze, 
 She quieted down to read again, 
 Its voice -igain was raised.
 
  
 Hark ! hush ! I know it can't be fur, 
 'Tis clearer than before, 
 Is it the whistle of the car, 
 Or distant thunder's roar? 
 
 Ah! soon I'll know for here it conies, 
 My nerves quake in their bud, 
 For with its long and pointed tongue 
 'Twill pierce and drink my blood. 
 
 My doom is sealed, I know my fate, 
 O ! would that I were a man, 
 He darts from his aerial state 
 And lights upon her hand. 
 
 She screamed for help and raised a stick 
 And fought, for she could not hide, 
 The great mosquito gave a kick, 
 Fell from her hand and died. 
 
 She could not read because she hud 
 Deep meditating thoughts, 
 She stood and gazed upon the spot 
 Where she'nd the skeeter fought. 
 
 But present!}' she heard a noise 
 Circling around her head, 
 And there was a score of skeeters, 
 Singing songs of the dead.
 
 She closed her book and sat upright, 
 The skeeters increased their mew, 
 She saw she could not stand it long, 
 So she grabbed her book and flew. 
 
 Magna est Veritas. 
 
 I want to be a soldier, 
 From realms of heavenly light, 
 Be pure in soul, and bold in heart, 
 And guide all mankind right. 
 
 I want to serve the weary, 
 And cause a light to shine 
 In every path that's dreary, 
 To cheer when strength declines. 
 
 I want that meek and tender glory 
 That fills the soul with life, 
 So dear to youth, to age and hoary, 
 To all so dear and free from strife. 
 
 Our lives nre unincumbered 
 By depressing want and woe, 
 And the days fly by unnumbered, 
 Smoothly down time's path they go.
 
  
 I'm trying to forge a key 
 To ope the giites of heaven ; 
 That key's in the hearts of men, 
 And back its bolts are driven. 
 
 Lord strengthen me, that while I stand 
 On the rock, and strong in Thee, 
 I may stretch out a loving hand 
 To wrestle a troubled sea. 
 
 Lord, teach me, that I may teach 
 The things thou dost impart, 
 Help me and my wants to reach 
 The depths of many a heart. 
 
 "To place my thoughts in one line," 
 In a decoration of beauty, 
 And get behind my conscience, 
 My whole life's work is duty. 
 
 These words come to my mind, 
 
 "The work of the world is done by a 
 
 few," 
 
 These words come from my conscience, 
 "God looks for a part to be done by 
 
 you."
 
 Just Married. 
 
 You've launched in a new vessel, 
 And down life's stream you're going, 
 Remember that life's tides will rise, 
 And life's winds will be blowing. 
 
 But while the storms are raging, 
 Stand by each other's side, 
 And just as 'tis when all is calm, 
 Your boat will stem the tide. 
 
 Eternal love and wisdom drew 
 
 The plan of earth and skies, 
 
 Let His great love be e'er your guide 
 
 Throughout your married lives. 
 
 May your lives be prosperous, 
 
 And always full of love, 
 
 And may you both be led by Him 
 
 Whose home's in heaven above. 
 
 All earthly good we wish thee, 
 
 All good for thee and thine, 
 
 And still not only earthly, 
 
 Hut all that is divine. 
 
 May heaven and earth both mingle, 
 
 May earth and heaven be one 
 
 All through your earthly journey, 
 
 Till set your earthly sun,
 
  
 The haart that you have given, 
 The heart that's given to you, 
 May both be joined together, 
 May both be good and true. 
 
 In shadow and in sunshine, 
 
 In sighing and in song, 
 
 May heaven bless your union, 
 
 Throughout your whole life long. 
 
 Woman in Congress. 
 
 Well, a woman went to congress, 
 
 Because she was elected ; 
 She lived in a woman's era, 
 
 Hence she was not objected. 
 
 All of the leading problems 
 Of the country's weal or woe, 
 
 Were discussed while there at congress, 
 And her mind was all aglow. 
 
 And a lady friend said to her ; 
 
 "Did you catch the speaker's eye?" 
 "I sure did, and I'll tell you 
 
 The simple reason why!"
 "I were my navy blue bloomers, 
 
 And heliotrope skirt waist; 
 And his eyes were ever on me, 
 
 I dressed to suit his taste." 
 
 This woman was a congressman 
 
 She had the states at heart ; 
 Of course she had to dress that way, 
 
 For that's a woman's part. 
 
 Life Pictures. 
 
 One little look from mother, 
 Has caused the innocent child, 
 To go into spasmodic shame 
 Or a distillation of smiles. 
 
 Just one little word when spoken, 
 In a soft and gentle tone, 
 May send reviving spirits 
 Into a heart of stone. 
 
 Sometimes a soul that's frigid, 
 Though frozen up for years, 
 May, by an act of kindness 
 Be melted into tears.
 
  
 So we, whose lives are lighted 
 
 With all the world holds dear, 
 Should give to those less favored 
 A kindly word of cheer. 
 
 These little things we count for naught, 
 Hold all our greatest power, 
 The dewdrop on the thirsty bud 
 Opens the fragrant flower. 
 
 Quietude. 
 
 When my daily toil is ended 
 And the sun begins to wane, 
 O. if I could find some quietude, 
 To dispel my care and pain. 
 
 What a peaceful change I'd witness, 
 How my heart with rapture'd glow, 
 While the murmurs of the quietude 
 Lull my soul in sweet repose. 
 
 Quietude while I am busy, 
 Calmly on the bustling shore, 
 Better hearts than mine can love thee, 
 Purer lives thy peace adore.
 
 Should perchance someone enjoying 
 Kesidence within thy shrine, 
 Bury in thy placid bosom, 
 All his cares along with mine. 
 
 A Christmas Gift. 
 (Bible.) 
 
 Do you know that this is Christmas, 
 And this little book is sent 
 
 As a messenger of One who 
 
 Came to earth with good intent? 
 
 Came to earth, left home in glory, 
 On that first cold Christmas day, 
 
 And He's left this as a token, 
 Showing us the right of way. 
 
 When you ponder o'er its pages, 
 Think of how the Savior died, 
 
 How He suffered men's outrages, 
 Loved them, yet was crucified. 
 
 Can we count redemption's treasure, 
 Scan the glory of God's love? 
 
 Such shall be the boundless measure 
 Of His blessings from above.
 
 When the Christmases are over, 
 And the Savior comes again, 
 
 May you join the happy chorus, 
 And in glory be ordained. 
 
 The Negro's "America." 
 
 My country, 'tis of thee, 
 Sweet land of liberty, 
 
 Would I could sing; 
 Its land of Pilgrim's pride 
 Also where lynched men died 
 With such upon her tide, 
 
 Freedom can't reign. 
 
 My native country, thee 
 
 The world pronounce you free 
 
 Thy name I love ; 
 But when the lynchers rise 
 To slaughter human lives 
 Thou closest up thine eyes, 
 
 Thy God's above. 
 
 Let Negroes smell the breeze, 
 So they can sing with ease 
 
 Sweet freedom's song; 
 Let justice reign supreme, 
 Let men be what they seem 
 Break up that lyncher's screen, 
 
 Lay down all wrong.
  Our fathers' God, to Thee, 
 Author of liberty, 
 
 To Thee we sing ; 
 How can our land be bright? 
 Can lynching be a light? 
 Protect us by thy might, 
 
 Great God our King! 
 
 Fleeting Spring. 
 
 Friends, my dear friends, do you know 
 That Springtime's April is gone, 
 
 And lovely May with all its show, 
 Has nature's spring coat on? 
 
 Birds, little birds, yes you know 
 
 That it is beautiful spring; 
 From tree to tree, the birdies go, 
 
 On fleeting wing ! 
 
 Quaker, quaker, do you know 
 
 That the yellow is going? 
 More than that do you know 
 
 That the green is growing? 
 
 Singer of songs, do you know 
 
 That youth is flying? 
 That age, at the lock of your life, 
 
 Will soon be prying?
 
  
 Lover of life, do you know 
 That youth's hue is going? 
 
 More than that, do you know 
 That the gray is showing? 
 
 Time Eternity. 
 
 The Saint's Departure. 
 
 I had a dream the other night, 
 
 I saw some strange and mystic sights 
 
 That puzzled me ; 
 Some things I saw resembled time, 
 And some resembled more sublime 
 
 "Eternity." 
 
 The oriental Persian scenes, 
 
 The tropics- with their bright sunbeams, 
 
 Could not compare. 
 And even Italy's soft'ning hillss, 
 Pleasant dales and rippling rills, 
 
 Would stand aglare. 
 
 I saw the sun rise in the East, 
 
 And watched to see its Western feast, 
 
 It ntrer set ; 
 
 I wandered 'round among the throng, 
 To see if any soul was wronged, 
 
 But none I met.
 
 TIME -ETERNITY. 131 
 
 They all had on their bright attire, 
 It seem'd they nerer would retire 
 
 To workman's garb; 
 I wondered how they could exist, 
 Forever in a pleasure mist, 
 
 My senses throbb'd. 
 
 I strolled around the city's limit, 
 
 To find the tombstones that were in it, 
 
 And as I went 
 
 I saw towers and castles high, 
 But not a white slab to my eye 
 
 Said monument. 
 
 I sought to find the destitute, 
 
 And wondered why they were so mute, 
 
 I felt for them ; 
 I could not get a single sigh, 
 Nor even see a tearful eye, 
 
 No face was grim. 
 
 I went into a chapel grand, 
 
 Its walls were gold. I saw a man 
 
 Stand by the door; 
 
 "There's no place for the poor I see!" 
 And he this answer made to me: 
 
 "We have no poor."
 
  
 I was perplexed, so I sat down, 
 Beneath a shade tree's springtime sound 
 
 And this implied: 
 "Sir! whence come all these loving 
 
 scenes, 
 This landscape to our eyes serene, 
 
 Sir ! where am I?" 
 
 And then out from among the leaves, 
 And from the pathway's flower wreathes, 
 
 And 'cross the stream; 
 There came a thronging band of saints, 
 With countenance above complaints, 
 
 Joy reigned supreme. 
 
 At first I thought I knew their voices, 
 Their greetings to me were the choicest, 
 
 I made a start ; 
 
 Hut they, arrayed in shining gold, 
 Appeared as strangers in the fold, 
 
 I knew them not. 
 
 And when they saw me puzzled stand, 
 The mighty throng did clap their hands, 
 
 Saying "welcome." 
 And all the mystery passed away, 
 The band cried out ' ' you're here to stay, 
 
 This is hearen !"
 
 CLASS VALEDICTORIAN. 133 
 
 I found that time had gone its trip, 
 Eternity had fixed its grip 
 
 On human hearts; 
 The rich and poor together stood, 
 Upon one solid brotherhood 
 
 Never to part. 
 
 And some one said from out the throng, 
 "Are all here who have conquered 
 wrong?" 
 
 He was a seer ; 
 
 And voices from all generations, 
 Sent forth in loudest exclamation: 
 
 " We are all here." 
 An angel cried "Time why depart?" 
 And Time replied with cheerful heart, 
 
 I used to be ; 
 
 But God, the maker of mankind, 
 Said some day I should be defined 
 
 "Eternity." 
 
 Class Valedictorian. 
 To A. R. 
 
 The struggles you have made in school, 
 Today are crowned with honor; 
 You st.-iiid now in a vestibule, 
 That causes you to ponder.
 
  
 School days and childhood days must end, 
 And life's tempestuous storms; 
 From every part are coining in, 
 Be firm ! Be true! Be calm ! 
 
 In conversation once you said 
 
 The highest human standing 
 
 Would be your goal. And you'd be led 
 
 By all your rights demanding. 
 
 No matter what the world may say, 
 Adopt this as an omen 
 That you will go the right of way, 
 And make yourself a woman. 
 
 tt 
 
 A gentle voice is calling thee, 
 
 The future calls for aid; 
 
 And those stern ones in death made free, 
 
 Tell you the price they paid. 
 
 Stand forth for God arid liberty. 
 Stand forth for human rights; 
 In one strong effort, worthy thee, 
 Soul stenciled, be a light. 
 
 Enter the field of life to do. 
 
 Not just to work for gain ; 
 
 For such mottoes make men untrue, 
 
 Narrowing 1 the heart and brain.
 
 CLASS VALEDICTORIAN. 135 
 
 Enter not in si feverish strife, 
 Nor in 'a giddy ing whirl, 
 For these dry the fountain of life, 
 And gulfs the soul in a swirl. 
 
 Enter not in a dull routine, 
 He who was meant to be king, 
 Thus will he made a dull machine, 
 Grinding down to a thing. 
 
 Your classmates have their eyes on you, 
 Your kindred watch your motion, 
 Your friends have all your acts in view, 
 Your ship is on the ocean. 
 
 And world-wide Christendom at large, 
 Stands waiting for your action ; 
 And God, who shaped your fleeting barge, 
 Has with you a transaction. 
 
 Thus environed move forward brave, 
 Surmount all opposition, 
 And on this restless human wave, 
 Make better man's condition. 
 
 Go forth, thou leader of the class, 
 With brain ahead of brawn; 
 Strive e'er to gain the foremost place, 
 Let no man take thv crown.
 
  
 As you move off into life's sea, 
 With skill to use the pen ; 
 Be thou a messenger of peace, 
 A beacon light to men. 
 
 Press on, you have the class's hope, 
 Be brave and watch your course ; 
 Success is on ahead and you 
 Shall gain the wished for shores.

 From the world's great pictures view it,

 PART II. 
 
 Children's Corner.
 
  
 Children's Corner. 
 
 Little Children Love One Another." liil-le. 
 
 I wish that I had the power 
 To dedicate this chapter, 
 
 There's not a single hour, 
 My soul it don't enrapture. 
 
 * * * 
 
 I wish I knew just what to say, 
 
 To introduce this part; 
 Its on my mind both night and day, 
 
 It penetrates my heart. 
 
 * # # 
 
 I wish I had the children here, 
 Well, then I couldn't write; 
 
 My mind would be in such a cheer, 
 My heart in such a flight 
 
 That I would not believe my eyes, 
 
 That I was not in Paradise.
 
 CHILDKEWS KISSES. 180 
 
 Children's Kisses. 
 
 1 John, 3:7. 
 Sometimes we kiss for passion's sake, 
 
 Sometimes we kiss through love; 
 Sometimes we kiss and make mistakes, 
 
 Our kisses should be gloved. 
 We never know when lips impart, 
 
 If it is false or true; 
 But if its from the children's heart, 
 
 Just rest assured its pure. 
 We ne'er have thoughts unsatisfied, 
 
 Which children's kisses bring; 
 No tearful eyes for hope denied, 
 
 Nor taste of bitter things. 
 We ne'er have sense of fallen pride, 
 
 No reason for resentment; 
 No thoughts of wicked Lethe's tide, 
 
 The child's kiss brings contentment. 
 The hope of endless better things, 
 
 The kiss of children wakes, 
 And stirs our hearts, till conscience sings 
 
 And hearts with gladness break. 
 If all the kisses on the earth, 
 
 Were pure as little children's, 
 And I could get my conscience's worth, 
 
 Mv kisses would be millions.
 
 THE SINGING OF BIRDS. 141 
 
 " The Time of the Singing of Birds 
 is Come." 
 
 Solomon's Song, 2:12. 
 
 I sought the sanctum of a bird, 
 
 I wanted information ; 
 I simply asked for just one word, 
 
 To help in dedication. 
 
 Chirped the birdie, "Its an honor, 
 
 If it is for the children; 
 For their holy, sacred corner, 
 
 I'll give you half a million." 
 
 "Little sisters, little brothers, 
 
 I've a message from above; 
 Told to me to tell to others, 
 
 Its a heart brim full of love." 
 
 "While time is fresh and hope is new, 
 While youth is lingering nigh, 
 
 Keep noble things within thy view, 
 Look up toward the sky." 
 
 "I often think how the angels 
 Arc near us both night and day, 
 
 Let us prevent evil passions, 
 From driving them far away."
 
  
 "Just like dear, good little children, 
 Let's try to obedient stay, 
 
 Of the sins and strifes of this world, 
 And we'll hear what angels say." 
 
 Heart Thieves. 
 
 I John, 3:18. 
 
 There is a band of little thieves, 
 
 That often 'round me dart, 
 And like the wind that takes the leaves, 
 
 They steal away my heart. 
 
 Sometimes they catch me unawares, 
 
 And e'er I get my breath, 
 The heart is gone, I know not where, 
 
 But still I'm not bereft. 
 
 Sometimes they come when both my eyes, 
 Are fixed upon them straight, 
 
 And all at once to my surprise, 
 The precious heart they take. 
 
 Sometimes they come in regiments, 
 
 By tens, by fives, by twos. 
 And sometimes even only one, 
 
 But yet the heart is due.
 
 HEART THIS VES. 143 
 
 No matter when or how they come, 
 Though I know they :ire thieves. 
 
 The heart's door is always open, 
 And gladly does receive. 
 
 And if they fail to steal my heart, 
 
 The heart is sadly grieved ; 
 And nothing sare those little rogues, 
 
 Such sadness can relieve. 
 
 Sometimes at home, sometimes at school, 
 
 Sometimes upon the street; 
 No matter where, it is the rule, 
 
 The heart gives them a greet. 
 
 Sometimes it catches one of them, 
 
 And when its not amiss, 
 The heart turns thief itself what then? 
 
 It quickly steals a kiss. 
 
 And when the heart is so bereft, 
 
 O'er wicked ways of men, 
 It receires new strength from the thought 
 
 "These little ones don't sin." 
 
 And all the influence that I have, 
 Which to these thieves is given, 
 
 Is pointing out the way that leads 
 Their little souls to heaven.
 
 ! 
 They take the heart at early dawn 
 
 Way off to Paradise, 
 And show it to the blood-bought throne, 
 
 Around the living Christ. 
 
 They take the heart at sultry noon, 
 
 Into a cooling breeze, 
 Where all of life's hardships make room 
 
 For what we call "heartsease," 
 
 They take the heart at eventide, 
 
 When daily toil is ended ; 
 They take it where the stars abide 
 
 And have its tissues mended. 
 
 And when the heart lays down to sleep, 
 
 While in a pensive dream, 
 These little thieves around it creep, 
 
 And makes the rest serene. 
 
 They take the heart at dark midnight, 
 
 And wander far away, 
 Into the land of pure delight. 
 
 Where midnight is as day. 
 
 My friends, I guess you know by now, 
 Who these thieves are in part ; 
 
 The Savior loves the little rogues, 
 The children steal my heart.
 
 God Sees. 
 
 When I rise at early morn, 
 Need I fear of any harm 
 God sees. 
 
 When I run about and play, 
 If I 'tempt to go astray 
 God sees. 
 
 When my mama whispers low, 
 "Baby you do so and so" 
 God sees. 
 
 If I disobey her rule, 
 Or if I am rude at school 
 God sees. 
 
 If I do the thing that's right, 
 Whether it be day or night- 
 God sees. 
 
 If I do a thing that's wrong. 
 Even though I hide it long 
 
 God sees. 
 
 When I'm through with all the day 
 And I kneel at night to pray 
 
 (iod 
 
 10
 
  
 After I am gone to bed, 
 
 If I cover up my head 
 
 God sees. 
 
 Even when I'm sound asleep, 
 While the angels 'round me creep- 
 God sees. 
 
 So you see I never fear, 
 God's protection's ever near 
 God sees. 
 
 Children and Mother. 
 
 I John, 1:4. 
 
 Isn't it noble children dear, 
 
 To have a mother's voice to hear, 
 
 A mother to honor and to love, 
 
 And watch that you the right way rove? 
 
 Once 'pon a time, I was a child, 
 
 And I enjoyed a mother's smile, 
 
 Since she's gone to a happy home. 
 
 I have felt at times all alone, 
 
 But your influence now I feel 
 
 Gently across my senses steal, 
 
 And undefined, resistless spells, 
 
 Brinir to me thoughts I cannot tell.
 
 CHILDREN AND MOTHER. 147 
 
 I feel her breath upon my cheek, 
 And from your letters hear her speak. 
 Seraphic sounds, more sweetly dear, 
 Than when from her they met my ear. 
 Dreams of you, dear children, keep 
 Your vigils 'round me while I sleep, 
 And wiping off the sorrowing tears, 
 Bring back the thoughts of other years. 
 Bright are the joys your spells create, 
 They place our minds in happy state, 
 For music's charm is weak and faint, 
 To that which children's love can paint. 
 But now I will not take your time, 
 For thou art mine, and mine are thine; 
 Thine by creation's mystic skill, 
 Which formed and doth sustain us still, 
 Thine by the more endearing love, 
 Which sent a Savior from above, 
 Our souls to save, our lives to bless 
 With hopes of untold happiness.
 
  
 Santa Clans 011 New Years Eve. 
 
 Il serins to me ihsit all  f ximis had none, 
 And the new year would l e in the coining morn. 
 And it seems to me 'twa* Santa Clans that said:
 
 X.I.V7M f LAI'S. 14 
 
 % 1 know that the children are safely in bed, 
 I'll just leave my reindeer and slily steal out, 
 And taken good peep at the gifts strewn about." 
 Thetirst place he went to dwelt six reckless bojs, 
 And in a sad plight did he find all their toys, 
 The drums, it was awful, each one of the six. 
 Was riddled with holes there was not a drum 
 
 stick, 
 
 A dog with his tail gone, a horse with no head, 
 A wagon wheel tied to the wagon with thread, 
 And Santa (Maus. you know he felt awful bad, 
 He stood there and looked disappointedand sad. 
 And then Santa went where dwelt three tiny 
 
 girls. 
 All sweet little maidens, with eute dangling 
 
 curls, 
 lie a*d : "They're not lxvs with sm-h rough, 
 
 careless wavs, 
 
 IMM- girls can be happy in much quieter plays." 
 Mut i) he xva* shocked when he entered in 
 
 4 here, 
 
 A doll with l>oth legs off hay -under the chair. 
 A little bird, eyckss, with feathers pulled out , 
 Reposed on n bed with its tongue it) ;i pout. 
 The tea sets so scattered that Santa (Maus said: 
 - J fee-l ve4^v sick J'll go home .and Jo
 
  
 But some one then asked him to sit in a chair, 
 And things were explained to him while he was 
 
 there. 
 They told him that toys wrecked and broken 
 
 but rise 
 
 To take on new value in little folk's eyes, 
 Those drums 'twas a pity it can't be denied, 
 The boys longed to see all the noises inside; 
 The boys found out that they were hollow, no 
 
 doubt, 
 
 We all pay big prices some things to find out, 
 So, Santa, don't plan any vengeance next year, 
 These toys, worn and broken, are none the less 
 
 dear, 
 
 And Santa, all children are not that way, 
 For some have their toys on the next xinas day. 
 Then Santa said: "Yes, I'd forgot childish 
 
 days, 
 I now feel hop'd up, you've explained childish 
 
 plays." 
 Then Santa Claus was asked to give them a 
 
 speech , 
 And this is the way that the old man did preach.
 
 RANT A OLAL'S. 151 
 
 "We can hear the muffled tread of noiseless 
 
 years, 
 And they bear the stream of both our smiles 
 
 and tears, 
 They are loaded down with hopes and dreams 
 
 sublime, 
 
 As they come stealing up the scope of time, 
 We are near the threshold of the open door, 
 We are treading where we' ye never trod before 
 And our days are on a loom and their chimes, 
 And their warp and woof are past and future 
 
 times. 
 
 VN'e are near where the old year is at an end, 
 And we know that the new will soon begin. 
 The year that is leaving may be blotted, 
 But the new one is clear, its page unspotted. 
 Let us make each day a record page clear, 
 Then we'll have a clean volume for the year. 
 Let us grasp now the key of inspiration, 
 And wind our lives with new determination. 
 That through the year now coming clear and 
 
 bright, 
 
 We'll trust in God and advocate for right." 
 Then Santa Claus, he nicely bowed his head, 
 And said the thought of speaking he did dread.

 lf8 TELEPHONE TO HE A YEN. 
 
 Telephone to Heaven. 
 
 A little child with her aunty came 
 
 Into a certain store, 
 But the merchant was busy waiting 
 
 On those who came before ; 
 The child asked many questions and her 
 
 Aunty would reply : 
 " That's so and so. You must be quiet," 
 
 And then she'd give a sigh. 
 
 "Well, aunty, wat is dat nittle box wid 
 
 All dem strings tummin down?" 
 " Why, baby, that's a telephone where they 
 
 Talk all over town." 
 " I want to talk dat telephone." "No 
 
 Darling, not today." 
 "Well, net dat man turn talk for me 
 
 I tell him wat to say." 
 
 The merchant overheard all this and 
 
 With a pleasant smile, 
 He thought within himself what he 
 
 Would say to please the child. 
 And the child had concentrated 
 
 All its thoughts upon the 'phone, 
 'Till the merchant and the woman 
 
 And the child were all alone.
 
 TELEPHONE TO HEAVKN. 159 
 
 "Now I can wait on baby," the 
 
 Smiling merchant said, 
 As he stooped and softly toyed with 
 
 The curly little head. 
 "I want oo to tall up mama," came 
 
 The answer full and free, 
 " Wif zo telephone and ast her when 
 
 She's tummin back to me." 
 
 "Tell her I so lonesome 'at I don't know 
 
 What to do, 
 And papa cries so much I dess he must 
 
 Be lonesome too. 
 Tell her to turn dis eve'ing, tauseat night

 Wif no mama here to take me when the 
 
 Night dins to fade.

 And ebry day I want her, for my 
 
 Dolly's dot so tored, 
 From the awful punchen buddy give it

 And poor little lonesome kittie's ditten 
 
 Thinner every day."
 
 K XI 'K LSI* HI. 
 
 * Succt child." the merchant murmured us 
 
 He touched its anxious brow. 
 There's no telephone connection where 
 
 Your mama's living now." 
 " Aint no telephone in hearen?'' and 
 
 Tears came to her eyes, 
 "I fought dat God had everthing wif 
 
 Him up in the skies." 
 
 The woman with a heavy sigh, and 
 
 Child walked out the door, 
 And the merchant he was puzzled as 
 
 He'd never been before. 
 And he said, I'll ever strive to make 
 
 Myself a telephone, 
 Through which the little children can 
 
 All " know as thev are known.' 
 
 Excelsior. 
 
 (To the memory of Alma, a little niece, born Septeml er 
 12th, 1888, died May 80th, 1891. An angel.) 
 
 Rev. 21:11. 19:1. 
 
 'Twas in the bleak September, 
 
 The flowers were gone ; 
 AVhen our loving flower, 
 
 Dear Alma was born.
 
 11 
 
 EXCELSIOK. 
 
 The flowers came and went, 
 And came and left once more; 
 
 But when they came again, 
 Alma thought she'd go. 
 
 I asked myself the question, 
 *' Why take one so dear?" 
 
 Spoke my heart full sadly, 
 "The answer is not here." 
 
 (iod hath his mysteries, 
 Ways that we cannot tell ; 
 
 He hides them deep like a sleep, 
 Of them he loves so well. 
 
 She had played, and needed 
 
 A little wayside rest; 
 ( 1 ould she have found a better place 
 
 Than her dear Savior's breast? 
 
 Her earthly mission was love 
 
 To and from ev'ry one, 
 She's gone to be rewarded, 
 
 In lands beyond the sun. 
 
 Sleep on, precious Alma, 
 
 Take your eternal rest, 
 Mama and papa're coming 
 
 To take you to their breast.
 
  
 Weep not beloved parents, 
 The Lord, He knoweth best, 
 
 Your child's not dead but sleeping 
 In God's angelic nest. 
 
 She was radiant in beauty, 
 Perfect, glorious, bright, 
 
 God wanted her for a setting 
 In His crown of light. 
 
 When the dead now sleep in Jesus, 
 Rise in forms that are fair, 
 
 Then shall we meet our jewel, 
 Our treasure rich and rare. 
 
 Our diamond, sapphire, our ruby, 
 Our dear little opal of love, 
 
 Our pearl, most precious jewel, 
 We'll meet her in heaven above. 
 
 Where are the Boys. 
 
 A question I would like to ask, 
 To answer it may be a task. 
 But the thought cannot be masked, 
 Where are the bovs?
 
 WHERE ARK THE HOYS* 163 
 
 Congregations' service of song, 
 Thou who workest against all wrong, 
 Canst thou help us h'nd the throng? 
 Where the boys are? 
 
 Young People's Club at Baptist church, 
 Thou who for the boys doeth much, 
 Canst thou answer for us on such? 
 Where are the boys? 
 
 Epworth League at Wesley chapel, 
 Thou who for the boys doth battle, 
 Canst thou just one answer grapple ? 
 Where are the boys? 
 
 These reply to us in sadness, 
 We throw out our wings in gladness, 
 But the boys go by in sadness, 
 No boys are here. 
 
 Pastors, while at morning service, 
 Telling men of God's own mercies, 
 Baffling all these earthly curses, 
 Where are the boys? 
 
 Pastors reply with .saddened heart, 
 The true answer we cannot start, 
 When the truth we try to impart, 
 No boys are there.
 
  
 Mothers ! thou who hast all power, 
 To begin these human towers, 
 Canst thou tell at this late hour, 
 Where the boys are? 
 
 Mothers with the fashions and styles, 
 Have not time to lose with the child, 
 Hence the answer comes with a smile, 
 The boy's all right. 
 
 At half past nine o'clock at night, 
 Up and down the streets in a flight, 
 Some at play and others in lights, 
 There are the boys. 
 
 On the corners they congregate. 
 In wicked oaths they conversate, 
 With a cigarette puff they state, 
 We are not boys. 
 
 Thus they are moving down life's stream, 
 Grasping all things low and mean, 
 Soon we will hear a mother scream 
 Where is my boy? 
 
 This is the way they get their start, 
 The county farms will get their part, 
 Then we hear mother's broken heart. 
 Where is my bov?
 
 WIIKHK ARK THE BOYS? 165 
 
 Then they wish time in its flight 
 Could make him a child for one night, 
 O! on what a different plight, 
 They'd start their boy. 
 
 Too late, too late, will come the cry, 
 Neglected days have hastened by. 
 Hence we will hear both sobs and 
 
 sighs 
 
 Where is my boy? 
 
 In the year of nineteen ten, 
 There'll be a mighty call for men, 
 What can we give as answer then? 
 Where were the boys? 
 
 The nation's cancer makes a dust, 
 And moral virtue calls out thus, 
 Mothers, thou who hast all the trust, 
 Where are the boys? 
 
 Mothers! You have power to save, 
 Down life's long stream you start the 
 
 wave, 
 Mothers ! keep not our minds enslaved. 
 
 Where are the boys?
 
  
 Children's Day. 
 
 1 John, 4: 4. 
 
 Children, when you read that sweet story of old, 
 When Jesus was here among men, 
 
 How he called little children as lambs to his fold, 
 Wouldn't vou liked to have been with him 
 
 / 
 
 then? 
 
 Though you could not see His kind look when 
 he spoke, 
 
 You can only read the story 
 You are greater today while under his yoke, 
 
 Than all of Solomon's glory. 
 
 Though before our time death frost came to lie 
 Upon his warm and mighty heart, 
 
 And it quenched His bold and tender eye, 
 His spirit did not all depart. 
 
 That spirit now from thousands of pens, 
 
 Is thrown upon the lucid page, 
 It's moving, it shakes the heart of men, 
 
 In this golden, yet sinful age. 
 
 It's showing the children how to go, 
 
 To witness a part of His love, 
 And if we will seek Him here below, 
 
 We will see Him and hear Him above.
 
 CHILDREN'S DAY. 167 
 
 He's gone away, only to prepare, 
 For those whose sins are forgiven, 
 
 And many children have gathered there, 
 For such is the kingdom of Heaven. 
 
 o 
 
 Come, look in my eyes little children, 
 And tell me through all the long day, 
 
 Have you thought of your God and your Savior, 
 Who keepeth from sin all your ways? 
 
 When you go to rest little children, 
 
 Right over your innocent sleep, 
 Unseen by your vision, His angels 
 
 Their watch through the darkness doth keep. 
 
 They hearcth e'en the cry of the sparrows, 
 They caret h for great and for small; 
 
 In life and in death, little children, 
 Their love is the truest of all. 
 
 Then we'll pray that the lore which guideth, 
 The lambs that they loreth so well, 
 
 May lead you that in life's bright morning, 
 Beside the still waters you'll dwell. 
 
 Since there's a world that's beyond the grare, 
 And children are all hastening there; 
 
 While you arc in your youthful strength, 
 Incline your dear hearts to prayer.
 
  
 Put your trust not in this world, children, 
 Which has for you thousands of charms, 
 
 Though they catch the fancy a moment, 
 To the soul they all doeth harm. 
 
 We are faced by sinful influences, 
 
 But our Savior was crucified; 
 For your sins and my sins dear children, 
 
 He suffered, He languished, He died. 
 
 But He went and buried His sorrows, 
 Knowing that we all had our share; 
 
 And He opened a crystal fountain, 
 And bid children enter there. 
 
 You children were made for life's battle, 
 And God's sword is girt on your thigh ; 
 
 And the purpose of God is overthrown, 
 If you only linger and sigh. 
 
 For our lives are coinages of heaven, 
 To be spent in a coinage of love; 
 
 'Till all the realms of earth below, 
 Arc as pure as the realms above. 
 
 We are strangers, we are pilgrims, 
 
 But Christ our eternal brother, 
 Whispers from out His blood-bought throne, 
 
 "Little children, love one another.'*
 
 Til K sr.]f/'LK IfKASOX. 109 
 
 I wish thnt your thoughts so heavenly were, 
 And your hearts to Christ so given; 
 
 That all our toils, our love, our care, 
 Might lead us nearer to heaven. 
 
 Were it in my power dear children, 
 
 To set all of sin's pinions free; 
 Your paths should he pared more smoothly, 
 
 Throughout time to eternity. 
 
 Let us all try daily to forge a key, 
 
 To open the gates of heaven, 
 If we make that key the hearts of men, 
 
 The holt will be backward driven. 
 
 The Simple Reason. 
 Ill John, 1:4. 
 
 The sweet month of May was drawing to a 
 
 close. 
 
 The month of hope and promise, of leaves 
 And sunshine that clothes the earth 
 With smiles, but fills many hearts with tears, 
 By calling the victims of consumption to its 
 (ireen gloom. It was the evening of the 
 Holy Sabbath. The public worship was near 
 Over, and never since has my heart been 
 So deaplv touched us by the songs they sang.
 
  
 The children's voices sounded above all others. 
 They were singing, sweetly singing, 
 It was a lovely Sabbath day, 
 And the evening air was ringing, 
 About the little child, Angel May. 
 They sang of her stately sadness, 
 How 'twas whispered in heaven afar, 
 How she asked the watchman one favor. 
 To set the beautiful gates ajar, 
 "Only a little, I pray thee, 
 Set the beautiful gates ajar." 
 "I can hear my mother weeping," 
 Said the child in a trembling tone, 
 Feeling that heaven she couldn't enjoy, 
 With mother on earth alone. 
 She felt that when the gate was closed, 
 Her mother couldn't see her so far; 
 So she cried, "O angel give me the key, 
 And I'll set the gate ajar, 
 Only a little I pray thee, 
 Set the beautiful gate ajar." 
 
 The warden knew not a mother's worth, 
 Hence could not feel for the child, 
 And prompted by heavenly duty, v 
 He answered her with a smile.
 
 THE SIMPLE REASON. 171 
 
 And when the child impressed it, 
 Speaking of mother afar, 
 The warden answered "I dare not 
 Set the beautiful orates ajar," 
 In :i low calm way 1 dare not, 
 4 'Set the beautiful gate ajar." 
 Then up rose Mary the blessed, 
 The mother of the Savior of men, 
 Who knew the child's young feelings, 
 Who had motherly feelings within, 
 She laid her hand on the angel, 
 Whose feelings were just at par. 
 The warden, seeing her expression, 
 Set the beautiful gate ajar 
 Just for the sake of the mother, 
 Set the beautiful gate ajar. 
 
 Turned was the key in the portal, 
 Fell ringing the golden bar. 
 And, lo, in the little child's fingers, 
 Stood the beautiful gate ajar. 
 
 With exultation I was about to rise when 
 A stir was made, and a man rose whom 
 I can never forget. He was an old man 
 I'pon whose frame the years of a 
 Centurv had left their traces; while
 
  
 As snow his white heard hung upon his 
 Breast; and although the lower part of his 
 Face was sunken by extreme age, his eyes 
 Beamed with a fadeless benevolence and his 
 Brow had scarcely a wrinkle. They told me 
 Afterward, that he was the most loved 
 Companion of Christ and in sweetness of tem- 
 Per most like the children. 
 
 Unable to support himself, he was carried 
 Forward in the arms of his friends to the 
 Little rostrum at the end of the room. 
 All rose to greet him, and even little children 
 Looking up into his face with affectionate 
 Joy, as he whispered " Ble^s the children." 
 Having reached the stand, he attempted to 
 Speak, but failing, sunk into the arms 
 Of friends. 
 
 Eyes swam in tears, 
 
 Hearts melted in sorrow. 
 After a little, he revived. They raised 
 Him up again. He looked around like a 
 Father taking his last farewell, then 
 Stretched forth his hands above the group, 
 And, while tears ran down his cheeks, 
 He cried with tremulous voice, 
 
 "Little children love one another."
 
 Til K SIMI'LK RKAS'tX. 173 
 
 He could say no more. It was his last 
 
 Sermon. He looked around upom them again 
 
 With a smile of divine sweetness and 
 
 His lips moved, but we heard nothing. His 
 
 Eves fell upon me and with a feeble gesture 
 
 He beckoned me to him and seemed to read 
 
 My countenance. "Sir," said I, "You and 
 
 The children almost persuadest me to 
 
 Be a Christian. You are fixing to 
 
 Leave me. The children will be with me, 
 
 We are to battle life for each other. I 
 
 Pray thee leave me thy grace." 
 
 Grasping my hand he said, "I leave 
 
 You seven words, give them to the 
 
 Children, they are Faith, Hope, Charity, 
 
 Peace, Joy, Truth :md Love." 
 
 "Father," said I, "can't you tell me what is 
 
 faith?" 
 He whispered distinctly 
 
 "Faith is that which you see descending 
 Down from the realms of celestial light, 
 Something that's on the cross depending 
 (iuidiiig children through this life aright." 
 And what is hope? 
 
 " Hope has a sight which nerves the wc.-irv. 
 And all of its brightness in luster shines,
 
  
 It lights the path when all life seems dreary, 
 It cheers when all our strength declines." 
 
 And what is charity? 
 
 ' ' Charity comes in and helps soothe the dying, 
 Its ears are open to the orphan's wail, 
 It hears the voice of the homeless crying, 
 It feeds the hungry and protects the frail." 
 
 And what is peace? 
 
 "Peace is a calm, meek, tender glory, 
 That fills our souls with the pride of life, 
 It helps the youth and the age when hoary, 
 Itisfree from passion, from war, and strife." 
 
 And what is joy? 
 
 Joy comes pure as a fragrant flower, 
 Its blossoms are scattered along life's* I ream, 
 It cheers the heart in its youthfu! hours, 
 And lulls men's cares like a merry dream." 
 
 And what is truth ? 
 
 "Truth comes in a majestic splendor, 
 And its light shines in all honest souls, 
 It makes men just, in their nature tender, 
 It gives all strength to character it holds." 
 
 I will not ask you what is love, for I beliere 
 
 That is a combination of these six. 
 
 The mortal spasm now grasped him. Once 
 
 More he spake, but it was with the energy
 
 77//-; >/.!//'/,/; A'A'.ISGLV. 175 
 
 Of strong health, " Even so, Lord Jesus take 
 Me" he was asleep in death. I 
 Turned to leave and 
 
 A poor wayfaring man of grief 
 
 Was standing by my side, 
 
 Who sued my conscience for relief, 
 
 His wounded side I eyed. 
 
 He uttered not a single word. 
 But showed his nail'd print hand; 
 He saw my heart was so bestir'd, 
 He said "You understand." 
 He said "go to some mountain, 
 And call the children near; 
 You dip them in a fountain, 
 And teach their heart to fear." 
 He then left me. I am now a 
 Christian. Children I have many things to 
 Tell you, and through grace I intend 
 To tell them yet. 
 
 A week passed and one of the blandest 
 Mornings in June that ever the sun rose 
 I'pon, I visited his library and found 
 On a tablet these words: "Jesus is very 
 Precious to my soul, my all in all, and I 
 Kxpect to be saved by free grace through 
 His atoning blood. This is my testimony."
 
  
 I left the room resolving within 
 Myself to make his testimony my 
 Testimony and to 
 
 Love the children just as he did, 
 Who for love once sweetly pleaded ; 
 Trust and guide, and never doubt 
 Build a wall of love about. 
 
 But I've always loved the jewels, 
 Always thought that it was cruel, 
 To efface their youthful beauty 
 It has been a life-time duty. 
 
 Yes, I love them, I remember. 
 May is not like cold December. 
 If I've words of rage and madness, 
 Always check it from their gladness. 
 
 When my heart is tilled with kindness, 
 And to evil shows its blindness; 
 Then it's time to turn my whole heart 
 Into the porte called children's mart. 
 
 When I'm thinking of my Savior, 
 When I'm seeking good behavior; 
 When I look for earthly angels, 
 Then I with the children mingle.

 When the general roll is thunder'd. 
 If .iniiiiL r the saints I'm number'd, 
 I will search that place of honor, 
 'Till I find the children's corner. 
 
 "And now little children, abide in him; 
 that, when he shall appear, we mav have con 
 fidence, and not be ashamed before him at his 
 coming." I John, 2:2X.
 
 PART III. 
 Ajax' Ordeals on Lynching.
 
 180 AJ AX' 1) UK AM. 
 
 Ajax' Dream. 
 
 Ajax of the Southland 
 
 Was walking out one day. 
 Enraptured did his spirit seem, 
 Inspired by some poetic theme, 
 
 Or heavenly array. 
 
 His gaze was running forward, 
 
 When sudden toward the sky, 
 A buzzard rose upon his wings, 
 From off a dark and ghastly thing 
 Which startled Ajax' eyes. 
 
 A hideous corpse he noticed, 
 
 He shudders, .standing there 
 His spirit feels a sharp recoil, 
 From that which taints the air and soil 
 From lack of burial care. 
 
 The lynchers had been there 
 
 And killed a Negro man: 
 They would not let his kindred come, 
 Nor even friends his corpse entomb. 
 
 Hut left it on the sand.
 
 .1./.-IA" IHtKAM. 181 
 
 Ho almost turns to leave it 
 
 But stops and turns again, 
 That carcass there was once the home 
 Of some sad soul now doomed to roam 
 
 Perhaps in endless pain. 
 
 And so this trembling Ajax 
 
 The duty does not shirk, 
 But with his unaccustomed hands 
 Piles on the corpse the dirt and sand, 
 
 And it was tedious work. 
 
 When Ajax' work was o'er 
 
 Fie said with tearful eyes, 
 "This country, call'd the * land of free,' 
 Has no protection here for me, 
 
 But whither shall we fly?" 
 
 He thought of Afric's jungles, 
 Where his ancestors roamed, 
 He thought of all the foreign lands, 
 \Vhre he thought man could IK* a man 
 Ami have protected homes, 
 
 A ship wa^s there in waiting. 
 
 Her prows turned toward the sea. 
 So Ajax said, at break of day, 
 I'll take this ship ami sail away 
 In search of !U>ertv.
 
  
 He wended his way homeward 
 
 His mind was all af right, 
 He made a hasty trip to bed, 
 And tried to doze away the dead, 
 He passed a restless night. 
 
 But while he slept a spirit, 
 
 Before him seemed to stand 
 The soul whose body on the beach 
 He covered from the buzzard's reach, 
 Who spoke with warning hand. 
 
 "Ajax." said the spirit, 
 
 " Listen to a friend's command! 
 Thou hast in mind to sail the sea 
 In search of free-born liberty, 
 This is thy native land!" 
 
 So when Ajax awoke 
 
 He formed a resolution, 
 He said this is my native land, 
 And if I make myself a man, 
 
 There'll be a revolution. 
 
 And then he closed by saying : 
 "I think I know the sequel, 
 I'll patronize my fellow man, 
 And lend him all the aid I can, 
 And thus build up my people."
 
 AJAX' SECOND DREAM. 183 
 
 Ajax' Second Dream. 
 
 I dreamed I was with the lynchers, 
 And in their arms I lay. 
 Ah me! has the vision vanished, 
 Have the demons passed away? 
 They are like a pack of hell-hounds, 
 They seek an innocent man, 
 And simply on his color 
 He dies at their command. 
 
 Sing to me songs of slavery, 
 They will cool me after my sleep, 
 And with freedom's odors fan me, 
 Till into my veins they creep, 
 For my heart is hot and restless, 
 And all of the lynchers' crimes 
 The hundreds of hanging bodies 
 Are dancing before my mind. 
 
 My soul! this lifeless nature. 
 Oppresses my brain and heart; 
 ( )h ! for a storm and thunder, 
 To sunder this world apart! 
 Stop singing, please I hate it, 
 But take up a buckle and sword, 
 And clash these human demons, 
 Till this lynching world is stirred.
 
 AfAX' SRGOX DREAM. 
 
 Now leave me, and take from my chamber, 
 
 This wretched mosquito, and tell 
 
 The people how much he annoys me. 
 
 With his silly, tinkling bells. 
 
 Its strange, but my nerves he vexes, 
 
 A thing without blood or brain, 
 
 But ask it first please to help me 
 
 To tear the lynehers in twain. 
 
 I long for the jungles of Africa, 
 Among the wild beasts to roam, 
 Where the hissing of the reptiles, 
 Will make me feel at home; 
 In n vision I was transported, 
 To Africa in a day, 
 And through the jungles of memory, 
 Loosen 'd my fancy to play. 
 
 I wandered through the jungles, 
 
 I played with the crocodiles. 
 
 And toyed the head of the hissing asp, 
 
 As we often do n child ; 
 
 The elephant trum)eting start ed, 
 
 When he heard my footsteps near, 
 
 The kangaroo fled wildly, 
 
 Crviiiii in distressing fear.
 
 And I heard a wild mate roaring, 
 As the shadows of night came on, 
 To snoose in the brush beside me, 
 And the thoughts of my sleep were gone. 
 Then I roused myself from slumber 
 And sprang to my trembling feet, 
 Anxious for some one to soothe me, 
 I wandered my mate to greet. 
 
 We grasped each other on meeting, 
 
 And rolled upon the sand, 
 
 And tried our best to kill each other 
 
 How powerful he was and grand. 
 
 Then with all his might he seized me, 
 
 With a wild, triumphant cry, 
 
 That sounded like the lynchers' yell. 
 
 And the Nero's wail and sih. 
 
 We grappled and worried together, 
 For we both had rage that was rude, 
 And his teeth as they sank into my flesh, 
 I)rew forth the lyneh-eseaped blood. 
 But I had courage to tight him, 
 For we were but foe to foe, 
 While the lynchers come by hundreds, 
 To defend we have no show.
 
  
 Other wild beasts were vicious, 
 The lion and the grizzly bear 
 Fought for me in the moonlight, 
 While I lay crouching there. 
 Then down to the river we loitered, 
 Where the young fawns came to drink, 
 And my beast friends sprang upon them, 
 Ere they had time to shrink. 
 
 The wild beast in the jungles, 
 Had tenderer, softer hearts. 
 Than America's Anglo-Saxon, 
 In civilized Christian marts; 
 Would that I had the power 
 To touch the hearts of men, 
 And with the aid of wild beast 
 Heveal this wretched sin. 
 
 Ajax' Fright. 
 
 There's a dreadful horror 'bout me, 
 That nothing drives away ; 
 
 It's with me in my night dreams. 
 It's with me every dav.
 
 AJAX- Fiuanr. 187 
 
 It makes the night appear so short, 
 
 The bed is hard and cold; 
 It makes the days appear so long 
 
 To both the young and old. 
 
 Must I arise from out my bed, 
 
 And start my daily work? 
 The lynchers, just for meanness, will 
 
 My head from body jerk. 
 
 To die like a man by gun or shield, 
 
 Such a death I do not fear ; 
 No other death 'Id be worst to feel, 
 
 Than to leave my loved ones here. 
 
 But fear of being lynched for naught 
 
 Makes all one's senses start; 
 To be chased by hounds and hell-hounds 
 
 Draws pangs to bleeding hearts. 
 
 I hear the hell-hounds yelping, 
 They're coming 'cross the plain ; 
 
 With bloodshot eyes and gnashing teeth, 
 For blood of a Negro's veins. 
 
 I've never harmed a white man, 
 
 They can't be after me; 
 But oh! when they're blood thirsty, 
 
 Innocence is no plea.
 
 188 
 
 There's stirring in my back yard, 
 There's fumbling under my floor, 
 
 Great God they seem to smell me ! 
 The Ivnchers are at mv door! 
 
 Ajax* Soliloquy. 
 
 Riches, which once I held in light esteem, 
 And inspired me now I laugh to scorn ; 
 And lust of fame which was an ideal dream, 
 Has vanished from me with the morn. 
 
 When in my solitary room I sit, 
 And try to see where life presents a bloom ; 
 Not one fair dream before my mind's eye flits, 
 But hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom. 
 
 My heart aches, instead of night rest, HIT 
 
 dreams 
 
 Are anxious, that a cup filled up with drugs 
 For me to drink, and leave the world unseen. 
 And go and be a feast to hungry bugs. 
 
 Would I could fade, dissolve, go and forget 
 That I upon the earth was ever known, 
 For all these crimes, the fever and the fret, 
 All we can do is heir each other groan.
 
 .I/.I.V KIMHlKlf* s 
 
 There is something painful :mi sad to see, 
 "r\voull shock the red man looking fora scalp: 
 A human body hanging from a tree, 
 A white man's victim that had been entrap' tl. 
 
 I often prav, but the only touching p raver. 
 That from my heart doth move my lips for me, 
 Is, "You may have the heart that now I bear. 
 Hut give my mind and body liberty." 
 
spirit, () spirit of the other land. 
 Turn here your voice and in a whisper say: 
 44 O Ajaz ! () Ajax ! come from that stand, 
 And dwell with me in a brighter day." 
 
 I'm pondVmg, I'm wond'ring, I'm thinking, 
 If this world intends to ever get right; 
 It's reeling, it's shaking, it's sinking, 
 Let my soul join the blue bird's flight. 
 
 Ajax* Kindred's Soliloquy. 
 
 In Africa. 
 
 Thelhoughtsof the future doth pu/xlemy mind, 
 And O how I shudder at flitting of time: 
 It seems that it's hast'ning that dreadful day. 
 When no when- in this dull earth I can stay. 
 The power?, of Kurope are taking my land. 
 And siftinir it out at their own command.
 
  
 They do not attempt to civilize me, 
 
 But use all their efforts to make me flee. 
 
 Where in this broad domain can I fly, 
 
 My body to rest and my mind satisfy? 
 
 That land called the Star Spangled Banner of 
 
 free, 
 Toward which all the nations at one time did 
 
 flee, 
 
 My countryman Ajax who dwells over there, 
 Relates that which straightens my sun kinked 
 
 hair, 
 
 He tells me they lynch, tar and burn the Negro, 
 And mangle them worse than the cruel Nero, 
 He tells me to stav here and dodge the wild 
 
 tf 
 
 beast, 
 
 It's easier than being the lyncher*' love feast, 
 The isles of the sea are all filled up they say, 
 I wish a ne.w mountain would rise in a day ; 
 The fox and the panther, the birds of the air, 
 They all have a home in this world somewhere, 
 The sun shines resplendent in its bright degree, 
 Dame nature is pleasant, all happy but me, 
 I long for the wings of the blue bird of flight, 
 To flee from this plain and in mid ocean light, 
 And there put an end to these heart-bleeding 
 
 sighs,
 
 A-/ AX' MO AT. Ml-: AT. 191 
 
 And banish the tears from my long weeping 
 
 eyes. 
 
 O God! is the time ever coining again 
 When I can .sec peace in this broad domain? 
 If not take me now in the palm of thy hand, 
 And fling me away from this blood-shedding 
 
 land. 
 
 And if I don't land in thy mansions all fair, 
 Just fling me until I am nothing but air. 
 The lynchers, the lynchers are here by the 
 
 throng ! 
 My Savior, my Savior, O, why was I born. 
 
 Ajax' Monument. 
 
 When in the shadow of the tomb, 
 
 My heart shall rest, 
 Please lay me where spring flowers bloom 
 
 On earth's jrreen breast. 
 
 r- 
 
 Please never in vaulted box place 
 
 My lifeless frame, 
 For it is not the best of grace, 
 
 Yes, I am sane.
 
 In some sweet village of the dead 
 
 I'd like to sleep, 
 Where flowers may deck my little bed, 
 
 Where angels creep. 
 
 And if the children in their roam 
 
 Know not the spot; 
 Enough if but by lore alone, 
 
 I'm not forgot. 
 
 But I'm a Negro and I need 
 
 Not so lament, 
 For never did a lyncher's creed 
 
 Say " monument." 
 
 My God, will the time ever be, 
 
 When I can have 
 Pure thoughts without the lyn* JUTS' glee 
 
 To make me swear? 
 
 Ajax' Song. 
 
 (Tune: " Tenting en the Old Camp Ground.") 
 
 We are thinking today of the loved ones lost, 
 Gone through the lynchers' hand; 
 
 Of the innocent men who have gone across 
 The bridge where villains stand.
 
 AJAX' SONG. 193 
 
 CHORUS. 
 
 Many arc the hearts that are mourning today, 
 Mourning for the loved ones mobbed, 
 
 Many are the eyes full of tears that say, 
 Why are we left in sobs? 
 
 Help us to say, "Humbly we pray, 
 Father, is it brighter ahead?" 
 
 We are hoping today that the Christian world, 
 Will yet see the matter straight ; 
 
 And will see that this question is all unfurl'd, 
 Before time replies, "too late!" 
 
 CHORUS: Many are the hearts, etc. 
 
 We are praying today to our God on high, 
 
 To wrestle this lynching age ; 
 To listen to the widow's and orphan's cry, 
 
 That's caused by this outrage. 
 
 CHORUS: Many are the hearts, etc. 
 
 We are weeping today but the hour will come, 
 
 When the lynchers all shall see 
 That America is the Negro's home, 
 
 And here he's bound to be. 
 
 CHORUS: Manv are the hearts, etc.
 
  
 Ajax* Meditations. 
 
 If I should die 
 
 Today or tomorrow, 
 
 And my soul fly, 
 
 Into bliss or sorrow, 
 Would any who never saw my face, 
 Know that on this earth I had filled a place? 
 
 If I should sail 
 
 Away on some great ship, 
 
 And in a gale 
 
 Should end my earthly trip, 
 Would anyone while riding o'er the waves, 
 Remember me while in my wat'ry grave? 
 
 If I should stray, 
 Way off in the wild woods, 
 And be the prey 
 To vicious wild beasthood, 
 Would future men while lev' ling down the plain, 
 Know that I'd ever been in this domain? 
 
 If I, at home, 
 
 Were quietly sleep in bed ; 
 
 And lynchers roamed, 
 
 To tar arid burn my head, 
 
 They would prevent my friends from burying me 
 Could future men say that I used to be ?
 
 .17.1 A" MEDITATION*. 19o 
 
 If when I'm dead, 
 The future children come, 
 With joyous tread 
 And human beating drums, 
 Will they while either at their work or play, 
 Remember that poor Ajax had a day? 
 
 Songsters will sing, 
 While I am dead and gone ; 
 Their echo'll ring, 
 And thrill the living throng, 
 Will any songs remind the living men, 
 That poor Ajax upon the earth has been? 
 
 A cent'ry hence, 
 
 While boys and girls in school, 
 
 Upon the bench 
 
 Obey the teacher's rule, 
 
 Will any book show them the deeds and acts, 
 Of trembling, poor, despis'd, oppress'd Ajax? 
 
 God hold my hand, 
 And give me power to write, 
 Give me command, 
 That I may say what's right. 
 I'll write a book before I leave this land, 
 To show tho world that Ajax was a man.
 
  
 A Mother's Rage. 
 
 Fruits of Lynching. 
 
 A mother stood at the river brink 
 
 Holding in her arms a dear child, 
 'Twas all on earth that the mother had, 
 
 And she said with a sacred smile : 
 " Your father did all a man could do 
 
 To live for you and for me ; 
 But the wicked lynchers murdered him, 
 
 Irrespective of mother's plea." 
 
 She says, " I know whereof I speak, 
 
 In the sight of these my own eyes, 
 Your father said in a mournful tone: 
 
 'Dear wife, kiss the baby good-bye,' 
 And that was the last I heard of him ; 
 
 I knew not the lynchers' plan. 
 The world is witness to one true fact, 
 
 Thy father was an honest man. 
 
 But honesty in this fast age, 
 
 In regards to the dusky race 
 Has carried many 'cross the dark stage, 
 
 And brought to the whites a disgrace. 
 If this mode of death is continued, 
 
 Why should I leave you, my dear boy, 
 To have your life blotched with such sights, 
 
 Such a life you cannot enjoy !
 
 .1 MoTlIKtfS KAtiK. 197 
 
 My child, I am almost tempted now 
 
 To throw thee into this river, 
 And let thy soul go wandering back 
 
 To Him who is the great forgiver. 
 For then thy mother will be satisfied 
 
 That thou art in God's tender care, 
 For another death like thy father's 
 
 Thy mother, she can never bear. 
 
 And then, my child when you have passed 
 
 Beyond earth's shadows and its teachings, 
 When Paradise is reached at last, 
 
 Brought to you by the Lord's entreating, "~ 
 When starry crowns shall deck your brow, 
 
 And white robes to you be given, 
 My child, you can't imagine now, 
 
 How sweet 'twill 1x3 in heaven. 
 
 The "many mansions" high in air 
 
 Will glearn with more than earthly splendor, 
 And the shining angels, pure and fair, 
 
 Will greet you with a love most tender ; 
 Your head in grief shall never bow 
 
 But rapturous joy'll to you be givn, 
 My child, you can't imagine now 
 
 How sweet 'twill be in heaven.
 
 19S AJAX* 
 
 But oh ? my child my heart repines, - 
 
 How horrible would be the guilt 
 When in after years it corner to mind 
 
 That your blood was by mother spilt 
 My child, I cannot bear to think 
 
 Of throwing thee into the tide ; 
 But oh r the lynchers ! the lynchers I 
 
 The mother fainted! and died. 
 
 Ajax* Bashfulness.- 
 
 I was once out of social circles, 
 As bashful a-s a young man could be; 
 And I wondered if all society 
 Could m-ake a socialist of me. 
 
 1 wandered on in my bashfullness, 
 Nothing socially good could I see ; 
 And the thought filled my heart with sad 
 ness, 
 No socraV redemption for mev 
 
 I vrent to a tmvn on probation, 
 And my bashf umess^ followed me r 
 And while in deep meditation, 
 A voice gently whispered to me*.
 
 A.TAT 
 
 It was the voice of a social dub, 
 That was speaking so kindly to me^ 
 And I heard its social improvements 
 Saying tenderly, *'come unto me." 
 
 I went to the club very shyly. 
 They gladly accepted of me, 
 But I told them I was so bashful, 
 A socialist I never could be. 
 
 And I found that while it was social, 
 Some other things they'd review; 
 There was moral's tie and culture's trend. 
 They ever had in view. 
 
 The first time that they called on me, 
 I didn't have very much blood, 
 But all I hud to my head did flee, 
 And I felt like social mud. 
 
 And when I got through theyallclapMme, 
 "*Twas not about what I said ; 
 But they were, through sympathy, 
 Clapping the blood from my head, 
 
 We next had the social jubilee, 
 And from my heart I wondered", 
 If any girl there would talk to me 
 A simple, social blunder.
 
  
 And when I came to myself again, 
 I was drifting down the tide; 
 I was in the boat for the social port, 
 With a ladv on each side. 
 
 Ajax Looks Beyond. 
 
 I have tried to be contented 
 In this land of vale and tears, 
 When I think how Christ, the Savior, 
 Suffered here without a fear ; 
 But the way that I am treated 
 In this low slough of despond, 
 Makes me long to be transported 
 To the calm, unknown beyond, 
 
 I am longing for a moment 
 
 When I can this country leave ,' 
 
 For some unknown, peaceful city, 
 
 Where the} r never sigh or grieve, 
 
 W T here the mansions glow with beauty, 
 
 Which to mortals is unknown ; 
 
 I am waiting, I am longing 
 
 In those brighter realms to roam.
 
 AJAX VOTES FOR MCKINLKY. 201 
 
 I am longing for the breaking 
 Of the day when I'll be free, 
 And can leave behind the heartaches, 
 And toward my Savior flee; 
 When I shall to lynching horrors, 
 In this cold world bid adieu, 
 I am waiting, I am longing, 
 And my race is waiting too. 
 
 Ajax Votes for McKinley. 
 
 Ajax went out to vote 
 
 On election day ; 
 White man was standing 'round, 
 
 Things had gone his way. 
 
 Ajax had heard before 
 How the white man done, 
 
 Made Negroes vote with him 
 Or, he had a gun. 
 
 White man said to Ajax, 
 "Well, how do you stand?" 
 
 Ajax said to white man, 
 "Straight republican."
 
  
 White man said to Ajax, 
 "Leave the poles at once." 
 
 Ajax said to white man, 
 "You must be a dunce." 
 
 White man said to Ajax, 
 "You don't mean to go?" 
 
 Ajax said to white man, 
 "While I'm livingNo!" 
 
 Ajax said, quite raging, 
 "This thing's got to stop, 
 
 Bossing Negroes' voting, 
 No more'll be a sop." 
 
 White man saw that Ajax 
 Was not like the rest ; 
 
 Could not be bluffed away 
 With a little jest. 
 
 White man said to Ajax, 
 ' Why are you so bold?" 
 
 Ajax said to white man, 
 "Mj rights to control." 
 
 White man said to Ajax, 
 "I don't mean to fight." 
 
 Ajax said to white man, 
 "I'm for peace and right."

 Ajax' Conclusion. 
 
 My friends, our race is ostracised, 
 Long standing tears are in our eyes, 
 And we as meek and humble doves, 
 Endure it all with smiles and love. 
 And those who try to crush us down 
 Return our smiles in hateful frowns, 
 So we must rise and strike a blow, 
 When e'er these demons block our door. 
 
 As long as we retreat from them, 
 
 They'll use us as their limber-jim, 
 
 But if we punishments resist, 
 
 The white man'll know that we exist, 
 
 And if we all united stand, 
 
 We can our rights as men demand; 
 
 But we must show determination, 
 
 Instead of meek disconsolation. 
 
 The red man showed that he would tight, 
 This country gave him certain rights, 
 They never lynch an Indian chief, 
 They know his friends come to relief, 
 The foreigner from 'cross the sea, 
 Has all the rights of liberty, 
 Because if humans take his scalp, 
 His countrymen will raise a scrap.
 
 AJAX* CONCLUSION. 205 
 
 The rattlesnake, the white man dreads, 
 And on his body will not tread, 
 Because he knows the rattlesnake, 
 If touched, will to'ard the toucher make. 
 The harmless ant upon the ground, 
 Men trample on without a frown, 
 If we resist, we'll gain respect, 
 If we unite 'twill take effect. 
 
 There must be some blood shed by us, 
 When Southern brutes begin to fuss, 
 Some Brown and Turner' ve got to die, 
 To picture to the demon's eye 
 The fact that we are in this land 
 To stay, 'till God gives us command 
 To move away, and until then, 
 We must be recognized as men. 
 
 We made the South-land with our toil, 
 And we intend to share the spoil, 
 But sometimes it seems just as well 
 To have a residence in hell. 
 Poor men are cut and burnt like fuel, 
 The country does not call it cruel. 
 Someone must rouse this base-ball ar-. 
 To overcome this black outrage.
 
  
 Who's more fit to defend this right, 
 Than we who've seen these wicked sights? 
 Stern freedom's voice bids us arise, 
 Our patient ways she does despise, 
 Contentment makes real life decay. 
 Brave discontent brings brighter day, 
 What we are now, the past has made, 
 The future's on our shoulders staid. 
 
 Ajax is Chastised. 
 
 Ajax, in the stillness of the night, 
 
 Lie down and take thy rest ; 
 Live in the dreams of the starry light 
 
 As the bird in its nest. 
 
 This world is filled with sorrow and shame, 
 
 With sin, with tumult rife; 
 But as metal is fused by the flame, 
 
 So men are made by strife. 
 
 Ere long from now, thy feet may turn 
 
 From this distressing mood ; 
 So lose the thought that men are burned, 
 
 And help to make life good.
 
 A./ A X AT THE CENTENNIAL. 207 
 
 And Ajax, though it wounds and grieves, 
 We grow strong by lees of pain, 
 
 So shelter your heart against the thieves, 
 And be thyself again. 
 
 You have your life, why not be glad? 
 
 For the gift of life is good; 
 But the lessons of life are sfreat and sad 
 
 To thy dear brotherhood. 
 
 So turn your back on the sinful ways. 
 
 And blend the race together; 
 Let us unite for a brighter day, 
 
 And help to make life better. 
 
 Ajax at the Centennial. 
 
 1897- 
 
 Ajax went over to Nashville, 
 To attend the great centennial ; 
 And a white man asked him rashly 
 About the race in general. 
 
 "Ajax, tell me the whole se-juel: 
 Your father was my father's slave, 
 And now you stand as my equal, 
 On this educational wave."
 
 2C8 AJAX AT THE CENTENNIAL. 
 
 And Ajax paused for a moment, 
 Slightly hanging down his head; 
 And then from the depth of conscience, 
 These are the words that he said : 
 
 "You know it was sixteen-nineteen, 
 When my first African brother, 
 Sailed over here in a canteen, 
 And called America his mother. 
 
 He climbed up degradation's hill, 
 
 Two hundred and fifty years ; 
 
 And over the Israelitic rills, 
 
 He waded through heartaches and tears 
 
 In his efforts to leave degradation, 
 He was cramped, doomed in a cell ; 
 Dishearten'd,discontent'd, discourag'd, 
 By a prejudice born in hell. 
 
 But through God's work, who guides 
 
 man's life, 
 
 The world's second Moses came; 
 And through the sea of civil strife, 
 Brought freedom instead of shame. 
 
 From there we started out in life, 
 To make a mark as a race; 
 But someone's ever causing strife, 
 Brinnnjf on us a disgrace.

 
 You take the thousand oppressions, 
 That are hurled into our face; 
 And change them to progression, 
 Then we will be a race. 
 
 My sir, it is a will-known fact, 
 That the Negroes' aim is high, 
 And if they'll stop holding him back, 
 He'll reach them unless he dies. 
 
 He's in the national government, 
 He's been a military man; 
 And in these United States, 
 He's been surveyor of lands. 
 
 He's widely known in medicine, 
 He's faced millions as teacher; 
 Thundered his eloquence at the bar, 
 He can't be excelled as preacher. 
 
 And in hundreds of newspapers, 
 He tones up ideas and thoughts ; 
 In connection with his people, 
 To show what they have wrought. 
 
 A- for a Southern laboring man, 
 His equal cannot be found; 
 And to find a regular Negro tramp. 
 You must search the countrv 'round.
 
  
 In scholarship he's stood the test, 
 In the institute's at home; 
 And 'cross the sea without a jest, 
 His eloquence is known. 
 
 He's writing poetry books and prose, 
 To scatter over the land ; 
 To show the depth from which he 'rose, 
 The height where now he stands. 
 
 A hundred thousand students now, 
 Behind the study desk ; 
 Have fix'd a frown upon their brow, 
 They will not be oppressed. 
 
 I think I see the coming time, 
 When this curs'd lynching land; 
 Will see the Negro's worth sublime, 
 And claim him as a man. 
 
 And my dear sir, fifty years hence, 
 When your grandchildren stand ; 
 Ajax grandchildren's recompense, 
 Will show an equal man. 
 
 A hundred years from now my friend, 
 Could you and I peep back ; 
 We cannot tell vour children then, 
 From those of poor Ajax.

 Ajax' Appeal to America. 
 
 My country, noble spectre of the past; 
 Along thy rivers, and within thy vales, 
 There breathes a deep-toned voice, that tells 
 
 of days, 
 
 When thou wert called thecountry of the free 
 Admiredand frequented; when pilgrim 'd hosts 
 Trod thy sanctomed shores, and music filled 
 The air with freedom. Broad hearts of men 
 Were thine, in bonds of union ; and around, 
 The voice of love and happiness arose. 
 Voluptuous life enkindled every heart 
 But as time moved on in silence, 
 A dreadful change took place, 
 The great Abe. Lincoln wept, he saw the wreck 
 That slavery scattered 'round him and he 
 
 mourned 
 To think that scenes so bright should fade so 
 
 soon. 
 
 Thou wa^t a marvelous country, ere the star 
 That lit the way to Bethlehem, gleamed the 
 
 east , 
 
 And heralded a Savior and perhaps, 
 Thy shores resounded with the hum of men, 
 NVlien Ajax on the Afrie shores did live.
 
  
 Thou wast a brilliant mystery- and from far, 
 The nations of the earth poured into thee. 
 Thou prospered well, now four wars, 
 Stamped upon thy flag, but these four wars, 
 And four timesfourlarge warsof ancient times, 
 Could not shed blood enough to cover up 
 The principle that underlies the greatest 
 Of all wars, that's waged by thee 'gainst thine, 
 Andthoucould'st with one stroke exterminate. 
 Thou claimes't to be a Christian country, 
 And rankest with highly civilized countries, 
 And there is nothing in the category of crime, 
 Or in the history of savages to surpass those- 
 Fiendish, blood-chilling horrors perpetrated 
 
 against 
 My people by your Christians. The southern 
 
 mob, 
 
 When in its rage feeds its vengancc by shoot 
 ing, 
 
 Stabbing and burning men alive, which only 
 Some disgusting birds and beasts, would do. 
 And to plead "not guilty" is a waste of time, 
 For when the mob's will has been accomplish- 
 
 ed, 
 
 And its thirst for blood has by its bands been 
 quenched.

 And the victim is speechless, silent, dead, 
 Then the moboeratic amusers have the ear of 
 The world all to themselves, and the world 
 Listens to them because thy noble govern 
 ment, 
 
 Planted by the Pilgrim Fathers, Defended by 
 Noble Washington and regenerated by God-

 Urges it on and it widens as the waters 
 Of the Mississippi entering the great gulf.

 Who looks across the sea, and never comes, 
 Thinks thou art great, magnanimous and brave, 
 And we have heartily hoped that this estimate, 
 Would soon cease to be contradicted. Instead 
 
 our 
 
 Confidence in thy nobility as a nation has been 
 Shaken and the future all looks dark 
 And troubled. This tends to dim the lustre 
 Of thy noble name and to obliterate the 
 Cause of liberty which thou hast sung to the 
 
 world.

 Thy moral sense is now on a decline and we 
 May well ask the question " how low " someof 
 Thy safe guards are swept away. Supreme 
 Courts are surrendered, State sovereignly i? 
 Restored, Civil rights are destroyed, men 
 
 are 
 
 Lynched like beast of the forest. What next ? 
 Emmigration wont save us for we are convinced 
 That this is our native land. Neither will 
 Colonization redeem us for we are colonized 
 To day upon the land that gave us birth. 
 Think, O America, of the sublime and glorious 
 Truths with which, at thy birth, thou saluted 
 A listening world. Thy voice was then the 
 Trump of an archangel, summoning oppres 
 sion, 
 And time-honored tyranny to inherit the sweet 
 
 V V 
 
 Freedom of thy shores. The oppressed flock

 Crowned heads trembled, toiling millions

 than the unspeakable Turks do 
 The Armenians, or the dread Spaniards 
 Do the Cubans. Are th,e horrors of Siberia, 
 Against the thriving Jew to be exceeded 
 By thy Christian crimes? 
 
 To thee 
 
 One came in humble guise, upon whose brow 
 A sweet harmonious peace in beauty shone. 
 Towards portals of peace, the heroic Ida Wells 
 Reposed within thy house, and talked of right. 
 Oh, had thy powers then but heard her voice, 
 And trod the way she pointed, then with thee 
 This darkness would have ended, and this 
 
 crime 
 Which hangs about thy neck, would hang no 
 
 more. 
 Rut, hit-king the \vanu hope that filled her 
 
 breast, 
 To cheer the rose-lipped nymph in her great 
 
 work, 
 
 She down-cast minded, but determined soul 
 Keptn sujwrior thought and crossed the sea. 
 From thy great name she could have told 
 Of the bright mansions in the freeman's land: 
)Yr which no night descended, From herlips, 
 The foreign nations could have learned of love
 
  
 And friendship, such as this lynched land of ours 
 Can show no sign or symbol. 
 
 Ida's faith 
 
 Was weak and wavering, and she opened up 
 The eyes of Christian nations far across the 
 Sea who've been in darkness and misled 
 For quite a while. And they do think that 
 When a nation's moral tone is on the decline, 
 We well may wonder what will be the depth. 
 Thou art declining noble state ! and the breath 
 Of pestilence among thy lynching towns 
 Sweeps to and fro, and in the place, 
 Where Lincoln's armies rode, there lies a 
 
 shade, 
 
 That of late days have gathered like a pall. 
 A midnight hangs upon thee not alone 
 This lynching crime, but the dim eclipse 
 Of moral desolation. Heaven's frown 
 Is visible around thee. Rise! thou wreck 
 Of slf downfall, and call upon thy God 
 If alone, so that those within thy bound, 
 This land so dark and cheerless, may not 
 See the bright day of hope in gloom go down I 
 But where protection, which is life and light, 
 Broods ever like the grandure of the stars, 
 That studs the summer skies of boundless 
 
 blue.

 With hauds outstretched, they beckoned me

 And heads of men were thrown at me in

 I further noticed a partly eaten body 
 Mangled and bruised. I shrieked aloud. 
 And then I saw a sight that captured all. 
 A mother, deathly clad, who in her arms, 
 Upheld a child. She cast her eyes on high, 
 And then she cast her infant from her. 
 It sank beneath the waves and was gone. 
 A mother drowned her own dear child.

 And it had all the semblance of a house, 
 
 And my bewildered mind beheld unreal

 Gray haired man stand mute as death 
 And by his side I saw one young in years

 He hid his face hehind his hands 
 As if in sorrow. And behold the old man 
 Turned his back to him.

 But during this mighty struggle with 
 
 Ajax and his foes, 
 He and one man fighting for life had 
 
 drifted from the shore. 
 And Ajax fought a brave man's fight 
 
 against a watery grave, 
 Exhausted down he seized some planks 
 
 adrift upon the waves. 
 He stepped upon his rescu'd ship with 
 
 clothes all dripping wet, 
 And blood from every garment fell, his 
 
 eyes the white man's met. 
 Death had pressed him closely and 
 
 precious was rach second 
 Two hands from out the water reached, his 
 
 eyes toward Ajax beckoned.
 
  
 There was the bloodless pallor of a wretched 
 
 drowning man 
 With mouth all gaping, eyes bloodshot and 
 
 hair on end did stand. 
 The struggling white man exhausted from 
 
 trying to kill Ajax 
 Was fighting with water, now his strength 
 
 was all relaxed. 
 He cried'* I perish my dear sir, give me a 
 
 helping hand." 
 And Ajax's heart was melted down he drew 
 
 him to a stand. 
 And Ajax said, "You've treated me as though I 
 
 were a pup, 
 I give you good for evil I in God's name 
 
 bring you up." 
 And Ajax heard his mother shriek afar upon 
 
 the shore, 
 And tears gushed down bis bleeding cheeks, 
 
 "injGod can it be so?" 
 The planks were drifting further and further 
 
 down the river, 
 And Ajax turned to bis shipmate and these 
 
 words did deliver: 
 " The shrieking voice you hear comes from 
 
 niv mother's bleeding heart
 
 .I./.1A" DKATlf. 231 
 
 It is a shrill and helpless roice, it makes HIT 
 
 senses start. 
 My mother murdered, butchered and my aged 
 
 father slain, 
 Their infant child is murdered to, ought I 
 
 silent remain? 
 Can it be true that I have saved your wretched, 
 
 wicked life, 
 While others of your gang have killed my 
 
 father and his wife? 
 You heathen of the white-skin'd tribe, you 
 
 sit down there and wonder 
 I've robb'd grim death by saving you, your 
 
 watery grave I've plundered. 
 I've prayed to God for vengeance through all 
 
 these dreary years 
 
 I've gathered patience from my friends relat 
 ing all their fears. 
 
 My assailants have been many and my defend 
 ers few, 
 But now we stand as man to man, sir, should 
 
 I murder jou ? 
 Grim death keeps secrets better than the mass 
 
 of living men, 
 The river waves will gladlj take you to the 
 
 fishy den. 
 Then I could dive down in the waves and be, 
 
 myself, at rest.
 
  
 And your dear lynchers seeking me would 
 
 vainly beat their breast, 
 And though they are good hunters of the blood 
 
 of Negro's vein, 
 There they would follow long and far to 
 
 ne'er find my domain. 
 Consider, as I do, sir, what the river's waves 
 
 would be 
 In contrast of the life, my peer, which now I 
 
 give to thee. 
 And I am now adrift, afloat in the marts of 
 
 the world, 
 And if the lynchers can catch me my soul to 
 
 wind'll be hurled. 
 If all the demons of your race could gather 
 
 'round us now, 
 Sir, all my pleading would not keep cold death 
 
 from my hot brow. 
 
 But man was made for life's battle, and some 
 times life is fate, 
 To every man that breathes a breath death 
 
 cometh soon or late. 
 And how could you die better, sir, than by a 
 
 hand like mine, 
 For all my race's punishment by all your race's 
 
 crimes?
 
 AJAT DEATH. 2 : 
 
 And could I die a nobler death than facing 
 
 fearful odds 
 For vengeance of my father and my mother 
 
 'neath the sod; 
 And for those tender mothers with their babies 
 
 at their breast 
 Whose husbands died the death of dogs at 
 
 your race's behest? 
 
 O! no, my mother's noble form lies not be 
 neath the sod, 
 Its now a prey for buzzards' feast, you wicked 
 
 wretch ! My God ! 
 I have been at your mercy, sir, jou tried to 
 
 take my life. 
 I have no hope of your favor, for you I have 
 
 no rife. 
 I could kill you and cast your form beneath 
 
 the rolling \raves 
 But I urn human, so -ire you, I'm not to kill 
 
 but save." 
 The white man set there calm as death he ut- 
 
 ter'd not a word. 
 It seemed his frame \ras void of breath his 
 
 soul was all bestirred. 
 He never gave an earnest look he did not even 
 
 wink.
 
  
 And Ajax said, " These circumstances do make 
 
 my conscience think. 
 O white man ! have you any heart and did you 
 
 ever sigh, 
 And did your senses ever start to see a Negro 
 
 die? 
 Consider now the torture and the cruelty on 
 
 my race, 
 Look at my mother's cruel death, her infant 
 
 child effac'd. 
 Come go with me to Texas and see those red 
 
 hot irons 
 That burn'd the eyes and mouths of men and 
 
 made them roar like lions. 
 And how the lynch'd men bellow'd like a cow 
 
 in deep distress, 
 And how the lynchers laugh'd and took it in 
 
 with minds at rest. 
 Oh ! how the men did struggle to loose the 
 
 lynchers' chain. 
 
 Oil! how thej howl'd like mad men, their ef 
 forts were in vain. 
 The guards had gone upstairs to rest, women 
 
 and children came 
 To view the scene with idle jest, and they were 
 
 not ashamd.
 
 .I//LV DK.\m. 283 
 
 The angels 'round the thron of God h:ul turn'd 
 their backs to earth, 
 
 NVith hearts melted away in tears at sight of 
 Texas mirth. 
 
 This land of brutal cowards still lack the moral 
 backbone, 
 
 The moral courage, moral strength to drive a 
 villian home. 
 
 To even lift a finger or to raise a warning crj, 
 
 They stand in silent pleasure and gaze on the 
 Negro die. 
 
 And in the shadow of the church human be 
 ings are burned, 
 
 From Sunday-schools the children rush this 
 
 / 
 
 wickedness to learn. 
 They gather 'round to take a smell of burning 
 
 human flesh, 
 They cheer the scene and make the spot a 
 
 place of sacred mesh. 
 For him to plead, when all the hearts his 
 
 keenest prayer could probe, 
 Are but a breath of ether in the space around 
 
 the globe. 
 
 It's no more than a ripple to the roaring water 
 fall, 
 It's a snow-flake in the valley to the cloud 
 
 that cover* all.
 
 There'?* no protest, there's no rebuke, there's 
 
 not a single cry 
 Fished from the pools of blood and wrong to 
 
 touch the nation's eye. 
 The world now sits in judgement and could the 
 
 nations plead 
 This land would be a criminal of the vilest 
 
 kind of deeds. 
 Could Ida Wells have raised a force to follow 
 
 her crusade 
 This dreadful crime, long ere this time in 
 
 darkness would be laid. 
 If Frances Willard and her host would help to 
 
 raise the cry, 
 Intemperate lynchings ghastly ghost would 
 
 fade away and die. 
 For when a woman makes a vow that she will 
 
 do a thing 
 
 She's sure to win, or else she'll make oppon 
 ents conscience ring. 
 
 Few men of crime can stand to break a wo 
 man's heart, perchance, 
 Some nations chang'd their ship of state upon 
 
 a woman's glance. 
 Fair Helen seal'd the fate of Troy and queens 
 
 of ancient times 
 Have led brave hearts in cause of truth and 
 
 made the wrong 1 decline.
 
 AJAX' DEATH. 237 
 
 Some noble, stalwart woman have in every time 
 
 and place, 
 Wielded her influence, good or bad, upon the 
 
 human race. 
 If all the noble women who have a Christian 
 
 heart, 
 While .sitting by the fireside would take an 
 
 active part, 
 And have a gen'ral family talk about the ship 
 
 of state, 
 And speak of what the states should do to 
 
 have a union great-- 
 And speak of how almighty God was looking 
 
 from the sky- 
 Down on the doings of each one. He heard 
 
 the lynch'd man's sigh, 
 More husbands and more sons will go away 
 
 from sacred homo 
 With purer thoughts and higher aims and of 
 
 a Christian tone 
 'Till ships of church and ships of state will all 
 
 be till'd with men 
 With Christian hearts, with humane minds, 
 
 with works oppos'd to sin. 
 Then there'd be more McKinley hearts as 
 
 governor of .-lutes.
 
 To see that men obeyed the laws which they 
 
 themsehres would make 
 Then ev'ry gov'nor would be tit to make a 
 
 president 
 The whit* house then would ever have * man 
 
 with good intent. 
 Then lynching crimes would melt away as ice 
 
 in summer's heat, 
 Then we could praise this ship of state, this 
 
 union strong and great. 
 For many years my race has been a universal 
 
 target, 
 They never try to find the part that's crimson, 
 
 bright and scarlet, 
 In all of the affairs of life enormous fads have 
 
 spent 
 
 All of their forces upon him to bring our dis 
 content. 
 All those unhappy phrases they should try to 
 
 set aright, 
 Are dwelt upon with mighty force to make as 
 
 dark as night, 
 
 A just investigation, to show the brighter side, 
 Is never made by those who strive forever to 
 
 deride. 
 TheNegro's moral standard, sir, has never been 
 
 as low
 
 As tho.se destructive lyncher's hearts who nev 
 er try to know 
 Whether it was a crime or not they're simply 
 
 satisfied 
 To pass their own meek judgment, they crurc 
 
 the Negro's hide. 
 There's no class in America whose moral 
 
 pathway's fill'd 
 With thorns as is the Negro's and he must 
 
 tread at will. 
 American Christianity's not recognized by 
 
 Him 
 Who came to earth to die for man and gire 
 
 him Christian trim. 
 IIr body's broken by disease her conscience 
 
 soared with crimes. 
 
 A mind and soul of cruelty to cap tht heath 
 en climes. 
 And in the light of all these things it is a poor 
 
 spirit 
 To point with Christian horror but ne'er try 
 
 to prohibit. 
 Ah! what a reckless nation, what an undiscip- 
 
 lin'd child 
 Noble, but sometimes tricky, doing somethings 
 
 that are wild.
 
 * * * * 
 
 A freeman am I, must I die a slave adrift at. 
 
 sea, 
 Or must I live as master's dog to whimper at 
 
 his plea. 
 And must I crawl down at his feet, and must 
 
 1 lick his hands? 
 Poor Ajax' cheeks did flush with heat he 
 
 ground his teeth like sand. 
 By Jove, by thunder, by the gods, I'd rather 
 
 herd with wolves, 
 And seek the lion's friendship and to tigers 
 
 make my love, 
 Then I could marshal all their strength against 
 
 the cursed mob, 
 And teach them how it felt to give a beast a 
 
 wailing sob. 
 To all my sorrows I would add those of my 
 
 punished race, 
 And devote myself to vengeance upon this black 
 
 disgrace. 
 And I would pray to all the gods, the gods both 
 
 good and bad 
 To lend me their special terrors to ridicule this 
 
 fad. 
 I'd ask for tempest, heat and cold, for drought, 
 
 for wild beast's lair,
 
 And all th poison of the land that men let 
 
 loose in air 
 And all the thousand other things that quickly 
 
 put to sleep 
 Of which men die on sea and land, my God ! 
 
 why should I weep? 
 
 My feelings are not vagary as a sensitive lad 
 But reas'ning of suffering manhood to give 
 
 endurance sad. 
 Every age has its sorrows and O, the ills of 
 
 time, 
 
 No parallel in human life to match this lynch 
 ing clime, 
 My spirit never goes to sleep I cannot rest at 
 
 night, 
 A dog remembers, long, a wrong, he knows a 
 
 friend at sight. 
 I have a book of great events, I'll write this 
 
 voyage down 
 That men may know what I have seen and try 
 
 its depths to sound. 
 My mother, father all are gone and I in this 
 
 wild wood, 
 My wife and child sev Vd from me, all gone 
 
 but my manhood. 
 
 I never hope to h'nd them now amid my anx 
 ious fears 
 
 As "Ben Hur" found his jewels after eight 
 
 long grieving years. 
 He found his precious mother and his sister 
 
 with disease 
 
 From out a wicked dungeon he brought them 
 , to release. 
 
 > > t 
 
 But dungeons where the lynchers place the 
 
 prison'd corpse of man 
 
 ' ' : * " 
 
 The buzzard sailing in the air has all at his 
 
 command. 
 O white man! Qan't I probe from you a single, 
 
 tender sob? 
 And won't you help me pray one prayer to 
 
 your Almighty God ? 
 "OGod! give me a little faith and into my 
 
 darkness 
 That's deeper darkening every day, O send a 
 
 light of rest. 
 All hopes deal with the future Lord, I hope 
 
 for better days , 
 And while I'm drifting down the tide, guide 
 
 me the right of way." 
 Laurels of this world may be sweet but they 
 
 soon pass away. 
 j 
 
 We have no laurels as a race, are they in com 
 ing days?
 
 Like those colossal tombs of old on drifting 
 
 n 
 
 desert sands 
 They cast .shadows 'cross the cent'ries then 
 
 crumble to the land. 
 This country in a prosperous stage will yet 
 
 come to a halt, 
 And see the depths of this outrage and remedy 
 
 the fault. 
 
 When time lies down fore'er to sleep at eter 
 nity's feet, 
 And vanities, pomps, more creep upon the 
 
 stage so sweet 
 And stars of heaven have all gone out of their 
 
 ethereal home 
 
 The eternal hand, unseen by us across this land 
 
 11 
 
 will roam. 
 
 The evening shade was gathering now, the 
 
 surging waters rollM. 
 And Ajax felt the cool ni^ht wind, it seemed 
 
 to fan his soul. 
 Unruly winds began to cease and zephyr's 
 
 breezes rose 
 The lotus plant from water's depths beforo 
 
 his ga/e roposcd. 
 The solemn river loiter'd on its way quite un- 
 
 coBoerned,
 
 The palm trees shook their nodding heads and 
 
 stoop' d to greet the fern. 
 The Jackall slipping on the bank knew Ajax' 
 
 skin was black 
 He snapp'd his teeth he thought t' was law his 
 
 fleshless bones to crack : 
 The guiding stars began to show, the day went 
 
 into night 
 And like a phantom ship at sea they drifted 
 
 out of sight. 
 The planks, call'd ship on which they rode, . 
 
 went calmly down the river 
 And no one knows unto this da}- which was 
 
 the longest liver. 
 Did Ajax kill the white man? O no, his heart 
 
 was tender ! 
 Did white man kill poor Ajax? his heart was 
 
 rash as timber ! 
 Did both of them drift to the gulf and make a 
 
 feast for whales ; 
 Did both of them escape and shall we yet hear 
 
 both their tales? 
 If poor Ajax i* yet alive and dwells upon the 
 
 land, 
 He'll write a book to shake this world and 
 
 make men understand.

SKETCH OF THE AUTHOR. 
 
 PERFORMANCE is to be judged by the means employed in attainment. The Eiffel tower is a marvelous structure for  this age of steam and iron, but it is no greater achievement than  the little boat which required two years for Robinson Crusoe to complete with the miserable tools at his command. An infant  may learn to talk in a few months, and may speak fluently at the  age of two. Wonderful as this is, no one remarks it, but that  Helen Keller has mastered speech is a marvel. 
 
 This little book is an unpretentious volume, but measured by  the toils and difficulties through which it came to light, it is noteworthy. The author is one of a race that has given scarcely any thing of literature to the world. The obstacles which he has surmounted were undreamed of by Burns and other sons of song who struggled up from poverty, obscurity, and ignorance to glory. 
 
 Joseph Seamon Cotter was born in Nelson County, Kentucky, in 1861, but has spent practically all his life in Louisville. He had the scantiest opportunity for schooling in childhood, though he could read before he was four years old. He was put to work  early, and from his eighth to his twenty-fourth year earned his  living by the roughest and hardest labor, first in a brick-yard, then in a distillery, and finally as^ a teamster. At twenty-two his scholarship was so limited that when he entered the first one of Louisville's night schools for colored pupils, he had to begin in the primary department. His industry and capacity were so great that at the end of two sessions of five months each he began to teach. He has persevered in this calling, educating htmself Avhile at' work, and is now the Principal of the Colored Ward School at Eighth and Kentucky streets. The man whose advice and encouragement  at the beginning chiefly enabled him to accomplish this was Prof. W. T. Peyton, a well-known colored educator of this city, whom he regards as his greatest benefactor. 
 
 Mr. Cotter is wholly self-taught in English literature and composition. He fell naturally into rhyming when he began to write, but he received no instruction beyond the most elementary hints as to meter. Whatever he has done since has been the result of unaided effort. Six years ago several of his poems appeared in the Courier-Journal, this being his first publication outside of one or two newspapers conducted by men of his own race. I was then city editor of the Courier-Journal, and his modest tender of some Christmas verses to me led to an inquiry which revealed his story of unpretentious but earnest and conscientious toil. He laid no claim to being a poet, but his verses were interesting and always worth publication. 
 
 Without referring to the merits of this little book, it is proper to call attention to the cheerful optimism and reverent faith that find expression in his lines. The author submits it with modesty, and only asks that it be judged in accordance with its claims.

Links of Friendship
 
 PROF. MAURICE KIRBY. 
 
 To John G. Roach, Esq. 
 
 It needs no heaven-inspired eye 
 To scan the horde of passers-by, 
 And note therein worth's alchemy 
 
 Turning to gold 
 The dross of life — the levity — 
 
 Of young and old 
 
 Through some acute, far-reaching soul 
 That pierces life from pole to pole, 
 And sees it a consistent whole 
 
 Whose rhythmic beat 
 Chimes forth an ever-welcome dole 
 
 For weary feet. 
 
 As after lingering, wintry weather 
 A few bright days bear down together 
 And warm the air and cheer the heather 
 
 Through friendly rain, 
 And drive the herdsman forth to tether 
 
 Flocks on the plain ; 
 So all who have by contact found 
 That littleness and greed are bound 
 To most, as they unto the ground, 
 
 Must quickly see 
 And worship all who bear a sound 
 
 Nobility. 
 
 In every age such spirits tower 
 Above the crowd and wield a power 
 That gives to all a heavenly dower, 
 
 So strong and pure, 
 Though fate may frown and storms may lower 
 
 They still endure. 
 
 'Tis ours to boast one such we knew 
 Who stood within the public view, 
 And spread himself like friendly dew 
 
 Upon the earth, 
 And with a mighty impulse slew 
 
 Our mental dearth. 
 
 He moved among us as a man 
 Of lofty nature only can, 
 Fashioned upon so true a plan 
 
 That changing it 
 Would be like going forth to span 
 
 The sea with wit. 
 
 Misfortune's touch — somehow, somewhere — 
 So fringed his youthful soul with care 
 That evermore he strove to bear 
 
 Complacently 
 His brother's load, so he might fare 
 
 On calm and free. 
 
 The true man's mission is to know 
 What pang has caused his brother's woe, 
 And by untiring efforts show 
 
 He is too great 
 To be at ease while others go 
 
 Disconsolate. 
 
 Those that are called the favored few 
 
 Because they boldly read anew 
 
 Some straggling thought as though they drew 
 
 Help from the skies 
 That straightway drops the plummet through 
 
 Life's mysteries 
 
 Are simply such as long have met 
 The trials that must needs beset 
 The glowing mind, if it would let 
 
 Its worth be seen; 
 All fail who scorn to pay this debt, 
 
 Trebly serene. 
 
 This weight but made his burden light, 
 And gave him inklings of the right, 
 So needful when his footsteps might 
 
 Be wont to stray 
 Beyond the bounds, beyond the sight 
 
 Of duty's ray. 
 
 And made full clear the mystic art 
 By which he probed the human heart 
 With many a friendly, barbed dart 
 
 Until he saw 
 That he who rules mankind must start 
 
 With will and law ; 
 And therefrom slowly climb the steep, 
 
 Exploring every dungeon-keep 
 
 Of his own soul, lest there should leap 
 
 Some stalwart fear, 
 And, leagued with failure, quickly sweep 
 
 Him to the rear; 
 
 And leave him there to fan the flame 
 That feeds on his self-nurtured shame 
 Until to him the very name 
 
 Of life grows dull, 
 And tells him how his own became 
 
 So damnable. 
 
 Thus mastering each secret phase 
 Of human nature's devious ways, 
 He found the means that spur and raise 
 
 From apathy 
 The lagging powers until they blaze 
 
 With energy. 
 
 And from such conquest comes a sense 
 
 Of rare and lasting eminence 
 
 That sets at naught all base pretense, 
 
 All idle show, 
 And forms a fertile background whence 
 
 True pleasures flow. 
 
 He felt this as the flowers feel 
 The airs of springtime gently steal 
 Along their veins, and there conceal 
 
 A nutritive 
 By which they silently reveal 
 
 How best to live. 
 A lofty, witty seriousness 
 
 Ran riot through him terrorless, 
 
 And, hence, became a means to bless, 
 
 A force to fire 
 Stupidity, and yet suppress 
 
 One's wonted ire. 
 
 His eyes were clear enough to see 
 This combination's mystery, 
 And how through guarded jollity 
 
 And calm repose 
 The struggling soul is led to free 
 
 Its path of foes. 
 
 And, like a seer, he saw wherein 
 
 The untrained hand, with clash and din, 
 
 May sow a laugh and reap a sin 
 
 So consummate 
 That naught can thwart its right to win 
 
 Relentless hate. 
 
 To him, in inarticulate speech, 
 Life's lessons nature deigned to teach 
 So simply not one failed to reach 
 
 The spirit's core, 
 And flare so men would fain beseech 
 
 It evermore. 
 
 Thereby he builded better than 
 
 A thousand others ever can 
 
 Who work upon some book-made plan 
 
 Whose stilted tone 
 Spurs not the groveling charlatan 
 
 To strive alone. 
 Lift up mankind as high's you will, 
 You'll find them mostly lackeys still 
 Who live to act, and act to drill 
 
 Themselves into 
 Such sycophants as gladly fill 
 
 Shame's rendezvous. 
 
 All praise to him who scorns to yield 
 His manhood's right — by honor steeled — 
 And bears upon a blazoned shield 
 
 His changeless creed, 
 And scouts the hand that dares to wield 
 
 The cringer's meed. 
 
 He whose rare virtues shield this lay 
 From such assaults as else would slay 
 Added to man's imperial clay 
 
 A finer ring, 
 .And met each task in duty's way 
 
 Unwavering. 
 
 The littleness that holds in trust 
 Life's bastard glitterings that must 
 Beneath wrath's oxide turn to rust, 
 
 He hurried by 
 And held as so much worthless dust 
 
 Blown to the sky. 
 
 As when clear sunlight pierces dew 
 And makes it iridescent through, 
 So all who felt his manhood drew 
 
 An influence 
 That tinged their fading hopes anew 
 
 Through why and whence. 
 
 SEQUEL TO THE "PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN." 
 
 To Thomas G. Watkins, Esq. 
 I. 
 
 The last sweet notes the piper blew 
 
 Were heard by the people far and wide; 
 And one by one and two by two 
 They flocked to the mountain side. 
 Some came, of course, intensely sad, 
 And some came looking fiercely mad, 
 And some came singing solemn hymns, 
 And some came showing shapely limbs, 
 And some came bearing the tops of yews, 
 And some came wearing wooden shoes, 
 And some came saying what they would do, 
 And some came praying (and loudly, too), 
 And all for what ? Can you not infer ? 
 A-searching and lurching for the Pied Piper, 
 And the boys and girls he had taken away, 
 And all were ready now to pay 
 Any amount that he should say. 
 It seems that just relentless Fate 
 Ransacks her ever ample store, 
 And issues out the roughest ore 
 To all who basely hesitate. 
 
 The people stood at the mountain-side, 
 And listened to hear the merry strain 
 
 That gathered them from far and wide, 
 But they listened all in vain. 
 And if they could have heard his music, 
 
 Why, some of them were really too sick 
 To tell just what his notes were saying, 
 Or know it was the piper playing. 
 
 Their heads were many, but their hearts were one ; 
 And so the thoughts that came and went 
 Served only to kindle their discontent 
 Into a flame ere the set of sun. 
 
 3- 
 
 Some thought that they could open wide 
 Another portal in the mountain-side, 
 And then that they could pass right through 
 And find the children and piper, too. 
 At last a stalwart man arose 
 And spoke as one who would interpose: 
 ' ' Rouse up, good sirs, like gallant people, 
 
 And quake no longer with consternation • 
 But ring the bells from every steeple, 
 
 And summon the mayor and corporation." 
 
 4- 
 The bells rang out as never before 
 
 Within that ancient city; 
 They seemed to tell it o'er and o'er — 
 To tell that tale of pity, 
 And steadily the angry people 
 Stood gazing at each lofty steeple. 
 
 5. 
 The stalwart man cried out again, 
 "Death's servant is procrastination; 
 Your grief and tears are all in vain, 
 
 Go, summon the mayor and corporation." 
 
 6. 
 The people started in twos and threes 
 
 To seek the mayor and corporation, 
 And found them all upon their knees, 
 
 Imploring expiation. 
 
 7- 
 The mayor winked and the mayor blinked, 
 
 And the councilmen, they listened; 
 The mayor's eyes gazed at the skies, 
 
 And the councilmen's eyes, they glistened. 
 
 8. 
 " You are all to blame, " the people cried, 
 
 With a look of detestation, 
 " You know full well that you have lied, 
 
 And sold our rising nation. 
 
 9- 
 
 "As enemies we hold you all, 
 Despite your loud lamenting; 
 Upon your recreant heads shall fall 
 The burden of repenting. 
 
 10. 
 
 " Through you the little ones we nursed 
 Were taken we don't know where to ; 
 Through you our city has been cursed — 
 Deny it if you dare to. 
 
 11. 
 
 "And you shall know that parleying 
 With that outlandish piper, 
 Shall be to you as deep a sting 
 As that of any viper." 
 
 12. 
 
 The mayor bowed low, and then said, " Oh ! " 
 
 And the councilmen said, " What is it?" 
 The mayor grew red, and huskily said, 
 " I do not like this visit." 
 
 13. 
 The mayor's teeth clattered, and the mayor's 
 tongue chattered, 
 And the councilmen's did also; 
 The mayor floundered, and the mayor wondered 
 How a brave man's voice could fall so. 
 
  14. 
 The mayor did sup from no golden cup 
 
 That he could drown his grief in ; 
 The councilmen saw with deepest awe 
 
 Nothing to find relief in. 
 
 15. 
 The mayor looked straight at the massive gate 
 
 (And it was a look of pity), 
 Then turned his face to leave the place, 
 
 And bid farewell to the city. 
 
 16. 
 The councilmen turned, and their red cheeks 
 burned, 
 As the bells rang out in the steeple ; 
 And they heard the beat of a thousand feet, 
 And saw the angry people, 
 Who came by dozens and scores that way, 
 Intent upon their human prey. 
 They hadn't a single word to say, 
 
 But, oh, it was a woeful day 
 
 For the mayor whose hair was turning gray. 
 
 17. 
 
 Some seized the mayor by the throat 
 
 As roughly as they could do, 
 And tore the buttons off his coat 
 To show him what they would do 
 Unless he eased their mental strain 
 By finding the boys and girls again. 
 18. 
 And some arrested the corporation, 
 
 And poured into their ears 
 So free a strain of denunciation 
 It roused their latest fears, 
 Till one and all wished through and through 
 The piper would come and take them too. 
 19. 
 And then they marched through that ancient city 
 
 With the mayor right before them, 
 And the corporation, who sang a ditty 
 That threw a madness o'er them, 
 And stirred their ire so it crept out 
 And put their better thoughts to rout. 
 
 20. 
 " Let's drive them into the Weser waters," 
 
 Some cried out angrily 
 " Unless they find our sons and daughters, 
 And bring them back this way." 
 ' Agreed ! agreed ! " said high and low, 
 ' Right into the waters they shall go." 
 21. 
 
 They marched them down to the river's brink, 
 And roughly drove them in; 
 
 But before the shortest one could sink 
 An inch above his chin, 
 They heard a muffled, deafening note, 
 Such as might come from a lion's throat. 
 And all the motley crowd grew mute, 
 For it was a blast from the piper's flute. 
 He stood on the edge of Koppleberg hill, 
 And blew till the feet of the people grew still, 
 And those of the mayor and corporation 
 Began to move as by incantation. 
 He took the flute from his honeyed lips 
 And pressed it between his finger tips, 
 And straightway a vapor began to rise 
 That tickled the nose and blinded the eyes ; 
 And when the people could see again 
 They looked for their victims all in vain, 
 And all about it they ever knew 
 Was that the piper had drawn from view, 
 And the mayor and corporation too. 
 
 22. 
 How often is the tide of sin 
 
 Averted ere it reaches us 
 
 By ways just as mysterious 
 As those in the case of Hamelin ! 
 
 23. 
 The people went to their homes as mute 
 As since has been the piper's flute, 
 And never were known to even dispute, 
 
 Among themselves or others, 
 As to how such things could come about, 
 Or whether or not they had a doubt 
 Concerning how they would turn out 
 
 For fathers, sons, or mothers. 
 
 24. 
 
 The years passed by, as years will do 
 
 When trouble is the master, 
 And always strives to bring to view 
 
 A new and worse disaster; 
 And Sorrow, like a sorcerer, 
 
 Spread out her melancholy pall 
 
 So that its folds enveloped all, 
 And each became her worshiper. 
 
 25. 
 
 And not a single child was born 
 
 Through all the years thereafter; 
 If words sprang from the lips of scorn 
 None came from those of laughter. 
 So hour by hour, and day by day, 
 The city's inmates passed away, 
 And left but one, then old and gray. 
 
 26. 
 
 And that was he the piper left 
 
 That fatal day behind him, 
 Of whatsoe'er he was bereft, 
 
 He never strove to find him. 
 27. 
 But wisely let the prowler go 
 
 Where'er his whim might take him, 
 And kiss his magic flute and blow 
 
 For all who might forsake him. 
 
 28. 
 Alas, alas, there came a time 
 Too sad for even the saddest rhyme, 
 When this one mortal became immortal, 
 And flitted away through the heavenly portal. 
 Without a soul outside or in 
 Stood poor, deserted Hamelin, 
 Devoid for once of human sin. 
 
 29. 
 You know a message went to Rat-land 
 
 By that strong rat that swam the Weser; 
 And, lo ! a race of rats was at hand 
 Outnumbering all the hosts of Caesar. 
 They came by ones and twos and threes, 
 And then in larger companies — 
 As single fours and double scores 
 And hundreds up to fifty, 
 
 And thousands up to twenty-five, 
 And all seemed more and more alive, 
 And, hence, were doubly thrifty. 
 
 30. 
 They swarmed into the highest towers, 
 And loitered in the fairest bowers, 
 And sat down where the mayor sat, 
 And also in his Sunday hat; 
 And gnawed revengefully thereat. 
 With rats for mayor, and rats for people, 
 With rats in the cellar, and rats in the steeple, 
 With rats without, and rats within, 
 Stood poor, deserted Hamelin. 
 
 FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 
 
 O eloquent and caustic sage ! 
 Thy long and rugged pilgrimage 
 
 To glory's shrine has ended ; 
 And thou hast passed the inner door, 
 And proved thy fitness o'er and o'er, 
 
 And to the dome ascended. 
 
 In speaking of thy noble life 
 
 One needs must think upon the strife 
 
 That long and sternly faced it; 
 But since those times have flitted by, 
 Just let the useless relic die 
 
 With passions that embraced it. 
 
 There is no evil known to man 
 But what, if wise enough, he can 
 
 Grow stronger in the bearing; 
 And so the ills we often scorn 
 May be of heavenly wisdom born 
 
 To aid our onward faring. 
 
 Howe'er this be, just fame has set 
 Her jewels in thy coronet 
 So firmly that the ages 
 To come will ever honor thee 
 And place thy name in company 
 With patriots and sages. 
 
 Now thou art gone, the little men 
 Of fluent tongue and trashy pen 
 
 Will strive to imitate thee ; 
 And when they find they haven't sense 
 Enough to make a fair pretense, 
 
 They'll turn and underrate thee. 
 
 ALFRED TENNYSON. 
 
 To Colonel Bennett H. Young. 
 
 cruel Death ! thy lancet sharp 
 Spares not the peasant nor the lord. 
 It rudely cut the sweetest chord 
 
 That sounded in this century's harp. 
 
 1 know that on our sinful earth 
 
 Full many victims should be thine; 
 But why remove the half-divine — 
 The only ones of real worth ? 
 
 I turn from thy depressing gaze, 
 And wonder who shall be the last 
 On whom thy fatal gloom is cast, 
 
 And face the singer and his lays. 
 
 Old England, mother of the good, 
 Old England, mother of the wise, 
 Delighted in thy watchful eyes 
 
 Thy sons of song have ever stood; 
 
 And cherished that poetic fire, 
 
 And that incomparable skill, 
 
 And that indomitable will, 
 That ever grapple for a higher. 
 
 Love and unstinted praise belong 
 
 To all who have in any way 
 
 Added a single, genuine ray 
 To thy kaleidoscope of song. 
 
 From ancient down to modern dates, 
 Upon thy scroll of mighty names, 
 There is not one more wholly fame's 
 
 Than his, thy fallen laureate's. 
 
 I have in mind three tuneful souls 
 
 Whose words are life's philosophy, 
 
 And may they never cease to be 
 While wisdom through experience rolls. 
 
 One gathered up a thousand fears 
 With thousands of the heart's desires 
 And dipped them in dramatic fires, 
 
 And tossed them down the coming years. 
 
 In strains both simple and sublime 
 One sang of man's first happiness, 
 And weighed his numbers with a stress 
 
 Of thought that puzzles every clime. 
 
 And one laid bare his manly heart 
 
 To nature's every influence. 
 
 His song breathes forth the eloquence 
 Of artlessness that is pure art. 
 
 These lofty three, and these alone 
 Of all thy gifted, tuneful throng 
 Can rival in the race of song 
 
 Thy love-encircled Tennyson. 
 
 Thy diadem is cut in four, 
 The pieces separate and fall 
 Upon the lordly heads of all, 
 
 And Glory's goblet trickles o'er. 
 
 May English natures everywhere, 
 
 And all who love the English tongue, 
 Remember him whose songs were sung 
 
 To rob man's spirit of despair. 
 
 Great poet of thy race and age, 
 Thy roving, all-beholding eyes 
 Peered into Nature's mysteries 
 
 Like any dry, prosaic sage. 
 
 Thine was true English hardihood; 
 And unto thee kind Nature lent 
 Her wonderful embellishment — 
 
 The gift of being understood. 
 
 Love as an artist ever draws 
 
 Pointed and clear-cut likenesses; 
 And feasting thy clear eyes on these 
 
 Thou didst imbibe their subtle laws. 
 
 Sweet Sympathy with pen of fire 
 
 Wrote o'er and o'er thy yearning soul 
 Her heavenly creed as on a scroll, 
 
 And plumed the wings of thy desire. 
 
 The Muse passed by the minor throng 
 And bade thee of diviner blood 
 Pour on the world a lasting flood 
 Of pure and sweet and limpid song. 
 
 The sweetness of thy melody 
 
 And mighty harvest from thy pen, 
 Gathered from field and marsh and glen, 
 
 Attest how well thou didst comply. 
 
 Thy thoughts touched life at every part, 
 And robed themselves in burning phrase ; 
 Hence thy thought-ribbed and love-wrought lays 
 
 Should find a home in every heart. 
 
 Nature at times o'ersteps her bounds; 
 
 And, working by a newer plan, 
 
 She gives to us a gifted man, 
 And with his deeds the world resounds. 
 
 THE DEVIL AND THE HIGHER CRITICISM. 
 
 The Devil sat with the sons of God, 
 
 And listened so patiently 
 The preacher said: " It is certainly odd 
 
 That such a thing should be." 
 
 But the Devil kept his humble seat, 
 
 And kept his quiet tongue; 
 And the verdict was: " He is more discreet 
 
 Than most of the old or young." 
 
 The preacher said: "We would like to know 
 Just why you are so civil." 
 "I am not here for fun or show," 
 Gravely replied the Devil. 
 
 "For many a day I've met you here, 
 And now I am convinced, sir, 
 I haven't a single thing to fear 
 
 Where the Gospel is so minced, sir. 
 
 " In other times I sought my own, 
 And was both loud and rough, sir, 
 But since that day your whims have thrown 
 Out stumbling-blocks enough, sir. 
 
 "Now, all I have to do, you see, 
 Is just to sit and wait, sir, 
 While your advanced theology 
 Kills faster than your prate, sir. 
 
 "And I would thank you o'er and o'er 
 For all your worthy aid, sir ; 
 And hint that you will still do more, 
 When you are less afraid, sir." 
 
 HOPE. 
 
 How oft inflated hope carries us on 
 
 In search of ancient truth's deferred dawn, 
 
 And then, with eyes grown dim and lips grown mute ? 
 
 We hurry back in failure's parachute! 
 
 THE TRUE MAN. 
 
 To Rev. J. H. Heywood, on his Eightieth Birthday. 
 
 A miser stands beside the sea 
 And counts his treasure grudgingly. 
 " It is not meet that I should be 
 
 Of those who give 
 An impulse whereby charity 
 
 May henceforth live." 
 
 He turns and sees, not far away, 
 A beggar who is old and gray. 
 "This dog may limp and mourn and pray 
 
 Until he dies. 
 My life's a light that sheds no ray 
 
 Of sacrifice. 
 
 "I see the point. I, too, am poor. 
 I'll take my precious, shining store 
 And place it here and heap it o'er 
 
 With this loose sand, 
 And of the beggar straight implore 
 
 A helping hand. 
 
 He moves some paces. " I'm in need. 
 For alms, good sir, I humbly plead." 
 And, lo, the rogue is poor indeed; 
 
 For the swift sea 
 Sweeps in and out and pays his greed 
 
 With usury. 
 
 A true man stands beside the sea 
 And says : " Heaven-blessed charity, 
 
 My all-in-all I find in thee." 
 
 Within his hands 
 He holds what he received as fee 
 
 For all his lands. 
 
 He looks and sees the angry wave 
 Is dragging downward to its grave 
 A little child. He is too brave 
 
 To reason why. 
 It is enough that he may save 
 
 One ere it die. 
 
 And it is saved. His manly eyes 
 Weep not because he lost the prize — 
 His worldly all-in-all that lies 
 
 Beneath the sea. 
 Ah, no, for joyous sacrifice 
 
 Now weepeth he. 
 
 He turns him round in act to go, 
 And there before him, pure as snow, 
 Lies a great pearl. The sea to show 
 
 That fate is fair, 
 And worth's reward through love shall grow 
 
 Has left it there. 
 
 O full-orbed soul ! O pioneer ! 
 Of dauntless will and vision clear, 
 Thou art the true man pictured here. 
 
 By right divine 
 Of noble parts and fellow-cheer 
 
 The meed is thine. 
 
 Too broad for hate, too pure for shame, 
 Too high for selfish, worldly aim, 
 Too fond of worth to worship fame 
 
 Reverted-eyed, 
 Through kindly acts thou'st won a name 
 
 That shall abide. 
 
 REV. DR. JOHN A. BROADUS. 
 
 Sacred interpreter, we saw in thee 
 
 All that a man of God might hope to be. 
 
 Now, thou art gone, we see how ill we can 
 
 Afford to lose a noble fellow-man. 
 
 The dullest thing, when brought to thy attention, 
 
 Seemed rife with sturdy thought and quaint invention. 
 
 And, hence, thy hearers never wished for thee 
 
 A closer partnership with brevity. 
 
 Thou didst not dally with the lance of thought, 
 
 But hurled it as a Christian warrior ought. 
 
 So earnest was thy plea, so honest thy intent, 
 
 That seldom was an arrow vainly sent. 
 
 The sweetness of thy soul was so revealed 
 
 The wounds that followed were as quickly healed. 
 
 So wise and modest was thy great endeavor 
 
 Those thou didst pass bade thee God-speed forever. 
 
 If faults were thine, they were so girt about 
 
 With virtues that they seldom ventured out. 
 
 After deducting all the critic can 
 
 He must admit thou wast a model man. 
 CONTRADICTION. 
 
 He was a man who lived a peaceful life, 
 
 Yet died from a continual round with strife. 
 
 His being born without a single fear 
 
 Made him of course an abject coward here. 
 
 He grew so fast his limbs were duly stunted, 
 
 And breathed so smoothly that he always grunted. 
 
 The more he learned, the more he saw he needed 
 
 To keep his empty mental-garden weeded. 
 
 When men were killed outright and resurrected, 
 
 He held such little things should be expected. 
 
 And to become, thought he, extremely wise 
 
 One simply has to misapply his eyes. 
 
 And seeing things as they will never be 
 
 Leads ever on to true philosophy. 
 
 By placing twilight at the early dawn 
 
 He stopped his motion while he still went on. 
 
 Humility in him was two-edged pride ; 
 
 And, likewise, sin was pure and glorified. 
 
 He made an everlasting truce with death, 
 
 Then straightway turned and drew his latest breath. 
 
 THE POET. 
 
 What boots it, Poet, that from realms above 
 
 Come messages for thee to tersely state, 
 If after scattering the seeds of love 
 
 Thou straightway chok'st them with the weeds of hate? 
 THE INFIDEL'S CREED. 
 
 Men stagger in my light, yet are too dull 
 To see that my creed is infallible. 
 
 They rather worship God whose cruel laws 
 Are made up wholly of mistakes and flaws. 
 
 The time shall be when they will cease to follow 
 Views that are so disgusting and so hollow. 
 
 Let blinded Christians, ere they think or stir, 
 Confer with me, their great philosopher. 
 
 When they have steeped their souls in blasphemy, 
 And trodden under foot theology, 
 They will be fit to teach true piety. 
 
 As I have searched for light should Christians search, 
 They'll find that faith in God the soul will smirch, 
 And know that hell's another name for church. 
 
 Therefore, my fellow-men, on you I call. 
 
 I am your friend, and heartily extol 
 
 My creed of life to save you, one and all. 
 
 ON A PROUD MAN. 
 
 Here lies a man whose soul was so 
 
 Puffed up with pride it couldn't grow. 
 
 Yet, may be, in the life to be 
 
 The fates will give it liberty, 
 
 And let it reach, through steps severe, 
 
 The size it fancied it had here. 
 PROLOGUE TO A SUPPOSED PLAY. 
 
 My worthy hearers, have you come to-night 
 To feast on comedy that's brisk and light, 
 And gladly spend an idle hour or two 
 In viewing pictures that are just like you? 
 If this be what you want, just let me say 
 You couldn't turn your heads a better way; 
 And for each cent you gave to enter here 
 You should take back a modicum of cheer, 
 And weigh yourselves so well that you will be 
 Arrayed against your insufficiency. 
 
 But this is preaching ? Well, the comic stage 
 
 Has preached through ridicule to every age. 
 
 Man scorns his shallow deeds and sordid pelf 
 
 When he's employed in laughing at himself. 
 
 So, let us preach in every way that can 
 
 Lift man up to the dignity of man. 
 
 Now, don't be too exact, but let good sense 
 
 Decide the point of honest eminence ; 
 
 And bear in mind that what is trite and true, 
 
 If well arranged, is worthy through and through. 
 
 But to the play. It comes in five long acts 
 In which the weapons used are naked facts. 
 There is no effort made to polish darts 
 That find a lodgment in deceitful hearts, 
 Nor to put on the rogue an honest mask, 
 For that would be, indeed, a fruitless task. 
 The characters are plain^ as you will see, 
 And richly freighted with humanity; 
 And, by the way, their actions prove in making 
 A man of noble parts the undertaking 
 Is such that nature seldom deigns to run 
 The same material on from sire to son. 
 
 The actors are a queer and jolly set, 
 
 Whose fun increases as you fume and fret; 
 
 So, should they hurl at you eccentric airs, 
 
 Just dodge as though they struck you unawares, 
 
 Or jesting strive to make a pointed hit, 
 
 Just hold your peace and let it pass for wit. 
 
 Now, my good hearers, hint what I shall say next. 
 
 You want to hear no more ? Bring on the play next? 
 
 Well, here it is, and if you don't grow wiser, 
 
 Censure yourselves as well as the adviser. 
 
 THE BACHELOR. 
 
 To Prof. W. T. Peyton. 
 
 The bachelor was old and sad, 
 His life was fast decaying ; 
 
 'Tis said he oft grew raving mad 
 While o'er the past surveying. 
 
 He dwelt within a little hut, 
 Surrounded by starvation ; 
 
 No woman called upon him but 
 By special invitation. 
 
 There lived with him a little boy 
 Who loved to romp and tumble 
 
 And see how much he could destroy 
 To hear the old man grumble. 
 He broke his pipe and spilled his snuff 
 
 And beat upon the kettle 
 Until, in truth, it was enough 
 
 To stir a preacher's mettle. 
 
 At last the old man hallooed out : 
 ' ' You surely are inhuman ; 
 I'd sooner far be buffed about 
 And bothered by a woman." 
 
 His words flew by like wind-tossed chaff 
 
 And only tickled Harry, 
 Who answered with a boyish laugh : 
 1 ' Then, sir, why don't you marry?" 
 
 " Now, boy, the question that you ask 
 Is somewhat out of season, 
 But yet it is an easy task 
 To give to you the reason. 
 
 " When I was in my eighteenth year, 
 And not a little frisky, 
 I stopped at everything to peer, 
 No matter howe'er risky. 
 
 "A few miles from my father's farm, 
 Between two little ditches, 
 I heard there dwelt, secure from harm, 
 Two very pretty witches. 
 
 "Then, thought I, this can not be so, 
 Such talk is so deceiving; 
 But to convince myself I'll go, 
 For ' seeing is believing.' 
 " So off I started, all alone, 
 Adown that muddy hollow; 
 But would have stopped had I but known 
 What was destined to follow. 
 
 "At last I saw the ruined cot 
 Between the little ditches, 
 And paused to think whether or not 
 'Twas wise to see the witches. 
 
 "Then slowly crept on hands and feet : 
 Don't think I meant to creep in, 
 Or with them face to face to meet, 
 But simply for to peep in. 
 
 " Soon as I reached an open crack 
 I gazed steadfastly through it; 
 But, ah ! a burden met my back 
 That made me doubly rue it. 
 
 ' ' Somehow I did not care to stay 
 For any further pleasure; 
 But when at last I got away 
 I had a double measure. 
 
 "And from that time on down to this, 
 Although it proves inhuman, 
 I never could find happiness 
 In being near a woman." 
 
 Far better take the word of Man, 
 And let the word of Prophets go, 
 Whose steady bickerings to and fro 
 
 Run counter to the Maker's plan. 
 THE STRANGE MAM. 
 
 To Prof. F. L. Williams. 
 
 There lived a man of low degree, 
 
 Far in a land obscure, 
 Who daily thanked the fates that he 
 
 Was born so very poor. 
 
 "The multitudes of wicked men 
 Who plan and steal and lie 
 Can never rob my wallet when 
 I am too poor to buy. 
 
 ' ' Kind is the fate that will not let 
 Great riches bother me, 
 And so the poorer that I get 
 The happier I will be." 
 
 He swore this by as many gods 
 
 As ever lived of Did. 
 Meanwhile he turned the heavy clods 
 
 In search of precious gold. 
 
 He sang of rustic Genevieve 
 At the approach of dawn, 
 
 Then slept until the dewy eve 
 And danced upon the lawn. 
 
 Whatever made all other folks 
 
 The cup of sorrow quaff 
 Seemed unto him but witty jokes 
 
 To make men sing and laugh. 
 And so he lived for many a year 
 
 And sang his own rude hymns; 
 And still the people, far and near, 
 
 Wondered at his strange whims. 
 
 Some said his eyes would never view 
 
 The fast-approaching fall; 
 And others swore by all they knew 
 
 He would not die at all. 
 
 Straightway, on hearing this, grim Death 
 
 Passed king and artisan, 
 And most politely took the breath 
 
 Away from this strange man. 
 
 But as the people gazed on him 
 
 And thought him stark and dead, 
 He cried: "I'll give you one more whim 
 
 While on my dying bed : 
 
 " Play loudly on the fife and drum, 
 Let flags of triumph wave ; 
 And let the jolly peasants come 
 And dance upon my grave." 
 
 MY MUSE. 
 
 My Muse, thou art a laggard by the way. 
 
 To every thought that comes thou sayest nay. 
 
 Art thou like critics whose delight is ever 
 
 To numb the heart-throbs of Life's poor endeavor? 
 MAN DOES NOT KNOW. 
 
 To Prof. C. W. Houser. 
 
 Man does not know. He daily looks around him 
 And tries to master earth and air and skies ; 
 
 But some mysterious power has firmly bound him 
 Unto a plane from which he may not rise. 
 
 Man does not know. He plunges into science 
 As urchins plunge into the wooing wave ; 
 
 Yet nature's highest works still bid defiance 
 And rear up bulwarks that he may not brave. 
 
 Man does not know. He says that on to-morrow 
 
 He will be in a state of ecstasy ; 
 But when it comes his head is bowed with sorrow, 
 
 And he is in the depths of misery. 
 
 Man does not know. He tries to look before him 
 And view the bright side of his future way; 
 
 Yet who can tell but what this may throw o'er him 
 A veil to hide the bright side of to-day ? 
 
 Man does not know. He claims to have a spirit 
 (And may he never cease believing so) 
 
 That some far day or other will inherit 
 Eternal pleasure or eternal woe. 
 
 Man does not know. Has he a valid reason 
 To deem this ignorance a grave offense ? 
 
 To look for anything before its season 
 
 Shows there is urgent need of common sense. 
 
 Man does not know. Suppose he were partaker 
 Of all that now lies hidden from his sight, 
 Not even meeting with his blessed Maker 
 Could thrill his bosom with a new delight. 
 
 Man does not know. Yet why should he take pleasure 
 In doubting what perchance he can not see ? 
 
 Or why should he believe there is no treasure 
 Awaiting mortals in eternity ? 
 
 Man does not know. Each day he is receiving 
 
 Assistance from a power out of sight ; 
 So he should never, never cease believing 
 
 That God will some day bring it all to light. 
 
 Man does not know. O Thou Almighty Power ! 
 
 As thy great ways are past man's finding out, 
 Do teach him day by day and hour by hour 
 
 That lofty faith that overpowers doubt. 
 
 TACT IN RELATING. 
 
 To Dr. F. G Fowler. 
 
 Now, first, let each one estimate 
 To what extent he owes it 
 
 Unto his neighbor not to state 
 A thing just as he knows it. 
 
 I make no war upon the truth, 
 
 Nor on its rigid stating, 
 But hold that tact may be, forsooth, 
 
 A factor in relating. 
 
 It profits naught to bolster up 
 The point of outright lying, 
 
 For that's the devil's brewing cup 
 Whose pottage is denying. 
 
 But you know what I'm striking at 
 Without so much detailing; 
 
 Just issue out the portion that 
 Will cause the. least bewailing, 
 
 And keep the rest until you must, 
 In honor of truth's calling, 
 
 Disrobe it wholly though the dust 
 You stir up be appalling. 
 
 What right have we to make up plans 
 For weighing one another? 
 
 Are we not daily taught that man's 
 The keeper of his brother? 
 
 And then, in all sincerity, 
 How can we dwell together 
 
 Without observing what will be 
 Our neighbor's future weather ? 
 
 My brother, when the time shall come 
 (And may it not while I live) 
 
 Men's polish serves to make them dumb, 
 The ones that ought to die live. 
 
 TEMPTATION. 
 
 It is a great temptation to behold 
 
 The thoughts of one whose fibre's beaten gold; 
 
 They pass so easily into our own 
 
 And make our feldspar seem like diamond stone. 
 THE DEMAGOGUE. 
 
 To Albert S. White, Esq. 
 
 The demagogue is grave and gay, 
 
 And almost everything 
 It takes to bring success his way 
 
 With gracious leavening. 
 
 He's made upon a special plan 
 
 That puzzles wit to see 
 How nature makes a common man 
 
 With such variety. 
 
 And places in his hands the tools 
 
 Adapted to his trade, 
 Wherewith he decks the veriest fools 
 
 In wise men's masquerade. 
 
 If you attempt to analyze 
 
 Whate'er his tact ordains, 
 You'll reap a dreadful sacrifice 
 
 Of patience for your pains. 
 
 Should you think otherwise, perchance, 
 
 The facts on every hand 
 Will lend their meaning to enhance 
 
 Your power to understand. 
 
 And teach a lesson many a sage 
 
 Has learned at the expense 
 Of shortening life's dull pilgrimage 
 
 And brightening common sense. 
 
 So, see his actions as you see 
 Some bright and distant star 
 That seems in close proximity, 
 Yet well you know 'tis far. 
 
 And should you view his conscience till 
 It seems a gloomy wraith, 
 
 Discharge your weak and lagging will 
 And trust the rest to faith. 
 
 THE THRESHING FLOOR. 
 
 To William H. Steward, Esq. 
 
 Thrice blessed is he who wields the flail 
 Upon this century's threshing floor. 
 
 A few slight strokes by him avail 
 
 More than a hundred would of yore. 
 
 Around him lies the ripened grain 
 From every land and every age. 
 
 The weakest thresher should attain 
 Unto the wisdom of the sage. 
 
 Ambitious youth, this is the wealth 
 The ages have bequeathed to thee. 
 
 Thou canst not take thy share by stealth, 
 Nor by mere ingenuity. 
 
 Thy better self must spur thee on 
 
 To win what time has made thy own • 
 
 No hand but labor's yet has drawn 
 
 The sweets that labor's hand has sown. 
 
 Genius may serve thee well indeed, 
 If thou wilt treat it like a guest 
 
 Thou makest bring more than his need 
 And with thee freely share the rest. 
 
 Or thou hadst better humbly pass, 
 
 Wedded to noble industry. 
 Greater a glow-worm in the grass 
 
 Than yon orb roving lazily. 
 
 What boots it to mankind, O youth ! 
 
 That thou hast studied well and long, 
 And delved in million-veined truth 
 
 And learned to sever right from wrong ; 
 
 Unless thou strikest wide and deep 
 
 Below the planes where men have gone 
 
 Until thy honest labors heap 
 
 Truth's coffers as they journey on ? 
 
 There is a time to sit and muse 
 
 Upon what other hands have wrought, 
 
 If thou canst wisely find and use 
 
 Such as will strengthen thy own thought. 
 
 If not, thy time is spent in vain. 
 
 Go, seek some other, humbler way 
 To prove the part thou calPst the brain 
 
 Is all the Master made of clay. 
 
 This is, indeed, a worthy task, 
 
 But thou art simply gathering 
 Another's sowing. Who shall ask 
 
 What of thy own fruit's harvesting ? 
 
 Do not remorse and bitter shame 
 Possess thy feelings now and then ? 
 
 Strike out for self, and let thy name 
 Swell earth's vast list of mighty men. 
 
 So many brains are playing at 
 
 The game of study in the schools, 
 
 And ply their trade so deftly that 
 
 Mankind won't die for want of fools. 
 
 Not unto him whose eyes ne'er ope 
 Without the help of others' eyes, 
 
 Not unto him who fain would grope 
 And guess out nature's mysteries, 
 
 Is given the divine insight 
 
 That pierces through the warp and woof 
 Of earthly things until the light 
 
 Springs upward from the torch of proof. 
 
 THE KATY-DID. 
 
 Ready-noted katy-did, 
 Slender-throated katy-did, 
 Ever-ready katy-did, 
 Ever-steady katy-did, 
 Never-changing katy-did, 
 Ever-ranging katy-did, 
 Novelty-hating katy-did, 
 Tersely-prating katy-did, 
 Thou canst say thy say as plainly 
 As thy make-up is ungainly; 
 Thou canst speak so very tersely 
 That thy lastly is thy firstly. 
 AGAINST BOLDNESS. 
 
 To Gertrude and Frances. 
 I. 
 
 I often think the truly wise 
 
 Are such as seek through doubts and fears 
 To understand the mysteries 
 
 That have out-run the vanished years ; 
 And question long and reverently 
 
 The smallest as the greatest things 
 Until truth's winnowing wings shall free 
 
 The mind of crude imaginings. 
 
 II. 
 With doubts and fears and reverence, 
 
 O Master, must thy work be wrought ! 
 Whatever fosters bold pretense 
 
 Is but the garbage house of thought. 
 And from it shall the soul be fed 
 
 Until its heavenly tone is spent, 
 And in its place is harvested 
 
 A passion wild and turbulent. 
 
 III. 
 As at the future's ample door 
 
 The soul is tapping knowingly, 
 May it remember o'er and o'er 
 
 How slow and rare is certainty. 
 And, Master, may thy wisdom still 
 
 Direct us as it did of old, 
 And check each weak and erring will 
 
 That in itself grows over-bold. 
 
 ANSWER TO DUNBAR'S "AFTER A VISIT." 
 
 [The following is an answer to a poem written by Paul L. Dunbar after his 
 visit to Kentucky.] 
 
 So, you be'n to ole Kentucky, 
 
 An' you want to go ag'in ? 
 Well, Kentucky '11 doff her kerchief 
 
 An' politely ask you in. 
 An 7 she '11 loosen from her girdle 
 
 What perhaps you didn't see — 
 Keys that fit the other cupboards 
 
 Of her hospitality. 
 
 Not that she's inclined to hold back 
 
 With the good, and give the worst; 
 But, you know, in all fair dealin', 
 
 What is first must be the first. 
 So, when she takes key the second 
 
 An' gives it a twist er two 
 (Maybe I ought not to say it) 
 
 It '11 most nigh startle you. 
 
 An' then keys the third and fourth, sir, 
 
 (Not to speak of all the rest) 
 Wouldn't stop at crackin' buttons, 
 
 They'd jest smash that Sunday vest. 
 And your happiness would find, sir, 
 
 A momentum then and there 
 That would carry it a-sweepin' 
 
 Through the stronghold of despair. 
 
 Now, the grippin' o' the hand, sir, 
 An' the welcome that you say 
 Was so firm an' true an' all that 
 
 Has a kind o' curious way. 
 At the first it's sorter slow like, 
 
 Till it forms a league with you, 
 Then it makes a kind o' circuit 
 
 That jest thrills you thro' an' thro'. 
 
 But it may be I had better 
 
 Not discuss this aftermath 
 Fur it might stir up your feelings 
 
 To the righteous point of wrath 
 As you brood o'er what you lost, sir, 
 
 By not stayin' with us longer. 
 . Ah, well, come to see us often, 
 
 Ole Kentucky '11 make you stronger. 
 
 So, you be'n to ole Kentucky, 
 
 An' you want to go ag'in ? 
 Well, Kentucky's standin' waitin' 
 
 Jest to take you wholly in, 
 An' she'll loosen her vast girdle 
 
 So that you can fully see 
 All the roots, fruits, leaves, an' branches 
 
 Of her hospitality. 
 
 FAITH. 
 
 Faith is essential to prosperity, 
 Although no mortal knoweth what it be; 
 For, without it, the wise man, like the fool, 
 Would swap the ocean for a stagnant pool. 
 
 ON HEARING JAMES W. RILEY READ. 
 
 [From a Kentucky standpoint.] 
 
 To tell the truth, each piece he read 
 
 Set up a jingle in my head 
 
 That bumped and thumped and roared about, 
 
 Then on a sudden just crept out, 
 
 Gently and slowly at the start, 
 
 Then made a bee-line for my heart. 
 
 And more than once I thought maybe 
 His charming Hoosier poetry 
 Would be a guide to lead me over 
 To the Elysian fields of clover. 
 
 To find fault with his worst or best 
 Would be like finding fault with rest 
 After a fellow has been in 
 .The dirt and dust up to his chin, 
 And bathed and stretched beneath the trees 
 Whose branches fairly hug the breeze. 
 
 In these hackneyed and sordid days, 
 When censure thorns the bud of praise 
 And many think they ought not to 
 Give genius half its honest due, 
 And never fail to bombard it 
 With silly quips and shallow wit, 
 I like to just go hunt it up 
 And sup and sip and sip and sup; 
 And then I like to speak my praise 
 In honest thought and simple phrase, 
 And let the giver know that I 
 Delight in him and tell him why, 
 And not go wavering to and fro 
 But just come out and tell him so. 
 
 HEROISM. 
 
 Life's fibres we are wont to separate 
 
 And nourish such as yield to pleasantry 
 
 A few scant sheaves. Thereby we sow a fate 
 Whose reapings choke the soul's vast granary. 
 
 Tread we, if need be, over thorny ways, 
 
 Rejoicing ever it is ours to dare ; 
 Nor heed the million-footed throng that stays, 
 
 Nor stop to heal our bleeding feet and bare. 
 
 BACON. 
 
 He was, in truth, a man whose genius dwelt 
 In mystic corners of the universe ; 
 
 And Nature, couched in what he saw and felt, 
 Appears in garments simplified and terse. 
 
 EMERSON. 
 
 He tilled the old deserted fields with zeal, 
 And honored every common thing he saw 
 
 By making it a part of the great seal 
 That holds secure the universal law. 
 HYMN FOR ZION'S CENTENNIAL. 
 
 To Bis:iop Walters, D. D. 
 Tune — "My Cotintry, ' Tzs of Thee!' 
 
 The Past with all its wrong 
 Deserves a joyous song 
 
 From every soul; 
 For, be it as it may, 
 It sheds a dazzling ray 
 That lights our tedious way 
 
 With ample dole. 
 
 The Present speaketh thus 
 In accents glorious : 
 
 The times to be 
 Will check man's selfish ways 
 And yield him better days 
 And ever be ablaze 
 
 With liberty. 
 
 O Zion ! dost thou ask 
 What daily, hourly task 
 
 Thy God has set 
 To see if thou wilt still 
 Thy noble creed fulfill 
 And hearken to His will 
 
 However met ? 
 
 It is to place His love 
 All earthly dross above 
 
 And let men know 
 Howe'er they be depraved, 
 If Christ's name be engraved 
 Within they will be saved 
 From lasting woe. 
 
 O Zion ! true and tried, 
 By faith and hope abide, 
 
 And steer right on. 
 And as thou mov'st spread out 
 No tempting sail of doubt 
 Whose ample folds may flout 
 
 The promised dawn. 
 
 QUATRAINS, 
 i. 
 
 CO-OPERATION. 
 
 Her eyes gave forth a light that softened so 
 The rugged metal of my inner soul 
 
 I straightway reckoned loneliness and woe 
 
 Would flee, if we approached them as a whole. 
 2. 
 
 ROBERT BURNS. 
 
 Sin smirched thy garments, and thy lot was cast 
 Within the cold embrace of discontent; 
 
 Still thou didst blow so clear and pure a blast 
 Its echo warrants censure's banishment. 
 3- 
 
 CONQUEST. 
 
 As one would rob a reptile of its sting 
 And make it tame and trustful in the end, 
 
 So by sheer tact and kindly ministering 
 Convert each foe you meet into a friend. 
 THE VOICE OF THE OCEAN. 
 
 As I stood beside the ocean, 
 
 Gazing silently 
 At the wild waves in commotion, 
 
 Thus it spoke to me : 
 
 ' i Thousands now are sweetly sleeping 
 In my wide embrace, 
 While my waves are slowly creeping 
 O'er each silent face. 
 
 " In the dark primeval ages 
 That so long have flown 
 Holy men and mighty sages 
 Loved to sleep in stone. 
 
 "So vast sepulchres were hollowed 
 By the hands of slaves, 
 And by thousands they were followed 
 To their rocky graves. 
 
 ' ' But the loved ones whom my billows 
 Now are raging o'er 
 Sank to sleep on briny pillows, 
 Mid my awful roar." 
 
 MODERN HOMILETICS. 
 
 Now, firstly, from my text I stray 
 To where my discourse is begun; 
 
 And then I just say on and say 
 Until, well, I am done. 
 SONNETS. 
 
 Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
 
 Who can hold up the intellect and say : 
 " From here to there scampers a vein of wit 
 
 With laughing humor by the side of it, 
 Assisting cold philosophy to play 
 The game of thinking?" Not a single ray 
 
 That boldly shines therefrom will e'er admit 
 
 Of close analysis. So, bit by bit, 
 We fall to guessing out the mind's true way 
 Of forming wholes. O astute analyst ! 
 
 And royal merchant in the mart of song ! 
 Because of this we see as through a mist 
 
 Thy charming whole. Yet know to thee belong, 
 Howe'er they be arranged, the God-like three — 
 Wit, humor, and sublime philosophy. 
 
 AMERICA TO ENGLAND, 1895. 
 
 O England ! mother England ! hast thou come 
 To dally with the love of victory 
 That flashes forth thy sometime cruelty 
 
 Thou visitest on nations wearisome? 
 
 And would'st thou start a wound the blood therefrom- 
 Mingled with blood that will come forth with glee 
 To meet thy own upon both land and sea — 
 
 Shall curse eternally all Christendom ? 
 
 Mother ! the great West has no will to mar 
 Thy glory's currents that so grandly run ; 
 But would remind thee it has grown a star 
 
 That borrows naught from thy resplendent sun. 
 Let us not winnow chaff till its increase 
 Sever the girdle of the whole world's peace. 
 
 TO A BEAUTY. 
 
 Homage is thine because, forsooth, thy face 
 Brooks not an entrance to thy fickle soul; 
 So, untrained eyes think they have reached life's goal 
 
 If but allowed thy lineaments to trace. 
 
 He who looks deeply will at once erase 
 Thy outer image till worth's sacred stole 
 Warm into active being powers that dole 
 
 Out inward beauties he must needs embrace. 
 
 Thus, richly blended, thou wilt have the power 
 To wield an influence whose magic dart 
 
 Will find each victim in Love's crowded bower, 
 And leave thy message on his throbbing heart. 
 
 Then he who flinches 'neath thy chastening rod 
 
 Belies his nature and defies his God. 
 
 THE NEGRO'S LOYALTY. 
 
 I. 
 Disloyal to my native land ? 
 
 A traitor to the stripes and stars ? 
 I lift this tried and sturdy hand 
 To forge my brother's prison bars ? 
 Perish the hellish thought ! 
 My all shall go as a true patriot's ought. 
  
 II. 
 For him who doth unwisely prate 
 
 Of my good will to bloody Spain, 
 I brew the patriot's righteous hate, 
 And hurl it at him with disdain. 
 May the avenging rod 
 Wed his foul dust to the o'er-welcome sod. 
 
 III. 
 Justice at times may slightly swerve, 
 
 And turn the course of freedom back, 
 Her blinded presence tend to nerve 
 The mob that puts me to the rack; 
 Yet, I am what I am — 
 A force to guard the rights of Uncle Sam. 
 
 IV. 
 
 My faith looks up through blood and tears 
 
 And tarries at the golden dawn 
 Whose beams slant out across the years, 
 Proclaiming freedom fully born. 
 I must do what I can 
 To hasten on this boon to struggling man. 
 
 V. 
 God bless this land of corn and wine ! 
 
 God bless her loyal, fighting sons ! 
 May each one say : ' ' The cause is mine ; 
 I'll stand beside the roaring guns, 
 And play a hero's part 
 In striking terror to Spain's cruel heart." 
 MR. GOODY'S GOAT. 
 
 Old Mr. Goody had a goat 
 That was quiet and genteel; 
 
 His mustache started on his chin 
 And ended on his heel. 
 
 This goat thought he was just as smart 
 
 As anything could be ; 
 He said no other goat alive 
 
 Knew half so much as he. 
 
 He knew that corn is made to grow, 
 And eggs are made to hatch ; 
 
 But, lo, he never yet had seen 
 The thing you call a match. 
 
 So, one day as he pondered o'er 
 The many things he knew, 
 
 He chanced to see this very thing 
 Lying plainly in his view. 
 
 Said he : " Of all the things I've seen 
 Not one of them I've feared; 
 
 So I will take this something up 
 And hang it in my beard." 
 
 Just then a monkey came along, 
 And sneeringly he spoke : 
 "The thing that dangles from your beard 
 Was clearly made to smoke." 
 
 "And how?" the goat made quick reply. 
 The monkey said: "Just so;" 
 And gave the match a kind of stroke 
 That monkeys only know. 
 
 And in a trice there stood a goat 
 
 As beardless as a flea, 
 And one that thought the smallest thing 
 
 Knew just as much as he. 
 
 CONSCIENCE. 
 
 Thou art the daysman of the human soul, 
 
 Thou giv'st thy timely warning loud and long; 
 
 And all who hearken unto thy control 
 
 Will never tread the noxious paths of wrong. 
 
 Oh, brother mine, let this true herald cease 
 To guide thee as thou movest on thy way, 
 
 And, soon or late, the fires of love and peace 
 Will dwell in thee as dormant as the clay. 
 
 Therefore, at every point be vigilant 
 
 Lest thy own action thwart the soul's emprise; 
 
 And numb the pulse that otherwise would grant 
 The key to earth's unearthy paradise. 
 
 COMPENSATION. 
 
 It is a blessed thing to look into 
 The many-sided mysteries of man ; 
 
 But for each point secured is ever due 
 The servile homage of the charlatan. 
 
 LILY. 
 
 To Sarah. 
 
 She was the prettiest little maid 
 That ever tripped along, 
 
 Or sat beneath the pleasant shade 
 To sing an evening song. 
 
 And ever at her work she sang 
 
 Some sinple, rustic lay 
 Until the cliffs around her rang 
 
 With its sweet melody. 
 
 Her cot, beneath a rocky hill, 
 
 Stood by an aged tree; 
 And far below a little rill 
 
 Ran rippling to the sea. 
 
 Along its banks she often strayed 
 To fill her lap with flowers, 
 
 Or in some grassy cranny played 
 At building fairy towers. 
 
 Now, sunny April came to wake 
 All nature from its sleeping ; 
 
 And here and there a little brake 
 Above the soil was peeping. 
 
 And Lily thought the gentle spring 
 
 Did never fairer seem, 
 And hurried through her work to sin£ 
 
 Beside the little stream. 
 
 While sitting on its grassy brink, 
 Singing her rustic lay, 
 She saw the songsters light and drink 
 Then quickly flit away. 
 
 Just then some school-boys came along 
 
 Upon the farther shore ; 
 And straightway did she cease the song 
 
 To row them safely o'er. 
 
 She tried to take the little boat 
 
 Across the stream in vain, 
 And sank beneath the current swift, 
 
 And never rose again. 
 
 MARY. 
 
 When you roam the garden over, 
 When you trip across the lea, 
 
 When you play amid the clover, 
 Mary, do you think of me ? 
 
 When you sit beside the fire 
 
 In the closing of the year, 
 Have you still the same desire 
 
 That once made my presence dear? 
 
 When the banquet hall is lighted 
 For the youthful and the gay, 
 
 And you are with the invited, 
 Do you sigh that I'm away ? 
 
 When you hear that some disaster 
 Has befallen ship and crew, 
 
 Do you wish the hours were faster 
 That will bring me back to you ? 
 
 And if I, perchance, should perish, 
 While upon the briny sea, 
 
 Mary, will you ever cherish 
 
 All the gifts you have from me ? 
 
 SALT WATER. 
 
 I put salt water to my thirsty lip, 
 
 And drew it back as quickly as I could. 
 
 Do likewise, man, whene'er you chance to dip 
 Into those things you have not understood. 
 
 I separated both immediately, 
 
 And drank the water to my soul's content, 
 Then threw the worthless salt into the sea. 
 
 Drink pleasures, man, after sin's banishment. 
 
 LET NONE IGNOBLY HALT. 
 
 " The paths of glory lead but to the grave." — Gray. 
 
 Let none ignobly halt because 
 They tell us glory's fickle wave 
 
 Rolls on in keeping with set laws 
 
 And bears but to the cold, dark grave; 
 
 For whatsoever course we take 
 
 Leads straight to this unwelcome goal, 
 
 So, spur the will and grandly make 
 The voyage with elated soul. 
 ANSWER TO DUNBAR'S "A CHOICE." 
 
 They please me so — these solemn lays 
 
 That tell what God to man decrees. 
 The world so seldom mends its ways 
 
 That poets should by swift degrees 
 Put back the frail, bring forth the strong, 
 And wed stern facts to sober song 
 With a ring so clear that our barks must steer 
 To the haven where the God-kissed air 
 
 Makes the soul-wine sweet through its earth-brewed lees. 
 
 PERVERTED VISION. 
 
 As one who stands beside a magic pool 
 
 And cries to every nymph that lifts its head : 
 "Come, bring me gold," and only hears : " Thou fool, 
 Repent or journey on disquieted ;" 
 
 So he who stranger is to his own soul 
 
 Will find him face to face with the unreal, 
 
 And spend his time in trying to read the scroll 
 Whereon he thinks is writ life's great ideal. 
 
 THOUGHT AND FEELING. 
 
 "Lend me thy fire," I said unto my soul; 
 
 "Give me a thought," I pleaded with my brain. 
 The first said: " Cultivate thy needed strain." 
 The second whispered: " Search from pole to pole." 
 JOHNNY'S DREAM OF SANTA CLAUS. 
 
 Johnny was smart as he was good, 
 But still he never understood 
 Why Santa Claus, with his reindeer, 
 Can only come 'round once a year. 
 The more he thought about the thing, 
 The more it set him wondering. 
 
 " Now, why," said he, "can't Santa Claus 
 Throw off those old and binding laws, 
 And always have his little pack 
 Ready to fling across his back; 
 And, mounted on his fleet reindeer, 
 Come 'round at least four times a year ? 
 
 1 [ I'm sure that all the little boys 
 Who find such sport in Santa's toys, 
 And all the girls who love to play 
 With dolls and such the live-long day, 
 Would welcome him whene'er he comes 
 With songs and plays and fifes and drums." 
 His eyelids closed, his head drooped low, 
 And he was where the sleepers go. 
 
 He dreamed that he was sitting by 
 The fireside, musing silently, 
 When all at once he heard a shout 
 Ring loud and merrily without; 
 And as he gazed into the flame 
 Santa Claus down the chimney came. 
 His voice was low, but round and sweet, 
 His beard., it almost touched his feet. 
 With eyes as bright as they could be 
 He looked at Johnny curiously, 
 And said, 'Til tell you why my deer 
 And I can come but once a year. 
 
 " When they were given unto me 
 I had to promise faithfully 
 That whatsoever might betide, 
 I'd always keep them at my side. 
 Now, I can't live and be untrue, 
 So they can't come unless I do. 
 
 "And of the many promises 
 Concerning me, I give you these : 
 My beard must be as white as snow, 
 And just as long as it can grow. 
 My eyes must be so bright that I 
 Can see a speck up in the sky. 
 
 u When I have given out my toys 
 To all the little girls and boys, 
 And scampered over hill and plain, 
 And driven my deer back home again, 
 My beard turns black and all drops out — 
 A fact, perchance, that you may doubt. 
 
 "And then it creeps out leisurely 
 Till it's as long as it should be, 
 Then, bit by bit, each day and night, 
 It turns and turns till it turns white. 
 About the time this task is through, 
 The Old Year sadly hails the New. 
 
 " My eyes grow dim and dimmer still, 
 Until I can not see at will ; 
 And then they turn and grow so bright 
 That I can see the darkest night. 
 But this, too, takes a whole round year — 
 Another fact to doubt, my dear. 
 
 "And now, perchance, you'd like to know 
 Just why these things should vary so. 
 About the beard I will not speak 
 (I see that you are growing weak), 
 My sight grows dim, so I can't view 
 The naughty things .that children do. 
 
 ' ' I can not give my precious toys 
 To any little girls and boys 
 That I know have been bad at school, 
 And violated every rule 
 That ma and pa so lovingly 
 Have made for their prosperity. 
 
 "Since I am anxious every one 
 Should get some toys and have some fun, 
 It is as plain as plain can be 
 The only thing that's left for me 
 Is not to see them when they do 
 The very things they ought not to. 
 
 "And so I wait till near the morn 
 On which the blessed Christ was born, 
 When, like the Master, every child 
 Is striving to be meek and mild." 
 Then, seated on the brightest flame, 
 Old Santa went the way he came. 
 Johnny awoke in great surprise, 
 And, as he slowly rubbed his eyes, 
 He turned his mind aback to see 
 The flaws in his past history, 
 And they were such he had to say : 
 " Old Santa's is the better way. 
 
 "And if he and his fleet reindeer 
 Will not come more than once a year 
 I'm sure that it will just suit me, 
 And I don't know but there may be 
 Some others who, like me, will say 
 That Santa's is the better way." 
 
 SIX IN DEPORTMENT. 
 
 A SCHOOL-BOY IDYL. 
 
 "What's that you got there in your hand? 
 You think that I don't understand ? 
 Let's see! er I'll chug you in the ribs. 
 Ho, boys ! come here ; old Tricky Tibbs 
 Got his report. Say, Trick, I'll bet 
 You anything that you can get 
 That thing don't say you're going to pass, 
 You know you done been giving sass 
 The whole month through. You, snigger, you! 
 That teacher's bound to out figger you 
 On that deportment. Well, let's see! 
 I told you so ; he's just got three. 
 Got six? Well, now, just listen to that! 
 Goose! you don't know where 'bouts you're at." 
 
 " You bet I do," said Tricky, wearing 
 A smile the boys thought had no bearing 
 Upon said case. " I have some doubts 
 As to you seeing the ins and outs 
 Of this here thing. There is a point 
 That in my case becomes a joint 
 And fastens this three to enough 
 To make it six. You say it's stuff? 
 Let's figger then. Even you can see 
 To make my six takes one more three. 
 Now, ain't that right? You sleepy dunce, 
 You ought to see the rest at once, 
 Or from your eyes the scales be picking. 
 I got the other three in licking." 
 
 UNCLE ZEB. 
 
 "Well, Uncle Zeb, it seems that you 
 Are always peeping 'round 
 As if in search of some queer spot 
 Where wisdom may be found." 
 
 " Now, child, you see this head of mine 
 Has been a kind of bin 
 For all the things around me to 
 Store up their valuables in. 
 
 "And, child, I tell you what I b'lieve 
 About this here affair ; 
 I b'lieve this world's a kind of thing 
 Whose breath you call the air. 
 
 "And this is alway blowing and 
 A-sputtering, and so 
 The moon and sun and all the rest 
 Are just obliged to go. 
 
 "Just look out there! Now, ain't that sun 
 A-running 'round and 'round ? 
 And ain't this breath you call the wind 
 A-keeping it from the ground ? 
 
 " Now, child, the winds that get out there 
 Are mighty far from home 
 And lonely-like. So they just take 
 The sun and have a roam." 
 
 A DIFFERENCE. 
 
 When Time was laggard in the long ago, 
 And stopped to pilfer dainty things to eat, 
 
 Dispatch, his master, vowed him lasting woe 
 By putting bells about his lazy feet. 
 
 Now, had Dispatch been master of the tongue 
 And served it likewise for his pleasure's sake, 
 
 Reason and Silence would have long since wrung 
 His nose and ears for making the mistake. 
 
 TO KENTUCKY. 
 
 Make not a law to rule another 
 
 That you yourselves would not obey ; 
 In this, as in the ancient day, 
 
 Man is the keeper of his brother. 
 
 Let not the States about you see 
 That you are great in all that goes 
 To banish friends and harbor foes 
 
 Around the base of freedom's tree. 
 
 A JUST REWARD. 
 
 A poet shyly sang a ditty 
 
 To Lady Bonnevare, 
 And hinted she was wise and witty 
 
 As well as wondrous fair. 
 
 " Upon my word I will forsake you," 
 She said and laced him coldly, 
 
 " And may the devil come and take you 
 Till you can warble boldly." 
 
 MY POVERTY AND WEALTH. 
 
 This life of mine is poor indeed, 
 
 If it be measured by 
 The little mankind, in their need, 
 
 Reap from my charity. 
 
 But rich it is beyond the power 
 
 Of my dull eyes to see, 
 When measured by the gracious dower, 
 
 Which they bequeath to me.

        <collex:text>MORNING ON SHINNECOCK
            The rising sun had crowned the hills,
            And added beauty to the plain;
            O grand and wondrous spectacle!
            That only nature could explain.
            I stood within a leafy grove,
            And gazed around in blissful awe;
            The sky appeared one mass of blue,
            That seemed to spread from sea to shore.
            Far as the human eye could see,
            Were stretched the fields of waving corn.
            Soft on my ear the warbling birds
            Were herding the birth of morn.
            While here and there a cottage quaint
            Seemed to repose in quiet ease
            Amid the trees, whose leaflets waved
            And fluttered in the passing breeze.
            O morning hour! so dear thy joy,
            And how I longed for thee to last;
            But e'en thy fading into day
            Brought me an echo of the past.
            "Twas this,–how fair my life began;
            How pleasant was its hour of dawn;
            But, merging into sorrow's day,
            Then beauty faded with the morn.

        <collex:text>TREASURED MOMENTS
            For a time away from the tumult,
            Shut in from the care and the strife,
            Away from the gloom and the discord,
            That seemed to encircle my life.
            Shut in with the dear, earnest women–
            Women with hearts true and strong,
            Who dared to face a great evil,
            Who dared to contend against wrong.
            And the speaker's words were so cheering,
            As she talked to us of the time
            When the women crusaded together;
            How they battled against the wine.
            How they fought against deadly poison;
            How they struggled again and again,
            Till some homes were made better and brighter,
            Till some hearts were robbed of their pain.
            Then the speaker's tones grew more tender,
            As she spoke of a life so complete,
            That many lives caught the essence
            Of her life so full and so sweet;
            Who had just stepped over the threshold,
            And had entered the "Great Beyond,"
            Life's labor so nobly completed,
            Heaven's blessing triumphantly won.
            Then sweet rose the voice of the singer,
            Singing of "Christ and the Cross,"
            Till my soul cried loudly within me
            "I'll count everything but as dross."
            For His sake who bore our great burden,
            Who labored and suffered so long;
            And my heart grew glad for the singer,
            And I said: "O praise God for the song!"
            Ah! how I was strengthened, uplifted.
            How the depths of my soul were stirred;
            And the words, the song and the music
            Seemed the sweetest I ever had heard.
            I thought when that hour was ended,
            I shall cherish its memory so long;
            I shall think of the words so inspiring.
            I shall think of the singer, the song.
            As I wended my way again homeward,
            Possessed with a sweet, nameless peace,
            I thought of the great Life Eternal
            Where such moments as these never cease.
            Where there's fullness of joy forever,
            Where we meet an unbroken band,
            Shut in with the dear, blessed Master;
            Resting safe at the Father's right hand.

        <collex:text>AT HARVEST TIME
            A Sower walked among his fields
            When Spring's fair glory filled the earth;
            He scattered seed with eager hand,
            And sowing, thought upon their worth.
            "These seeds are precious ones," he said.
            "The finest flowers shall be mine;
            And I shall reap rich, golden grain,
            When these are ripe at harvest time."
            "I'll watch their growth with earnest care,
            And faithfully will till the soil;
            With willing hands each passing day
            From morn till setting sun I'll toil. 
            And when the reaping time shall come,
            A bounteous Harvest shall be mine;
            I shall rejoice at duty done
            When these are ripe at Harvest time."
            Forth to his fields at Harvest time,
            The Sower bent his steps again;
            The Reapers' song sang merrily,
            Their sickles gleamed 'mid golden grain. 
            With joyous heart the Sower cried
            "Behold, what precious sheaves are mine;
            And labor brings its own reward,
            For these are ripe at Harvest time."
            O Master! in thy fields so fair
            We, too, are sowing precious seed.
            And like the Sower we will toil
            Till golden grain fulfil thy need.
            Then shall we hear thy loving voice,–
            "Behold! what precious sheaves are mine.
            Let all be safely garnered in,
            For these are ripe at Harvest time."

        <collex:text>A HERO OF SAN JUAN [HILL]
            Among the sick and wounded ones,
            This stricken soldier boy lay,
            With glassy eye and shortened breath;
            His life seemed slipping fast away.
            My heart grew faint to see him thus,
            His dark brown face so full of pain,
            I wondered if the mother's eyes
            Were looking for her boy in vain.
            I bent to catch his feeble's words:
            "I am so ill and far from home.
            I feel so strange and lonely here;
            You seem a friend, I'm glad you've come.
            "I want to tell you how our boys
            Went charging on the enemy.
            'Twas when we climbed up Juan's hill;
            And there we got the victory.
            "The Spaniards poured a heavy fire;
            We met it with a right good will.
            We saw the Seventy-first fall back,
            And then our boys went up the hill.
            "Yes, up the hill, and gained it, too;
            Not one brave boy was seen to lag.
            Old Glory o'er us floating free,
            We'd gladly died for that old flag."
            His dim eye brightened as he spoke;
            He seemed unconscious of his pain;
            In fancy on the battlefield
            He lived that victory o'er again.
            And I; I seemed to grasp it, too,–
            The stalwart form, the dusky face
            Of those black heroes, climbing up
            To win fair glory for their race.
            The Spaniards said that phalanx seemed
            To move like one black, solid wall;
            They flung defiance back at Death,
            And, answering to that thrilling call,
            They fought for Cuban liberty.
            On Juan's hill those bloody stains
            Mark how these heroes won the day
            And added honor to their names.
            March on, dark sons of Afric's race,
            Naught can be gained by standing still;
            Retreat not, 'quit yourselves like men
            And, like these heroes, climb the hill,
            Till pride and prejudice shall cease;
            Till racial barriers are unknown.
            Attain the heights where over all,
            Equality shall sit enthroned.

        <collex:text>CRISPUS ATTUCKS
            The Nation's heart beat wildly,
            And keenly felt the coming strife;
            The Country's call was sounding
            Brave men must offer life for life.
            So long Great Britain's power
            Had sternly held unyielding sway,
            The people yearned for freedom
            And cried, "Our blood must pave the way."
            So, on the streets of Boston,
            Where madly rushed the British foe;
            Men questioned with each other,
            "Who shall be first to strike the blow?"
            Not that they shrank from duty,
            Ah, no! their lives they gladly gave;
            But War, with all its terrors,
            Brings fear to hearts both true and brave.
            But one, with fearless courage,
            Inspired them to activity,
            And boldly led them forward
            With cheering shout, "For Liberty!" *
            In face of death and danger,
            He met the foe, this soldier true,
            Till, charging full upon them,
            Their bayonets had pierced him through.
            He fell, and o'er the pavement
            A Negro's blood was flowing free.
            His sable hand was foremost
            To strike the blow for liberty.
            It was a deed most valiant,
            And mighty was the work begun,
            For War then waging fiercely,
            Ceased not till victory was won.
            Naught but a slave was Attucks,
            And yet how grand a hero, too.
            He gave a life for freedom,
            What more could royal sovereign do?
            Well may we eulogize him!
            And rear a monument of fame.
            We hold his memory sacred;
            We honor and revere his name.
            A century has vanished,
            Yet, through the years still rolling on
            We emulate his bravery
            And praise the deed he nobly done.
            Then write in glowing letters
            These thrilling words in history,–
            That Attucks was a hero,
            That Attucks died for Liberty.

        <collex:text>Unjust, untrue, is he who dares
            Upon our honor to intrude,
            And claims that with the sin of crime
            The Negro's nature is imbued.
            Shall we keep silent? No; thrice No!
            We stand defenseless in our cause.
            If voices fail to cry aloud
            And plead a right to justice's laws.
            For who shall vindicate this wrong?
            Who shall defend our perjured race?
            We must speak out with one accord,
            If we the stigma would erase.
            The cruel hand that raised the lash
            To strike a wronged and helpless race,
            Is stained with sin of deepest dye,
            And shows of brutal crime more trace.
            I draw a picture of the slave
            Who meekly bowed 'neath stinging blows
            And raised no hand in swift defense,
            To kill, to threaten, or oppose.
            I hear from out his cabin rise
            Sweet songs of praises unto God.
            E'en with his painful wounds he sings,
            And utters no resentful word.
            I see him in the darker days
            When blood like crimson rivers ran,
            And Southern slavers left their homes
            In answer to stern war's demands.
            They left their lands, their kindred ties,
            Entrusted to the Slave alone.
            Who faithfully and nobly strove
            To guard the sacred rights of home.
            Yes; even lives were in his hands.
            Yet he, though held in slavery,
            Upon his honor threw no shame,
            Or stain of criminality.
            Today, on equal ground he stands
            With loyal, true, and noble men.
            He loves his country, and remains
            A law abiding citizen.
            He shares no part in daring plot,
            He scorns to hint of anarchy;
            He only asks his native right;
            Can this be criminality?
            Then, Justice! we implore thy aid.
            Thine arm can well supply our need;
            Protect our name, assist our cause,
            For Right and Right alone we plead.

        <collex:text>THE WALK TO EMMAUS
            'Twas eventide. Along the dusty road
            Two weary travelers passed with aching feet
            And heavy hearts, while each in saddened tones
            The story of their Lord would oft repeat.
            We yearn for Him, and is it not three days
            Since first He lay within the silent tomb?
            Yet when we hastened to His resting place,
            Our Lord had gone; His grave was wrapt in gloom.
            Communing thus, these weary travelers went.
            Their hearts oppressed by mingled doubt and fear;
            When lo! along the road to Emmaus
            Their Lord, the risen Christ Himself, drew near.
            With gentle voice He asked of them their grief,–
            "Why are ye sad? and O, what troubleth thee?"
            They knew not that the loving Master spoke,
            Their eyes were holden, that they could not see.
            And one replied: "We know not where He is,–
            Our Lord, who promised Israel to redeem.
            Art thou a stranger in Jerusalem?
            And knowest not what marvelous things have been?"
            Then Jesus spoke. "Why are ye show of heart?
            Did not the prophets in the days of old
            Proclaim that Christ must die and live again,
            That ye His wondrous power might behold?"
            Their hearts were touched; the Master's thrilling words
            Dispelled their fears and cleared their darkened sight.
            And while the Holy Scriptures He declared,
            There came sweet peace and filled their souls with light.
            The Master ceased, and now the journey o'er
            He still would further go along the road.
            But they constrained Him, saying: "Tarry here;
            Abide with us and enter our abode."
            He deigned to pass within that humble home,
            His holy presence filled the place with light;
            He sat at meat and brake and blessed the bread,
            And ere they know it vanished from their sight.
            They said, with gladdened hearts, "It is our Lord,
            Our risen Christ for whom we long have yearned;
            We knew Him not when walking by the way,
            And yet our hearts within us sweetly burned.
            O Christian! walking o'er Life's rugged road,
            Thou too, like His disciples, oft shall say,–
            "Did not our hearts within us sweetly burn
            When Jesus talked with us beside the way?"

        <collex:text>MY DREAM OF THE NEW YEAR
            Through the waning hours of moments
            Of the slowly dying year,
            I sat watching, watching, waiting
            For the New Dawn to appear.
            While the Old Year's strife and struggle,
            With its changing, varied scene,
            Passed before me till I wearied,
            Fell asleep–asleep to dream
            That I saw a lofty Castle,
            Vast in size and wondrous fair;
            And I stood outside its portal
            Knocking for an entrance there.
            From its towers the bells were ringing
            In a strange, discordant tone,
            Wailing out their mournful measures
            Like a mortal's dying moan.
            Still I waited, knocked and waited,
            For I longed to enter there;
            Longed to know the name and secret
            Of this Castle, vast and fair.
            When a voice within cried loudly,
            "Thou shalt have that wish of thine.
            Thou art knocking at Life's Castle,
            And the keeper's name is Time.
            "And the bells you hear above you
            Ring out all the dying years;
            Ring out Man's past griefs and sorrows,
            Ring out blasted hopes and fears.
            With the coming of the New Year
            They will cease that refrain.
            You will hear them chiming sweetly,
            Ringing out a joyous strain.
            "If you watch and wait with patience,
            You shall be admitted here;
            For the New Year swift approaches,
            Its bright dawning draweth near."
            So I waited, watched and waited
            Till the Castle's door swung wide;
            And the keeper bade me enter,
            Saying, "Mortal here abide."
            'Twas indeed a wondrous Castle,
            With its arches gleaming bright,
            E'en the keeper's face was beaming
            With a rare and radiant light.
            Through its spacious halls he led me
            Over floors of spotless white,
            Till it seemed that mortal vision
            Ne'er beheld a fairer sight.
            On its walls in blazoned letters
            I could trace each written word,
            Words that could not fail to strengthen
            When by mortals they were heard.
            And the keeper, softly speaking,
            Read them, one by one, to me,–
            "Resolution, faith, and duty,
            Hope and opportunity."
            Then I asked him, "Can you tell me
            Why these words are written here?"
            He replied: "These are the watchwords
            That shall guide thee through the year.
            Just resolve to do thy duty;
            Thine the opportunity.
            Hope shall aid thee in thy purpose,
            Do it well and faithfully."
            Then the bells pealed out so loudly,
            Ringing out their joyous strain,
            That I started from my slumber,
            Found myself alone again.
            Saw no more Life's wondrous Castle,
            Vanished now the keeper Time;
            Heard no more the joyful pealing
            Of the bells' sweet, tuneful chime.
            Day had dawned, the night was over,
            Life's Old year was safely past.
            Now had dawned a brighter morning,
            Life's New Year had come at last.
            But the Dream had filled its mission– 
            Made my path of duty clear.
            Hope and Faith were now the watchwords 
            Brightening up my glad New Year.

        <collex:text>DRIFTING
            And now the sun in tinted splendor sank,
            The west was all aglow with crimson light;
            The bay seemed like a sheet of burnished gold,
            Its waters glistened with such radiance bright.
            At anchor lay the yachts with snow-white sails,
            Outlined against glowing, rose-hued sky.
            No ripple stirred the waters' calm repose
            Save when a tiny craft sped lightly by.
            Our boat was drifting slowly, gently round,
            To rest secure till evening shadows fell;
            No sound disturbed the stillness of the air,
            Save the soft chiming of the vesper bell.
            Yes, drifting, drifting; and I thought that life,
            When nearing death, is like the sunset sky.
            And death is but the slow, sure drifting in
            To rest far more securely, by and by.
            Then let me drift along the Bay of Time,
            Till my last sun shall set in glowing light;
            Let me cast anchor where no shadows fall,
            Forever moored within Heaven's harbor bright.
            Newport. June 12, 1898.

            I stand upon the haunted plain
            Of vanished day and year,
            And ever o'er its gloomy waste
            Some strange, sad voice I hear.
            Some voice from out the shadowed Past;
            And one I call Regret,
            And one I know is Misspent Hours,
            Whose memory lingers yet.
            Then Failure speaks in bitter tones,
            And Grief, with all its woes;
            Remorse, whose deep and cruel stings
            My painful thoughts disclose.
            Thus do these voices speak to me,
            And flit like shadows past;
            My spirit falters in despair,
            And tears flow thick and fast.
            But when, within the wide domain
            Of Future Day and Year
            I stand, and o'er its sunlit Plain
            A sweeter Voice I hear,
            Which bids me leave the darkened Past
            And crush its memory,–
            I'll listen gladly, and obey
            The Voice of Opportunity.

MY DEAR SISTERS,
CLARA AND PRISCILLA,
IN MEMORY OF TRUE AND TENDER AFFECTION,
AND IN TESTIMONY OF
INCREASING LOVE AND GRATITUDE,
THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED
BY
THE AUTHOR.
INVOCATION
     Oh gracious Master, just and true,
With all Thy wondrous plans,
     Lead us, a trodden nation, through
This dark and stormy land!
Thou who didst hear our father's cry,
     Midst suffering pain and woe,
Who dried the tear drops from their eye,
     Can guide us as we go.
Let not our hearts with trouble wake,
     And say there is no way,
The hour before the morning break,
     Gives little hope of day.
Oh let this be the darkest hour,
     Which vails the dawning light;
And let us trust Jehovah's power,
     Till daybreak fades the night.
NEW JERUSALEM.
Behold that New Jerusalem!
     Her streets are paved with gold;
Twelve stately gates, are set with pearls,
     And yet the half's not told.
Great walls of rich and precious stones,
     Surround that city fair;
Sweet music from that heavenly clime,
     Swells out upon the air.
Within those walls so beautiful,
     The heaven immortals dwell;
What peace and comfort they enjoy,
     No mortal tongue can tell.
The sun within those walls that shine,
     Is He who's glorifed;
Splendor and glory's all combine,
     In Him for nations died.
And all those gates of pearl and gold,
     Forever stand ajar;
To welcome strangers passing by,
     Where nothing can debar.
There shall my weary soul find rest,
     Where blissful joys abound;
Around His throne so pure and blest,
     I'll lay my trophies down.
OUR GIRLS.
A song to the damsels, our Ethiope maids!
          Her crisp curly locks, in beauty arrayed.
Her voice is so gentle, so tender so true;
     Her smiles glow like sun-beams;
          Her eyes spark like dew.
Her teeth shine like pearls, her laughter the while,
     Re-echoes with music, like waves on the Nile;
Her steps are so gentle, kindhearted is she;
     The Ethiope maid, is the damsel for me.
No paints and no powder, bedecks her sweet face
     Her beauty is nature, the rarest of grace.
The oils and pomatums, ne'er touches her hair;
     Those curled raven locks, by nature are there.
Before ev'ry nation, exultant we'll sing;
Arrayed in her beauty, our maids we will bring.
A BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE.
Walking through life's tranquil journey,
     Flowers blooming 'neath her feet—
She has reached each year a milestone,
     Stationed on life's highway street.
On and on, old time hath led her,
     Through the night, and through the day—
In her childhood's joy, and sorrow,
     As the milestones pass away.
On each one her name is written,
     And life's journey briefly told—
Of her infancy and childhood,
     Written in the purest gold.
And her cup with many a blessing,
     Has been filled, from year to year;
She's been blest, with friends and kindreds,
     And a loving father's care.
And a sympathetic mother,
     Who has loved so dear since birth;
Sharing all her pains and sorrows,
     Sharing all her joys and mirth.
She has reached the twentieth milestone,
     'Long her blooming path of life,
She has grown a handsome lady,
     Soon she'll face a nobler strife.
And we've met to pay her homage,
     Friends and kindreds all around-
'Tis our debt that we should wish her,
     All the joys that can be found.
May life's journey in the future,
     Be more radiant than the past—
And the purest light from heaven,
     In her pathway e'er be cast.
BEYOND THE RIVER.
Just beyond the brimming river,
     Just beyond the flowing tide,
I have thoughts within me ever,
     Of rare scenes on yonder side.
Days and months and years are fleeting;
     Still that stream is passing on;
Pilgrims, saints, and angels greeting,
Those who just have past beyond.
We are journeying to that river;
     Some have reached the flowing tide;
Some have crossed to turn no never;
     From the scenes on yonder side.
Some have scarce begun their journey;
     Some have trudged it faint and slow;
Some have reached the topmost mountain,
Looking on the vale below,
They can see the brimming river;
     How divide her banks between,
Where the parting friends doth sever,
     Ford the tide to realms unseen.
I have dearest friends who've left me,
     And have crossed that whelming flood;
Left their all, their earthly duty,
     And have gone to meet their God,
Where 'tis said, the sun shines ever;
     And the trees forever green;
Where there's grief and parting never,
     Oh! that Beulah land unseen.
When I've trod life's dreary highway,
     Footsore, weary, lame and slow,
When I've climbed the mountain's summit,
     When I've reached the vale below,
May I cross that brimming river,
     Fearless of its mighty flood;
Leave my earthly cares forever,
     Cross with Joy to meet my God.
OUR NATIONAL FLAG.
Noble flag, in triumph flowing,
     O'er this land where now we be,
With thy glorious colors showing,
     Flag of truth, I'll sing of thee.
Many a year you've shone your splendor,
     Stationed on the highest towers;
Where the sounds of music tender,
     Mounts the breeze through leafy bowers.
Thou hast shone thy might and duty,
     In the present and the past;
Thou hast faced the storm with beauty,
     Faced the tempest's furious blast.
Oft before the deadly cannon,
     Fell brave soldiers mangled, slain,
Floating steadfast in thy mammon,
     Floated at old Lundy's lane.
While amidst the rush, the hurry,
     Midst the musketry sublime,
Lark shrill notes the fife rang merry;
     With a zeal you've beat the time.
Many a noble gallant warrior,
     Robed in red, the white, the blue,
In their tomb, awaits the morrow;
     'Neath the cold and chilling dew.
Now when blissful peace and pleasure,
     On our land and on our seas,
Still with stars and stripes keep measure,
     Floating on the balmy breeze.
Dearest flag, a debt, a duty,
     All this nation owes to thee;
As you flow with pride and beauty,
     With thy colors fair to see.
With our arms, we will protect thee;
     And our tongues shall speak thee true;
Flag of truth, most noble emblem;
     Decked with red, the white, the blue.
MY COUNTRY HOME.
Near the highway in a valley.
     Where sweet rose and poppies bloom,
Where cool shade and breezes rally,
     Stands my happy country home.
On her walls antique and rustic,
     Clings the vernal leafy vines;
In the yard so calm majestic,
     Grows the lovely columbines.
Orchard trees in vernal splendor,
     Shades the grassy carpet green,
And the song birds sing so tender;
     Hidden by the leafy screen.
Calm and peaceful stands the dwelling,
     While great beauty round I see,
And my thoughts with rapture swelling,
     Dawns a trodden path to me.
Dawns a path of thorns and roses;
     Dawns a path of joy and gloom;
Dawns the hour, o'er friends most dearest,
     Wept I at their burial tomb.
I reflect upon my childhood,
     Round this cottage I did play;
When far in the beechea wild-wood,
     Gathered I sweet flowers of May.
And I plucked the precious jewels,
     While this wood land I did roam,
Wove them into radiant garlands;
     Brought them to my country home.
Long may stand this little cottage,
     She hath harbored me since birth;
Though the hue fades in her dotage,
     'Tis my dearest home on earth.
EMANCIPATION.
Three cheers! well may we shout with joy,
     And hail Emancipaton;
Our fetters long have been destroyed:
     We are a free, free, nation.
No more like cattle on the hills,
     That feed upon the clover;
Shall wait our brethern for their doom,
     Unable to discover.
No more upon our brother's track,
     We'll hear the blood-hounds baying;
The cries of men to bring him back,
     With curse and evil sayings.
No more our maidens bought and sold,
     The southorn tyrant's booty;
No more the brutal trader's gold,
     Shall buy the sable beauty.
No more our brave and gallant youths,
     Shall tremble of the morrow;
Behold, sweet liberty and truth,
     Hath broke the chains of sorrow.
For now we stand on freedom's plain,
     With joy and exultation:
Though scarred and maimed,
     From bondage chain,
     We'll hail Emancipation.
Three cheers! we'll shout our liberty:
     Long may our nation live,
Large, large, may grow her fruitful tree,
     And sweetest manna give.
THE DREARY DAY.
The clouds creep low, the day is dark;
     The wind howls sad and drear;
The rain desends with glittering spark;
     No cheerful sunlight near.
The orchard trees, their leaves all drenched,
     Bends low their vernal crown;
The furtile soil her thirst have quenched,
     But still the rain comes down.
Oh dreary day!filled to the brim,
     The brooklet struggles on;
The mist, the fog, so dark, so dim;
     Oh! where is sunlight gone?
That glittering orb, once lit the land,
     With splendor, bright and clear;
Through stormy clouds his light grows wan;
     Have nature lost her cheer?
Deep in my melancholy breast,
     There comes a tranquil voice;
A gentle murmur pure and blest,
     Which bids my soul rejoice.
The fair muse caught the cheering phrase,
     Which sounds like vesper chimes;
Her pen retraced a fiery blaze,
     In feet of rhythmic rhymes.
I read, and in my weary soul,
     The sun shone in again;
No more life's gloom about me roll,
     Though tall the dreary rain.
MY QUEEN.
Queen of my heart, of thee I am thinking;
Thinking, of thee through life's dreary dream;
Bright in my thoughts as the stars that are twinkling,
Shines thy fair image so calm and serene.
All day I have roamed through wood-land and meadow,
Seeking the beauty of nature's sweet flowers;
In the calm noon tide,reposed in the shadow
But ne'er found such beauty, among the green bowers.
Queen of my heart, for thee I am longing;
Longing to view thy beauty and grace;
Rare is thy beauty, to thee e'er belonging;
Sweet are the smiles on thy dear, winsome, face.
Love is divine;with love I adore thee;
Fair,sable damsel, to thee I'll be true;
As thy companion,for e'er I'd be happy;
Thou gem of my casket that sparkles like dew.
THE CHIMING BELLS.
Ho! watchman, from yon belfry tower,
     Ring out those bells to me!
And let my fancies catch the power,
     That steals upon my soul each hour,
While chimes their melody.
I love to hear those chiming bells:
     To me, their music clear,
Time after time, strange stories tell,
     And oft they ring the parting knell,
Of friends and kinsmen dear.
And oft when at the alter stood,
     The modest bride, the groom,
Sweet echoes filled the vernal wood;
     Where giant oak and elm trees stood,
While zephers shook their plumes.
I love their sweet melodious chime,
     It wakes my sleeping soul;
They bear good news from heavenly clime.
     It cheers the heart, uplifts the mind,
When e'er those bells doth toll.
I love to hear their medley sound,
     Swell on the sabbath morn:
Their music from yon tower, sinks down,
     Into my heart with joy profound,
And banish cares forlorn.
Oftimes in peace and quiet bliss,
     The raptured music falls,
My soul craves for the parting kiss,
     And yearns to break that vale of mist,
Which binds her like a thrall,
They swell with music sweet and clear,
     Upon each mortal's breast;
Our doom advances near and near,
     Those bells shall ring year after year,
When we are laid to rest.
Ho! watchman, ring those bells to me!
     And let their music fall,
With chime and glee, o'er land, o'er sea,
     In blissful peace to all.
THE CHAIN OF BONDAGE.
Arise! arise! my fellow-men,
Arise, with might and main;
     Arise, with intellectual din,
And cast aside your chains!
For, like a web around us bound,
This chain hath long entwined;
     It brought a mighty nation down,
And humbled low their minds.
How oft we're quelled when 'tempt to rise,
     By envy and disdain;
And ofttimes wipe our tearful eyes,
And try no more our chains.
Oh! tear them loose in union's strength!
We'll not be trampled down;
     We'll reach the promise land at length,
Behold the Ethiope's crown!
LEAD ME.
Lead me, oh my blessed Redeemer!
     Ere my feet shall walk astray;
Through this world of dire temptation,
     Lead me on the heavenly way!
Lead me, though my steps should faulter,
     As I journey through this land;
When I meet with worldy conflicts,
     Grasp me tighter by the hand.
On the verge of earth's temptation,
     When my strength is almost gone,
Haste before I fall, dear Savior,
     Grasp my hand and lead me on!
In my earthly joys and sorrow,
     Let me not forget the way!
For too soon may dawn the morrow,
     Should my steps be lead astray.
THE BUTTERFLY.
The butterfly with gorgeous hue,
     Flits noiseless through the summer air
He sips the honey from the dew,
     And from the wild flowers fair.
Thus day by day,he soars abroad,
     O'er wood-land, hill and dale;
And e'er his restless flight affords,
     Sweet blossoms to regale.
From east to west, from north to south,
     He takes his aerial flight;
Ne'er 'till the summer sun is set,
     He shelters for the night.
And at the rising of the sun,
     When birds begin to sing,
He sallies from his hiding place,
     To dry his moisted wings.
He soars abroad, his wings now dry,
     His beauty still remains;
Now slow, and now with speed he flies;
     His days are all the same.
I'd envy him of hue and flight,
     But seeing his abode,
I learned that life in public sight,
     Is not what private showed.
And when declining days did come,
     He lost his tint of hue;
And trembling in his humble home,
     Did perish in the dew.
THE ONE I KNOW.
There's a gentle voice like music;
     From a being kind and true;
There's a smile like glowing sunbeams,
     Sparkling on the summer dew.
There's a footstep calm and gentle;
     Lighter than a faries'tread;
Two bright eyes, of jet black beauty;
     Ebon locks bebecks her head,
Tiny hands so small but useful;
     Busy all the livelong day;
Toiling in her joys and sorrows,
     Toiling on a pilgrim way.
Ebon face bedecked with beauty;
     Form most graceful to behold;
Not one tith would be her value,
     Should I give my weight in gold.
THE SAME OLD SUN.
The same old sun is shining,
     That shone in Bethlehem;
That dawned upon the morning,
     When Christ our Saviour came.
His splendor is no brighter,
     His rays are spread the same, to
As spread with gold on the streets of old,
     Where He healed the deaf and lame.
The same old sun is shining,
     That shone on Galilee;
When He called two angling brothers,
     And said, "Lo, follow me."
While down that dusty highway,
     The same old blazing sun;
Shone downupon my Saviour's brow,
     And on Capernaum.
And at the Jordan river,
     This sun shone bright and free,
When He to John, who stood amazed,
     Said, "Suffer it to be."
Through the land of old Judea,
     Through neighboring cities round,
Where e'er there went our Saviour,
     The same old sun shone down.
The same old sun was shining,
     When He 'fore Pilate stood:
Where sat the false accusers,
     Who yearned to shed His blood.
As they hailed Him king with scoffing,
     Robed Him with purple gown,
The radiant light of the golden sun,
     In silence glittered down.
And on the road to Calvary,
     With thorn wreath on His brow,
The same old sun was shining down,
     That shines upon us now.
But when upon that fatal cross,
     When the pang of death passed through,
Vile earthquakes, shook this sinful earth,
     This sun was hid from view.
And round His tomb upon that morn,
     When weeping Mary came,
The sun renewed his brilliant light,
     That glittering orb of flame.
And when an angel rolled the stone,
     And to that mother said,
     "He've rose, He's gone to Galilee;
     Come, see where He hath layed."
Behold, with glittering beams of gold,
     This sun gleamed round Him then,
"All power is mine, "He bravely told,
     "Go! preach my word to men.”
Still shines the same old blazing sun,
     He runs his course each day;
While nations perish one by one,
     He shines upon their clay.
THE SUMMER NIGHT.
Balmy are the breezes blowing,
     Low the sun sinks in the west;
Cattle far and near are lowing,
     Homeward, seeks the plowman rest.
Flowers that shone in gorgeous beauty,
     'Neath the summer, shining sun,
Droop their heads repose with nature,
     Close their petals one by one.
While the lark and feathered songsters,
     Shelters in their leaty nest,
Gaze upon the fading twilight,
     Gaze upon the golden west.
And when sleep the weary sogsters,
When through dream-land, takes their flight,
     All the air is filled with beings,
Borne upon the wings of night.
Fire-flies with enchanted lanterns,
     Through the darkened gloom they come;
Close behind pursues the beetle,
     With a steadfast noisy hum.
And the screech-owl's cry re-echoes,
     Through the moor-land, through the swamp;
Through the forest and the fallow,
Boldly doth the wild-fox tramp.
Far among the stars an echo,
     Borne upon the zephyrs still,
Falls into my ear so faintly,
'Tis the notes of whip-poor-wills.
While the ponderous orbs in heaven,
     Twinkles with a silvery light,
And the air, all filled with calmness,
     Welcome, be ye summer night!
I AM GLAD.
I am glad that I drank at the Fountain;
     From its waters I found a relief:
And that stream from Calvary's mountain,
     Have healed my affliction and grief.
How I thirst when I roamed o'er the desert,
     And viewed the oasis before:
I journeyed through heat and through sand-storm,
And oft for sweet waters deplored.
But at length I arrived at the Fountain,
     Though footsore and blind from the sand;
Blessed stream of Calvary's mountain,
     O'er the banks of the channel it ran.
I drank of it's life healing waters,
     With a sparkle like pearl it did gleam,
My thirst was there quenched, and rejoicing,
     I bathed in that life's given stream.
THE OAK TREE.
By the river that is flowing,
     Towards the ocean's tide,
Stands an oak tree, tall, gigantic,
     Branches spreading wide. 
And his form so tall and stately,
     Brace the cool spring breeze,
With his crown so bright and vernal,
     King of all the trees.
Grayhaired men, now old and palsied,
     Once in childhood played,
'Neath this oak tree by the river,
     Where the acorns layed.
Through the wear of many a summer,
     Wax childhood to man,
Same in valorous strength and beauty,
     Still the oak tree stands.
And his leaves hath yield to autumn,
     Many a century year,
When the red men roved the forest,
     Chased the panting deer.
Oft there floated down the river,
     In his snug canoe,
Indian youth with bow and quiver;
     Here, the wild birds flew.
And the fox with tearless footsteps,
     Roamed the forest here,
Deer and fawn, beneath the moon-light,
     Grazed with little fear.
All alone the oak tree standeth,
     Now the forest's gone,
Ne'er the scenes of wood-land nature,
     Left to look upon.
Birds migrated, flowers created,
     Red men came and gone;
Time hath like the flowing river,
     Drift to parts unknown
Still he holds his youthful beauty,
     Wears his broad,green crown;
As a landmark he's now standing,
     Known for miles around.
THE FORESIGHT.
Behold, the time advances,
     It's nearing day by day;
And I view a gleam of sunlight,
     Through a mist and stormy way.
The hour is fast approaching,
     As the Book of Truth records,
When the hand of Ethiopia,
     Shall weal her trusty sword.
Not with stern and brutal sovereign,
     Not with blood-stained hands of might,
But in freedom's name she'll govern,
     With justice, truth, and right.
Though Caucasia's tongues deride us,
     In their 'tempt to make us fall,
But God who loves His children,
     Looks upon us, one and all.
And through His precious promise,
     Like a dark and misty vail,
Behold, a ship comes sailing,
     With rainbow-tinted sails.
The pilot at his rudder,
     With cold and bleeding hands,
Long stood with fear and trembling,
     While lost upon the strand.
And oft he lowers the anchor,
     At night fall on the deep,
Or when the storms are raging.
     His trusty vigils keep;
Through the darkest fog before him,
     Which vails the light before,
He stands the howling tempest,
     And looks for yonder shore.
Across the stormy waters,
     Though the winds come down with might,
Ere long the pilot on that ship,
     Shall see a gleaming light.
The dawn of day advances,
     ‘Twill calm the rolling sea,
Like the Hand that calmed the tempest,
     On the lake of Galilee.
I view her in my vision,
     Her shipmates and her crew,
With trusty hopes are waiting,
     To anchor at yon view.
Though many a gallant shipmate,
     Who were drowned in the dreadful deep,
Lay buried 'neath the waters;
     In their aqueous graves they sleep.
I see one brave old sailor,
     Who has climbed the topmost mast,
And he shouts with loud, Hosanna,
     At the scenes before him cast.
She's heading for yon harbor,
     Her sails are now unfurled,
Though drenched, and shaken by the winds,
     Her splendor awes the world.
Their dawns another vision,
     And the Muses bid me write,
I see her in the harbor,
     Her sails are sparkling bright.
I see Queen Ethiopia,
     Before all nations stand,
She is robed in royal purple,
     And a seal is in her hand.
As she lifts her hand, with jewels,
     To take the solemn vow,
Kings, prince, and nobles, hail her,
     All nations 'fore her bow.
THE SHINING STAR.
Shine on, bright stars with sparkling light!
     Shine in yon heavenly dome,
Illume the skies, with splendor bright,
     In my celestial home!
Ye sparkling gems,of sapphire hue,
     That stud the skies afar,
All glowing like the summer's dew,
     Shine on,ye faithful stars!
Shine on, for as I view the sight,
     Thy bright gleam cast before,
My weary soul yearns for that Light,
     Which shines from heaven's bright shore.
It is a bright, and glorious star,
     Whose splendor o'er us fall,
My soul perceives it from afar,
     His light illumes them all.
It gives the color to the flowers,
     Whose odor sweet doth yield:
Provides with nourishment each hour,
     The lilies of the field.
And weary travelers 'neath this Light,
     Day after day are led;
Their blinded eyes receive new sight,
     Their hungry souls, are fed.
Then spread abroad thy glorious light,
     With rarest blessings stored!
Illume my weary soul by night,
     With peace and sweet accord!
THE FEAST.
Come, the feast is spread and waiting,
     'Tis a message from the King;
Come, and thus partake ye needy,
     Come, and all your friends do bring!
'Tis a feast where all's invited,
     Rich and poor, the great, the small,
And the traveler lone, benighted,
     And the bearer of the pall.
Come, ye blind ones, lepers crawling,
     Come, ye halt, and come, ye lame!
For the message still is calling,
     Dine into the halls of fame!
Come and dine, for great the table,
     Many the vacant places still;
Throngs the rich, the poor, disabled,"
     Yet the Master's hall's not filled.
THE SONG BIRD.
There's a music sweet and low,
     From a song-bird in the west;
And the sweet notes gently flow,
     From her little, leafy nest.
'Tis a song I've often heard,
     But I cannot catch the words,
While the cadence sweetly echoes pure and blest.
When the sun sinks in the west,
     At the closing of the day,
And the golden beams aglow,
     I can hear her, far away;
I can hear her warble sweet,
     I can catch each note complete,
While I listen to that sweet and gentle lay.
Oft in melancholy mood,
     Blindly I the future brood,
O'er some destination hidden from my view,
     Oft my heart is cheered like spring,
When her warble sweetly ring,
Through the haze of íading twilight and the dew.
There's a sweeter music still,
     From a song-bird 'mong the hills,
In a quiet country dwelling far away;
     And her music thrilled with love,
Calm and gentle as a dove,
Lingering ever in my memory day by day.
'Tis a sable damsel fair,
     Jet black curled, her raven hair,
And her beauty never changing stays the same.
And her winsome, dusky face,
     Marks her with divinest grace,
     She's my sweet-heart;
But I will not tell her name.
SCENES OF LIFE.
As fade the evening twilight,
     Far in yon gleaming west,
And the plowman, and the reaper,
     Homeward-bound, to seek their rest,
Fades my childhood days, and fancies,
     Fades the vision of a child,
Fades the fairy tales and fictions,
     Once my childish thought beguiled.
Midst rare scenes of vanished fancies,
     Still remains in memory bright,
There are visions which enhances,
     Still to me a childish light.
Oft they shine o'er man's dominion,
     One brief instant then are tlown,
Like the condor on his pinions,
     Mounts to summits scarcely known.
Soon the youthful might and valor,
     Of this form shall lose its sway,
Soon these eyes shall faintly glimmer,
     And this head be bent and gray.
Still among time's vast procession,
     March the multitude so brave,
Page, and sage of mark profession,
     Seeking but the solemn grave.
Day by day in this procession,
     I am pressing towards the van,
While the fading days of childhood,
     Change my youthful form to man.
So I'm pressed from man's dominion,
     Through the scenes of joy and gloom,
Till I mount death's direful pinions,
     Aged infirmed, a silent tomb.
FAREWELL TO SUMMER.
Farewell to the summer,
     Behold, she hath fled;
Her bright vernal foliage,
     Are faded and dead;
The hot, golden, sunbeams,
     Shine brisk through the trees;
The leaves on their pinions,
     Ascends on the breeze.
Farewell to the summer,
     For autumn is here,
The skies they are cloudy,
     The days dark and drear;
Wild winds like a deluge,
     Through fields shall desend,
The trees of their beauty,
     Must yield to the wind.
Farewell to the summer,
     The birds that are known,
For music and beauty,
Behold they have flown;
The caw of the crow, and the cry of the jay,
     Resounds through the wood-land,
          And fields far away.
     Farewell to the summer,
          Sad, sad, my refrain,
     Her beauty and splendor,
          Shall fade 'neath the rain;
All cloudy and dreary our days soon shall be,
     And the east winds shall howl,
     O'er meadow and lea.
     Farewell to the summer, 'tis sad to depart,
          All thy charms they have vanished,
               Thy beauty and art;
     The vines have grown crimson,
          On walls over head,
     Sweet odorous blossoms, are faded, and dead.
     Farewell to the summer, long'fore thy return
          Sad hearts, shall await thee,
     For thee, they shall yearn;
          They shall honor thy beauty,
     Of days long ago, and welcome thy coming,
     Through the frost and the snow.
THE TRAVELER'S DREAM.
In the calm of the noontide, and silent the day,
     A traveler sat down for to rest;
He bore in his hand a plat of the way,
     A rout seemed easy and best.
Full of zeal and of valor, this traveler had come,
     Through lands that were rugged and steep;
Midst music of birds, and the wildbee's hum,
Midst fragrance, that rose from the radiant blooms,
     Through brooklets that flowed to the deep.
Whlie footsore and weary, as he rest'neath the shade.
     His eyelids soon shut in repose;
In his vision and dream he saw a fair maid,
     Midst wreathes of blossoms and rose.
The eyes of the sleeper beheld in that dream;
     With marvel he looked on the sight,
Her raiments, their sheen were purple an green,
     And her jewels like stars of the night.
She drew near the stranger,
     She stretched forth her hand,
And thus did the traveler behold,
A plat with its highways, that led to a land,
That land was a city of gold.
But its route was so rugged, the hills were so steep,
And the highways were dreary, forlorn;
     There were tombs of travelers,
     In death they did sleep,
There were vines and brambles and thorns.
     Fair damsel, he said to the beautiful maid,
Though my travels've been rugged and steep,
     Yet my path have been laid, with flowers and with shade,
Their odor and fragrance most sweet.
The end of my journey though my eyes can't behold,
Yet I fain could observe from aíar,
Should I look in yon future, a city of gold
With splendor as bright as a star.
Arise, said the damsel, and journey with me;
     And soon on your path way we'll find,
That the fruits of thy toil through sunshine and shade,
     Leads not to a fate so sublime.
He seized her fair hand so they sped through the land:
     Cross plain, through valley and glen,
And soon in his dream, by a chasm did stand,
     Beheld there his fate and the end.
He viewed from the brink as he paused with the maid,
     Horrid sights, as he gasped for his breath,
In that grim dreary depth through darkness and shade,
He beheld an angel of death.
His wings were outspread and he soared o'er the dead,
Where travelers, benighted had feil,
And the bones on the waste,
     Of that vail thick were spread,
And the grim sights were startling to tell.
The traveler was frightened;
     He groped for her hand to retrace o'er the route she had lead,
All trembling and weary alone did he stand
     He awoke, but the damsel had fled.
CALLING.
I have heard dear friends, a Saviour,
     Calling, calling, day by day;
Night and morning, noon and evening,
     Never ceasing, calls away.
When with mirth among my comrades,
     I do frolic and rejoice,
When I pause awhile at leisure,
     I can hear my-Saviour's voice.
I can hear my Saviour calling,
     In the tranquil hours of night;
When the morn and silent noontide,
     Wakes the sun with golden light.
Heard His voice through earthly struggles,
     As I've shed a parting tear,
O'er dear friends, who've gone before me,
     As each moment fleets the year.
Though the din of earthly tumult, 
     Loud into my ears doth fall,
Still I hear my Saviour's pleading,
     Hark! I hear His loving call.
Shall I turn away unheeding,
     Slight His promise so secure,
While I hear my Saviour pleading,
     Pointing 'cross to Jordan's shore?
FLEETING TIME.
Time is fleeting, time is fleeting,
     Swiftly doth each moment fly
Scarcely dawns the morn till even;
     Short we live till we must die.
Time is fleeting, time is fleeting,
     As the waters seek the sea,
So down life's stream we are drifted,
     Till we reach eternity.
Time is fleeting, time is fleeting,
     Let not follies lure us on,
And we waste cur time with trifles,
     Till the bloom of lite is gone.
Then with feeble steps and pilsied,
     Down life's stream with empty hands,
Leaves no honor, leaves no title,
     Print no footsteps in the sand.
Let us estimate its value,
     While we through life's journey go,
Let us gather in our harvest,
     Ere the winter comes with snow.
DEATH OF ABSALOM
Throughout the courts and palace halls,
     Resounds a mighty warrior's call;
The notes from out his trumpet horn,
     Reechoes on the early morn;
Enchanted by its warlike sound,
     His gallant charger paws the ground,
And champs his bit with rage.
All, summoned by bold Joab's call,
     Ten thousand soldiers, large and tall,
And archers with their bows in hand,
     Did form in line at his command.
Out through the swinging palace gates,
March valorous men with spears and plates,
And war-steeds robed in trappings gay,
     Canters and prance; their piercing neigh,
Commingles with the warrior's lay,
In one harmonious sound.
While through the swinging gates they go,
     Footmen, with battle-ax and bow,
War-chariots bearing gallant knights,
Went up against the Israelites.
King David stood beside the gate,
     His trouble was a ponderous weight,
And while he breathes a silent prayer,
     His eyes the sign of weeping wear;
To passing captains one by one,
     He says, "deal gently with my son."
So Joab and his men of might,
     Arrayed their armies for the fight;
With spear and battle-ax they stood,
     Among the oaks of Ephriam's wood.
The traitorous Israelites came down,
     Upon King David's host;
Amidst defying trumpet sound,
     Throughout the wood, and waste around,
Fell men by thousands, lost
The clashing of the sword and shield,
     Through Ephriam's wood resound;
Brave soldiers fell upon that field,
     And trampled by the horses'heel,
Lay prostrate on the ground.
War-steeds, blood-stained and riderless,
Down through the ranks, with fright did press,
     Their eyes like fire, flashed left and right,
While captains urged their men to fight.
     And long before the set of sun,
A noble victory was won.
The blast of Joab's trumpet loud,
     Subdued the tumult of the crowd,
Brave warriors in their triumph came
     With broken sabers; men of fame,
With gory ax and broken shield,
     Returned victorious from that field.
Out through the land the tidings spread.
     How Israel's traitorous host had fled;
How valorous men were overcome,
     The death of willful Absalom.
Upto the chamber o'er the gate,
     With breaking heart from troubles great,
He rose, and weeping as he went,
     In dire distress, his sad form bent,
His troubled soul most overcome,
     Cried, Absalom! Oh, Absalom!
Rebellious in thy youthful pride,
     Oh, that for thee, I could have died!
ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE.
On either side of the river's bank,
Sweet nature hath waken the bloom;
And the vernal trees, and the grasses rank,
Subdue drear winter's gloom.
As thunders along the turbulent tide,
To the end of her flow in the sea;
How little she know, that her channel divides,
The land of the slave and the free,
The bondman ne'er ceased from his toil in the corn,
He sang, yet the strains were not glee;
To the twilight of eve, from the dawn of the morn,
He had gazed on the land of the free,
Long, long, had he toiled on the southern shore,
And gazed on that flowing tide;
And ofttimes grim thraldom he sadly deplored,
As he looked on the northern side.
But the rigorous law, and the river's flow,
Defied him to venture the tide,
For the hands of the spoiler, had threatened the blow.
Should a bondman fail to abide.
No hopes for his freedom, his head decked with gray,
Is bowed low with trouble and grief;
And his heart throbs with sighs,
As he longs for the day,
When death shall bring his relief.
BE READY.
Have your windows open, and your lamps trimmed and bright;
Put on the gospel armor of the purest white;
Keep the pickets at their duty,
In the highest towers and domes,
And be ye therefore ready;when the Bridegroom comes!
Have your windows open, and your lamps trimmed and bright;
For soon the day shall vanish;
And then dawns dreary night;
When the tempter prowls through darkness,
As a wild beast from its lair,
Where the watchman's light is gleaming,
He can never harm us there.
Have your windows open, and your la mps trimmed and bright;
Behold! the Bridegroom cometh,
His raiments pure and white;
He hath bid you to the table,
For the feast hath long been spread
So be ye therefore ready, to eat that living bread!
THE TEMPEST.
We have ofttimes heard in our childhood,
While perched on some old settler's knee,
Fanciful tales of the forest;
     And tales of the briny sea.
How the hunter that trudged through the wood-land,
Returned when the sun's gleam was low,
Of drear battle-fields 'neath the moon light
Where fell the friend and the foe
The tales of the sea, they were many;
Of her sailors, her ebb and her flow,
Of the many ships lost in the tempest,
In the days of the far long ago.
Among the tales that were startling,
Time upon time to me told,
There is one of a most dreadful tempest;
That rages o'er mortal man's soul.
It dawns with sin's tempting pleasure
In the morn, when the soul first awakes;
And thunderous clouds, thickly gather,
While storms on the weary soul breaks.
The bulwark of life which surrounds it,
'Neath torrents of torture and gall,
'Neath storm-winds of direst temptations,
To oft they are shaken, they fall.
While thicker and dark, grows the tempest,
As the day advances we're told,
The fierce, dreadful winds of temptation,
In torrents they charge on the soul.
The deluge of sin's reenforcements,
With scepter, and missel, and dart,
Joins in with the host of marauders;
In destruction they seek for the heart.
The soldiers grow baffled and weary,
While stifling smoke shadows the air,
The wounded among them are many;
The dying ones groan in despair.
Ere long, when hopes were most vanished,
A cry, but not in despair,
Comes forth from a new reenforcement;
With shouts of defiance, a prayer.
The baffled ones gather about them,
To banish their fear and their dread;
Forthwith to the rampart they follow
The bearer's cross 'bove their heads.
Away flies the evil pursuers,
From the sight of that standard 'tis told,
The thick clouds of gloom and of darkness,
Fall back from their charge on the soul.
LIFE'S PROCESSION.
They are passing, one by one;
Morning, noon, at set of sun;
When the dawn awakes the day,
When the noontide shadows play;
Fleeting, like the morning dew,
'Neath the golden sunlight's hue,
In the race of life they run;
They are passing, one by one.
They are passing, one by one;
Morning, noon, at set of sun;
Through the sunshine and the shade,
Pass the matron and the maid;
Through the vale of death they go,
Through the gloom of bitter woe,
In the race of life they run;
They are passing, one by one.
They are passing, one by one;
Morning, noon, at set of sun;
Men of wisdom, might, and fame,
Princes, paupers, kings the same;
All, must meet that solemn fate,
All, must pass death's chilling gate
When life's toilsome race is run,
They are passing, one by one.
THE LOCK OF HAIR.
I have in my casket a jewel,
More precious, than rubies or pearl;
'Tis only a little blue ribbon,
United, and wove with a curl.
'Tis the curl of an Ethiope damsel,
Tinted with deep midnight hue;
A gloss adds fourfold to its beauty,
With a glittering sparkle like dew.
Her tiny black hands plucked this treasure,
From the mass of jet curls on her head,
And they wove in the little blue ribbon;
As a token of fondness, she said.
Her sweet smiles, they haunt me forever,
That curl, and the ribbon of blue,
They ne'er from my casket shall sever;
For I hold them as tokens most true.
FRIENDSHIP'S PARTING.
Ofttimes when friend from friend depart,
A new, sweet fondness touch the heart.
     A feeling so sublime.
'Tis but the shaft from cubid's bow,
Which starts love's crimson blood to flow,
     So ends my simple rhyme.
THE NEW YEAR.
Dying, dying, yes he's dying,
Hark! his friends doth crowd around;
See them! lo, they all are crying;
Soon his son shall wear the crown.
Tired and weary are the watchers,
They have watched since early dawn;
Strike the clocks, one hour of midnight,
Soon will dawn the new year's morn.
Slow the clock ticks on the mantle,
Silent gleams the grate's red light,
Bring him water, he is dying;
Soon the soul will take its flight.
Raise him from his couch, he's sinking!
Bind a wet cloth round his head;
Glared and dazed, his eyes cease blinking,
Hark! the old year he is dead.
Bring the shroud, the pall, the bearer!
Death hath rent the parting tear,
Slow and solemn comes the carrier,
Comes the son,the new, new, year.
On his head, the crown of jewels,
That a thousand kings have worn;
Some too well we know were cruel,
Some were careworn and forlorn.
Mounts he on the monarch's station,
And he smiles with kingly cheer,
As he looks on every nation;
Hark! it is the new, new year.
Drink his health, and spread the table!
Welcome him with mirth and cheer!
Thanks to God, that we are able,
Thus to see another year.
GOLIATH AND DAVID.
Behold the champion of Gath,
     His height, six cubits and a span;
A valorous giant, stern with wrath,
     Defies of Israel, every man.
All glittering gleams his armor bright,
     Aglow doth shine his helmet crest;
Brass greaves encase his legs of might,
     A mammoth gorget shields his breast.
Into his giant hand he holds,
     A spear with staff like weaver's beam;
Oft Israel's host he 've jeered so bold,
     In bantering jest his armor gleams.
For forty days through Elah's vale,
     At dawn of morn, at fall of night,
His challenge with its hideous wail,
     Fell on Saul's host with deathly fright.
Thus spake Goliath, large and tall,
     "Are not ye servants of King Saul,
While I am but a Philistine,
     Why stand ye warriors there serene?
Send down a chosen man from thee,
     And let him come and fight with me!
     And should he overcome my might,
Then we will serve ye Israelites.
But should his strength before me fail,
     And o'er him should my strength prevail,
Then thou shalt bow before my host,
And yield thy nation to his lost;"
The men of Israel all gave way.
Beneath Goliath warlike call,
     Quoth he, "I do defy this day,
Ye men of Israel, one and all!"
Into the ranks that quaked with fear,
     There came a ruddy dauntless lad,
A shepherd's garment he did wear,
     A staff, and trusty sling he had;
The tumult broke on David's ear,
     Such boastful, scoffing, wrath;
His eyes beheld the ruffian there;
     That mighty man of Gath.
"Who is this giant Philistine,
     Upon yon slope doth trod,
Why should his shining armor's gleam,
     Defy the host of God?
I'm not afraid this man to fight,
     My God hath gave me grace;
I care not for his valorous might,
     I'll meet him face to face."
"I know thy pride, "brave Eliab said,
     Why camest thou down hither?
Go see that father's flocks be fed!
     Who keepeth them together?"
Again the shepherd spoke the words,
     That fell on one and all,
The captains of the armies heard,
     And brought the news to Saul.
"Go seek that lad, "upspoke King Saul,
     And bring him unto me;
Who says he'll fight Goliath tall;
     I fain his face to see.
Forthwith they brought the shepherd boy,
     Among the warriors frail,
And David said with boastful joy,
     "Of him, let no heart fail!"
Saul said, "thou art a ruddy boy,
     Thou uttereth haughty wrath,
With ease he can thy form destroy,
     This champion of Gath.
"Thy servant watched his father's sheep,
     Mid fields of Bethlehem,
Alion prowled the forest deep,
     And stole a precious lamb.
I over ran my fleeing foe,
     That robbed my father's fold,
I dealt on him a deadly blow,
     I slew him on the wold;
The Lord who led me forth that day,
     Among those fields of green,
Will give me might, and strength to slay,
     This giant Philistine."
The youth, in coat of mail, Saul armed,
     His armor bright did glow,
The awe struck captains round him swarmed,
     “The Lord be with you, go!"
"Thou hast borne this armor well, my King,
     Thou art a warrior tried,
Give back my shepherd staff and sling.
     I'll cast this coat aside.
For I am but a shepherd lad,
     This sword I dare not cling,
All combats were the Lord's I had,
     I'll meet him with my sling."
As David spake these words profound,
     He dashed the armor to the ground;
Decends the slope, his warlike yell,
     Upon the heathen's host did swell.
He reached the brook and stooping down,
     He chose five bolders, smooth and round;
And one into his sling did lay,
     Went forth, that man of Gath to slay;
Saul's army gave one feeble cheer,
     Goliath, dauntlessly drew near,
His armor bearers 'fore him run,
     His coat of mail reflects the sun.
Its massive weight, a ponderous load,
     He slowly came with stealth he trod,
And seeing David with his rod,
     He cursed him by his heathen Gods;
"Am I a dog, thou Israel slave
That thou shouldst come to me with staves?
Come unto me! thy flesh I'll tear,
To feed the beasts, and fowls of air,"
"Thou cometh mighty man of Gath,"
     The shepherd David said,
"With armor, shield, and greaves of brass,
     And helmet on thy head,
To meet an unarmed shepherd boy,
     To slay him with thy sword,
This day thou giant, I'll destroy;
     This battle is the Lord's.
Thou stands and chide in sullen scorn,
     With vengence, ire, and mirth,
From off thy giant trunk, this morn,
     Thy head, I'll cleave to earth;
And all thy captains and thy host,
     Who scoff my shepherd rod,
Shall mourn their gallant champion's lost;
     Of Israel, know their God."
These words the mighty champion heard,
     He paid but little heed;
Of Israel, not a man had stirred,
     On David haste with speed;
He plants his feet firm to the ground,
     He halts, he wheels his sling around,
The bolder fled with whizzing sound;
     It sunks deep in Goliath's head;
He groaned, he fell, his bearers fled.
Upon his baffled dying foe,
     The shepherd boy did tread,
And with the champion's sword, one blow,
     Struck off his mighty head;
The host of Israel mad with joy,
     'Rose with tumultuous shout,
They chased, they slaughtered and destroyed,
     They put their foes to rout.
Through vale, o'er hills, and slopes of green,
     Saul's army chased the Philistines;
Until through Ekron gates they went,
     Back Israel turned and spoiled their tents;
Now David with his captured prize,
     Turns to Jerusalem;
He bears the head of monstrous size;
     The people gaze with great suprise,
And hail the conqueror's name.
THE JOURNEY OF LIFE.
In our spring, the glorious sunlight,
     Spread his fulgent light abroad;
And her vernal grass, and roses,
     Decorates our pilgrim road.
Roses in their rarest beauty,
     Grasses of an evergreen,
They are placed on special duty
     In this land, by hands unseen.
From the spring, there dawns the summer;
     And fair roses full in bloom,
Soon begins in ceaseless number,
     Dropping petals, one by one.
So our youth doth wax to manhood,
     And the childish face hath fled,
Like the fading roses'petals,
     Fall among the grasses dead.
And as dawns the dreary autumn,
     With its ripened sheaves of grain,
And the sweeipng winds are tossing,
     Golden sheaves upon the plain,
Come man's autumn, short the warning,
     Bright hath shone the golden sun,
Day by day, his light grows dimmer;
     Soon life's journey will be done.
Scarcely dawns the fall, till winter,
     Comes with chilling hands so cold,
Garners in the ripened harvest;
     Brings the sheep into the fold.
So man's lot is like the harvest;
     Reaped and stored away on high,
Some like grain that never ripen;
     On the field are left to die.
GO YE UNTO EVERY NATION.
Go ye unto every nation,
     Go before the even tide,
Go with joy and consolation,
     Spread the gospel, far and wide!
Spread it far among the nation;
     Give it to rich and poor;
Leave it at the scoffer's station,
     Hang it on the heathen's door!
Hang the gospel on the highways,
     As a guide post there to lead;
Write with plain and simple letters,
     Though the footsman run, may read!
Go where sick, distressed, where dying;
     Go where wealth and pomp display;
Where the wounded lying, dying;
     Go before the close of day!
Go upon the dark deep ocean;
     Where the sailors tempest tossed;
Tell how Christ in deep devotion,
     Came to save the world, 't was lost!
Go where booms the deadly cannon,
     Where the musketry doth roar;
Where the wounded soldiers' lying,
     Fainting on the fields of gore!
Go within the walls of prison,
     Where the criminals are lead;
Go before the sun hath risen,
     Go before their hopes are fled!
Go until your steps shall falter,
     Go and seek the lost to save;
Till the shroud your mission alter,
     And you 're laid into the grave!
WORK.
Work, ye while the daylight shineth;
     Work, with all thy might and skill;
Work, and ne'er thy task declineth;
     Work, for 'tis our Master's will!
Work, for He hath set thy duty;
     Light the task, how canst thou shirk?
Work, to seek sweet heavenly beauty;
     Ere night cometh, man can't work!

INTRODUCTION.
In this little volume, entitled "Ethiope Lays," I have endeavored, as nearly as possible to picture the real side of my race bringing in the foreground, their patience, fortitude and forbearance, devoid of that undertone of sarcasm, generally courted. I hope that it will prove satisfactory to my readers.

TO THE NEW YEAR.
PRINCE NEW YEAR, welcome to thy throne.
   King Old Year is no more;
Since he hath bid the world adieu,
   The cumb'rous duty falls to you,
To rule his Kingdom o'er.
Capricious was thy reverend sire,
   Whilst on the throne he sate,
Sometimes he made me to rejoice
   With richest treasures of my choice,
And blessings truly great.
And then, again he bowed me low,
   With such a pond'rous load,
My heart within me sorely bled;
   And many were the tears I shed,
While groping long the road.
Again he suffered me to tread
   That milder path between;
Where neither leaped my pulses glad,
   Nor did my life blood slacken sad;
For quiet ruled supreme.
And yet, despite his fitful mood,
   Kind hath he been to me;
For every trial made me strong
   In battle, as I journeyed long,
To broader spheres and free.
A respite did his sunshine give,
   To rest my weary feet;
And what with shine, and what with shade,
   And wholesome mixture hath he made,
To make my life complete.
And now, that he hath passed away,
   Sad tears mine eyes bedew:
Oh, mayst thou be as true, fair Prince,
   And reign o'er us as nobly, since
His Kingdom falls to you.
THE OLD SAINT'S PRAYER.
WITHIN a dark and cheerless hut,
   Where haughty spurned to stray,
Where even sunshine paused not long,
An old saint knelt to pray.
Her ill-clad form was bent with age;
   Her crisp hair specked with snow;
Her eboned face was upward turned:
Her voice was deep and low.
Long had she worn her armor bright;
   Oft Satan's host defied;
Full sixty years she'd faced the brunt,
And still she was not tired.
Her faith was stronger than the winds,
   That rent lake Galilee;
She laid her crosses at His feet;
His blood, her only plea.
Before a living God she knelt;
   She felt His presence near;
She prayed with all her heart, this saint,
She knew her Lord would hear.
Her trammeled race, bowed to the dust,
   Beneath the tyrant's sword,
Abused and crossed on ev'ry side,
She laid before her Lord.
In earlier, gloomier, days than these—
   Those bitter days of old,
When children, plucked from breaking hearts,
Were hurried off and sold,
Had she not felt His kindly arm
   Embrace with father's care,
And bear her up, she knew not how,
From utter, dire, despair?
She knew on whom her hopes were built,
   To whom her wrongs to tell,
She felt a peace steal o'er her heart,
That told her, all were well.
And all is well, oh blessed saint,
   Thou lowly one divine!
God strikes the shackle from dim eyes
And bids the light to shine.
And now behold, yon eboned youth,
   Is nerved to face the fray,
And lead a weaker brother through,
Unto a brighter day.
Yon dusky maid, with dauntless zeal,
   Forced by a vague command,
Aspires to widen intellect,
As well as tutor hands.
Oh! many a noble, eboned youth,
   By that low uttered prayer,
Was made to feel a discontent—
That forced him from the rear.
And up the line of intellect,
   Was led by His strong hand,
'Til with his fair-faced brethren,
He faltering takes his stand.
Thou strong and mighty one in prayer,
   Thou heir to bliss on high —
Cease not thine ardent, heavenly chant,
Jehovah heeds thy cry.
Thou canst not live to see the day,
   When thy race shall be free,
To swell the volume of His choir,
The Lord hath need of thee.
But, when the last o'er-whelming foe,
   Before thy race, shall fall,
Methink thy thankful, heavenly chant,
Shall rise above them all.
THWARTED.
DOWN in the cabin all things were gay;
   Mammy and pappy were in the field,
So Rube and Charley and Sammy and Tray,
Were keeping house just as they pleased;
And it pleased each pickaninny, mischief bent,
To let riotous chaos, be their intent.
Old Tray is barking loud as he can,
   At Rube and Sammy, who pats and jigs,
To the music of Charley, who beats a pan,
And sings in a voice, that is boist'ous and big:
But just when the revel was truly begun,
Old uncle Sam entered and spoiled all the fun.
He raised not his voice in censure dire,
   Nor told how, "De Lawd wos a watching thah ways,"
But he sullenly took a seat by the fire,
And fell at once to conning the blaze;
While the children skulked under the bed with Tray,
Presuming, old uncle would soon go away.
But the fleeting time went on a pace,
   The children grew tired of their cramped retreat,
So Rube made a plot, with a crafty face,
And thought to bring back the fun complete;
"Good bye uncle Sam," he said with regret,
But the old fox made answer, "I ain't gone yet."
So he staid till the children weary grew.
   And meekly came out of their small retreat,
Chilled by the winds that through the chinks blew,
And quietly sought the hearth-stone heat;
Then he bids them adieu, just as mammy comes in,
"Good bye uncle Sam," comes with a foiled grin.
RAPHAEL.
BEHOLD young Raphael coming back;
How long the time doth seem,
   Since last he parted from the side
Of her, his sweetest dream.
And yet a fortnight scarce hath past,
Since last he left her side,
   And saw those soft eyes fill with tears;
His love, his joy, his pride.
And now he's coming back again,
A husband's place to hold;
   He seeks communion with himself,
And saunters 'cross the wold.
With polished rifle on his arm,
And hunting coat of gray,
   His Pilot trotting at his heel,
With joy he winds his way
Though Raphael is a marksman fair,
   Of hunting over fond,
   Ere yet, he lifteth not his gun,
To bring the good game down.
But now doth rouse he from his dream,
   And cocks his trusty gun;
For he hath reached the willowed dell,
Where deer is wont to run.
The day is calm, soft breezes blow,
   And all is still as dawn;
Upon the lake, among the rush,
Are floating, flocks of swan.
Then saith young Raphael, as he gaze
   On rush, and willows 'round,
"The truant deer hath sought the cliffs,
And naught but swan I've found."
"I'll choose the whitest of the flock,"
   Thus did young Raphael speak,
"As symbol of the pure young heart
Of her, whose hand I seek."
And so, adown the dell he peers,
   And through the rush he sees,
A mass of downy whiteness there,
Half hidden by the leaves.
He lifts his gun, he takes good aim,
   And forward Pilot start:
Triumphantly he lowers his piece;
He knows he've hit the mark.
Oh luckless youth, retrace thy steps!
   The sight that waits thine eyes,
Will turn thy ebon locks to snow;
And waste thy life with sighs.
Oh deadly bullet, why so true?
   What havoc thou hast wrought,
To turn into the deepest grief,
Young Raphael's noblest thought!
For there, half hidden by the rush,
   Doth lie a heap like snow;
Poor Pilot crouch and lick the face,
Of one full well he know.
And now young Raphael's coming up;
   He push the rush aside,
And there upon the sward behold,
His game—his own loved bride.
One look reveals his waiting love,
   All clad in snowy white;
Her angel face, her bosom red —
He groans— and all is night.
Oh young, heart-broken, weary youth!
   God chasteneth whom he love:
Thy thoughts were ever with thy bride;
They never soared above.
But since the one thou lovest so well,
   Hast flown to realms of rest,
Thy whole soul turneth to thy God,
And yearneth for the blest.
And when thy keenest grief is past,
   And hushed thy deepest sighs,
Thou'lt deem her but an angel sent,
To lure thee to the skies.
THE PRECIOUS PEARL.
ONCE, the mighty waves of ocean,
   Washed to shore, a precious pearl;.
Tossed it, hidden half with sea-weeds,
   To our dingy, sordid, world—
On the beach, four little children,
   Each engaged in sportive play,
Piling sand, or hunting sea-shells,
   Idly, passed the time away.
One, while hunting 'mid the sea-weeds,
   For the shells, in childish play,
In his lack of understanding,
   Found, but tossed the pearl away.
Then, anon, his brother found it,
   Treasured it away with mirth,
But, when burden down with sea-shells
   He too, cast it to the earth.
Then at length the third child found it,
Hoarded it within his hand,
   But in search of showier treasures
Likewise, tossed it to the sand.
Lastly came the fourth child meekly,
And the precious pearl he found,
   Joyfully, he grasped the jewel,
Flung his sea-shells to the ground.
For he valued high the jewel,
That his brother, late had spurned,
   And his wise consideration
Fruitful compensation earned.
Ah! how many grown up children,
Figuring in the play of life,
   In the search of gold or pastime,
Slight the Pearl of Greatest Price.
ALBERTA.
ALBERTA, lovely little dame,
   Of thee I'm thinking ever;
      Oh, little witch, with eyes of sloe!
Thou haunts me, wheresoe'er I go,
And grants a respite, never;
      A victim of thy spell I be,
      A bondman, robbed of liberty:
   Show quarter now, and pity me,
         O, fair Alberta.
Thy solemn eyes, are hid from sight
   By dark-fringed, dusky, curtains;
      Oh, lift thy orbs, up unto mine,
And let one ray of love light shine,
      To make my faint hopes certain;
      Oh, from suspense, and misery,
   Let but a frank smile set me free,
           Do fair Alberta.
Thou surely know I loveth thee,
   For when I'd show my feeling,
      Thou seemst in modesty to thwart,
The flow of love words from my heart,
By chaff and laughter pealing;
      Oh, show thy own true self to me!
      And let me show my love to thee,
            Do shy Alberta.
Alberta, all thy little ways,
   Are so familiar to me,
      That I am thrilled before you speak;
I guess thy smiles, they make me weak,
A maudlin, lovesick youth, I be:
      Oh, break this bitter spell that bind,
      By giving me that hand of thine,
            My own Alberta.
THE INNER REALM.
THERE is a sphere, a secret sphere,
   Within each human's breast;
A sacred realm shut in from sight,
   Securely closed from outward light.
   Where faintly fall the sounds, repressed,
Upon the outward ear.
Within this guarded, secret, land,
   No mortal man may roam;
No eager list'ning stranger ear,
   The secrets of this realm may hear;
   'Tis the abode of two alone—
God, and the Inner Man.
Fierce cyclones oft o'er this land sweep,
   Whilst outside all is calm;
Oft when the outer man seems gay,
   And mirth and frolic rules his day,
   The inner loudly groans for balm,
To heal a raw sore deep.
Sometimes when fiercely sweeps the gale,
   Within that inner sphere,
A flood of tears to eas'ly wrung,
   A burst of censure, overdone,
   Oft fall upon our clever ear
And hint a woeful tale.
Oh realm of sighs and muffled groans,
   What secrets you possess!
Our sad regret doth there abide;
   Our weakness coated o'er with pride
   There finds a hiding place to rest,
In quietness alone.
What eager hopes lie buried there,
   Ne'er to be realized;
Sharp yearning after wealth and fame,
   Past follies, fraught with burning shame,
   Find refuge from man's cruel eye,
And daylight's open glare.
Oft willful love lies squirming there,
   Held down by reason mild;
Oft envy dire, doth struggle strong,
   And hatreds oft that region throng,
   Like roaring ocean's tempest wild,
Disturbs a morning, fair.
Our God alone, is present there,
   When fierce the tempest roars,
No balm can soothe the aching heart,
   No one can sympathy impart,
   As He, who in those days of yore,
A crown of thorns did wear.
In Him alone, our souls find rest,
   When pressed by sorrows sore;
No one can mend the broken string,
   And bid the oldtime notes to ring,
   In sweeter accents than before,
As can our Saviour, blest.
THE MUSE'S FAVOR
OH Muse! I crave a favor,
   Grant but this one unto me;
Thou hast always been indulgent —
   So I boldly come to thee.
For oft I list thy singing—
   And the accents, sweet and clear,
Like the rhythmic flow of waters,
   Fall on my ecstatic ear.
But of Caucasia's daughters,
   So oft I've heard thy lay,
That the music, too familiar—
   Falls in sheer monotony.
And now, oh Muse exalted!
   Exchange this old song staid,
For an equally deserving—
   The oft slighted, Afric maids.
The Muse, with smiles consenting,
   Runs her hand the strings along,
And the harp, as bound by duty—
   Rings out with the tardy song.
THE SONG
Oh, foully slighted Ethiope maid!
With patience, bearing rude upbraid,
With sweet, refined, retiring, grace,
And sunshine ling'ring in thy face,
With eyes bedewed and pityingly
   I sing of thee, I sing of thee.
Thy dark and misty curly hair,
In small, neat, braids entwineth fair,
Like clusters of rich, shining, jet,
All wrapt in mist, when sun is set;
Fair maid, I gaze admiringly,
   And sing of thee, and sing of thee.
Thy smooth and silky, dusky skin,
Thine eyes of sloe, thy dimple chin,
That pure and simple heart of thine,
Tis these that make thee half divine;
Oh maid! I gaze admiringly,
   And sing of thee, and sing of thee.
Oh modest maid, with beauty rare,
Whoe'er hath praised thy lithe form, fair?
Thy tender mein, thy fairy tread—
Thy winsome face and queenly head?
Naught of thy due in verse I see,
   All pityingly I sing of thee.
Who've dared to laud thee 'fore the world.
And face the stigma of a churl?
Or brook the fiery. deep, disdain—
Their portion, who defend thy name?
Oh maiden, wronged so cowardly.
   I boldly, loudly, sing of thee.
Who've stood the test of chastity,
Through slav'ry's blasting tyranny,
And kept the while, their virtuous grace,
To instill in a trampled race?
Fair maid, thy equal few may see;
   Thrice honored I, to sing of thee.
Let cowards fear thy name to praise,
Let scoffers seek thee but to raze;
Despite their foul, ignoble, jeers,
A worthy model thou appear,
Enrobed in love and purity;
   Oh who dare blush, to sing of thee?
And now, oh maid, forgive I pray,
The tardiness of my poor lay;
The weight of wrongs unto thee done—
Did paralize my falt'ring tongue;
'Twas my mute, innate, sympathy—
   That staid this song, I sing to thee.
KNIGHT OF MY MAIDEN LOVE.
KNIGHT of my maiden love,
   Stalwart and manly—
Ever my yearning heart searcheth for thee;
   Searcheth the busy crowd;
   Hearken its babble loud;
Yearning in secret, thy dear face to see.
Knight of my maiden love,
   Stalwart and manly—
Tender thy words were, and tender thy mien;
   Deep in my loving heart,
   Thee, hath I set apart—
Prince of my fancy, and lord of my dream.
Knight of my maiden love,
   Stalwart and manly—
Calm and composed in thy presence I seem;
   This is my sex decree—
   Maidens must modest be;
And manly courage hath made thee my dream.
Knight of my maiden love,
   Stalwart and manly—
'Tis not thy noble form, I love the best;
   Nay, 'tis thy tenderness,
   Tempered with manliness,
Forming a noble heart, deep in thy breast.
LINES ON A DEAD GIRL.
CLOSE the dim eyes, for expression hath left them;
Arrange the limp hands, ere stiffness ensue;
Cover her o'er, with a cloth of pure whiteness;
   Reverence her clay, it is all we can do.
Never again shall those calm lips be parted,
Displaying the pearl in the sunshine of mirth;
   Never those dim eyes in sympathy kindle,
Nature hath claimed her dust for the earth.
Ever her image is bright in our vision,
Recalling so vividly, days that are fled;
Days, when her light step, her smile, and her beauty,
Seemed more for the living, than marked for the dead.
Short was her day—so early she faded;
Sank as the sun sinks, behind a great hill—
And, though his grand form is lost to the vision,
The light of his splendor is lingering still.
Long may the light of her splendor be with us—
Spreading a balm, that shall soothe ev'ry breast;
Soon may we muse on her, with resignation;
   Saying, 'Amen' to her summons to rest.
A SOUTHERN SCENE.
FAR in the land of sunny South,
   Where brightly shines the sun,
Where foliage green, is ever seen,
   Like to a northern spring begun,
   A lithe and agile, ebon, youth,
   With gladsome heart, in love and truth,
   Is ling'ring with his plighted one.
One arm about her waist is twined—
   One little hand he holds;
Her head at rest, upon his breast,
   Is like a lambkin in the fold—
   When fierce, the mountain wolf of gray,
   Howls in the uplands, far away,
   Of hunger, wretchedness, and cold.
"Yes honey, after we are wed,
   Far to the North we'll stray;
There black and white, have equal right,
   I've heard the northern Yankee say,
   And noose, and lash, are never used,
   On guiltless blacks, with foul abuse,
   But law and justice, rule the day."
"And Ellen, honey, when at last,
   We'll rest on freedom's clay,
I'll show a self, my little elf,
   Which here dare not to show, I may;
   The foul and loathsome chains I'll break
   From inner man, and bid him wake,
   To bright and gladsome freedom's day."
"Oh Henry! "—Ellen sadly cries;
   Dark doth the future seem;
That brighter day, is far away,
   And love, I fear 'tis but a dream;
   Your white foes all about you throng,
   Their hateful snare they'll set erelong,
   And thwart your brightest hopes, I ween."
The hot tears, veil her soft eyes dark;
   She heaves a weary sigh;
For in their road, doth doom forbode,
   She feels convinced, she knows not why:
   And, ever like a shadow near,
   Lingers the burden of her fear,
   Like threat'ning clouds in summer sky.
He soothes her timid tears away,
   And folds her in his arms;
She's braced at length, by manly strength,
   And feels secure from any harm;
   From trembling lips, he coax a smile,
   And steals a honeyed kiss the while,
   And gaily laughs at her alarm.
With gladsome heart, he homeward hies;
   High beat his pulses free—
His whistle shrill, rings from the hill,
   And sends an echo o'er the lea;
   With light, elastic, step, he tread,
   And thinks of her he's soon to wed—
   Guard and protect, by fate's decree.
A feeling of unworthiness,
   Possess his noble mind;
His precious love, seems of above,
   An angel, strayed from heav'nly clime;
   He conjures up her presence fair,
   Her tender smile, her patient air,
   And reverence her in truth sublime.
But hark! at nightfall grim and dark,
   What are those sounds I hear—
Like to the hiss, through fog and mist—
   Of serpents in the rushes near?
   'Tis whispr'ings of a vicious plan,
   To seize and lynch a guiltless man,
   Whom justice fair, would rightly clear.
Their false accuse of hatred bred,
   They hiss with fiery tongue,
To kindred fiend, with equal spleen,
   Who join the leaders in the run:
   And like a pack of dumb curs bold,
   In search of lost sheep out the fold,
   They hie upon their errand, mean.
They gather round poor Henry's cot,
   And then, with motions fleet,
With muttered oath, and faces loath,
   They bind their victim, hand and feet;
   Dazed by their vicious threats, profane,
   He seems a dead man in his chains,
   As he is borne through dim lit streets.
Erelong, a taper looms in sight;
   It falls on Henry's gaze:
Fair Ellen's light, arms him with might—
   To brave his pale faced foes, amazed;
   He breaks those hateful ropes that bind,
   As though they were small threads of twine;
   And turns, his enemies to raze.
His blows fall fast, on cringing heads—
   Swift moves his stalwart form;
His glaring eyes, flash like a fire
   Fanned by a raging winter's storm;
   Like slaughtered beeves, his foemen fail,
   And dire confusion ruleth all;
   They crouch, they swear, in mean alarm.
But look, a form is by his side—
   A woman's scream he hears!
A painful start, possess his heart—
   It is his frightened Ellen, dear;
   He shields her from the ruffians vile,
   And makes a desperate break the while
   To 'scape the mob and soothe her fear.
But lo! a vicious outlaw, wild,
   With murder in his heart,
With deadly ire, his weapon fire,
   And speeds a bullet like a dart;
   It drives a hole through Ellen's breast,
   On Henry's breaking heart she rest,
   While once again the mob upstart.
The Ethiopes are rallied now,
   A deadly fray ensue,
The lifeblood red, from victims shed,
   Moistens the trampled earth like dew;
   And soon the direful fray's complete,
   The outlaws, cowardly retreat,
   To seek protection not their due.
When dawns the light of morning's sun,
   Destroyed by bullets, sped—
On bloody ground, the dead are found,
   With features stern and eyeballs red;
   And with him rest, in tranquil grace,
   Poor Ellen, closed in his embrace,
   Lay Henry, with the silent dead.
How long, oh Lord, wilt thou permit
   Such direful deeds as these?
How long with pain, the bitter chain
   Of torture, shall my people grieve?
   When shall Caucasia's blows be staid?
   When wait thou hush her foul upbraid,
   On those who doth on Thee believe?
AN UNROMANTIC AWAKENING.
I FELL asleep, and had a dream—
   Which even now, doth linger near;
Methought, that in my arms, I held,
   One who to me, is very dear;
I drank her warm breath rapt'ously,
   As her soft arms my neck entwined—
She pressed a kiss— it was too much!
   I woke in trembling joy divine.
It was too much, indeed, for me;
   What were my feelings, when I found—
The certainty of my fair love,
   Was, cuddling in my lap, my hound?
I rose and dashed him savagely
   Upon the ground, with one sound kick—
And as my slumb'ring sense returned,
   I saw him marching, double quick.
THE VINEYARD OF MY BELOVED
Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. ISAIAH 5:1
MY BELOVED hath a vineyard,
   In a very fruitful hill,
Where the choicest sunbeams glimmer,
   And the clouds their moisture spill;
And he fenced it round about,
   To keep the wild fox out;
And set a mighty host the field to till.
My Beloved hath a vineyard,
   In a very fruitful hill,
Where the earth is damp and fertile,
   And the harmful bee is still;
And he planted choicest vine,
   To yield the sparkling wine,
And set a mighty host the field to till.
But, despite the workers efforts,
   And the sun shine, and the rain,
Many of the choice vines withered,
   Making all His efforts vain;
So He took the blighted vines,
   And threw them to the wind—
Suff'ring not one barren grape-vine to remain.
We are grape-vines in that vineyard,
   And our opportunities,
Are the sunshine and the workers—
   Luring to eternity;
And, with conscience fenced about,
   To keep all bad deeds out,
Our hearts are ever pressed toward purity.
But despite our wary conscience,
   And our opportunities—
Many a one of us, are failures,
   Yielding rank impurities;
And at last, like backward sprouts,
   Our just God casts us out—
For we slighted all our chances, carelessly.
EVELYN.
EVELYN, sweet Evelyn,
   List to my lay;
List to the sighs of my heart;
   Hearken the words of a lover, sweet dove.
Do, and a blessing impart.
Evelyn, sweet Evelyn,
   List to my lay;
Forsooth you have made me to sing;
   Your sweet midnight eyes, and your smiles, fair dove,
Have prompted my heart-chords to ring.
Evelyn, sweet Evelyn,
   Favor my suit;
Let love smiles sparkle on me—
   Incline thy fond heart to a lover, fair dove,
One love glance, a pris'ner to free.
MY FATHER'S STORY.
THERE is an ancient story,
That my father used to tell—
When out side all were hoary,
And still the snowdrops fell;
While the rolling hills about us,
Seemed sinking to the dell.
When heavy snows, prevented,
All outside exercise,
Our fam'ly group, contented,
Sought amusement otherwise;
Then, my father, smiling blandly,
Would tell his tale thiswise:
"When a boy, I well remembah,
How th' ole folks use to tell,
'Bout a rich man, in Virginyah,
Who was mean and close as well;
And his po' slaves late and early,
Tilled his fields, whate'er befell.
All day long with oaths tremendous,
He, his weary slaves would drive,
And his urging lash, malicious,
Did the setting sun survive;
And each sunrise found his bondmen,
Grieving that they were alive.
Oft the piercing cry of woman—
Rent the placid ev'ning air,
And the foul lash, at his summun,
Left her swooning in despair;
While the rude whelks on her person,
Marred the beauty, ling'ring there.
Oft the aged, maimed and feeble,
Fell before his brutal blow,
While he hurried on, unheedful,
Of their groans of utter woe—
Or the look of bitter anguish,
In their tearful eyes of sloe.
One ev'ning, atter set of sun,
When the moon-beams faintly shown,
When two day's work were forced in one,
By the dint of fierceness shown,
This evil man sat on his porch,
Which vines had overgrown.
And the blue smoke, odorif'rous,
Rose up from his pipe of clay,
While his evil mind, assiduous,
Labored o'er a sternah way,
To force from his wornout bondmen,
Greatah tasks the coming day.
Pond'ring thus, with evil foresight,
With his glassy eyes half closed—
Through the smoke and misty moonlight,
An uncanny object rose;
'Though he rubbed his eyes with vigah,
Still it lingered in repose.
'Twas an object, grim and massive,
Lurking near his grand abode;
Crouching ever, calm and passive,
Whilst the misty moonbeams glowed,
And its rude shape, in the dim light,
Loomed up like a giant toad.
Up he sprung, by terrah shakened—
With his hands to temples pressed.
And the spook, as if awakened,
From its deep, still, passiveness,
Quivered in a blue blaze, frightful—
Then, dissolved to nothingness.
Long he stood there, terrah strickened,
Staring at the vacance, grim,
And his heart within him sickened—
While a trembling seized his limbs—
And the cold sweat on his forehead,
Glistened in the moonlight, dim.
Thenceforth, when with over fierceness,
He would press his bondmen, sore,
And his cruel, foul, perverseness.
Made them their sad lot deplore,
This grim spook, at fall of ev'ning,
Threat'ningly would haunt his door.
But, by frequent visitation,
Ever harmless, ling'ring near—
'Last, its evil premonition,
Lost its meaning on his ear;
And with recklessness, defiant,
He forgot his cow'ring fear.
Once, when with unusual madness,
He, his viciousness, had shown,
And his bondmen, bowed in sadness—
To their wretched huts had gone,
In the quietness of even,
He sat on his porch, alone.
Softly, zephyrs from the rushes,
Swept the smooth cut lawn of green.
While the shadows, of the bushes,
Like black dye on grass did seem,
And the dew, on bud and leaflet,
Shown like gems of Orient dream.
As he sat there staring idly,
Out into the lovely night,
Wrapt in blue blaze, quiv'ring wildly.
His old haunt flashed on his sight—
And with sudden impulse, quickly,
Anger took the place of fright.
With an oath, he seized his rifle;
And with coolness, took good aim;
But his gun hung fire a trifle,
Seeming fearful of the game—
And was loath to speed its bullet,
To that ghostly, frightful, flame.
When the rifle rang out clearly,
And the bullet true, had sped,
This old spook, with hiss and groanings,
Leapt into a huge blaze red,
And, with flying sparks, o'er covered,
This vile man, fell backward, dead.
Children, God sent forth that spirit,
As a warning, to that man;
But he passed it by, unheeded;
So God took another plan—
And he called him to his judgment,
As he oft does sinful man.
Then my father, sadly smiling,
With his patient, worn, hands claspt,
Would, with gentle air, beguiling,
Fall to musing on the past—
Of his earlier life in bondage—
Mindless of the winter's blast.

GLIMPSES OF INFANCY.
AS riper years approach us,
   Whiffs of infancy appear;
In mere sparkles of the sunshine,
   Glimpses, come of other years.
In the fanning of soft breezes,
   Or the sun's ray on the snow,
Oft a transient flash comes o'er us,
   Flickering scenes from long ago.
A strange flash, yet half familiar,
   That our infant brain once knew,
Now pushed back, by riper knowledge
   Oft they flash, with infant hue.
THE OLD FREEDMAN.
HE sits in front of the bright, blazing grate;
   A poor old freedman, maimed and gray;
With worn hands folded, he sits and waits,
   His Master's summons, from day to day.
His ebon brow is seamed deeply with care;
   His dim eyes, robbed of their scanty sight,
By the dazzling red of the ember's glare,
   Sets him to dreaming as though 'twere night.
And his hard, early life comes, scene by scene,
   As acts appear on a play-house stage;
While he sits with a thoughtful smile, serene,
   And views the past, in a dreamy maze.
Yes, now he can smile as he thinks on those days,
   For the fire of youth has long fled his breast;
He has cast the burden of past cares away,
   And humbly looks to his Master, for rest.
He hears the fierce screams of his mother, wild,
   Anguished and startling, and loud as of old;
While haplessly he, her remaining child,
   Is hurried "down the river," and sold.
And now comes the scene of that sugar farm,
   Where the lash and fever, rules supreme;
Where the humid, sickly, atmosphere, warm,
   Brings on a giddiness, e'en in his dream.
He is hoeing cane, with a stalwart pace,
   And with him, a girl, the joy of his life;
With her graceful figure and dark brown face,
   And her sunny smile—his own fair wife.
Whene'er the overseer's back is turned,
   He lends a strong hand to her lagging row;
That her exacting task may be earned,
   To ward from her back, the brutal blow.
Despite the appalling crosses of life,
   He deems himself, e'en a happy man—
Just to have her near, and to call her "wife,"
   And to hurriedly press her little worn hand.
The third scene is on, and now he behold,
   His Lucy coming with eyes filled with tears;
"Oh Ruben," she's crying, "why I'm to be sold!"
   The words fall like doom upon his shocked ears.
Again that dull giddiness rises within,
   His lower limbs weaken, he rests on his hoe;
Poor Lucy embraces again and again,
   Then turns, and back to the "big house" doth go.
Her fleeting form, brings him back to himself;
   He drops his hoe, with a desperate groan;
He'll make the rude trader take back his foul pelf.
   He'll claim his wife, for she is his own.
Oh, futile struggle! he sees his fair love,
   Borne off by the rude, evil, trader, who spoils,
While he helplessly, calls on his Father above,
   And is fiercely, brutally, lashed for his toils.
Oh, let us pass over the dark days that came—
   And rev'rently screen this act of his life!
When the anguish of Rizpah, who mourned for her slain,
   Could not be compared, with his grief o'er his wife.
And now, clears the smoke, that is black as the night;
   He stands firm, a giant with Gettysburg's brave;
The death blows he deals, in the hand to hand fight,
   Serves vengeance to rebels who late held him slave.
And now, he is come to the calm years of peace;
   His restless wand'rings in search of his wife;
When despaired and discouraged, his wanderings cease,
   And he fills with religion, the void of his life.
And now, the last scene, the triumphant—the grand!
   With dim sight renewed and infirmities fled,
Fair Lucy once more is pressing his hand,
   And Jesus is placing a crown on his head.
For there, in front of the bright blazing, grate,
   With a sad, kind, smile, and expressionless eye,
At the end of the day, in the even, late,
   He had taken his fight, to his home on high.
THE SNAIL'S LESSON.
DEEP into the midst of a great, dark, wood,
   Where shades are ever staying,
I found a snail, at the root of an oak,
   One day, as I was maying;
And I said," Oh stupid snail, so weak,
What moral high, canst thy poor life teach?"
And methought, the snail answered thus from his shell,
   "Oh maid! list to my teaching;
Cautiously taking full time as I do,
   I'm spared of over-reaching;
If you too, like me would take life more slow,
You truly would be benefited, I know."
"And I leave a silver trace in the rear,
   So that, when false friends cavil,
I may turn, for reference, back to my path,
   And prove how straight I travel;
Oh! if you'd leave in your rear, a fair trace,
'Twould serve you quite fitly the future to face."
"I lug on my back, wherever I go,
   This house, my life protecting;
Oh maid! though it slackens my speed the while,
   I'm safe when foes are besetting;
And it would be safer if you were enrobed,
In the strong defense of Jesus, your Lord."
AUTUMN.
THE sun shines bright, but sadly,
   Upon the earth's decline;
The high wind, cool and searching,
   Showers leaves from clinging vine;
The wood, in gorgeous burial shroud,
   Like some great prince in state,
Is viewed by sable mantled crows,
   Who mourn its luckless fate.
The weeds are dry and blasted,
   Within the grainless field,
And to the sturdy hunter's tread,
   Their ripened seeds they yield;
And the shot gun's constant firing,
   Booms salute o'er fallen game;
While the fleet hound's doleful baying,
   Sounds the 'taps, 'mid smoke and flame.
Our thoughts are ever turning,
   To sad scenes long gone by;
And, despite contrary efforts,
   We are ever heaving sigh.
Nature seems to hold us mourners,
   With a spell—sad, undefined,
For the faded leaves and blossoms,
   By a palling of the mind.
TO A DECEASED FRIEND
THE veil of death hath fallen,
    Loved one 'twixt thee and me;
Thou art now among the chosen of the Lord;
    With heavenly saints immortal,
        Enrobed in sanctity,
Thou art chanting with the blest, in sweet accord.
Oh, ever bright thy image,
    Is pictured in my heart,
Though autumn after autumn now hath flown;
    But memories still steal o'er me,
        In which thou hast a part,
And I sometimes yearn to rob Death of his own.
Well didst thou keep the promise,
    My dying mother craved:
That thou shouldst ever guard her orphan brood;
    Oh, blessed foster-mother!
        Thy tenderest love, thou gav'st;
And thou ever taught me lessons, pure and good.
Oh Death! why rob so early?
    Why snatched thou her, from me,
When I, in wane of childhood, craved her most?
    If longer thou hadst spared her,
        I could ungrudgingly,
Permitted her, to be unto me lost.
Oh, many times in blindness
    Have I stumbled as I tread,
The rugged old road, which to me is new;
    And I miss thy warm hand's pressure,
        And I grieve that thou art dead;
While sad, regretful, tears, mine eyes bedew.
But sleep, beloved mother,
    Why shouldst I grudge thy rest?
For thou indeed, hast done the 'better part;'
    A mother to the orphan,
        Of wives the true and best,
My inmost self, can yield thee, with glad heart.
DAVID AND GOLIATH.
And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; 
thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
1 Samuel, 17:32
KING Saul was disconcerted.
And a gloom was o'er him spread,
As his trusty captain, trembling,
To the fight, his army led.
For now, at the arrival,
Of that dreaded battle hour,
He was loath to 'tack the foeman,
For he felt he lacked the power.
Up from the vale of Elah,
    On one slope his army lay,
While the adverse slope frowns grandly,
    With the Philistine's array.
For two score days succeeding,
    Morn and eve, he'd seen his men,
Break the ranks and flee as cowards,
    From that giant Philistine.
And now, with with great composure,
    And bedecked in armor bright,
Again he sees that champion,
    Coming proudly forth to fight.
His mammoth head is covered,
    With a brazen helmet, grand,
And his coat of mail shines fiercely,
    And a spear is in his hand.
The target, 'tween his shoulders,
    Loudly grinds his coat of mail,
And the clash of greaves, that mingle,
    Sends an echo down the vale.
With pond'rous form erected,
    And a demon in his eye,
He stops, and lifts his mighty voice,
    And Israel's host defy.
"Why doth ye, O slaves of Saul,
    With thy armor and thy din,
Come to victor o'er Goliath,
    Am not I a Philistine?
Ho! cowards, from amongst you,
    Choose and send one man to me,
If I'm conquered in the conflict,"
    Then thy servants we shall be!
"But, if before me bleeding,
    He should fall, Goliath's prey,
Then ye Israelites shall serve us,
    Humbly, meekly, all thy day."
King Saul was disconcerted,
    And a terror o'er him spread,
As with trembling forms, dejected,
    From the fight, his army fled.
But now, from 'mongst the soldiers,
    With a heart that knows not fears,
Flustered sore with indignation,
    Steps a youth, of tender years.
His curly locks flow idly,
    And in shepherd's dress he stands,
And his comely face, exalted,
    Re-assures each faltering man.
"Who is this great Philistine—
    That the host of God, defied?
What is offered by our Sovereign—
    To redeem fair Israel's pride?"
Thus, freely he converses,
    With his elders, close at hand,
And the courage he displayeth,
    Seems more fitly for a man.
But Eliab, his brother,
    Hears the pond'rous threat he's made,
To attack the mighty giant,
    And the youth he sore upbraids.
"Thou'rt but an awkward stripling,
    Unused to war and men!
Cease thy vain and idle bragging,
    Get thee back to Bethlehem!"
"With whom didst thou leave thy sheep,
    In the dang'rous wilderness?
Get thee back unto thy duty—
    Well I know thy naughtiness!"
But David, never daunted,
    Hath with might impressed them all;
And despite his brother's censure,
    They've rehearsed his words to Saul.
When to the king he's summoned,
    With a boldness that appall,
He tells of his intention,
    To revoke the shame of all.
But Saul, with apprehension,
    Speaks with confidence and truth—
"He is old and tried in battle,
    Thou, art but a tender youth."
"Oh king!" the youth respondeth;
    "While I watched my father's flocks,
A great lion snatched a lambkin,
    And ran roaring to the rocks;
But I pursued him, fearless,
    And we struggled o'er the lamb;
And I seized his tawny beard—
    And I slew him with my hand."
"Oh king! the Lord is with me,
    And I go at His command;
He hast saved me from the lion,
    And He'll arm me for this man."
King Saul is disconcerted—
    But a ray of hope, now glow;
And he turneth to the stripling,
    With—"The Lord be with thee, go."
With coat of mail and helmet,
    Saul, the stripling, hast arrayed;
Places in his hand, his own sword,
    And the youth to go, assayed.
"I cannot wear thine armor.
    For, oh king! they are not tried;
Thy coat of mail, I have not proved;"
    And he cast them all aside.
Then, at the brook he searcheth,
    And five stones he quickly bring;
And he goes to meet the giant,
    With his staff and trusty sling.
Now with surprise, Goliath,
    Just beyond his bearer true,
An effeminate, fair stripling,
    In a shepherd's dress, doth view.
And as he cometh slowly,
    With heavy armor, bright,
He doth ridicule the stripling,
    For he scorns with him to fight.
But now his wrath is kindled,
    At the boldness of the boy;
Savagely the youth he curses,
    And he seeks him, to destroy.
"Come to me!" then cries Goliath;
    "With thy flesh a feast I'll yield,
To the wild birds of the heaven,
    And the wild beasts of the field."
Young David answers calmly,
    "Spear and shield on thee, I see;
In the name of God of Israel,
    I have come to conquer thee."
My God shalt thee deliver,
    Slain, this day unto my hand;
And thy soldier's mangled bodies,
    Feed the creatures of the land.
And now he hastens toward him;
    And he whirls his sling around,
The stone Jehovah speedeth,
    Brings Goliath to the ground.
The lithe youth hastens to him,
    And the giant's sword, doth take,
Severs head from body, quickly,
    While the Philistine doth quake.
And suddenly, Saul's army,
    With fierce shouts and battle din,
Fell upon them with great slaughter,
    Then, pursued the Philistine.
And they returned in triumph;
    And they plundered all their land;
Then to Saul, they bring young David,
    With the giant's head in hand.
King Saul is much elated,
    And he kindly promise fame;
While he looks on him with favor,
    Who's redeemed fair Israel's name.
THEY ARE THE SAME.
GOD'S blessings all are uniform,
   To each, to every one;
Within yon manse, within yon cot;
   An infant son is come.
The same sweet, childish, innocence,
   Alike in both, I see,
As calmly in their cribs they sleep;
   The soul of purity.
Each, by his pure, sweet, innocence,
   Can harshest moods bewitch—
They are the same, they are the same,
   Albeit, one is rich.
I see them now to prattlers grown;
   What say you now? The same?
Can earthly vice, so soon pollute?
   It can and more's the shame.
They meet each other on the street;
   By nurse and mother, led;
Alas! though rods have intervened,
   They turn their little head.
'Though each by other's scrutinized,
   By blinded infant eyes,
Who dare gainsay, what there they saw,
   Is looked for, by the wise?
For each by each's attire behold,
   What grown up people see:
That one is in the realm of wealth,
   And one's in poverty.
And straight-way, in each little heart,
   A smoldering vice appears,
To wrankle in each tender breast,
   And kindle more with years.
'Though one's the germ of vanity,
   And one is envy's sting,
As yet, a common lot they share,
   For each has now a sin.
A sin, that turns the rich boy's gifts,
   To bitterness, to hate;
At such a feeble offering,
   To one so passing great.
A sin, that turns the poor boy's gifts,
   To bitterness, to gall;
At thought of numerous costly gifts,
   And his so cheap and small.
And thus, with discontent each barque,
   Adown the stream doth drift—
They are the same, they are the same,
   Albeit one is rich.
And now to bearded men they've grown;
   And sobered down with cares,
Of guiding ever erring feet,
   Which wander more with years.
And fervent prayers, for wayward son,
   Each to their God uplifts—
They are the same, they are the same,
   Albeit, one is rich.
And now, old age steals on to them;
   And life draws to its goal;
Each one has had his many sins,
   How fares it with their soul?
Each, to the same just Maker turns;
   Each craves a common lot;
To rest where He, his children bids,
   And said, "Forbid them not."
God's blessings all are uniform,
   To each, to every one;
And from yon manse, and from yon cot,
   A soul, is gathered home.
FREEDOM AT McNEALY'S.
ALL around old Chattanooga,
   War had left his wasteful trace;
And the rebels, quelled and baffled,
   Freed, reluctantly their slaves.
On his spacious, cool, veranda—
   Stood McNealy, gaunt and tall,
With bowed head, and long arms folded,
   Pond'ring on his blacks, enthralled.
Years and years, he'd been their master,
   Harsh and stern his reign had been;
Many an undeserving lashing,
   He had rudely given them.
All his life he'd been a despot;
   Ruling all with iron hand;
Never till this deadly conflict,
   Had he e'er brooked one command.
But his lately rich plantation,
   Sacked by Union men he see:
And the bitter dregs stands waiting:
   He must set his bondmen free.
From their work, they come together,
   At their master's last command,
And at length, well-nigh two hundred
   Fore the large veranda stand.
Oh! that motley crowd before him,
   Speaks the wrong one man has done;
For his constant, dire oppression,
   Can be seen on every one.
Men of middle age all palsied,
   By hard work and sorrow's pain;
Blighted youths and orphaned infants;
   All had felt his cruel reign.
There were women fair who knew him,
   To be more of brute than man;
There were children clinging to them,
   Through whose veins his own blood ran.
Widowed hearts in swarthy bosoms,
   Ever bled in patient pain,
O'er their loved ones, sold before them,
   To increase McNealy's gain.
All of this preys on McNealy,
   As before his slaves he stands;
And his low'ring, dogged, expression,
   Speaks the power that's left his hands.
And, with quivering voice and husky,
   Tells he that each one is free;
Tells them of his heavy losses,
   Meanly seeking sympathy.
And the soft hearts of his vassals,
   Melts, as only Ethiopes' can;
As with brimming eyes and kind words,
   Each one grasps his tyrant's hands.
One by one, they've all departed;
   Man and woman, boy and girl;
Void of learning, inexperienced,
   Launched upon the crafty world.
But one cabin is not empty,
   Two old souls are kneeling there;
In the throes of desolation,
   They have sought their Lord in prayer.
They have never tasted freedom,
   And their youthful hopes are fled;
Now, the freedom they are seeking,
   Is with Jesus and the dead.
Poor aunt Jude and uncle Simon!
   Freedom brings to them no cheer;
They have served McNealy's fam'ly—
   For three score, or more of years.
Steep and rough, the road they've traveled,
   Many were their heart felt groans—
Yet they cleave unto their tyrant,
   For his lash, is all they've known.
Like a bird of long confinement,
   Cleaves unto his open cage,
These two wretched slaves, benighted,
   Clave to bondage, in their age.
And they sought McNealy humbly,
   With their hearts filled to the brim;
Told him, all their days remaining,
   They would gladly give to him.
And McNealy, pleased and flattered,
   With no feeling of remorse,
Takes them back into his service,
   As you would a faithful horse.
A HYMN.
LORD, within thy fold I be,
                And I'm content;
Naught can be amiss to me,
For thy helping hand I see,
Light'ning loads that heavy be;
                And I'm content.
Lord I've put my trust in thee,
                And I'm content;
Whatsoe'er my lot may be,
I have faith to rest in thee,
'Though my way I may not see;
                And I'm content.
Lord I feel thy presence near,
                And I'm content;
In thy care, I know not fear,
'Though the Tempter's voice I hear;
I'm secure when Thou art near;
                And I'm content.
A COMMON OCCURRENCE.
LUCINDY, who you 'spose I seed,
    Down at de mill, today?
I know you nebbah 'ud agreed,
    Dat he is, who he say.
It ain't no use to guess no mo',
    Fah you's way off de track;
Dah, honey! 'twus one ub de Rowe's—
    Dat one dey all called Jack.
When we libed on his pappy's place.
    You know, he wus de one,
Dat al'ays had dat grinnin' face,
    And wrote ou' lettahs home.
Dat boy—de pictah ub his pap,
    Wid ha' all curled an' light;
Dat useta messmate wid ou' chaps,
    De same ef dey wus white.
But mussy, honey! mussy me!
    He's lurnt his propah place,
Done climed dat des'-stool like a tree,
    Specked eyes, an' frowned his face.
An' crow-feet all about his eyes!
    Looks fifty fo' uh pas';
Dis fac' de white folks cain't deny:
    Dey do git ole so fas'.
Dat's right Lucindy! he's ez ole,
    As ou' own Malachi;
But 'tis de trute dat I done tole,
    He looks mos' ole ez I.
"Hello dah, Petah!" loud he sed,
    (Done laid de 'uncle' by;)
"I'd knowed you, ef I done been dead,
    An' seed you in de sky."
"Guess I's becum a strangah, so,
    Mus' intahduce, I see;
Why, I am mistah Jackson Rowe—
    You use ta wuk fah me."
Yo' pappy, boy, you mus' ta mean;
    I wuked fah him a deal,
When you wus but a youngstah, lean,
    A sniv'lin' at his heel.
I looked wid all de eyes I hed;
    De pas' my brain did rack;
But spite ub all— it made me med,
    I couldn't fin' Rowe's Jack.
"Why, hab I changed dat much?" he sed,
    An' 'peared a little hu't;
It quickly cumed into my hed,
    I sed, "not fah de wus"
He sed, he'd bought sheers in dat mill;
    Lucindy, ain't you beat!
De house, wid his big voice wus fill,
    A-holl'rin' 'bout his wheat.
He'd boss de men in his employ,
    Den 'dress me as "my lad,"
De same ef I'd a been a boy,
    An' he ole ez my dad.
He's got de 'big-he'd', dat's de fac';
    And got de 'big-he'd,' bed;
He made b'lieve, he'd fahgot my chaps—
    "Cain't place dem, Pete," he sed.
"Cain't min' my Malachi?" I sed;
    "An' all my uddah chaps?
You cain't keep ole times in yo' hed?'
    You's dif'unt f'om yo' pap.
An' den he spoke ub trabbling 'roun';
    Ub business keers, all days;
An' den his face put on dat frown,
    An' so I cumed away.
An' all along ez I cumed back,
    I thought, whut I thought fus:
"Dat, ef dis is Rowe's grinnin' Jack,
    He's pintly changed fah wus."
The KING'S FAVORITES.
A KING, once summoned his favorites;
    Four gallant young knight, were they;
And bade them to add to his kingdom,
    By conquering lands, far away.
"And honor and glory is waiting," said he,
"For the one who brings greatest riches to me."
Lord Prudence, bowed and said nothing;
    Humility flushed like a girl;
Ambition was loud with his braggings,
    To bring back conquered, a world.
But Lord Pride turned scorning, and said with conceit,
"Sir knight, why so hopeful, with me to defeat?
So each of the young knight departed;
    And legions of men had they;
But two of the lords united;
    And two marched different ways.
Pride and Ambition feared union would prove,
To be a sad robber to fame, that both loved.
Pride's army once pitched in a valley,
    For a respite after a fight,
When the foemen came and surprised them,
    And took most captive, by night.
Poor Pride humbled, by soldiers bereft,
Doggedly dashed out his brains down a cleft.
Sir Ambition drew up to a city,
    Whose fortresses threat'ningly frowned,
And the first blinding volley that met him,
    Struck half of his grand army down.
And next they were all confusion and strife;
So Ambition was forced to yield up his life.
But Humility and Prudence,
    In union they fight and toil;
Conqu'ring wherever they meet the foe,
    And marching off proudly with spoils.
Always successful in union's fair strength,
With priceless treasures they marched home at length.
The king rode out from the palace;
    In a thoughtful mood was he,
For he saw the train approaching,
    And he wondered which should it be.
And he said "Oh knights of Chivalry,
Which of you brings greatest riches to me?"
The knights knelt down before him,
    With—"Together we fought and bled,
Together we routed the foemen,
    'Mid wounded, dying, and dead;
So, together our trophies to thee, we bring,
And jointly, we crave thy blessing, oh king!"
The king gave freely his blessing,
    And bade them to take the lead;
But his eye with a tear was moistened,
    As he sadly mounted his steed;
And he looked at his court that rode at his side,
And he missed bold Ambition and high-headed Pride.
And he said, "This day's grand triumph,
    Hangs dark and heavy o'er me;
And I see an incompleteness,
    That oh! would I fain not be;
How can earth's pomp with my grand court abide,
Since I've lost Ambition and high-headed Pride?"
HAPPY PAIR.
I see them coming up the road,
    In buggy, time-defaced;
With lame old nag, in harness worn,
    And slow and labored pace,
A humble sight they make, forsooth,
    'Mid fancy turn-outs, grand,
And yet, an innate grandeur plays,
    Now that they're near at hand.
The stalwart youth in neat attire,
    With handsome, olive face,
Is all abeam with lover's smiles,
    And love's attentive grace.
And at his side his lady, love,
    With curly, midnight, hair,
And dusky cheek and jet black eye,
    Is truly all that's fair.
Her blush he sees in eyes down-cast,
    And smiles all modest, shy;
In confused air, to questions, bold,
    She quibbles in reply.
And air of dignity doth play,
    Around the pair, content;
As with a vacant stare, they view,
    The rich on sport intent.
What care they for the rich man's gold,
    Or scoff from high life thrown;
They live within another world,
    Exclusively their own.
The rich folks, after futile jeers,
    In ears that heed them not,
Sink back on cushions, rich and soft,
    And envy them, their lot.
Oh happy pair! with hearts of love,
    Ne'er mayst thy joy depart;
Thrice rich is he whate'er his lot;
    Who hath a happy heart.
TO A LITTLE COLORED BOY.
Oh, pure and sportive little child,
   Be happy while you may:
Ring out your laughter loud and clear;
   Be blithe, enjoy your day.
Your eyes of sloe, they sparkle bright;
   Your rounded, dusky cheeks,
Are ever dimpled in a smile,
   From each week into weeks.
Build high your castles in the air;
   Dream on of manhood's fame;
What matter, if your pure, young, heart,
   Deems each man's chance the same.
I hold your little hand in mine;
   Fast wags your childish tongue;
Your prospects doth look bright to you,
   Because you are so young.
Thou knoweth not, poor little boy,
   What Future holds for thee,
Thy dreams are not extravagant,
   And yet, they canst not be.
This mass of midnight curly hair,
   This soft and dusky skin,
Will bring not fortune's smile to you,
   When childhood's day will end.
Thou art a child, of promise rare;
   God, for some cause, profound,
Hath cast thee in a finer mold,
   Than most about you found.
E'en now your little high-aimed heart,
   A pris'ner seems to be,
And with impatience beats the bars,
   Of helpless infancy.
You'll bloom a rare high-minded, man;
   Surpassing fair-faced men;
Would God, the Future, held for you,
   The hope it holds for them.
Would that your path of life could be,
   Like theirs, with roses strewn:
Would that your thorns, be brushed aside,
   As often as their own.
Would that the world, which you must face,
   Were free from this low sin,
To meanly wrong a fellow-man,
   For darkness of his skin.
I look me deep into thine eyes;
   My love is mixed with grief;
To think that naught, within my power,
   Can later, bring relief.
But pure and sportive little boy,
   When time his trials lend,
Think not that you are destitute;
   In me you have a friend.
A WINTER NIGHT.
THE night is cold and frosty;
    The leaden clouds have flown;
The air is pure and bracing,
    And the moon shines out alone.
The earth is wrapt in whiteness;
    The hoar-frost on the snow,
Doth throw a ray like jewels,
    In the moon light's icy glow.
The distant sounds ring clearly,
    Upon the list'ning ear;
The earth is 'live with noises
    Of the gay world, making cheer.
O'er some the night spreads pleasure;
    O'er some her sorrow broods,
A complex mass of people,
    In a thousand dif'rent moods.
Here is the step elastic
    With pulses beating high;
There is the slow and falt'ring,
    Fraught with many a heavy sigh.
With smiling face, paternal,
    As he the future plan,
For his young and thoughtful children,
    Goes the happy fam'ly man.
The night holds for him, gladness;
    His distant welcome light,
His children's gay shouts, coasting—
    Spreads a glamour o'er the night.
And list the merry laughter,
    In yonder gliding sleigh;
The clear bell's merry jingle,
    And fiery horses' neigh?
'Tis easy for the list'ners,
    Who note their merriment,
To read the fair night's meaning,
    To those thoughtless hearts, content.
And lo, there goes the mourner,
    In sable garments drest;
Bowed down with bitter sorrow—
    O'er a dearest friend bereft.
To him the moon shines coldly;
    The mirth that's to him blown,
Is but a harsh reminder,
    That he sadly grieves alone.
Likewise in yonder prison,
    The moonlight through the grates,
Stirs sad dreams in the guilty,
    Of the doom, that he awaits.
Oh night! possessed by many,
    Each in a dif'rent mood,
I waver in my singing,
    To regard thee bad or good.
But may the brightness gleaming,
    A worthy symbol prove,
To the desolate and restless,
    Of radiant heav'nly love.
THE CONSUMPTIVE.
I HAVE traveled, I have traveled,
    Over land and over sea;
I've consulted skilled physicians,
    Yet t'was vain, they helped not me.
I am dying of consumption;
    Oh my God can this be true?
I, so fresh, so young, so hopeful,
    Pass away like morning dew?
Can I give up all life's pleasures,
    That I now, would fain enjoy?
Give them up— resign — and waiting,
    Say, "Thy will be done, oh Lord?"
Why should I, oh God be taken?
    I—with such an aim in view;
When there're scores of youths about me,
    Shunning tasks, I'd gladly do.
Yet I'm dying! Yes I'm dying!
    Day by day my end draws near;
Strange indeed this living body,
    Soon will be the clod's compeer.
Growing weaker, ever weaker,
    Nearer draws the reaper by,
Till methinks, I see his sickle,
    By which stroke I soon shall die.
Yes must die— the time approaches;
    And I feel the time is nigh;
Oh God! hush my vain complaining!
    Give submission, Oh Most High!
Oh, 'tis said thou lov'st thy children;
    And that thou art always nigh;
Free me from this dread of dying,
    Give me peace before I die!
Thou knowst best why thou hast called me,
    From the field that's partly sown;
I resign; — thy love hath saved me;
    Take, oh take me for thine own.
Yes, oh Lord! thy love hath saved me;
    Numbered me among thy blest;
Made a wretch like me thy jewel;
    Ope'd the door to let me in.
Let me in to sing thy praises;
    Share thy loved ones sweetest boon;
Let me in, to cease from sinning;
    I am blest to die so soon.
ADDRESS TO ETHIOPIA.
OH ILL-STARRED Ethiopia—
   My weak and trampled race!
With fathomless emotion,
   Thy dismal path I trace.
Thy bright and stalwart, swarthy, sons,
   Thy meek-eyed daughters, fair,
I trace through centuries by-gone,
   Of misery and despair.
Thy fathers' fathers long were taught;
   Nay, forced by tyrants, bold,
To worship at a mortal shrine,
   With humble heart and soul.
So long hath slav'ry's blasting hand,
   O'er thee its power swayed,
That now, though freedom sweet is thine,
   I see thee cowed and dazed.
The sin is at thy tyrant's door;
   The curse is at thine own;
And e'er shall rest upon thy head,
   Till thou shalt cast it down.
Oh! rouse thy slumb'ring manhood, strong!
   A foothold boldly earn;
And scorn thy brothers' patronage,
   When he's thy fellow-worm.
Tear down those idols thou hast built,
   In weakness to the proud!
Knowest thou that in thy blindness, deep,
   Thou desecrate thy God?
Oh rise in union great and strong!
   Hold each black brother, dear;
And form a nation of thine own,
   Despite thy tyrant's jeers!
We need not reek in blood and groans,
   This is a war within;
We need but conquer cow' ring self,
   And rise a man with men.
What though our number may be few?
   Hath not the Jews long stood,
In unions strong, 'mid myriads
   Of foes, who craved their blood?
Then rise, oh fainting Ethiopes!
   And gather up thy strength;
For by repeated efforts, strong,
   Thou'lt gain thy grounds at length.
The same God hath created thee,
   That did thy fairer brother;
Thinkst thou, that in His justice, great,
   He'd prize one 'bove the other?

James T. Franklin
Memphis Tennessee, 1900
World's Fair Edition
PREFACE.
Having been called upon to contribute something to the department of Negro Literature at Paris during the World’s Fair, and feeling ashamed of the feeble effort which I have made heretofore in literary work; I now present to the public a selection of late poems, taken from a larger book which I have written but, owing to extreme poverty, have been unable to put into print.    Therefore if the public will condescend to look with favor upon these few poems---if poems they may be called---I promise ere long, in my “Depth of the Infinite’’ to present to the world a better piece of literature.
                                  JAMES T. FRANKLIN.
A Dream of Creation..
Come, O, muse, into my dark chamber,
     Where gloomy and cold repines the soul,
And light on the mind’s hearth stone a flame,
     And set my poetic fires aglow.
Enfold me close to thy gentle bosom,
     And like a mother, fond, endearing,
Press me closer and hold me fondly,
     And imprint my lips with wisdom’s kiss.
Let love, deep in my soul and wisdom
    Sweetly vibrate in responsive strains,
And part the curtarn invi ible, that.
    Doth swing 'twixt me and eternity.
Litt out, I pray thee, gentle the soul
     From its prison walls, this finite clay,
That rolling waves ( f the ir finite
     May onward bear it forever more;
And to me the mysteries unfold,
    Of myriad worlds that fly in space.
 Explain the heavens, its depth of blue,
     And that flaming orb, all glorious,
 Which from the canopies e’er doth brush
     The shadows down, as some maiden would,
 From her parlor walls, the cobwebs sweep.
     And to me the book of nature ope,
 That read it I may, and understand
     The scenes that in all creation change,
 E’en human souls, how have their being.
     And the gentle rocking earth that drift
 Like some bubble by the winds blown forth,
     Whence cometh it ? Whence come the flowers
 That in varied hues bedeck this sphere?
     Ah ! now the heaven doth, like a scroll.
 Roll back itself as I pass through,
     And swift in the arms of gentle muse,
 Am I borne off into nothingness.
     For before creation now am I,
 Where reigneth darkness silent profound,
     Until with sound, the darkness tremble,
 And the thundering voice of God doth call
     “Let there be light” and inky darkness,
 By vibration breaks into a flame.
     Then forth from God’s hand into space
 A veil of white nebulae is hurled,
     Which rapid whirling, swift in motion,
 Rolls its flames into balls which it hurls
     With a quick momentum, sphere by sphere;
 And each bright ball as it speeds away,
     Into a million or more doth break.
 Thus time begins and ten million years
     Fly past while age doth quick record
 The first eve and morn of the day.
     Now eastward paling, the stars among,
 Round a flume whirling, beautiful earth
      Doth fly unceasing, itself aglow,
 And dietb ihe flame in ten million years;
      Which dying flames with vapor doth drape
 The firmaments, and the waters form
      Above and below, while hoary age,
 Upon his wrinkled brow doth record
          The second eve and morn of the day.
     Then comes, twixt water and land, a strife,
         And formed are the seas which swift retreat,
          And on rapid «ings doth hasten flight;
     While the land left bare doth put forth sprout,
         And out of the dust, green herbage spring;
     Which dust being crushed ten million years,
         The plants support while hoary age
     Doth quick in his ancient records write
         The third day both the eve and the morn.
     Then out of a vague unseeming space,
         This pamorama of mystery
     Doth bring ten myriad of angels forth
         Which gird with gravitatu n the stars,
     And into groups doth bind them fast.
         And bound by this invisible band,
     In space the constellations move
         In a changeless flight, in great star-drifts;
     Nor break do they their family tie,
         For ten million years have made it strong:
     And age once more sits down to write
         The forth eve of the day and the morn.
     Then fish from the water forth take wings,
         And from them hatched are all of the birds,
     And snakes likewise, but from the earth,
         The beast and worm and insec's spring.
     And the deer, that feed on the meadow- land,
         Doth, in time, a pacing horse become,
     And likewise moles into elephants
        Turn, and the wild cats into lions.
     And this, within ten million years,
         Doth the fith day end, both eve and morn.
     Then the sixth day begins and mystery dark
         Upon earth doth like a mantle hang,
     And when up it lifts, a double world.
         Revolving rapidly, sphere in sphere,
     Doth move thro’ space, and intangible,
       Each to each, as they move and they whirl.
  And in the one, vibrating beings,
       Transparent, move and eat and live,
  And the soul with face and wings take flight
       And moves on thro’ space and lives and waits
  Till man is formed, for in spirit world,
       None come to this until some new form
  Doth it invite and summon ft forth.
       Hence from the dusty earth springs man,
  A form without life, but fleet, the soul
       Doth come, and into the brain of him,
  Doth go and live and make its abode,
       And man doth a living soul become.
  And knit together are man and soul,
       Nor from the one can the other part,
  Nor die can man, for he like the soul,
       And blessed-with it, must eternal be:
  But he was lone and his nature craved
       To multiply and to bring forth souls;
  And into sleep God maketh him fall,
        That he may never the secret know,
  How man is formed and bow the soul
       Doth give it life, and maketh He
  A mate for man and layeth her down,
        And man awakes, aud bv him lying
  Is a poet’s dream, and beautiful
        Her love lit eyes looketb into his
  And ideals meet, and he graspeth her
       As would cupid grasp the fair psyche.
   And to him she now must ever be
        A wife and a kind receptacle
  For his desires, aud like the flowers
       Cast her bloom and bear forth fruit to God.
  Thus creation ends, and man supreme
        Doth rule on earth and the God doth rest:
  For within the sixty million years
      Hath He planned and made the universe.
 But ten million years must still roll on,
      And man for the things of earth must care.
 And forth from neath fair Eden’s bowers,
      Doth he and his wife perambulate
 Like lovers two on a star-lit night;
      And sit do they on flowery mounds
 And watch the stars as they nightly pass.
      But she superior far to him,
 Doth say to him, "There is life beyond,
      And mystery which only spirits know:
 So let us take of this poison plant
      And of it eat that our bodies die,
 And our souls, released, may fly above
      And back and forth the two worlds through,
 That all of creation we may know.”
      But speaketh he thus: — “Dost thou not know
That knit as twins are body and soul,
     And when one dieth, so dieth both,
 And what then, shall we not surely miss
     The very thing for which thou plannest?”
“Thou fool!” she cried “and dost thou not know
     That the body before the soul must die?
For sure the one is spiritual,
     And carnal sure, the other is.
But what if by this much poisoned plant,
     The soul should grow sick nigh unto death.
Is not there a cure ? for knoweth thou
     That next every bane is an antidote,
And relief there is for every pain.
     Behold ! there standeth the tree of death,
And is not hard by the tree of life?
     And naught there is for us both to do
But eat of the bane and nestle close
     Beneath its bowers and cast our forms.
And forth reach out with our hands and pluck
     The fruit of life, and all buoyant
Lift up ourselves into heavenland.”
     Then spake he thus:—“Thou speaketh well
 And happy no* is the lot of man,
     That woman noble did come to earth
 To give him her sweet companionship.
     I will eat the fruit tor thy sweet sake,
 And for thee would I upturn the earth;
     And further more would I wreck the stars,
 And cease from motion the universe
     Till entirely thou wert satisfied.”
 Then each of the fruit of death doth eat,
     And into their bodies the poisou
 Doth work corruption, and man is doomed;
     For on rapid wings, with flaming sword,
 Doth an angel come and quick doth stand
     Midway twixt the tree of life and them.
 And speaketh he in thundering tones:—
     “Depart from here, O, ye cursed man!
 And hasten thou on ere the angry God
     Doth melt the heavens upon thy head.
 For die thou shall, yet the soul shall not;
     But doomed, it shall stand and ever wait
 At thy burial place, nor leave it,
     Except to roam in some vacant place,
 Or to visit some sad familiar spot
     Where often with toil thy flesh did sweat.
 And yet, there cometh a time some day,
     When res urrected shall be the dead;
 And rejoicing souls shall quick go forth,
    And within these resurrected forms,
 Shall move thro’ all material things,
     And mysteries of the two worlds know:
 Thus is your most sanguine hope fulfilled.
     But before doth come to pass this thing,
 From glory land doth a Prince come down
     And with his blood our redemption pay:
 For die shall he and within three days,
     Himself again lift out of the grave.
 Nor shall His body corrupt or rot,
      But thine shall decay; nor from the tomb
     Shall ever rise thy flesh and thy bone;
          But when rottest thon, those elements
     Which giveth the bone and maketh flesh
         Shall break thoir bonds until purified;
     Then reunite into pure compound.
          Thus, shall thy bodies new be made
     And gloriously resurrected.”
         Then vanish fair Eden’s fruitful lands,
     And man quick with grief burdened much,
         Goes forth in sorrow to multiply,
     And with wild beast for mastery fight.
         The sky above, with a sorrow deep,
     Doth veil, in a cloud, her dazzling face,
         And bitterly weeps till with her tears
     The whole of the earth is flooded;
          And narrowly doth the race of man
     Escape being off creation swept.
         But swift the wind to his rescue comes
     And chaseth the tides and parts the clouds,
         And man, high upon a mount rescued,
     Doth again go forth to fill the land.
         And heaven again upon him smiles,
     And forth to Sinai’s rugged tops;
         The Holy Spirit, and greatest muse,
     Doth come and kiss him with holy truth.
          And later cometh of heaven down,
     The Prince upon mount Calvery,
         And sheddethjiis blood that man may live
     And happily spend eternity.
         But the man not yet is satisfied,
     And into the skies, the telescope
         He lifts, and measures the space between
     The planets and stars that race along
         In a ceasless flight the heaven lands.
     And he knoweth why Orion’s sword
         Is in nebulae casing sheathed,
     But thinks the dipper hangs in the skies
         That drink may the weary, thirsty stars.
 But soon the secret he knoweth well,
      Just why the stars are together grouped.
 And how each one, in its fiery glow,
      Doth trail with its flames the ether through.
 He catches sound and holdeth it fast,
      And familiar he is with science,
 And knoweth that light by seconds leap
      About the fifth of a million miles
 Yet soon he may o’er the empty space
      Which is between this earth and the stars,
 Throw forth a bridge and on rapid trains,
      Carry on an extensive trade-
 And then will the merry cycler have
      A race along the etherial blue,
 Si aging sweetly o’er the airy way,
      Closing the record of the seventh day.
 But forth come angels and cut in twain
      Th’ invisible band that binds the stars,
 And they, let loose, dart off into space,
      Pell-mell in their flight, and quicken speed.
 And then ivhat spectacle to behold
      The stars that in tangled mazes fly !
 While troop in their wake, ten million souls,
      Seeking their bodies to find and catch.
 Then suddenly sounds the trump of God,
      And worlds collide and explode and burn;
 And doth our Lord, in a whirling flame,
     Snatch up the righteous into his arms
 And then doth He to the wicked cry,
     “All of ye cursed from me depart.”
 And upon a throne of wickedness,
     Doth quick' the King of darkuess reign,
 While aged time with the seventh seal
     Shuts up the record of the “last” day.
Astronomy.
      Oh science sequestered much,
      And by wisdom’s gentler touch,
            Accelerated more!
      Did not thy voice give the command
      That man must venture from his strand
      In quest of other distant land,
            Or was it ancient lore ?
      For sure into his peaceful breast,
      Thou breathed the spirit of unrest,
          And bade him search the skies:
      Thou pictured earth a moving sphere
      Whose revolutions make the year.
      And whispered to his listening ear,
          “Search heaven and be wise.”
      Thy presence round him, charming fell.
      And break did it the magic spell
          That ignorance had wrought:
      And plain did seem the merry race
      Of myriad planets thrown iu space—
      Just how each kept in his place,
          Has fostered wondrous thought.
      And oft the would-be infidel
      Has list the story that you tell
          And wisely gave a nod;
      For now the planet checkered sky
      And tangle comets hissing by
      Have siezed and borne his thoughts on high,
           Acknowledging a God.
      
      No day has dawned, no sunbeam shqne,
      Where thought of man has not yet gone:
          And the rugged panoply,
    Encasing of his mental frame,
    Doth burst with unbounding fame
    And conquers heaven in thy name,
        Science of the canopy.
     Ah i could the Alexander brave
     Be resurrected from his grave?
          Weep he would no more,
     That no worlds to conquer still
     He had; for science would fulfil
     The very letter of his will,
          Of worlds, would give him more. 
Thanksgiving. 
From the mountain’s rocky summit,
   From the distant arid plain,
Thanks-Giving comes a romping
   Through heather mead and lane.
But with his very presence
   America is aglow,
And hearts like brimming rivers
   With joy do overflow.
And too the bird is singing,
   Caroling as he flies,
While turkeys stand in waiting
   To make a sacrifice.
In the tower leaps the church bell
    And music fills the air:
The echoes ring the chorus,
    “This is a day of prayer.”
Then let this fair America,
   From mountains to the sea,
Thank God that this asylum
    Is the home of the free.
No wars are now a rageing,
    No bloody banners stain
The fair name of America
    On the heated battle plain
No cannon balls are whistling
  No startling bugle’s blast,
Disturb us by repeating
    The horrors of the pash
  O God ! how thou doth bless us
     Bountifully from above !
  And 'in return requestest
      But a token of our love.
   Ah ! could we but realize
       Thy peaceful blessings more,
   Blot out the hideous spectre
        Of fields of human gore !
   For Peace has tossed her mantle back—
       No more the years of pain—
   And with her gentle hands has stooped
       And covered up the slain.
   And bids the nations now at rest
      No more the wars release,
   And whispers in the gentle breeze,
      "Peace! Forever, peace!"
The Blind Musician.
 The vesper bells rang out the day
      The jostling crowd moved on its way:
 The sexton flared the old church light;
      The lamps were lit and all was bright.
 Then slowly thro1 the open door,
      The moving crowd began to pour;
 And smiling youth and hoary age,
      Alike were crowding round the stage.
 A blind musician, flushed and gay,
      Mounted the stage and picked his way
 To where an old piano lone
      Awaited to adjust its tone.
 His form swayed as moved by the breeze,
      Electric fingers swept o’er the keys,
And like the mighty tides of the sea
     That slowly swell and flood the lea,
He made the strains of music rise
      And swell till they had lashed the skies.
The crowd sat mute, their minds had flown
      On trembling notet to shores unknown,
 Belated teamsters left their dray
     And toward the chapel sought their way;
A star peeped thro’ the clouds o’er head
     And seemed to trip and onward sped.
The blind musician lower bent,
     And swift the rolling music went
Like the gentle ebb and the flow
     Of ocean tides that come and go,
Or like the roll of drum and fife,
     Or sounds ot conflict and of strife,
E’en more, the mocking bird would trill
     Its warbling lays and all was still
Till soft the sound of winds swept o’er,
     And broke a mighty tempest roar.
 Lightening seemed in the player’s hand;
     A music cyclone struck the land.
 Then came a creak as if were struck
     Some massive house, or trees were plucked
 From their roots, and the thunder’s might
     Made those near by leap up in fright
 Then came the lull, the storm was gone:
     The musician seemed sad and lone.
 Thought he mast of his darling wife,
     Whom he’d ne’er seen in all his life.
 But as he sat in sad repose,
     Much he looked like the last fair rose.
 Tho’ music vibrated ev’ry vein,
     A rose bloomed opt on Sharon’s plain.
 O, what genius in deed and thought!
     What mechanism by heaven wrought!
 A soul of light, tho’ earth and skies
     Gave not light to his blinded eyes,
 His fingers sought the keys once’ more,
     And played he then as ne’er before
 And tossed he like a ship on the main,
     Till his soul echoed the last sad strain.
Battle of Port Hudson.
                                               S.
     Above the plain and cannon capped,
         Towers Port Hudson’s head,
     Its mighty guns lie low and wait
         To belch a storm of lead.
     Upon the plain an army brave,
         A regiment black as night
     Behold the cannon on their left
         And cannons on their right,
     And tremble never, brave are they,
         Louisiana’s blackest sons,
     But nervous fingers hard are pressed
         Upon their glist’ning guns
     Tho’ hungry, worn and long have marched
         This army of ihe brave.
     And long the burning sun has parched
         A spot to be their grave.
     Yet bravely do they stand and wait
         The bugle’s battle call.
     And to defend their country’s cause,
         Martyred, they will fall.
     Oh bugle, stay thy startling blast !
         Beyond are desp’rate foes.
     And neath thar angry frowning fort
         A mighty bayou flows,
     Forbear, O, Captain! utter not
         Words useless and unwise,
     To waste your men in useless strife
         Is needless sacrifice.
     But ah ! they wait the order; march !
         And with bated breath:
     The order comes, and swift they run
     Over the field of death.
  Then from the summits cannon capped
     Bursts ludgment o’er the plain,
  And along the bayou’s sullen stream
     Is strewn the mangled slain.
  They stop, retreat, and then advance
       Mid destructive, grape and shell
  ’Tis but the gaping jaws of death
       The open gates of hell.
  But on they rushed and cannons belched
       Furious storms of lead
  Trees were lifted from their trunks,
       The plain o’er strewn with dead.
  ’Twas here that brave Callioux fell,
       ‘ Comrades follow me !”
   And thro’ the storm of shot and shell
        Rushed into eternity.
  And here did Planctancois cry
     “I’ll bring these colors back,
  Or report to God the reasen why,’’
      And shrank within his track.
  Another comrade standing by
      Seized the flag and stood
  Proudly waving the colors high,
      They, painted o’er with blood.
  When crash ! a ball dashed out his brain
      And by his comrade’s side,
  Laid him low upon the plain,
      His valor and his pride.
   At last the army shattered, torn,
        Forbore to battle more
   And retreated o’er a battle field
        O’er spread with human gore.
   And tho’ no more of battle scene
        Or trampling soldiers’ feet,
   Fair memory cherishes what has been,
        And soldiers’ rest is sweet.
Christmas Carol. 
     O’er the deep and boundless space,
          Live leaps the message long,
     Till zephyr’s mute and trembling tongue
          Vibrates a Christmas song.
     Her sweet and trembling notes rebound
         From heavens sacret throne:
     Her echoes spread the world around
         And make the Christmas known.
     Yet, every gentle breeze that blows
         Is music’s sweetest note,
     From zephr’s trembling tongue sent forth
         To countries far remote.
     She sits upon the passing year
        And chants a merry rhyme
     And tells us of a Savior dear
        Who came at Christmas time.
     Aud e’en the leafless trees among,
        Resounds her trembling voice—
     No music sweeter could be sung
        And Nature does rejoice.
     The clouds she drives around the sphere,
         Their peaks with luster glow,
     And from their vapored eyes the tear
         Enshrouds the earth with snow.
     But with the snow her musics come,
         The sleigh bells gentle chime,
     “Wake up’’ ! the whistling wind doth hum,
         “Rejoice ! tis Christmas time.”
Secret of the Mad House.
  O’er the green walled mead the sunlight shone
      And dew drops sparkled on the mossy stone
  Of a madhouse standing dark and lone
           While people passed it by.
  But from its gloomy walls ther came
      A mad man’s cry— In heaven’s name!
  Was this sunnv France alone to blame
           If this, her hero die?
  For he Pierre Anthon once was brave
      And was in war to France a slave,
  And to save his country was his crave.
          But madness was his fate:
  For die would he for his dear Marie,
      A sister at home, while he at sea,
  Would strive to make her a lady be
             Aud choose for a mate.
  Now she to woman-hood had grown
     And early love for a lawyer shown
  And the lawyer claimed her for his own
          And Pierre gave consent.
  Then swift the reign of terror down
      While sunny France deposed a crowu
  And the guillotins swung in er’vy town
          As some one to glory went.
  Guillotins reddened with human blood
       Swept many away renown for good
  And death rode through the neighborhood
             Upon his fiery steed
  ’Til the lawyer cross his pathway sprung
       Aud upbraided him— His thrill words rang
 Till guillotins did in trembling bang,
      But paid he for this deed
           \
 Though shut he from his eye the scenes
      Of horrible crimes and guillotins
 Yet seized he was by the Jacobins
          And sentenced to exile.
 His brother in-law had chanced to be
     Within a neighboring port at sea
 And ready to save his own country
     E’en when the message came
 Which called him away to fair Bayonne
     To receive this pris’nor sad and lone
 To depose upon a shore unknown—
     Oh France thou art to blame !
 A man, in the secret service sworn,
     Had surely the true instructions torn
 And a false one sealed and duly sworn
          Inserted he instead;
 His pris’nor masked he took to the ship
     And bade the captain allow no slip
 But ere three days his oars should dip:
     La Coste must be shot dead.
 Had Anthon known his brother-in-law,
     But naught he knew. And the lawyer
 To make him know might over awe.
     And so kept still his tongue:
 But a note he wrote, and under seal
     It was sent his brother with appeal—
 “Keep this when thou hast dealt the deal
     And night her curtains swung.’’
 The day went by, the prisoner slain,
     His body sank in the gurgling main,
 And Captain Anthon at home again,
     Back in his dear LaClare;
      But naught of this to Marie was said.
          Oh tell me, sir ! is my husband dead ?
      And with grief the captain bent his head,
          ’Twas more than he could bear.
      With uplifted hands she gave a scream,
          And staggering walked like one in a dream,
      The world was blank and strange does it seem,
            Madness had seized her brain.
      She ne’er recovered in after years,
         Her brother sat by her bed in tears,
      And a tombstone o’er her grave he rears
         To mark where she was lain.
      He, worn out with care and old and gray,
          To madness also did fall a prey
      And there was he on this summer’s day
            In truth, no idle tale,
      And e’er and aaou would come the cry,
          And people would pass and give a sigh;
      And murmuring winds in passing by
          Would waft that dreadful wail-
Sweet Singer
Reign did silence o’er the stsge
    As aged night passed on
And destiny fraught with laurels sat,
     Sweet laurels never won,
Till was read aloud her name
     And forth the sweet voiced singer came.
 While grim old oight worn ont wtth age,
     Listening to the vibrating stage,
 Wept because he must pass on.
     But hark! they do applaud her so:
 She bows, she smiles and then looks round,
     She opens her lips and lo
 Bursts foith a trembling sea of sound:
     A sea voluptuous in its swell.
 The waves rose high and then they e i
      While beat the etherial shores, the ltd ,
  And ebbing then the waves subside
      To music’s gentler flow.
  O’er the vast and, blue expanse
      Leaped the merry music on:
  Around the’.universe, the flow
       Of that angelic tone;
  Till heaven’s'shores. Jte tideleti6.
       And wavelets o’er the'portalsldashed.
  The billowy waves break forth the sounds
        Reach the great white throne and rebound
   Echoing the song of home.
Departed Spirit.
  Oh, Nathan ! Nathan ! where art thou,
      Precious flower of truth,
  What mighty hand has plucked thee from
     Thy verdent stem of youth ?
  Oh tell me why that thou art gone,
      And whither winged thy flight,
  Putting the shining helmet down
       ’Mid the heated battle-fight?
 Ah sure thou wert not weary^
     Commander young and brave !
 For leading souls was thy chief joy,
     Oh ! why then seek the grave?
 O, mortal once, but spirit now,
     Permit the muse to sing !
 Thus pouring through my own sad heart,
    Thy own true answer bring.
’Twas God, you say, Oh mighty God!
   Who summoned you to him.
And left your habitation waste
   To death grewsome"and grim.
’Twas but the tottering mass of clay
    That weak and weary grew,
Until at length the casement fell
    And out the spirit flew.
And then, O soul, not left adrift,
    By God’s'eternal 'truth,
On rapid wings was wafted home
   Just in the bloom of youth.
  Speed on, O soul, to heaven’s gate
      And through its portals sweep,
  Consign this empty mass of clay
     To silence and to sleep.
  Tis but a dream of silent years
       ’Mid glorious scenes to stray,
  When God himself will send the soul
       To resurrect its clay.
   Ah, then speed on ye noble soul !
       Yes, noble brave and true,
   I pledge to fight as you have fought
        Till I have fallen too.
   Tis but a span of life and years,
        Then list my funeral knell.
   Till then, dear Nathan, I must bid
        To you a sad farewell.
Her Last Farewell.
       O welcome death ! I'm glad you’ve come
           ’Twill serve my purpose true:
      Just cut eternity’s veil in twain
           And let my soul pass through.
      And away from Earth’s dismal scene
          And the merry making crowd, •
      The giddy whirl of the banquet ball,
          To home beyond the cloud
      Ah ! then, dear mother, weep no more,
          But strive to meet me there:
      The space is small twixt life and death,
          Fill it well with prayer—
      So now, O, death, let fall thy sword,
          ’Tis but a kiss of love
      Much welcomed by the eager soul,
          Waiting to flit above.
      Farewell to earth ! Farewell to friends.
          To maiden young and gay,
      Think well on how you spend your life,
          For death will come one day.
Passing Away. 
  At last thro' toil and suffering,
      In misery, endless pains,
  When patience seemed exhausted,
      Flits she to higher plains.
  Buoyant from neath its burdens,
     Thro’ realms celestial flies
  The soul released from sorrow,
     While the body silent lies.
  Aad three sisters, gone before her,
      Awcit their sister Kate:
  Ah ! list their glad rejoicing,
      She enters heaven’s gate.
  And light winged, sweeps she onward
     While Angels join her wake,
  And harp notes of glory sounding
     Make heaven’s portal shake.
  Xis but a race thro’ heavenly lands
      To catch the fleeting soul:
  Alas ! less fleet the angels prove,
      And she has reached the goal.
  And ’neath her God’s majestic throne
     Tells the woful story,
  And He with gentle loving hands,
     Presents a crown of glory.
God is Love. 
     Hark ! the sound of music
         Wafted from above
     Aud list the voice of angels
         Singing God is love.
     God is love and glory
         Is the oft repeated story
     Told by tongues above:
         God is love and glory
     God is peace and love.
     Christmas bells are tolling,
         Holly trees abending
     Fleeting moments rolling.
         Hearts with joy rending,
     Santa Claus is Happy
         As the cooing dove
     To hear the children singing
         God is peace and love.
     Watch the dancing star-beam.
         On the wings of night:
     See the year revolving.
         Fading in its flight.
     Hear the peal of laughter
         Wafted up above—
     Ah ! it but reminds us
        God is peace and love.
     E’en the merry river,
         As it ripples by
     With its sparkling waters
       Neath a Christmas sky,
         Bursts into merry music,
             Lifts its voice alove,
         Joyous in      its    frolic
             Sinking Goi is love.
         As earth goet a whirling,
             Spinning round the sun,
         Conscience is revolving
             All the deeds we ve done;
         Yet our hearts keep beating
             Thanks to God above,
         And our souls repeating
             God is peace and love.
Purity. 
         Purity is a secret treasure,
           Untarnished by age or time;
         To hold it is a holy pleasure,
           And to lose it is a crime.
         It is the precious stone of heaven
           That on earth our Savior wore,
         Its sparkling rays still light the way
            To Heavens Eternal shore.
         Christ made His will while on the cross,
           And it covered all reforms:
         That men may, who this diamond wear.
          Forever rest in His arms.
Moonlight Dreams. 
     Oh to view the azure sky
         Bedecked with diamonds bright,
     To catch the moon-beams as they fly
         On the rapid wings of night:
     To list the merry cricket’s song
         In the corner near at hand.
     And watch the meteors race along
         The azure heaven land:
     To see the little stars to swing
         In orbits over head,
     Or list’ the murm’ing winds that sing
         To winters silent tread.
     It makes the conscious spirit say,
         “For sure there is a God,’’
     And all of nature gives assent,
         And heaven seems to nod.
     Ah sweet influence, inmost friend!
        Lift high our inmost thought,
     That always to some Godly end.
         Be ev’ry action wrought.
Douglas.
(To his widow.)
     Is Douglas dead ?
  That grand old man, that pleasant face,
     That mirrored idol of the Negro Race !
  Has he been struck from foremost rank,
      Into earth’s dusty apron sank
  And no one to take his place ?
           God forbid !             t
  Yea forbid that the winds should mourn,
      Or on zephyr’s timely wings be borne
  That word: For death in silent tread,
      Would loath to disgrace that honored head
  By writing ’boveit “He is dead:”
             For he lives.
  And every hour that wings away,
      Prolongs his life another day.
  For sure the flower from its stalk,
      May drop and wither upon the walk,
  Yet lives to bloom again that stalk:
             So Douglas lives.
  He tho’ a plant of the tropics, grew
      In America to live and do;
  And did he it, and did it well,
      True until his gray hairs fell.
  Of a greater man, no records tell,
          And still he lives.
  Tho’ kind old mother earth, perhap,
      Doth rock him gently in her lap,
  His slumber is sweetest rest:
          Gray hairs float on-his mother’* breaat:
      Yet speak not of him, but as the best,
              For still he lives.
      And up this barrier wall of life,
           His deed amid the storm and strife,
      Doth, clutching, climb on like the vine,
           Around each rock some tendrils twine,
      Till blossom they in warm sunshine
                   To never die.
      No, never, tho’ that aged head
          Be lulled to sleep—but one was made,
      And making him, was made a cleft
          In earth, and not a remnant left,
      From which onother might be made.
          So sleep on thou aged blest,
      Thy work is done, so take thy rest.
          For bear, O winds, to murmur aught
      But praise for mighty deeds he wrought!
          Rock gently in thy orb, O earth,
      Fret not him of humble birth,
               But let him rest.
      Stoop down, O heaven, kiss his brow,
          For oft before thee did he bow;
      Let holy angels watch his grave,
          And ne’er let man forget the brave.
      The good, the noble, tumble slave
          Who rose to highest fame.
Immorality. 
      Imniorality the terror of our homes,
   With hoisted banners in procession comes,
       And we sit here as stone
   And watch him while he in his demon tread,
       Raiseth the sword and strikes fair virtue dead,
   And on o’er her form with victorious tread,
       He mounts upon her throne.
       In tyranny he rules while naught remains,
   AS o’er our young his fierce sway he gains
       Wide spread in home and state,
   But hang our heads in shameful regret
      That we gave our girls to pay shame’s great debt,
   And now watch hope’s luminaries set
       And mourn fair virtue’s fate.
      ’Neath the tyrant’s gaze society belle
   Quailed and from her state of purity fell.
      And some one came along
   And a crape did he o’er her door way hang,
       And wrote—“Modesty died of chronic slang,
   The kneel of her funeral beer-bells rang
       And gamblers sang the song.
        For her soul to the sporting house went home
    To forever with white-robed demons roam
        E’en as her grave was dug;
    And the preacher who spoke the sad farewell,
        Had made that membership of demons swell;
    And that no member in his church would tell,
        Gave each a whiskey jug.
         Now both hands in with the tyrant he stands
     And force the people, by fierce commands
            To recognize “that thing.”
     Who owns the saloons and gambling dives
       And betrays our homes, our daughters and wives,
     And to which our girls with all of their lives,
            On to his coat-tail cling.
        Oh heaven and God ! can this be for long
     That purity must be sold for a song
             And we sit still and gaze
     While our girls on the public thoroughfare
         With the sport in his slang do gladly share,
     And to chastise them we would not dare,
             Oh God ! our courage raise.
         Let every woman and man and boy,
     With determined hearts that beat with joy,
                Take up fair virtue’s gun
     And then onward to battle like a host,
         Let not our wives aud our daughters be lost
     But slay tbe tyrant and count not the cost,
                For this work must be done.
  
Friends. 
   Somewhere in the depths of human hearts
       Is the many chambered cell,
   In each compartment a treasured friend
       Doth deem it fit to dwell.
  
  But oft’, in the course of fleeting years
      Friends step out and quick depart,
  And sacred memory writes, mid tears,
      Their names upon the aching heart.
  And thro’ all the lapse of weary years
      Their names some happiness tend,
  E’en sacred to us the precious spot
      Where a friend doth part with friend.
 Not even miles of the earth and sea,
    Nor the worlds that drift in space,
 Can come twixt us and the memory
    Of the pleasant friendly face.
 Nay, not all the years that time can roll,
     In all of this life’s domain,
 Can tarnish the links of friendship dear,
    For it is a golden chain.
A chain that girds the whole earth with love'
     And calms life’s fretful sea:
It binds the earth to heaven above,
     And time to eternity.
But ah! to the aoul what awful teat,
    E’en more than the tongue can tell,
And ah ! what sorrow fills our breast
    To say to a friend farewell !
 Forever Mine. 
         She is mine, altho’ the fair wheel of fate
      Doth seem to say that I am just too late,
          And the ring on her finger mocks in scorn
      And makes my heart ache from night until morn,
          It was heaven’s holiest high design
      That we should wed and so she is mine,
                    Forever mine.
         Mine when the winter sun wanes in its flight.
      Mine when the moon beams drift over the night,
         Mine when forth the litte violets peep
      Awake in bed from their mid winter sleep;
         And e’en the wind of the summer tide breeze
      Doth catch it and whisper among the trees,
                   Forever mine.
          Mine as I watched her in her early life,
      And oft I vowed that she would be my wife,
          And at school I watched her the live-long day.
      And admired her form when she was at play.
          And e’en tho’ I knew she had lovers nine,
      Yet still I had claimed her and she was mine,
                      Forever mine.
         Mine thro’ all of the long years of the past,
      Mine when her woman-hood was reached at last.
         Yea mine thro’ all of the long years to be
      And still mine in the vast eternity;
         Altho’ she is another’s promised bride,
      She is mine so the heavens will decide,
                   Forever mine.
    Yes mine in spite of her pride and her scorn,
My heart beats her name from night until morn,
    And oft’ as we wander in nights of June,
Our hearts in love, and both beating a tune,
   We study the stars as they dance and shine
And then she denies it, that she is mine.
               Forever mine.
     Bet mine she is and oft’ when I am sleep,
These feelings of love back over me creep;
    She comes to me rad'ant in her charms
And like mist we drift in each others’s arms,
    Ah ! could we thro’ all of the ages long
Drift thus, my soul would e’er vibrate the song
               Forever mine.
    And so oft’ at the noon-tide when I rest
And my head in slumber kisses the chest
    In a vision 1 lead her, as my bride,
To the altar rail and stand by her side,
    Our arms lovingly round each other twine,
And I say,in my sleep, she is mine, she is mine,
               Forever mine.
   She’s mine when I wake and mine when I pray
Mine till the coming of the judgment day,
   Yea mite until the awful trumpet sounds
And caught up the echo, “she’s mine” rebounds:
   For we are wed forever, wed in love,
And she’s mine in the sacret courts above
               Forever mine.
   Yea mine when th’ eternal judge decends,
Mine when my knee in humility bends;
   I will clasp her close to my beating heart
And pray O, God, do let us never part !
    This precious treasure and myself are thine
I have brought her home, but still she is mine.
              Forever mine.
     And I rise from neath his majestic throne,
Still clasping her fondly claim her my own,
     And all of the heavenly angels sing,
And the sweet wedding bells of glory ring
     As with them ten million harps combine
In proclaiming—she’s mine, she’s mine, she’s mine,
               Forever mine.
Battle of Manilla.
         Just off Manila’s lighted port,
              *Corr’gidor and Cabilla lay,
         And sentinel like each island, armed,
              Kept watch at the mouth of the bay;
         While cross each narrow neck between
              The mainland and its guardian isle,
         A chain of mines were hung unseen
              To make our ships a funeral pile-
         Between the isles a current swept
               And sped unchecked a spreading sheet,
         Beyond, an island city slept
               Protected by the Spanish fleet,
         And on the bay black night was King,
               The winds were strolling toward the lea:
         Our men-of-war like birds on wing
               Were speeding o’er the China sea.
         'Twas midnight by the Eastern clocks,
               Strong batteries guarded the seas,
         Manilla shone in lighted blocks
                And the Spaniards were at their ease
         No man of sense, the captain thought,
                Would clinch with death to enter there;
         But Dewey brave, our hero, wrought
                A deed none other man would dare.
         For like the winds on wings of night,
                He swept the secret passage way
         With ships and men prepared to fight
                 As his fleet put into the bay.
         Just then the drowsy iles awoke
                And spied, it seems, the phantom floats,
* corregidor. 
And thunder like their voices spoke
     With roaring flames from cannon throats
 Manilla ’woke from slumber sweet,
     A frightened queen in robes of night,
And rushed into the drowsy street,
     Producing pamic in her flight.
The winds helped bear the fleeting skirts,
     The streets echoed the sounding tread
Till forth upon the eastern sky
     The sun its golden glory spread.
And Sunday morn beheld our fleet
     In haste a steaming to the fray.
While from each yawing cannon mouth
     Was bursting judgment on the bay.
The Spanish fleet and batteries loud
    Spat out their flames the waters o’er
While from our ships with pennons proud,
    Came one reverberating roar.
A cloud of smoke spread o’er the bay
    And thro’ it loud the thunders crashed:
Beneath it was the shimm’ring sea,
    Resplendent as the lightning flashed.
Terrific shells, hot thunder bolts,
    From Yankee cannon’s deadly pour,
Burst flaming o’er the Spaniard’s decks
    And made them slippery with gore.
Old Spanish hulks were raised on high
    And poised were they the waters o’er,
Their magazines lit up the sky
    And frightened gunboats dashed ashore.
Then all was still, the smoking cloud
    Went up from o’er the judgment seat
And coiled its sombre glory round
    The flags of our victorious fleets.

PREFACE.
I do not deem it necessary to write a preface to these few
poems, but, somehow, I have a tender feeling for this little
book that is about to be sent out into the world, to bear such
an humble burden as my feeble thought. I do not know, but
I believe that if this book could speak it would sternly refuse
'to go on such an humble mission ; but, since I have imposed
upon it this duty, knowing the many censuring critics it may
have to encounter, I believe it my duty to say a word, for the
very book's sake, that may cause the censuring tongue of man
to wag less swiftly
First, I must say that these poems were written under very
unfavorable circumstances. Dignity may not allow me to
explain, but I will say that they were composed during my
leisure time, which has been limited. I say leisure time-no,
I have none; I should have said sacrificed time, time when
the body was almost exhausted from manual labor, when rec-
reation was greatly needed; and you who know what a strug-
gle the mind has battling with an exhausted body in trying
to perform such a task as this can easily allow for this feeble
result. The mind can not work when the body is exhausted,
and I assure you that I would not have written one line had
Nature not forced me to do so. Often at my work-bench, when
I thought greater speed was needed to finish my daily task,
these poems-or whatever you may call them.-would flash into
my mind and I would be restless to sketch them upon paper that
I might retain them until my day's work was done. Some-
times I could find it convenient to do so, sometimes I could
not, and when I would fail to sketch them, at night the muse
would not return Thus you can understand why I have not
written more.
I must also state that I am conscious of the fact that this
work does not come up to the standard work of the mighty
masters of poetry, but you need not censure me--it is not my
fault. The muse has not yet taught me to sing as they. Had
she given me the same power, do you not think I would have
written?
Moreover, I am just beginning, and perhaps she does not
care to intrust me with the whole art at once: she may have
thought it best to give me one talent first that she might see
how I would use it, and I assure you that I think I should
have done better. Often I have thought of laying these few
poems aside and not giving any to the public until I became
able to write as good poems as other poets. I publish them
because I do not wish the muse to find me with my one talent
buried when she comes to make up her jewels and reward her
servants. She might serve me as his lord did the other one-
talented servant we read of in the Bible.

EXPLAINING DIALECT POEMS.
You may wonder why the dialect words in my humorous
poems are so few compared with those in other dialect poems,
but if you will notice such characters as I have portrayed you
will find, as I have, i hat the most illiterate persons. living now
among so many who are cultured, do not speak the whole
dialect but speak correctly one half of their words. So I have
written just as the masses impressed me.

AVENGING THE MAINE.
Sing, O Muse! the avenging of the Maine,
The direful woes, the fate of Spain.
A heinous deed to our ship they wrought,
Untimely death to our crew they brought.
Our soldiers' valor forever tell,
Who for revenge both fought and fell;
Volcanic boats over the water went,
The burning revenge from them was sent.
Shafter's army, pray tell me all
Who died bravely rallying to the call ?
What of the Negroes in the band,
Did they scatter or did they stand ?
To this question I'll answer brief,
They fought like demons without a chief.
I'll ever sing of the memorable day
When negro valor was brought into play ;
In the hottest battle their captain died,
They did not scatter, “Onward they cried.”
Their eyes on victory intensely fixed,
Negro and white blood that day flowed mixed.
These are the first to embark on land,
There were no cowards in tbis band;
When the story you shall hear
They to you will ever seem dear.
Hold of her harp the muse then takes,
A minor chord on it she makes ;
All sịt quietly curious to hear,
But from her eye there falls a tear;
Her voice was choked, her bosom with sorrow did swell,
As from the strings her fingers fell.
O'er her face there came a frown,
She took a seat upon the ground,
Then to her side they quickly went;
From her breast a groan she sent.
Within our arms we held her head
And to the muse we softly said:
“Tell us, O Muse! what gives thee grief,
And if we can, we'll give relief?”
"From her breast again she sighed,
With throbbing voice to us replied,
"The story wbich you urge to hear
None can tell without a tear,
Grief to you this tale will bring
If I in poetry play and sing.
I can not sing the grievous woes
I'll tell the story to you in prose;
Now you all must listen with care
If the story you would hear;
From the beginning I'll now relate
That coming ages may know the fate.
In the land of Cuba there's a nation brave,
Whom the cruel Spaniards held as slaves.
One night their leaders in conference met
To see if their freedom they could get.
They the yoke of slavery bore
Till their shoulders bad galded sore.
Maceo, the first to take the stand,
He was the leader of the band ;
Unto them all he did declare
He could no longer slavery bear.
A bill to Spain he sent to see
If they would set the Cubans free;
And when the bill to Spain was sent
Becoming enraged the bill they rent.
To the soldiers she was heard to tell-
“Go! Murder the Cubans, if they rebel.”
Unto them all she gave command
To bring the leaders of the band.
The Cuban leaders they could not get,
There was a skirmish when they met;
When they had driven the leaders away,
The women and children they would slay
They murdered th' babes that knew no harm-
They stabbed them in their mothers' arms.
While killing all by sword they could,
From others they withheld the food,
To utterly starve a Cuban race.
To us it seemed a sad disgrace;
The freedom of Cuba then was our plea,
We called upon our General Lee,
Our beloved general to Cuba we sent
To see what the cruel Spaniards meant.
Over we sent our best ship“ Maine."
Spain to us had done the same;
Both were sent in truce's name.
Our ship in Havana's harbor stood;
But Spain was eager for our blood.
And in the secret of the night
On us explodes a dynamite;
And while her crew were fast asleep,
Some were hurled to the mighty deep.
The ship went down beneath the wave
Before we could our sailors save.
I can not picture the fearful sight,
Nor bear to think of the dreadful night,
When they performed the cruel deed;
Unless my heart is made to bleed.
Now the story you may abhor;
I've told the causes of the war.
The news was sent by the swiftest speed,
Announcing the Spaniard's cruel deed.
Sorrow and anger to us it brought,
To hear of the deed the Spaniards wrought.
Over the world a clamor rose,
And all the world that clamor knows;
Some were counting up the cost,
Others wailing over the lost.
Revenge! Revenge! our voices rang;
On to war was the song we sang.
To the White House we quickly went
To ask war of our President.
In the Senate, war was the cry,
Our President did not comply ;
To all of us he would rise and say:
"To go to war is more than play.”
The bill for war he would declare,
He could not sign till he prepare.
Soon his plans had been well made,
The cry for war he at once obeyed.
A number of men he first did ask.
To get them did not seem a task,
And every time a call was made,
Our loyal sons at once obeyed.
Of the brave heroes I now will tell,
Who for vengeance fought and fell:
Dewey and Sampson first I'll sing,
On my harp their names shall ring.
They first for vengeance made their way;
The woe of Spain began that day;
It seemed as He, the God Supreme, -
Down from His throne viewed all the scenes ;-
The deed of Spain He did abhor,
And lent us aid throughout the war.
With every fleet a guard was sent
To keep us safe where'r we went;
Around the mines to show us a path,
And manage the guns that burled our wrath.
The aid to us was beyond cost;
Not a boat of ours was lost.
Hobson's valor must not be untold ;
'Twas brave as any of the fold
The deed that made for him a name,
And I a muse must sing his fame,
To block th' Spaniard's escaping way,
He sank th’ Merrimac into th' bay.
The deed performed, his crew to save;
Their names I've placed among the brave.
The deed showed Sampson a safe way
To reach the port, Santiago Bay
He reached; the woe had begun,
That would not 'till the victory was won.
THE MEMORY OF MACEO.
Ye men of Cuba, to you I call,
Mourn for your leader, place crape on the wall;
Tell the young children that play at your feet
Of the wonderful General that has fallen to sleep.
Sleep! yes in the graveyard he lies;
But his spirit's sweetly resting, beyond the skies.
We think of his work, we say he was grand;
Why not let for him a monument stand;
One that will reach to the ethereal blue,
Bearing the name Maceo, will do.
Dear Maceo, our hearts pine for thee!'
For whom thou died, can say we are free.
SIEGE OF MANILA.
Just a few miles from Manila Bay
Near the close of a summer day,
When the sun was flooding with gold the west,
Our fleet was ordered to stop and rest.
After the regular meal was served,
Each returned to the usual place;
All stood gazing with mute and awe
Into the fiery dome of space,
Watching the stars steady blaze
As they down upon us gaze.
I will never forget the night
All the stars were shining bright,
A full orbed moon hung in the west
Watching to see the great contest;
The wind was of a steady gale,
It was a pleasant night to sail;
The ocean waves were rolling along
Pealing forth their mournful song.
Soon from the ocean a mist arose
As Nature's starry book close.
After another night had passed
And the morn was coming fast.
But before the gleam of day
We sailed to take Manila Bay;
Soon Manila revealed in sight,
From the window gleamed light;
When we saw the deadly guns -
O'er our fleet a stillness comes-
Each stood waiting by his gun,
Perfect stillness, not a breath,
An instant may bring sudden death.
Like a hero they did stand,
Waiting to hear the "fire" command;
The mist that from the ocean rose
Hid us from our Spanish foes.
When the enemy did not blast
Through our fleet a whisper passed.
Fortune it seems is on our side,
We have entered and are not spied;
By the fort we began to start,
But a distance we sailed apart,
One by one by the guns we stole
As a wolf in a shepherd s fold;
All our fleet had safely passed,
Except McCulloch which was the last
Fortune would not it pass;
In its furnace occurred a wreck.
And sparks went flying from its stack.
The sparks that from the stack did fly
Met at once the fortman's eye;
Through glasses they began to peep,
To their surprise they spied our fleet.
A cry of terror! The signal rung,
Shells came blazing from their guns
Before an instant could have passed
Around us shells were falling fast;
The mines in vain they did explore,
But we were safe around her shore.
Our captain gave command to fire
Which seemed to be our soul's desire;
Before the word he could hardly speak,
Shells went blazing from all our fleet;
We were burning with hatred ire,
We filled the air with shells and fire.
While the battle was raging high
And glowing shells were seen to fly,
Dewey back through memory gazed-
Saw the Maine, became enraged;
With his dazzling sword in hand
Whirling it high, he gave command.
Fury came blazing from his eve
With thundering voice was heard the ciy:
"Remember the Maine, Speed! Haste !
Careful boys, no shells to waste."
They remembered. their blood did run;
They hurled revenge through every gun
Our boats like burning Vesuvius seemed,
From our guns shells poured in streams.
Directed by an immortal eve
Not a stray ward shell did fly;
Each of the shells from the gun that went
Performed the mission on which it was sent,
Our captain takes his glass in hand
And over the battle begins to scan:
“Stop the guns," he quickly cries,
** Fortune now is on our side,
Spain's whole fleet is in a blaze,
Sinking fast beneath the waves.”
When this command to us was given,
Three haughty cheers went up to heaven;
When the sun sent up her beam,
Not a Spanish boat was seen;
But the whole Manila fleet
Were buried in the mighty deep.
SIEGE OF SANTIAGO.
Here Spain's dreaded host did stand,
The strongest fort in all the land;
When we entered into the bay
The eves of the world were turned that way,
Watèhing breathless, eager to see
What the issue of the fight would be.
Morro Castle was standing bold,
As it did in days of old.
Its deadly guns seemed to say,
“I'll hold the entrance of the way.”
A pleasant morning, a Sabbath day.
We were resting within the bay,
Soon our day of peace did change.
It proved a day for our revenge.
Sampson's heart did eager yearn
Cevera's secret plans to learn;
Schley, he sent to the upper shore
If the plans he might explore.
This somehow seems divine,
He sailed just at the proper time;
On their way to their surprise,
Two coming vessels met their eyes.
Through glasses we began to peep,
Behold! It was Сevera's fleet,
Rushing toward us in swiftest speed;
Two fierce boats were in the lead :
“Cevera's escaping!" Schley cried.
He rang the signal far and wide;
But before the story he could tell
The air was filled with fire and shell,
Shells that were not sent in vain;
It proved a direful fate to Spain.
Their ships in flames of fire were blazed-
Till we on them in pity gazed,
And sent a boat in chivalry's name
To save them from the burning flame.
Their direful fate's too great to tell,
To them it proved a fiery hell.
Schley gazing out from left to right,
To him it seemed a dreadful sight;
Ships were blazing on every side,
“We have revenge,” he quickly cried.
Many Spaniards on that day
Were burned and buried in the bay.
THE STARS AND STRIPES SHALL
NEVER TRAIL THE DUST.
'Tis a colored captain's story
That was told to Uncle Sam,
He was mustered out because the war was o'er;
He had borne his honor bravely
And the victory he had won,
He came to deliver up the flag he bore.
He was standing at the White House
With the Stars and Stripes in hand,
His sword and uniform with gore were red ;
A bullet had pierced his body,
Yet it had not caused bis death,
As he gave to bim the flag he slowly said :
“ Uncle Sam, here is Old Glory,
That you trusted to my care,
Through the hottest I have ever held my trust;
Though the bullets have rent my body,
Yet to you I can truly say,
That the Stars and Stripes have never trailed the
dust.'"
CHORUS
No, the Stars and Stripes shall never trail the dust while I live,
But shall ever wave untarnished o er the free;
Yes, the shells may rend my body,
And may death come if it must,
But the Stars and Stripes shall never trail the dust.
Uncle Sam then took the flag
And gazed into the Hero's face;
He said, “ My son, you're black, but still you're a man;"
On his breast he placed a medal,
And he said remember me;
To forget you; no, my boy, I never can!
Son, your Uncle knows no color,
Neither any party line;
The call I made was simply for the brave.
And you loving soldiers heard me
And rallied to the call,
And my country from destruction you have saved.
I saw you darkies bear the flag
Through shells up San Juan Hill,
I saw the Spaniards from your valor flee;
And the Stars and Stripes were waving
O'er Morro Castle bold;
They are waving now in Cuba o'er the free.
CHORUS
No, the Stars and Stripes shall never trail the dust while I live;
But shall ever wave untarnished o'er the free:
Yes, the shells may rend my body
And may death come if it must;
But the Stars and Stripes shall never trail the dust
SLAVERY.
Oh slavery! why wast thou so cruel,
So cursed and so black;
To leave your cruel footprints
Upon our Father's back.
Why did you not beat him,
And say to him, depart?
Why wast thou so cruel
As to crush his manly heart?
Even now his hair has faded
And blossomed for the grave;
Yet I can see within him,
Traits learned while a slave.
Why didn't you enslave the women,
And let their virtue live?
Slavery! thou wast so cruel,
How can the women forgive?
Women as pure as dewdrops,
As a baby at its birth;
But slavery's ravishing passion
Crushed their virtue to the earth.
Mother didn't finish the story ;
Her sons began to pine.
She pressed them to her bosom ;
God said, “Vengeance is mine."
I did not begin this story
To enrage your little heart;
I thought the cruelties of slavery
To you I would impart.
And if you would take vengeance
The debt lite couldn't pay,
God will judge them rightly
On resurrection day.
WAVE ON THOU FLAG.
Wave on, wave on the air,
O, flag that we have bought!
Stars and stripes for unity
Tells for what we fought.
Fade thou not by rain,
May whirlwinds passing by,
Not dash thee into tatters;
But leave thee in the sky.
Stand firmly thou mast pole,
On which the flag doth wave;
Many who performed that duty.
Are lying in the grave.
Farewell thou flag, wave on,
Perform tby duty well;
Wave gently o'er the burial place
Of those who fought and fell.
SEEKING HER BOY.
On a battle field, when the smoke had cleared away,
I saw a woman strolling among the dead;
'Twas a mother whose hair had faded gray,
Now and then she'd stoop and raise a soldier's head.
She was seeking for her boy, her only pride,
Who as a soldier had been taken from his home;
She'd heard that he had fallen in the fray
And had come to bear his body to the tomb.
She reached the place where raged the thickest fray,
The dead were lying thick upon the ground;
It was there I saw the mother kneel to pray
For her loving boy had not yet been found.
From the ground with trembling form she rose,
The tears were falling freely from her eyes;
With folded arms toward sweet heaven she gazed :
“Oh, where's my boy!” with throbbing voice she cries.
Soon she saw a form lying in the gore;
She knew it was the body of her own.
Like a streak of lightning to the form she tore,
Around his neck her arms were quickly thrown.
She raised his head, his blood-stained lips to kiss,
In his forehead she saw the bullet's gaping wound
Too weak, she could not gaze on this;
She gives a cry, sinks helpless to the ground.
I watch at length to see the mother rise,
She did not seem to raise her hoary head;
Nearing, I found the mother by his side,
Still clinging to his neck, though she was dead.
MEMORY OF LINCOLN AND THE YANKEES.
Among the dear old friends we darkies cherish
Within the highest portals of our hearts,
The name that sounds as dear as dear old mother's
Is the Yankees' name, and from us it will never part.
When first I heard of Lincoln and the Yankee
My heart sprang to the zenith of its joy;
In this heart of mine it quickly nestled,
My love for it no force can quite destroy.
Lord, while these rolling waves of time and pleasure
Dash against their sacred nestling place,
With Thy powerful hand stay it and guide us,
Let nothing from our heart these names erase.
Great! great! is the debt we darkies owe them,
A debt no hand but Thine can ever pay ;
Lord bless and from all danger guide them,
Let nothing from our hearts these names erase.
O! ye men that fought and are still living,
In whose veins the Yankee blood holds sway;
In our hearts for thee there lives a kindness
That will not be erased till judgment day.
Ye mortals who lie in graves and trenches,
Who fell to free this helpless negro race;
No mortal's name like thine do we reverence,
Within our hearts thou hast a sacred place.
I do not wish to call your souls from heaven,
But could I call your bodies from the ground;
On earth thou might live in peace for ages
With sweetest oil I'd daily balm your wounds.
To you 0, ye dear and happy mothers !
Thou whom the Northern race hast freed;
Grasp your loving infant from the cradle,
Tell them of the Yankees blessed deed.
THE DEATH OF HECTOR.
I will not attempt the task
Of the Iliad to relate;
But I will tell of Hector
And how he met his fate.
The Trojan war was over
And with glowing chariot wheels,
The Greeks were driving madly
The Trojans from the field.
The Trojans fled for safety
To a city they had planned ;
And they heard the voice of Priam
Who upon the wall did stand.
Crying, “ Wanderer throw wide the gate
Unless this day the fleeing Trojans
Will meet their certain fate.”
The wanderer sprang to the gate
And opened it at Priam's command,
And all of them entered with safety;
But Hector on the outside did stand.
He stood in mad confusion
With fury in his eye;
Saying, “This day I shall meet Achilles,
Though I be doomed to die.”
But his aged father saw him,
Who was standing on the walls;
With withered bands he beats his breast,
With feeble lips he calls.
Hector, Oh Hector, my boy, please enter,
Save us from grievous woes."
But angry Hector would not bearken
Then the gate was closed.
He viewed the army coming
Like a whirlwind mixed with leaves,
And great Achilles secretly leads
Drawn. by wbite foaming steeds.
Their chariot wheels glowing with fire.
Look! Hector meets their eyes
And they all rushed towards him
As racers towards a prize.
But Achilles' horses being swiftest
The race he seems to gain,
And hand to hand in battle
Hector in the dust was slain.
And after they had killed him-
The most brutal scene of all,
Achilles fastened him to his chariot,
Dragging thrice around the wall.
A DRUNKEN A.B.
One cold wet winter evening,
I was making for my home,
I passed a drunkard lying in the mire;
The sleet was falling fast
And my heart for him was moved;
I thought it best to aid him to the fire.
Then from the ground I raised him,
Bore him struggling to my home,
Which was a little distance from the place;
And when my home I entered
And the light had shone around,
I was attracted by the beauty of his face.
A fair young man just in his prime
Who wore a classic brow;
The rays of light were gleaming from his eyes,
On bis vest there was a medal
With the signature to show
That in college he had won it as a prize.
Soon he was sleeping soundly
In a chair before the fire,
Then from his breast the medal I took and read.
I saw he was an A.B.
And the poet of his class,
An honest valedictorian the medal said.
IT' was then my soul was lightened
As I gazed into his face,
I knew it was a genius I had found;
I thought who threw the arrow
That had pierced his manly heart,
And brought the noble victim to the ground.
Well, at first I deemed it rum
That had brought him to this state,
And then I thought what caused him first to drink;
Then he was sleeping soundly
And myself I did not know
Through the night the cause I could only think.
But next morning soon I rose
And his breakfast was prepared,
To have him dine with us I thought a treat:
To him we were a stranger
And at first he did refuse;
But at last we prevailed with him to eat.
Around our family table,
He was seated at the head,
And while he ate, our hearts did eager yearn;
We knew he was a genius
That had fallen to this state,
And much-the cause--we all desired to learn.
I told him where I found him
And his face began to change;
I asked bim what had brought him to this state;
While the tears were falling fast,
“It was Mary," be replied;
This story then to me he did relate:
"After I finished college,
I was doing fairly well;
In Chicago I was cashier of a bank;
But one day there came a letter
From the girl that had my heart,
It was an arrow. Oh, it pierced me and I sank!
,
T'was from my youth, yea childhood,
That this girl had won my heart,
Before our God she promised to be mine:
But when the time for invitations
To our comrades should be sent;
In this letter the vow she did decline.
I'll never forget the day,
Yea, time can never erase
The hour when the letter I did receive;
At first I was dumbfounded
And it seemed my heart would break;
But somehow the message I could not believe.
I was standing at my window
When the letter came to hand;
I knew the man to whom I was dealing chang;
I tried to bear it bravely,
But then all could plainly see
That with me there was something going strange.
The boy that brought the letter
Stood gazing into my face;
I bade him go, the answer not to wait;
I read the letter over,
Mused a moment to myself;
Tonight I'll call and make the matter straight.
Each moment seemed an hour,
I thought night would never come;
My assistant then I called to take my place;
Then from the bank I darted
And I hastened to her home;
I wanted just to gaze into her face.
She was standing by the window
And she saw me as I came;
She.felt her guilt and to a closet fled;
At the door her servant met me,
Being instructed what to say,
“ There's no one here but me,” he quickly said.
Well I knew it was false,
But I knew not what to do;
Had I the means, death might have been my fate.
But at last I departed,
Though I knew well she was there;
I had seen her when I entered through the gate.
Back to my home I struggled,
There I sat in deepest grief
Trying in vain to pass the time away;
Of course it was then evening
And I'd go again at night,
A moment then to me did seem a day.
Sometimes it would seem too hard,
But some way the grief I bore;
I called again before the sun went down.
But to be deceived again;
She had taken the early train,
With my heart she'd departed from the town.
At the door her mother met me
And the story she did tell;
It was then the arrow stung me
And you found me where I fell.
Then I did not cease to love her,
But with her desired to go;
For the way I prayed her mother;
But she vowed she did not know.
All that night around her mother
I wept and tried her heart to win;
On my knees I knelt and prayed her
That for her daughter she might send.
True my mother did weep with me,
From her the way I could not plead ;
I decided then to seek her,
Anywhere my mind should lead.
I left her house next morning
And to the bank I went again;
But my heart was filled with sadness,
It seemed that all my hope was vain.
That day I gave up my position
Until the next ensuing year,
For my heart was stolen from me
And I have sought it far and near.
Then I told my friend the story
And he too, wept when he did hear;
Then he gave to me some brandy,
He said my grief he would help to bear.
Since that day I've sadly wondered,
If my lover I could find,
Since that day the thirsting spirit
To the brandy seems to bind.
Eight months today I've not returned,
Neither has she, this letter said ;
And since that day I've been wondering
If the girl I loved is dead.
ENVY.
In a flower garden beautiful and tall,
Stood a bloomed lily above them all;
The lily was slender made,
Yet a humming bird stooped for shade.
Evening came, it had its rest,
Saying, “In this blossom I'll build my nest;
In this blossom my love will lie,
And I will dwell here till I die."
Another bird saw him content;
Asked to build, she gave consent.
So on one blossom build them all;
Blown by a zephyr it breaks and falls.
The mother bird returned and found
Her nest and blossom on the ground.
To the heart of a maiden tender and sweet,
The heart of a lover went forth to meet;
To another lover the maid seemed sweet,
By the maids consent he leaps to meet;
To one sweetheart clings them all,
They were too many and had to fall.
The loving maid turned around
And found the lovers upon the ground.
A LECTURE.
I was gointer make a speech;
But yer all began to frown;
Dats what I say about yer darkies
Yer tri to hold each uder down.
I am glad you aint de master,
De one dat sot beyond der skies,
Ef I wasn't ouah boy or gal
I am sure that I could never rise
Tom's scard Dick will get er ofis;
Dick's scard Henry ul git er prize.
Dats why we don't rise any faster,
We've got ourselves to organize.
THE GIRL AND THE BIRDS.
A little girl with tender hands
Went with the birds to play ;
The little birds with golden wings
Then swiftly flew away.
Do stay
with me
Pray leave me not, ob little birds!
I pray; I did not mean to do you harm
With you I came to play.
The little bird sailed on the air,
Would not her calling heed,
But gave a flutter of their wings
So to increase their speed.
The earth in wheeling on her course,
Giving a mighty hum,
Said, “Do not cry my little one
They to the ground must come.”
For to my sceptre all must bow,
The wicked and the good;
I have the key to the great store
From which they get their food.
SUMMER IS GONE.
Sweet summer is gone,
I stand in ice and sleet;
Where is thy storehouse,
Tell me that I may seek.
I turn to the woods,
That was once an arbor green ;
Nothing now but (bare) trees
And the brown leaves are seen.
The grass on which I lay
In the warm summer glow,
I look, and lo! 'tis now
A sheet of ice and snow.
THE END OF DAY.
When day's dusty journey 's run,
Laborers fill the homeward path;
The world worn out by toil and sun,
In dewy mist must take a bath.
Birds unto their nests will fly,
Crickets to their bearthplace creep;
Worldly cares are laid aside,
Man too takes a bath in sleep.
Whatever's bent in the glowing sun,
When Nature bathes, it will arise;
Withered corn blades will unroll,
All things new will greet our eyes
THE EVENING.
The sun is sinking o'er the hills,
Casting its gold on earth;
Young children in the harvest fields
Hail it with joy and mirth.
For often through the glowing day,
They gazed up with a frown;
And wondered in their little hearts,
Why it would not hasten down.
The Master seeing the fiery ball
Hiding its rays of light,
He gives His signal as to say:
“Cease laboring for the night.”
Children under a master's rod
Who are toiling all the day,
Hear the sound of the evening bell
And skip homeward on their way.
AFRICA'S CRY.
From the land of Africa
Comes a faint cry,
“ Send us the gospel,
In ignorance we die."
Dying unconscious
Of a heavenly home,
We know not the Saviour
What will be our doom? .
Send us a teacher,
Who will show us the way.
We know not the law,
How can we obey ?
Come to us quickly,
We have thrown wide the gate;
Millions of us
Do anxiously wait.
i
THE STARS.
Tell me, oh Star, art thou a jewel,
Shining in the sky so bright;
Or art thou a little lantern,
Hung from Heaven to give us light.
Often when I am alone
And think no one is nigh,
I glance into the heavens,
And catch your little eye.
I do not know your mission,
That none doth understand;
But I know if thou could'st do so,
Thou would'st tell me tales of man.
Some men are so foolish,
There's no eye but their own,
And steal out in the darkness
Where their deeds of vice are sown.
Ob Star, I wish thou had'st a voice,
To reach to the uttermost dell;
Where men would commit their evils,
Would whisper, and say “I'll tell."
4
Oh, if thou could only talk,
Many wonders thou would'st tell;
Thou that saw within the walk,
The trap in which the purest fell.
All mankind feel quite free,
When they think no one can see;
And cease to care how slack they wall
Ob, if thou could only talk!
If thou that shed the faintest beam,.
Could only tell wbat thou hast seen
It would be enough.
NOTHING TO DO.
The fields are wbite,
The laborers are few;
Yet say the idle,
There's nothing to do.
Jails are crowded,
In Sunday Schools few;
We still complain
There's nothing to do.
Drunkards are dying,
Your sons, it is true;
Mothers' arms folded,
With nothing to do.
Heathen are dying,
Their blood falls on you;
How can you people
Find nothing to do?
SATAN.
Satan's a robber,
He works day and night;
Go where you may,
He's always in sight.
Go to your closet,
And kneel down in prayer;
You need not be frightened;
For Satan's not there.
He lurks around poverty,
He lurks around gold;
He's always on duty,
Seeking a soul.
LIFE'S ROAD.
With joy I plod life's weary road,
Sometimes free, then with a load;
The cares I gather through the day
At night my banjo will drive away.
If life comes sweet, I'll only smile
Because it will please me well.
If life comes bitter, I'll only frown
And you can never tell.
I never grieve o'er past mistakes
Made through the previous day;
I will from them a lesson take
And go plodding on life's way.
Sometimes you see me plodding
And judge I'm doing well;
But the care that's moving in my heart
No tongue can ever tell.

THE SIGNS OF DEATH.
When yer hear at night de ole milch cow a lowin?
An' der houn dogs howling out der mornful sound,
I tell yer now yer better giter ready,
Dey's guinter plant some boudy in de ground.
You neanter believe in sines unless yer wantir,
But some des morns you'll wake up in suprize
An' if dey come a howling when I'm sleeping,
I'll tell yer now dis' darkey am gointer rize.
An' if der's any doubt of being ready,
On my knees I'm gointer make it strate;
You may laf an’ say dat darkey's scary,
I am like er rabbit, I can not trust mistake.
It may not be for me de dogs er howling,
But when dey howl, my path I'm gointer sweep;
I am not agoin to bed no moer dat eavning,
Death shant come and find dis darkey sleep.
Ders lot ov learned people talking bully,
An' saying der's nothing in de sign,
But if they come around me with their culture,
I am just er goin' ter tell dem da’er lyin'.
I don't care to listen to their lectures,
Cos dey's just tryin' to show off smart;
There aint noboudy, no matter how he's cultured,
Dats got de signs er' wiped clear from his hart.
Cultur' don't take from man his habits,
It only smears them over with a stain;
Caus' he's cultured, he's not an angel,
Dem same old traits is learking still widin.
CLASSES.
The world is divided in many classes,
All deny being of the masses;
Life is complex, whom may I believe?
All the world seeks to deceive.
Society is artificial, I find
When I see what draws the line,
Men with honor and much estate
Compose the class we all call great.
One class is made by color line,
One by those who dress fine,
Some are made by the family tree,
All painting and striving to seem to be.
FORTUNE'S WHEEL.
Daily the wheel of Fortune is turned,
Daily they award the prize;
But somehow they never call my name,
I've labored many years,
And the thing that causes me tears,
Always I've returned just as I came.
Often it seems too hard,
I decide no more to try;
It seems as though there is no prize for me,
Then a spark of hope will blaze,
And new courage it will raise,
And again among the throng I'll be.
Always it won't be this way,
Very soon will come my day,
When the fortune wheel will be justly turned,
Just as it makes its round,
Yes, my name will then be found.
And I'll get the prize for which I yearned.
SHOW YOUR LOVE.
If you love me show it now,
Wait not till I've passed away,
And lying cold in yonder grave,
I can not bear then what you say.
If a wreath await my death,
One green leaf now give to me;
All thy sweet sayings say them now, ,
Pray let me hear them while I live.
If the half had been made known,
That was said on burial dav,
Many that fainted would have risen,
And bounded on the upward way.
In th' book that tells of the warrior's glory,
For the private soldier pray write. a line;
Ah, if he bad been a coward
How could the captain have been sublime ?
True the Commander should be honored,
Without him there's nothing done;
But where the soldiers were not willing,
I have never seen a victory won.
Ye men of wealth and highest bonor,
All who sit in a honored sphere;
Gaze not on your brawny arm,
Think of th' weak who put you there.
MEMORY OF THE OLD TIMES.
When the bygone days come rushing to my memory,
Ah, those good old days I spent while but a boy!
Many a picture it brings that causes a tinge of sad.
ness,
Yet somehow my heart is filled with magic joy;
I can view myself going strolling through the corn
field,
Gazing on the corn silks and the tassels gray;
Through the woodland 'till at last I reached the
brooklet,
There for ininnows I would fish 'till close of day
But those good old days have gone and years of sad.
ness
Have wrapped themselves around that happy lad;
And no more at day to wander through the wood-
land,
And no more at night around my dear old dad.
I remember well how in the early springtime,
When the meadow and the orchard were in bloom
;
How John and I'd go bounding o'er the hillside,
Close of ere when time to bring the cattle, bome;
I speak of John, but he too has left me;
And his body lying mouldering in the clay,
And I gaze around to see my boyhood comrades,
But they like my youth from me have passed away.
My dear old friends have gone, and years of sadness
Have wrapped themselves around that happy lad;
And no more at day to wander with my comrades,
No more at night around my dear old dad.
DON’T LAUGH, BOYS!
A colored, gray haired, feeble man
Came tottering down the street;
Was tackled by some happy youths
That he by chance did meet.
His hands were trembling on his cane,
He raised his hoary bead;
With them he was not angry,
As with a trembling voice he said:
“Don't laugh, boys, at this old form,
I think I am doing well;
What I went through in slavery
No tongue can ever tell..
“I had no chance when I was young,
I was working for master then;
But now my boys you're free,
Make out of yourselves men.
“And when you meet an old grav.haired man
Struggling along as I;
Don't trouble him, for he loves you,
Politely pass him by.”
ABOUT DE PUTY GALS.
When I was a little feloab,
A sprying around de gals,
De yaloah gals wus all a guying din;
Goodness dey was triflin,
But uv course they didn't care,
Dey were serten-dey cud get de best uv men.
True dey were a rarety
And we darkies didn't know,
We thot it bes just'r take her in;
She knew dat we'ers beholding
And treated us as dey pleased ;
We poor fools wud sit en fold our arms en grin.
An' dat same old adage,
Sum are clingin to it yet,
An trien ter reason in de same old way,
Because dey's kinder puty
Dey can do just as dey pleased,
Den wid de biggest darkies hold er sway.
I'll tell yer now, you're foolish,
Dem kinder days has passed;
Features wid us now don'cut no shine,
You've gou to be a lady
In de fullest uv de word-
You have got to be de pure and genuine.
I'll tell yer puty darkeys
Who's reasoning in dat way,
I have a word wid you I'd like to give,
You had better git sum knoledge
In dat cocoanut uv yourn;
Don't, by yoursef furever yur haf tir live.
Cos, bonn'y, you need not prize your face,
You ain't no rarety in de race;
Der uster be a time
When de yallar gal helt the line,
But now, dere's plenty in de race.
MY SONG
Why was I born if this ends all,
All that I will ever be ;
To feel a spirit that seems divine
And no chance to let it free?
Poor; unfortunate seems my part,
Drifting on poverty's sea;
The chains of need have bound me fast,
Oh would that I were free!
Daily I'm struggling for the shore,
But the sea is vast and wide;
And when I stop to sing my lays,
I'm threatened by the tide.
But if these rugged lays I've sung,
Should cause some heart to move;
And should bring to me sweet freedom,
How could I them but love.
Accept these lays to you I've given
As a token of my art;
Jingling though they may seem to be,
Remember 'tis but a start.

OUR PICNIC.
In fullest joy and richest pleasure,
Under the shade, lying on the grass;
Picnic tables on the ground before us,
Our day with Pean did swiftly pass.
We found a spring by a rippling stream,
Gushing water fresh and cool;
We must have found what De Leon sought,
A balm for old age within a pool.
Children like lambs ran over the woodland,
Worldly cares were chased away;
Their voices like wild nymphs ringing,
Old age felt quite young to day.
Reaching the arbor dark with shade,
Joy threw aside her rustic door;
We entered in with hail of song,
All forgot that we were poor.
We turned around, lingering looked,
Going home at the close of day;
Pean stood weeping in the door,
Crying and beckoning for us to stay.
EDITH.
In the park under a mossy tree,
Upon a rustic seat,
In the evening when the sun was low,
Edith and I would meet.
It was on this seat three years ago
I gently took her hand;
And gazed into her smiling face,
No sweeter in the land.
But now she is dead and passed away,
I from my labor stroll;
I have no one to meet me there,
I have no hand to hold.
But some sweet day, when nuy work is done.
I'll stroll to another place,
Where I will again take Edith's hand,
And gaze in her smiling face.
Roll round, sweet day, and bear me up
To the heaven above,
Where I will again see Edith's face,
And rest with her, my love.
ODE TO LOVE.
Love! O passion! 0 woman!
Return what thou hast stole:
Ambition, heart, and treasure,
O free the weary soui.
Loose thy suffering victim,
Unbar the prison door;
Call them back that weary,
Let them live once more.
Why mock your helpless victim?
Loose your galling chain;
To many thou givest pleasure,
To others thou givest pain.
Thy hypnotizing power,
Over many holds a sway;
To him it seems a magnet,
It draws his soul away.
Many thou found were happy,
In society held a place;
Thou hypnotized and led them
To shame and sad disgrace.
HEROD'S SLAUGHTER OF THE BABES
It was a decree of Herod,
Caused mothers to run wild ;
He sent soldiers from his palace,
To kill each young male child.
To kill the babe, the mother's hope:
To mothers it didn't seem right;
The mothers with their babies,
For refuge took their flight.
One mother fled for refuge
To a cave within the ground;
To all it was suspicious;
By a soldier it was found.
Looking in at the open door,
As a bird upon its nest,
He saw a frightened mother,
With a babe pressed to her breast.
"What seek ye?” cried the mother,
With a voice both faint and wild ;
“I am on a duty from Herod,
To kill each young male child !”
“Oh! spare my child !” cried the mother;
pray thee let it live;
If life's what thou seek'st,
Take mine, I'll freely give!"
" It's not your's, it's the babe's,
My duty I must perform.”
He reaches his hand towards her,
To take the babe from her arm.
Back to the corner she fled,
He rushed like a wild bear;
As a wolf on a lamb, he seized
And from her bosom tore.
The mother to save her babe
Bounds like a flying dart.
Too late! he unsheathed his blade
And pierced it through its heart.
The mother viewing the horrible scene,
Sinks breathless upon the floor;
He throws the babe by her side,
And steps from the earthen door.
The mother dying upon the ground,
Once from death did awake;
Saw her struggling baby lying
With its arms outstretched to take.
Quick as lightning her babe she grasped,
Her lips pressed to its wound;
They both gave up life's precious breath,
Sinking dead upon the ground.
A spirit went wafting through the sky
With a babe upon its breast;
In the cave their corpses are seen
But their souls are in heaven at rest.
AMBITION.
The world is a race course;
Man is a charioteer;
In him there is a soul;
Ambition is the steed
By which he is drawn,
Over which he seems to have
No control.
Each day we speed on the race,
Ambition still our steed,
Regardless of the soul
And heaven the goal;
Toward riches and honor
We speed.
Ambition, thou most fiery steed,
Remember thou drawest a soul;
For riches and honor there is no prize
Heaven is the only goal.
Be mindful thou, O charioteer!
Ride careful, keep your place,
Let riches nor honor tempt thee
And you will gain the race.
A VIEW OF CHILDHOOD.
I love to think what joy I've had,
When I was a boy, a playful lad;
I couldn't appreciate it then,
I had not felt this world of sin.
No cares were then upon my mind,
Happy and playful all the time;
Just think of the many happy hours,
That I roved through woods and flowers.
How I'd bound around at night,
Catching the bug that flashed a light;
Next morning when the sun would rise,
I'd begin to chase the butterflies.
I can see myself creeping to a flower,
Where a butterfly has lit to sip;
Now it seems I almost have him,
But from my fingers he doth slip.
He fleeing away to another flower,
I stand and gaze to see him light;
Now again I creep to catch him,
Pilt he sees me and takes a flight.
9
As I chase him from flower to flower,
Many others meet my eye;
Some that do not seem so scary,
To catch the others I will try.
There, I see one on that flower,
His head deep in the blossom fold;
Now it seems as tho' I have him,
And by his silky wings I hold.
REASON, SAD WORLD.
Ye proud and merry world,
Reason with me I pray;
Why weary for the things
That soon shall pass away?
Knowing that soon thou'll die,
And on earth shall be no more,
Then what value will be to you,
The wealth you have in store?
Dost thou believe in God,
Of whom so much thou hast heard ?
If so, why dost thou weary,
Why not trust then to His word ?
Knowest thou that life and honor
And the wealth of sea and land,
And all for which thou longest,
He holdeth in His hand?
Then why not for true life
And all that thou dost need,
Beseech it from our God,
Cease to man to plead ?
All His promises are true,
Yea, more than we have heard ;
And this thou too would'st see,
Should you swing out on His word.
Let us first Heaven seek;
Of all, sweet Heaven is best,
And God has in His word
Promised to give the rest.
Sad world, now cease your pining,
Warriors, cease your strife;
Strive not for honor nor wealth,
But seek eternal life.
THE WEALTHY NIGGER.
'One day along de road I's strolling,
Over my circumstances scoling;
I saw a roll of money in de san,
At first de money blinded me,
Till I heard a voice behind me,
Den wid de money to my home I ran.
Dis black nigger am welthy, boys, at last;
You ought to see de raising uy the hat when I pass;
Dis black nigger don't seem so funny
Since dey's found he's got de money,
And dem same old niggers am glad now to call me
boss.
Der were some yaller darkies in de place where I's
born,
Dey uster say I's smutty. Oh ho‘v dey uster scorn!
They uster have dey socials, dey uster have der teays,
Dey uster have der walking for der cake;
But dis nigger dey always slighted
And to none I was invited,
Dey treated me as do I was a snake.
Dis black nigger am welthy, boys, at last;
You ought to see dem yaller niggers bowin' when I

Dis black nigger don't seem so funny
Since dey's found I's got de money,
And dem same old niggers am glad now to call me

I had a half brother and sister in de place where I's
born,
Both of dem was yaller, dis black'un dey uster scorn;
But when dey beard I had returned
Wid de money for to burn,
Dey both on me did cast a wishful eye.
Uv course dey uster scorn me,
But now dey love to own me,
Dey cry, “Dar go my brudder," when I
pass.
Dis black nigger am welthy, boys, at last;
You outer see my brudder an sister grinnin whea I

Der black brudder don't seem so funny
Since dey's found he's got de money,
And dem same old niggers am glad now to call me

Der were some Irish merchants in de place where
I's born,
An when I'd pass der building, how dem clerks ud

But when dey found I'd returned
Wid de money for to burn,
Dey'd ask me in so nicely whin I'd pass,
Do I had not changed my colour;
But dey found I had de dollar,
And de dollar toes de line to any class.
Dis black nigger am welthy, boys, at last;
Oh how dem merchants call me when I pass.
Dis black nigger don't seem so funny
Since dey's found I's got de money,
And dem same old merchants am glad now to call

SO
THE BOY'S OPPORTUNITY.
Hail, happy youth, in your prime,
Be up and doing, waste not your time;
Fast is coming on the day,
You'll wish the time you waste away.
True, I know you are a boy,
I do not care to stop your joy,
But very soon you'll be a man
And for yourself you'll have to plan.
These wasted days and foolish cares
You'll think of them again in tears;
When misfortune drives you mad
You'll wish the time you once have had.
But no matter how you may yearn,
Time once spent will not return;
Now, my boys, your minds are free
Think of the man you hope to be.
Study hard, your pennies save,
Always truthful, ever brave;
And when a man you come to be,
You'll think of what was said by me.
“NO USE IN SIGNS."
Tain't no usen being skar'd of congurs,

Jest say,
THE MEMORY OF FRANCES WILLARD.
Around the glowing fireside of the nation,
There's a vacant chair no one can ever fill;
Death came and stole from it a Temperance mother,
Yet-in Heaven she lives an angel still.
To all she seemed a pure unfolding lily,
On which no eye bad ever found a stain ;
She stood till death, the surest reaper,
Came to gather in his choicest grain.
CHORUS.
Dearest mother, gone thou art,
Left us with a breaking heart.
To sweet Heaven thou art conveyed,
Show us the star that thou hast made,
That thy dear friends at night may see
The silver rays that gleam from thee.
Upon the parlor wall of our nation,
Hangs a picture in a sacred place;
She was a tender friend to the drunkard,
All admire the beauty of her face,
'Tis a picture of dear old Mother Willard,
A mother to the drunkard and to all;
She was tenderly watching over the fallen
When she heard the loving Savior call.
CHORUS.
In the tender heart of all the nation
There's a place no one can ever fill;
A place for one who's living now in Heaven,
For her the lamp of love is burning still.
From the Union there's gone a loving mother,
For her our hearts in sorrow will ever pine;
May peace be unto her dear old comrades,
May joy pour out to them the richest wine
CHORUS
I'LL ENTER THE SALOON NO MORE
Daily we drop in the treasure,
But it never reaches its height;
And when we search for the reason,
We find it Saturday night.
Then we find them there in multitudes,
Spending in various ways;
I'll invite you to the bar room
That you in the window may gaze.
There you'll see Samuel Brown,
Who earns a dollar per day;
And for the cursed rum cup,
He is giving it all away.
At home his wife and children
Have earned whatever they could,
And are waiting by the fire
To receive their Sunday's food.
His wife is somewhat frightened,
The clock has long struck ten;
She lays aside her baby
To bring her Samuel in.
She laid aside her baby
And pursued the journey once more,
She didn't make any inquiries
Till she reached the grocery store.
Then she asked the merchant
If he had seen her Sam.
He said, "He's gone to the bar-room
To get his Sunday's dram."
Then to the saloon she hastened,
Entered in at the open door;
There she saw her husband
Lying drunk upon the floor.
By his side she sat and wept,
When he from sleep did wake,
And heard his baby crying
As tho' its heart would break.
When he saw them weeping,
He rose to his feet and swore,
For the sake of wife and baby
He would enter the saloon no more.
UNKER ISRAEL.
De people calls me a kungrer
Cos I do some simple tricks,
Cos I'se got a lucky black cat bone;
Kant gedder no rutes to make tea wid
Less dey talk'in about dat;
Da say I'se got a ball er blue load stone.
No madder what I do noble-
Makes no diffens bow 'es done-
Yer nebber hear dem praisen' ob mi brain;
Lack when I married Anlyzzer,
Jest cos she had some sense
Deys' sayn' dat I got her wid some skeme.
Let sometin' happen to de nabers,
Jes let one of dem get sick,
Fer it old Israel got ter bear de blame;
Cos dey see me wid dis bull eye
An' er rabbit foot er two,
Dey put ebertbing on me dat is mean,
Some time da talk so scandlus
Dat it gits me rite upset,
’N, 'speshly when I notice what dey say,
I'se a notion takin' dis cat bone,
An' eberthing dat I got,
'N lettin' de people see me thro’ dem away.
Den I gedder dem tergedder,
'N when I git dem in er pile
I gin ter think ob de comin' needy day,
'N I no what dey'll do fer me;
I git rite mad wid myself
Erbout worryin' ober what de people say.
Cos when I look on dis loadstone,
An' dis bull eye dat I got,
Kan't help de tears from comin'in my eye;
Cos once when de worl' was aginst me,
An' me frens all turn der backs,
Dis bull eye an' de loadstone stud rite by.
Call me kungrer jest much as yer wanter,
Yer can't take no feck on me,
Aint shame to own de things dat brought me
through;
Talk erbout yer mudder's teachin',
But what dese done fer me
Es' much as eny mudder can eber do.
Wid dis bone I uster mark de path
Dat run from ole Massa's dor,
Eber mornin' when he come out had ter cross;
Put mi bull eye in mi pocket
'N done jest like I pleased
U’der seen me u’der thot I was de boss.
'N ole Massa couldn't cross dat mark
'Dout a smile comin' on his face,
Ter talk wid me old Massa seemed rite proud ;
I made eberbody lub me,
An' as long as I stayed dare
Ole Massa neber hit one ob de crowd.
I kep ole Massa from beatin'
Mos' all de wimmen folks ;
Sum time I wuk a few tricks fer de men,
Dey couldn't git me do for nuthin',
Cudn't git me ter move a peg,
Fer eber trick dey hadder bring er hen.
When eber I'd go out cortin',
I'd rub de loadstone on mi han',
Den I'd put er rabbit foot in mi shoo ;
No houn dog on urf cud track me,
'N cud make any body love,
'N when I met de gurls dis ways I'de doo-
Make out like I's glad ter see dem,
'N I'd grab bol ob der han',
I'd be rubbin' de loadstone on um all de time;
Un un, honey, no use scornin',
Neanter be turnin' up yer nose,
If I want youb I kin easy made yer mine.
ODE TO CONSCIENCE.
O guilty conscience, thou scourgest well!
Would'st thou give ease if I should tell
The crime committed o'er wbich I weep,
Though unsuspicioned, denies me sleep?
Come, law, and punish and let me rest,
Ease the guilty, aching breast.
Loose the innocent, set him free;
Take the convict, I am be.
No punishment can th’ law impart
Equal to th’aching of a guilty heart.
TWO SPIRITS.
Two spirits are warring in my breast,
Each for the sway.
Each of me has made request-
Which to obey ?
I'll obey the one that seems divine,
It came from heaven.
The other from this heart of mine
Must now be driven.
THE PARTING SOLDIERS.
Many gathered around the station
To bid the soldiers a sad good.bye,
Many a mother's heart was aching,
Many a lover was seen to cry.
But when the train rolled from the station,
Parting home words seemed quite strange;
Girls strolled home with other fellows-
Boys, there's going to be a change.
Another one will take your place,
He is going to beat you in the race,
Your room is all your lover will miss,
Another one she will hug and kiss.
In the night, around the fort,
When the kettledrum beats the roll,
Then she has another sport,
And in the moonlight takes a stroll.
The ring you placed upon her hand,
And wished it not to be removed,
She has given to another man-
False to you that girl has proved.
“Tip, tip, bum!” the drum I hear!
Face to the enemy! Never fear,
Soon Uncle Sam will set you free,
And sign your pension with his hand;
Just as we follow an old brass band
Thick as the flies around a 'lasses can,
They will follow thee, follow thee.
MY LONELY HOMESTEAD.
My good old home doesn't seem like it used to,
Since my dear old mother died.
The sunshine from it has passed away,
The old cot seems so lonely
Here I can no more reside.
The dear old form is resting 'neath the clay.
I remember well, how in the evening,
When from labor I'd return,
I'd hear the dear one singing as I neared ;
When her room I'd enter,
How the lamp of love would burn;
A paradise to me my home appeared.
Hushed is the voice I used to hear,
There's no one sitting in the old arm chair,
My heart is filled with sadness, it is wrapped in
gloom;
I can not bear to enter in her dear old room.
There's her Bible lying open on a table near,
By the Bible lies the glasses that she used to wear
She had just finished reading, when she fell asleep
Where Jesus said to Simon, "feed my sheep.”
There's a half finished stocking she'd begun for me;
Here are all the knitting needles where they used
to be;
The spinning.wbeel is standing where she sat for
years
Spinning out the cotton, humming away her cares.
On the wall there hangs her picture—though solemn,
not stern;
It seems to gaze upon me every way I turn;
But the kind and loving Savior, who knoweth best;
Hath freed her from her labor, called her home to
rest.
AN APPEAL.
An old man living near his master
Ever since he was made free,
Saw in him an evil spirit
That he thought should never be.
The old man's heart seemed to be breaking,
He had seen it several years,
It seemed he could not bear it longer,
He speaks with eyes half filled with tears:
“Tell me, massa, why yer scorn me,
Is it simply cose I'm free?
I's nebber tried ter hom yer;
Allas kind I's tried ter be.
“ I'm same as I was when yer own me,
Whateber yer ask I try ter do;
Is it somethin' I's done?
Yer don't treat me as do I's one ob yo.
“True, l's glad I's got mer freedom-
Not semply do to 'scape yer rod-
I’s glad ob it down in mer buzom,
Dis luv of freedom came from God.
7
“Truf, I know I's little ignorent,
But dis I make es er ernes' plee-
Sposen you 'ad been in my condition,
How'd you do if you's me?
“Dis, O massa, I pra do tell me,
I'll do as yer would if I can,
What I do is not fer spite work,
I's simply tryin' ter be er man.
“Yer know I's proven miself harmless,
I wouldn't hurt yer when I cud,
When you lefy your homestead wid me,
Did I not prove myself as good ?
“Think when yer was off in battle,
Fiten fer de cause yer thought was rite,
How I toiled and fed yer fam’ly,
How I guarded dem safe at nite.
“Fiten ter keep me from mi freedom-
Dat, yer know, I noed full well-
In all ob dis was I not faithful ?
If dis aint so I pra de tell.
“Tell me, when de war was ober,
What did my ole mistess say?
Did her say I tryed ter harm her?
Did I eber'fuse ter oba ?
“Den wont yer fam’ly for protection
Lef' as young lam's by mer side?
'N 'fore I'd let the hole urth harm em,
Massa, yer know I wud 'er died.
“I want yer ter think erbout dis madder,
Look de case rite straight through,
'N se fer yoursef whi u'nt treat me
De same as do I's one ob yo.
“I wanter stay on dis farm wid yer,
My arm dis great big fiel' did clur;
More dan dat, hur's my affection,
My mudder an' fader are buried hur.
“U’nt do less we kin in union,
I luve ter lib where der is love;
I wont stan' dis, do, much longer,
I’speck it's best dat I would move."

WHY SNEER AT TH'ERRORS OUR
FATHERS MADE?
Why sneer at th’ errors our fathers made?
Of their mistakes why's so much said ?
To scorn these men is no way to do,
Their faults have been much help. to you.
We see the man that walked sin's path;
We find he met fate's cruel wrath,
And then we know what path to take,
Therefore we gained by his mistake.
For who, after reading the IIoly Book,
Would take the path Ananias took?
We learn the path to take or shun,
From those who lost and those who won.
For what is history read to day,
If not that we may learn the way?
And when I read of the early gloom,
I am glad I was not born so soon.
Now, when one falls before your eyes,
Extend your hand, help him to rise,
Ilis falling may a warning be-
Suppose it had been made of thee?
VIRTUE ALONE CAN MAKE MEN
GREAT.
In reading the history from Adam's time,
Studying the lives we call sublime,
So many I cross obscured by sin,
I find virtue alone can make great men.
We find so many once brilliant lights
To-day have vanished from our sight;
Tracing the cause, when I come to an end,
I find virtue alone can make great men.
I know a man whom no one feared,
Almost a sun his life appeared ;
I see the sphere that he did own
Extremely darker for having shone.
When I see how clever the vice he did,
And finding that it could not be bid,
I say, as the Book with the holy seal:
Your sins, though covered, shall be revealed.
My son, I charge you from this very day,
Choose the path of virtue, it is the way ;
Should you choose another, death is your fate,
For virtue alone can make men great.
TO HER THAT WEEPS.
Oh, beloved wife of the dear departed,
To thee I sing: be not broken-hearted,
The God that called thy loved one from thy side
Hath sent an angel o'er thy path to guide.
I know it's hard to give up one so dear,
To whom was trusted all thy love and care.
Death, my friend, is the common lot of all,
We must surrender freely to the call.
Weep no more, for thy loved one is at rest;
Expel the sorrow from thy aching breast;
Murmur not, for it is our Father's will,
He in love and mercy will keep thee still.
Go forth, oh song, in a strain loud and clear,
Soothe th' aching heart, dry up every tear,
And with thy cloak of love securely fold,
Pray that God her from all danger will hold.
HEATHEN LAND.
Across the ocean is a heathen land,
Hasten, brothers, and lend a hand;
Go as far as your feet can tread;
Tell them of the living God.
Let love of home stay thee no more,
Carry the Gospel from shore to shore,
'Till idolatry from them will flee,
'Till India and Africa will shout, “We are free."
Move on, my brothers, why stand you here?
Our Savior is with thee, why should you fear?
“Go preach my gospel, tell them of me,”
Thus says the Savior, “I am with thee."
BLAME NOT THE POET.
Blame not the poet who daily seeks the woods;
Call him not idle, thy verdict may be wrong,
For there he meets with nature face to face,
He hears her voice, to him it's song.
TO THE MEMORY OF W. W. BROWNE.
Listen, brethren, while I speak
Of our dear old father Browne.
In vain another we may seek,
Yet not another can be found.
No, not on this wide circled earth,
Has a greater man received his birth.
A tender father, loved by all,
How we miss his loving voice,
Then for his death our tears do fall.
Still in his work we do rejoice,
Because it was so kind and free-
A wonderful blessing it was to me.
A father whom our God did love,
When He saw his work was done,
Called him to his home above
To receive the great crown he had won.
Yes, though Ile called him from our sight,
Still we behold his brilliant light.
L
How he toiled, and how he suffered ;
How the sweat ran from his face,
While he worked and prayed for wisdom
That he might advance his race-
To teach them of a brother's care-
A brother's burden how to share.
Whenever he heard the sick man's groan
And the orphan's cry for bread,
He went with helping hand to loan-
He said these people must be fed.
He gave his life for those distressed,
Our God was pleased, his hand was blessed.
Farewell, fond spirit, and take thy rest;
Thy voice on earth will sound no more;
We will obey thy last request,
We will meet thee on the other shore,
There in perfect peace to dwell.
Dear father Browne, farewell, farewell!
TO THE MEMORY OF W. W. BROWNE.
Dear father Browne, the great, the good,
The noble leader of our race,
With task complete, his spirit fled
To heaven, its final resting place.
There in peace it shall remain,
Wrapped away from care and pain,
IIis body 'neath sweet roses sleeping,
Around his grave his friends are weeping.
Weeping for one so dearly loved,
Too soon it seemed we had to part.
To see him hid beneath the clay,
Sharp sorrow fills the aching heart.
It seems I see the great form standing
O'er the mighty host commanding,
And with his outstretched, loving arm
Telling the people they must reform.
Think of the great work he has done;
Behold the great reformer's band,
Ten thousand marching to and fro
Seeking the helpless, lending a hand.
Gone! Thou hast not lived in vain,
Thy deeds are monuments of fame.
Thy name from earth shall never depart,
Kindness engraved it on the heart.
No more to meet us here on earth,
But the noble impulses thou hast given
Will urge us on this mighty course
Until we too are called to heaven.
'Neath the cold clods! Is it the last ?
No; the memory of the past,
As Bethlehem star the wise men led,
So his light will lead us tho' he's dead.
DE 'SCURSION DAT YER RODE.
Do you remember, boys, last summer
All dem 'scursions dat yer rode?
Do you remember, boys, der money yer thode away?
Now de snow is fallin' fastly,
On
yer
feet der ain't no shoes.
Don't yer wish yer had dat money, boys, ter day?
WHY SHOULD I DEPLORE?
Oh, why should I deplore,
To have great wealth in store?
Ilaven't I health, food and shelter?
What need hath man for more?
GOD BLESS THE SAILORS.
God bless the sailors brave to night,
Out on the surging sea,
Who are tighting hard against the storm,
Protecting you and me.
The lightnings flash, the thunder peals,
The surging billows roll;
'Tis then the sailors' work begins,
The boat they must control.
Oh, raging sea, why not be calm?
Oh, lightning, thunder, cease;
Oh, mighty storm, why not be still?
Oh, why not hold thy peace?
Lord, calm again this raging sea,
If it's Thy holy will.
Pray let me hear Thy loving voice
Say to the wird, be still.
GIB TER ME ER LOCK OB YER HAIR.
Honey, I'se gwine ter sail fer Cuba termorrer;
Gwine ter make dem Spaniards fly.
My lub fer you has filled my heart wid sorrer-
I’se come ter bid yer all good bye.
Now, honey, here's a present I wanter gib yer:
Take dis ring. Remember me, an' wear.
An' now I'm gwine ter ask ob you a token-
Gib ter me er lock ob yer hair.
Gib ter me er lock ob ver hair, hun,
Ter 'member yer when I'm gone.
Take dis ring. Remember me, an' wear.
An' now I'm guinter ask ob you a token
Gib ter me er lock ob yer hair.
GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY.
God bless our country, the land of the free;
Be with our rulers, whoever they be;
Protect the flag, and let it wave
Forever o'er free men, not th' slave.
