        <collex:text>This digital edition was edited and proofread by Amardeep Singh and Joanna Grim. 
            Carrie Williams Clifford was born in Chillicothe, Ohio, in 1862, making her a generation older than many of her peers (most writers active in the Harlem Renaissance were born after 1880). For the first half of her adult life, she did not publish poetry. 
            Clifford was born into a middle-class family; her mother was a successful businesswoman. Clifford lived in Cleveland for some years, before marrying William H. Clifford, an Ohio state legislator. Clifford was active in Cleveland with the National Association of Colored Women, and played a leadership role in that and other organizations focused on African American women's issues. Clifford was also an editor of the Cleveland Journal, an African American-oriented newspaper. In 1910, the couple moved to Washington, DC, where the Cliffords hosted gatherings with many prominent African-American activists, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, Georgia Douglas Johnson, and Mary Church Terrell. 
            Among the collections of poetry we have been reading while developing this archive, there is no doubt that Clifford's Race Rhymes (1911) is among the most forthright in its commitment to activism and racial justice. While Georgia Douglas Johnson and others aspired towards a certain level of polish -- perhaps influenced by critics like William Stanley Braithwaite -- here Clifford is first and foremost interested in producing verses that speak to the social issues of her day. In her preface to this collection, Clifford says as much: "In giving to the world this brochure, the author makes no claim to unusual poetic excellence or literary brilliance." This disavowal is arguable, though what is not arguable is how powerful Clifford's voice is in this work as well as her subsequent collection, The Widening Light. 
            In her introduction to a recent edition of Clifford's poetry, P. Jane Splawn wrote of Clifford: 
            In her poetry and in her life, Clifford did indeed speak with a determination and resolve that would not be quenched by America's accomodationist desires for its black constituency. Clifford was unwavering in reminding America of African Americans' contributions of both their blood and labor for the progress of this country and in warning the 'boastful, white American[s]' who, as she saw it, must one day account to an avenging God for the offenses committed against blacks and other people of color. (Splawn, xvii-xviii)
            To this reader, the poems that deal with concrete historical themes are among the most memorable, especially, "Lines to Garrison," "Foraker and the Twenty-Fifth," and "Atlanta's Shame." The first of those three poems narrates, in celebratory fashion, the life of famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. "Foraker and the Twenty-Fifth" is an account of Joseph B. Foraker's contentious political quarrel with President Teddy Roosevelt over a historical event known as the "Brownsville Affair," where an entire battalion of African-American troops was dishonorably discharged by the President for dubious reasons. Finally, "Atlanta's Shame" is a response to the Atlanta Race Riot of 1906, which which left as many as 100 African-American men dead following questionable claims of sexual assault on white women.

        <collex:text>Mother, Mother, how I loved thee!
            And I know thou lov'dst me well;
            But the gentle Saviour called thee
            Home on high with saints to dwell.
            
            Mother, gentlest of all creatures.
            Patient, noble, just serene;
            To me thou wert perfect, ideal;
            Equal of thine, ne'er was seen.
            
            Thou art gone! but not forgot by
            Her who loved thee here on earth,
            Mine the sorrow, but for thee of
            Heavenly joy there is no dearth.
            
            So I smile in resignation.
            And repress the bitter pain
            Since my great loss for a brief space,
            Is for thee, eternal gain.

        <collex:text>In giving to the world this brochure, the author makes no claim to unusual poetic excellence or literary brilliance. She is seeking to call attention to a condition which she, at least, considers serious. Knowing that this may often be done more impressively through rhyme than in an elegant prose dissertation, she has taken this method of accomplishing the end sought.
            Each poem has been called forth by some significant event or condition in the history of the Negro in America. The theme of the group here presented -- the uplift of humanity -- is the loftiest that can animate the heart and pen of man; the treatment, she trusts, is not wholly unworthy. Remembering the good that has been accomplished by such familiar poems as 'The Prisoner for Debt,' 'The Song of the Shirt,' and similar ones, she sends these lines forth with the prayer that they may chance some evil heart, right some wrong and raise some arm strong to deliver.

        <collex:text>America is not another name for opportunity
            To all her sons! Nay, bid me not be dumb —
            I will be heard. Christians, I come
            To plead with burning eloquence of truth
            A brother's cause; ay, to demand, forsooth,
            The manhood rights of which he is denied;
            Too long your pretense have your acts belied.
            What has he done to merit your fierce hate?
            I charge you, speak the truth; for know, his fate
            Irrevocably is bound up with yours,
            For good or ill, as long as time endures.
            Torn from his native home by ruthless hands,
            For centuries he tilled your fruitful lands,
            In shameful, base, degrading slavery;
            Your humble, patient, loyal vassal, he —
            Piling your coffers high with magic gold,
            Himself, the while, like cattle bought and sold.
            
            When devastating war stalked through the land,
            And dangers threatened you on every hand,
            These sons whose color you cannot forgive.
            Did freely shed their blood that you might live
            A nation, strong and great. And will you then
            Continue to debase, degrade, contemn
            Your loyal children, while with smiling face
            You raise disloyal ones to power and place?
            Is race or color crime, that for this cause
            You draft against the Negro unjust laws?
            Is race or color sin that he should be
            For these things treated so outrageously?
            O, boastful, white American, beware!
            It is the handiwork of God you dare
            Thus to despise and He will you repay
            With generous measure overflowing, yea,
            For all the good which in his life you've wrought.
            For helpful deed, or kindly, loving thought —
            For every act of cruelty you've done,
            For every groan which you have from him wrung.
            For every infamy by him endured,
            He will you all repay, be thou assured!
            Not here alone ere time shall cease to be,
            But likewise There, through all eternity.

        <collex:text>We are rising, we are coming!
            See, the foeman's face grows pale;
            He to check our progress onward
            Spreads abroad this scandalous tale
            
            "Black men are not white men's equal
            All unworthy's the black race;
            Savage, soulless, scarcely human.
            Doomed forever to servile place."
            
            Shall such foul aspersions daunt us.
            Will we weaken in our fight?
            Never! Fighting, we will die for
            Justice, God and human right.
            
            We hurl back the defamation.
            Confound theory with fact.
            Prove by thought, by word, by deed.
            The falseness of the vile attack.
            
            There is earnest work before us,
            There are giants to o'ercome.
            Satan's angels to be vanquished.
            Grievous wrong to be undone.
            
            So we press undaunted forward.
            So we plunge into the fray.
            Rouse the timid lagging rearward.
            Point them to the breaking day!
            
            Will success perch on our banner.
            Which we struggle to hold high?
            From the valiant hosts who follow
            Comes a ringing, firm, "Ay, ay !"

        <collex:text>In queenly state she sits at the gateway of the South —
            And lifts with conscious pride her stately head :
            Fair Atlanta feels her worth, and her children are elate,
            As thro' her streets they go with happy tread.
            She has sons of many kinds, she has sons of many hues,
            And she says she cares for all, but this we know,
            Tho' she exacts of each alike service, revenue, respect,
            The blacks get of her favor but scant show!
            Yet the harder do they strive her good will and grace to win.
            Keeping step with progress — forward without pause!
            Gaining knowledge, getting wealth, doing all things duly meet.
            Hoping thus to gain Atlanta's prized applause.
            But alas! 'tis all in vain, for she hates with bitter hate
            These poor blacks who aye remind her of her shames;
            Of her greed for wealth and power, of her base consuming lust:
            Noble striving but the more her wrath inflames.
            Then to hide from honest eyes her blood-guiltiness and sin,
            She most cunningly contrives a wicked plot —
            Subtly spoken a base word, then this cry against the blacks
            Cleaves the night ! "Revenge! lynch, slaughter and spare not!"
            Three awful nights she reveled in a carnival of crime,
            Three days or e'er the tension was relieved;
            When her thirst for blood was sated, the whole nation stood aghast.
            Her cry of "Rape," no more the world deceived!
            Lamentations, bitter sobs, heart-wrung groans the soft winds bore
            Thro' the streets where lay the victims of her rage;
            Helpless age and guiltless youth, innocence and trusting truth —
            It had taken all, her fury to assuage.
            Dread Atlanta nevermore can the crimson stain erase,
            Nor the foul blot wipe from off fair history's scroll ;
            This fell deed shall e'er arise, ghost-like from the mists of time
            To confront and terrify her guilty soul!

            And the milk of human kindness
            In the proud heart turns to gall:
            Is not every hand against them,
            Every ear deaf to their call?
            
            Disregarded all entreaties,
            Stern protests unheeded are;
            Impotent words or achievements,
            To remove the color-bar.
            
            Shall such base, unworthy treatment
            Be by brave men tamely borne
            And the title "Non-resistant,"
            As a badge of honor worn?
            
            No; by heaven, they swear it, swear it!
            List ye, farthest glitt'ring star.
            Ten thousand black men shout in chorus,
            "We will fight the Jim Crow car."

        <collex:text>For oh, his song was so sad to hear!
            He sang of the millions who live in fear;
            Of those who in anguish and patient pain.
            Struggle for freedom but struggle in vain.
            For oh, his song was so sweet to hear;
            It fell like balm on the listening ear;
            It told of bright skies, fragrant flowers, green trees,
            And of God the Almighty — Creator of these.
            For oh, his song was so blithe and gay,
            "I will not hold my just anger alway;
            Tremble ye wicked ones!" Assurance blest.
            And hope brought the song to these children oppressed.
            For oh, his song was sublime, sublime!
            A glorious burst of music divine;
            "He whose endurance shall last to the end.
            On him shall heaven's choicest blessings descend."
            So ever he sang as he journeyed along.
            Cheering the faint heart, rebuking the wrong.
            Preaching to all the sweet gospel of love;
            Teaching of Jesus who reigneth above.
            But the singer grew weary and sank down to rest,
            Where he sleeps for a space, folded close to the breast
            Of old Mother Earth, the song stilled for a day.
            But our hearts to its music will vibrate alway.

        <collex:text>Read at his centenary celebration, Cleveland, Ohio.
            Ah, dark and grim and direful were those days,
            For cursed was our fair land, and torn with cries
            And groanings loud and terrible, of man
            Oppressed and tortured by his brother man.
            The poor, black, naked slave was worked and whipped
            And scourged; held, bought and sold as chattel
            At the behest of him who styled himself his owner;
            His body, mind, yea e'en his very soul
            Was held by cruel masters to belong to them!
            "How long,' O Lord, how long?" wailed these despairing ones.
            As Slavery's cruel bonds grew stronger day by day,
            More loathsome and unbearable!
            While thus they agonized in prayer, beseeching
            God, the father, for relief from this
            Distressed and pitiful estate, lo!
            Suddenly from out the mists of chaos
            And confusion, rose a voice commanding.
            Clear, loud-crying, "I am in earnest —
            I will not equivocate — I will not
            Retreat a single inch — And I will be heard!"
            It was the voice of one who hated slavery
            As he hated nothing else on earth ;
            It was the voice of one, who advocated
            Freedom for all men.
            It was the voice of Garrison, the brave,
            Which sounded clear above the tumult, saying —  
            "Tyrants as all hist'ry shows, must be destroyed!"
            Alarm fell on the sleek, complacent master.
            The quiet advocate of abolition likewise started!
            Dared he thus boldly agitate for right.
            Dared he thus forcibly denounce the wrong?
            A nation listened breathless!
            Again the voice came ringing, firm, emphatic — 
            "Are we enough to make a revolution?
            No, but we are enough, one to begin;
            And once begun it cannot be turned back!
            I am for revolution, were I utterly alone;
            I am there because I must be there;
            I cannot choose but obey the voice of God!''
            It was enough ! A Christian nation could not,
            Would not listen to the voice of God.
            The South cried for his blood;
            In Boston he was mobbed; dragged thro' the streets
            A rope around his neck, because, forsooth.
            He dared to speak for Freedom, Justice, Right.
            But brute force cannot thrust Truth down.
            Nor mobs with ropes o'ercome it.
            Tho' cast in prison
            Mocked at, jeered, yet Garrison, the great.
            Ceased not to plead the cause of the despised slave.
            He aroused a nation from its lethargy!
            The North viewed with dismay, the horrid beast
            The haughty South was nursing in its breast;
            Should this foul thing besmirch Columbia's name?
            Should free America, home of the brave.
            Become a noissome prison house for slaves!
            Not if the trenchant pen or mighty voice
            Of Garrison, the noble, could prevent.
            By day, by night, in season, out — he passionately
            Pleaded for his enslaved countrymen.
            So bold a leader could not long lack friends.
            Soon honest men became his staunch allies.
            The few, became a host! The little stream
            Became a flood, resistless, strong, compelling!
            The climax came
            In a supreme outburst of blood and carnage.
            The strife was fierce, the struggle desperate;
            But. glory be to God, the chains were snapped.
            The slaves were freed, and Garrison, immortalized!
            Peace to thy ashes. Honored Dead!
            We come today, thy grave to strew with flowers
            Of loving words, of honest praise; we come
            Ten million of thy countrymen
            Thy bier to consecrate with fragrant incense
            Welling up from grateful hearts!

        <collex:text>Who helped Columbia win the day
            At San Juan Hill and El Carney,
            When brave men faltered in dismay?
            The Twenty-fifth.
            
            Who welcomed then, their timely aid,
            Since they to charge were not afraid,
            But at the foe like demons made?
            Colonel Roosevelt.
            
            And when the glorious deed was done.
            The battles fought and victory won,
            Who honor gave to her dark sons?
            The Nation.
            
            Who was it played the scurvy trick,
            Who gave the thrust with his Big Stick
            That turned br'ght day to darkness thick?
            Our President.
            
            Where is the place was struck the blow.
            The deadly, fatal, unjust blow
            Our soldier boys' proud heads bowed low?
            At Brownsville.
            
            Discharged without honor or proof of guilt
            Was this the goal toward which they'd built.
            The end for which their blood they'd spilt?
            O, mighty God!
            
            Charged with honor up San Juan Hill:
            Discharged without honor at dread Brownsville,
            Achieved so grandly — rewarded so ill.
            These patriots.
            
            And did no voice for justice cry,
            None dare assail the powers high
            That did the grievous wrong — none ? Ay,
            Brave Foraker.
            
            Alone he braved the mighty wrath.
            Alone he dared the lightning's path ;
            Ha! braver champion no man hath
            Than Foraker.
            
            Defied alone the soldiers' foes.
            Himself bared to the cowards' blows;
            The price so nobly paid God knows —
            And Foraker.
            
            He suffered in a righteous cause.
            Fought to uphold his country's laws.
            And won just men's thund'rous applause.
            Great Foraker.
            
            Wherever black men's hearts beat high
            For justice, honor, liberty.
            Nor name nor deed shall ever die.
            Of gallant J. B. Foraker.
            
            And if a race's steadfast love
            A race's loyalty can prove.
            No other name is loved above
            The name of Foraker.

            Then forward, onward, upward go!
            And as you boldly press
            Your way to life's exalted heights
            The Lord of Hosts will bless.

        <collex:text>We are battling for the right with purpose strong and true; 
            'Tis a mighty struggle, but we've pledged to dare and do; 
            Pledged to conquer evil and we'll see the conflict thro' 
            Marching and marching to conquest. 
            All the noble things of life we'll teach our girls and boys, 
            Warn them of its pitfalls and reveal its purest joys, 
            Counsel, guide and keep them from the evil that destroys 
            As we go marching to conquest. 
            Loving confidence and trust must mark our intercourse, 
            Harmony and unity will our success enforce ; 
            Seeking guidance from the Lord of good, the boundless source, 
            As we go marching to conquest. 
            Come and join our anthem then and raise a mighty shout, 
            Sing it with such fervor as will put our foes to rout, 
            Sing it with conviction strong, dispelling every doubt, 
            As we go marching to conquest. 
            Women, when our work is o'er and we to rest have gone. 
            May our efforts doubled, trebled, still go sweeping on. 
            And the voices of millions swell the volume of our song. 
            As they go marching to conquest. 
            Chorus : 
            Hurrah, hurrah, we'll shout the jubilee; 
            Hurrah, hurrah, we'll set the captives free, 
            Ignorance, distrust and hate at our approach shall flee. 
            Marching and marching to conquest.

        <collex:text>Who loves my baby? Ah, who loves him not,
            My beautiful baby, who lies fast asleep;
            His dimpled brown limbs softly press his white cot.
            And angels, God's messengers, guard o'er him keep.
            Who hates my baby? Ah. merciful God,
            Thy children — his brothers whose faces are white;
            "Black skin is a crime: pass thou under the rod,"
            They cry! "This is our country, and might makes us right."
            My baby! immortal soul, dark tho' he be;
            Where shall I take him for safety and peace,
            Where in this land of the brave and the free
            Shall baby and I find of terror surcease?
            Justice, I ask for my baby is all,
            And freedom to grow and expand all his powers ;
            Then right give the verdict — to stand or to fall —
            While Hatred of Race before Righteousness cowers.
            Then, if my dark baby, unworthy be found,
            Incompetent, lustful, unfaithful or base,
            I'll abide by the verdict and utter no sound
            Agree that beneath is my dark baby's place.
            But glory to God! who my dark baby gave
            A mind, soul and being like unto his own
            And sent his dear son my brown baby to save
            From the seeds of corruption the Tempter has sown.
            Right my baby will place side by side with your child.
            And Right will erase from your heart that fierce hate;
            Will you bide by the verdict of Right? Will the wild
            And ignoble prejudice die e'er too late?
            For be thou assured, God's bright angels will guard
            My baby so brown, to the heavenly portal.
            White soul, not white face, shall there gain its reward.
            For Right keeps the gate to the City Immortal.

            O, vain and haughty white man, why
            Of ancestry prate so?
            Can you in tracing your descent.
            Farther than Adam go?
            Why boast of culture ? Well you know.
            Ere to your present state
            Of progress and renown you'd come,
            (With statesmen wise and great — )
            The blacks had splendidly achieved
            Long centuries before;
            Their monuments, unrivaled still,
            Adorn old Afric's shore.
            No adventitious circumstance
            Can fix a people's station.
            Integrity's the thing that counts
            In any man or nation.
            Then modestly let's run our course —
            All hist'ry tells the story:
            No race but has its page of shame.
            None lacks its page of glory.
            So what is blood or what is birth?
            What is black or white?
            Or great or small, or rich or poor.
            Just so the man's all right?

        <collex:text>"The Dreamers are the Saviours of the World."
            So ran the legend writ in letters bold,
            Upon a page whereon in idle hour,
            My listless gaze did chance to rest. Straightway
            A magic thrill thro' all my being ran
            And all my powers of mind became at once
            Instinct with leaping life. Again I gazed —
            Again with eagerness the page I scanned:
            Unchanged, the words still boldly graven there
            "The Dreamers are the Saviours of the World."
            "And can it be," I thought, this ancient page
            Doth to my own sweet wild imaginings
            Lend confirmation strong. Would this bright world
            Be but a barren waste, a wilderness;
            Its human creatures scarcely one remove
            From birds and beasts, and creeping, crawling things
            Instead of beings, as great God declared
            But little lower than the angels formed.
            Did not the Dreamer — Sculptor, Poet, Sage —
            Keep ever brightly burning life's ideals
            As beacon lights to comfort, cheer and guide
            The weary travelers o'er life's rugged way?
            Still motionless I sat, still pondered o'er
            The words this ancient tome did speak, dramatic
            And profound, as 'twere an oracle.
            The book, unheeded, fell from my lax hand.
            And back with lightning speed my fancy flew
            O'er space and time immense and limitless.
            Before mine eyes a panorama spread,
            Showing the great of earth since time began.
            I saw bold Caesar and Napoleon,
            St. Francis of Assisi, Socrates,
            Shakespeare and Froebel, Michael Angelo
            And all the sacred host of mighty dead.
            Before me moved the pageant of the years
            In ghostly pomp and grandeur. I saw again
            The youthful Joseph, Dreamer of Israel;
            Despised of his brethren, cursed and roughly used
            Because he dreamed the truth they could not grasp.
            And then, I saw the dream fulfilled, while they,
            The former scoffers, bent the suppliant knee,
            In silent tribute to the Dreamer's power.
            When busy Martha cumbered with much care
            Complained that Mary at the Saviour's feet
            In dreamland sat, the gentle Christ replied,
            "Mary hath chosen the better part." I saw
            Columbus, bold and unafraid, set out
            Upon an unknown sea his dream to find
            Come true. Douglass, the slave — the martyr, Brown,
            And Harriet Beecher Stowe, the prophetess,
            Each dreaming of a country free from rule
            Of grasping greed and heartless tyranny.
            In patience wrought, to bring to pass the dream
            Which men derided — called impossible:
            When lo! while yet they mocked, it came to pass!
            "Dreamers," I thought, whose dreams have changed the world!
            So must it ever be. The Dreamer comes
            In every age unvalued and condemned.
            The Doers trooping come, with boisterous haste
            Millions to one lone Dreamer: failing him,
            No single revolution of the wheel
            Of progress marks advance, for he alone
            Can move the world and bring a revelation.
            The true Idealist does not spend his time
            In vain and idle musings; nor does he flee
            Unfavorable conditions, as a slave.
            For quarters more secure and genial:
            But rather, he is one who patiently
            And often painfully his life doth shape
            Harmonious with an inward purpose true,
            Striving against cold materialism to make
            The glorious vision in whose light he lives
            Shine strong and bright before the eyes of men
            Whose sight less clear discerning is than his.
            'Tis true that dreams are but the evidence
            Of things unseen — realities which all
            Shall one day see and know. Dream lofty dreams.
            And as you dream, O, Friend, shall you become
            What you desire, you shall obtain; and what
            You shall aspire unto you shall achieve.
            Your vision is the promise of what you
            Shall one day be; your ideal but the prophecy
            Of what you shall at last unveil!
            Then cherish well your vision, cherish fondly
            Your ideals. O great and noble Dreamer!

THE BIRTH OF LINCOLN

INTRODUCTION
A poet that comes through a unique experience, as so many poets have, and very recently as the author of this volume has, arrives through his personality rather than his work at a precipitate sort of fame that may serve his talents well or serve them ill. To know that a man was sent to jail as the consequence of a passionate desire to go to college, and that that desire involved the tramping of dusty and hungry miles, adds to the interest to the man that cannot fail in some significant way to set a glamor upon the poet. Poetry is made out of experience the experience of dreams, of action, of desires and hopes baffled on the inexplicable sea of circumstance; in these latter the dream is as the spirit, and the man whose art becomes an expression of all he has realized in living, his experiences become something more than art, they are the subtle rendering reality that is truth.
In these poems of Mr. Jones' it is that which gives them a unique value because they are in a deeply essential manner the rendering of a human document, as all poems must be, of an individual who speaks universally. I emphasize this quality first because art registers its worth by the  vitality of its substance. If the substance be vital, then its embodiment is artistically successful to the degree in which the maker has felt his experiences. These poems, then, will come to many readers with a freshness, with the appeal for a certain sympathy that will compel attention.
The opening poem which celebrates the centenary of Lincoln's birth, with its fine imaginative sweep, is as good as any poem I have seen which that occasion called forth. In it is poetry that ought to assure Mr. Jones' future if circumstances permit him to cultivate an art for which nature has so obviously endowed him. "The Sylvan Cabin" in spirit may be said to characterize the author's book; that upward striving toward the ideal, which taking a personal expression in his own experience, in his own hopes, has also a larger significance in voicing the aspirations of those for whom, as is shown in many other poems, he becomes a voice, a representative. Mr. Jones' work has already won for him the approbation of many literary people, his poems having appeared from time to time in various publications; this fact not only justifies his gathering them together in this volume, but being so recognized must fill him with a certain assurance for the future. To this I can only add that, good as these are, they give us the hope for better from one who ought certainly to go on and upward.
WILLIAM STANLEY BRAITHWAITE.

A CENTENARY ODE ON THE BIRTH OF LINCOLN
I
O, FAIREST Dame of sylvan glades,
We come to pay thee homage due,
Embrace thee softly and to kiss
Thy lovely, long-forsaken cheeks;
To smooth thy flowing silver locks
And bind about thy snowy neck
A necklace golden studded full
With rarest gems and shining pearls.
Our eyes, though sometimes dimmed with tears,
In purer lustre sparkle forth
Whene'er they fall agaze on thee!
Our ears attuned to thy sweet lay
Catch every flowing, cadent note
And bear it ever safe within
Our rapturous hearts, which gladly leap
Whene'er thy name is called!
Deep in our souls the quenchless fire
Of love full brightly burns upon
The sacred altar, set apart
For sprite commune and sacrifice;
Whose high-priest tends with loving care,
And unto thee sweet incense burns.
Our tongues most gladly sing thy praise,
And from it ne'er shall cease-till all
The land be free!
II
A century lonely hast thou stood
Here all forsaken and forgot!
All men failed thee to visit save
Some idle lover of sylvan haunts
Who trod, perchance, this hallowed spot,
And cast a pensive eye upon
This lovely glade, thy sole abode
(Full lost in these continuous woods),
And brooding o'er thy lowly lot,
Oft thus did muse: "This cabin lone
Here stands to tell the tale of him,
Back-woodsman brave, who having scaled
The mystic mountains ne'er returned
To them, though loved yet left behind;
But here he chose his last abode,
These gloomy woods whose blackness stands
Up hard against horizon's slope;
Grim, spectral, dreaded, and untrod
Save monsters great of savage mien,
That prowled, or crouched upon their prey;
Sent forth a vicious roar that fairly shook
Old Sylvia far and near, from vale
Through crag to mountain peak!
Upon this spot the redskin oft
Has danced his 'War dance' and his 'Feast,'
His face a reddish hue aglow-
Long locks with eaglets' plumes bedecked;
His bow and never-failing dart,
And scalper dangling at his side.
More brightly gleamed his wary eye,
As braves the war-whoop loudly yelled—
A sight more like the fiery fiends
From Pluto's ghastly shore returned
Than human blood and bone!
They all have gone and left no tale
But woe which hurled them ever hence
To that shore whence no bark returns.
Old Cabin, thou, a land-mark art,
Of human progress' steady march!"
III
Of thee
Thus has time passed with naught more said;
For man in his pedantic art
Soars far in feeble flights of song
From Nature's heart, and thus he fails
With Nature's God to hold commune!
The bard has slept, dreamed many a dream,
But failed to dream one dream of thee.
High hangs his lyre on willow reed,
And sitting 'neath yon shady nook,
He fails to catch one note of thy
Immortal song that fills the air.
Awake, O bard, from sleep so deep!
Attune thy lyre; let Nature breathe
In her immortal breath of song;
Then wilt thou sing a song most sweet,
The song by Nature's vesper choir,
Through all the countless ages sung,-
And still is singing day by day.
Then all the world will join thy sweet
Refrain in praise and ardent love
Of this fair forest Dame!
IV
The nations all their day shall have;
Yet each in turn shall rise and fall,
As falls the dark brown autumn leaf;
Or as those dread sky-kissing tides,
Which toss frail barks high upon
Some ghastly, frowning storm-beat shore,—
Though slowly, yet quite surely ebb away.
-Aye! Egypt fair once spread the Nile,
And green-bay-tree-like proudly flourished;
Her snowy sails sea-ports bedecked,
And deeply ploughed the rolling main,
Or clave the placid lakes, as does
The gentle swan, when some soft breeze
The bulrush stirs, flings its perfume
Upon the rippling silver waves!
Fair cities dotted here and there
Her vast domain. Her royal line
Of Pharaohs held the sceptre gold
Upon her all-emblazoned throne.
Now Egypt fair is wreck and ruin.
For, as fled on the flight of years,
The unrelenting Hand of time
Wiped her sweet visage off the globe!
Naught save the grim, grey pyramid,
Sublimest work of man, yet stands
To greet the rosy morn, with proud
Uplifted head, expanded chest-
A death defiant scoff at time!
Yet hoary Time in his wild rage
Of wreck and ruin, like Jove shall hurl
His fiery bolts upon the head
Of pyramid with ire, and crush
And raze it to its base with scorn!
V
Next Greece, the fairest nymph that trod
This belted globe upon, once shone
As shines the Morning Orb, long ere
The Dawn the rosy East has kissed;
High reared her sacred temples in
Olympia's shady groves, and built
There sacred altars to her gods.
Old Zeus and Phoebus oft here sat
In council with their fellow gods.
And Homer, fiery bard, was first
To smite the chords of nature's lyre;
Sweet sang he till the earth was filled
With rarest strains of rapturous song!
Then art and letters blew and blushed,
The fairest flowers of ages past,
Whose essence, spilled upon the breeze,
Is wafted still forever on
The twin deft with the flight of years;
And man in calm delight inhales
The fragrance of pure classic lore!
But Greece is gone! Her statues fair
Are mingled with the dust; each god
Has flown some fairer clime to rule,
Or, subdued, walks the dark abyss.
VI
Then Rome, the gaudy Southern Queen,
On seven rugged, rock-ribbed hills
Securely built her throne. The world
Then saw a mighty power rise
In splendor great, as does the sun
On some young, swift-winged morn of June.
A brighter dawning seemed to break;
Another life was lived, for through
The Roman vein there coursed a blood,
A fiery burning blood of ire,
That rose and conquered all the world.
Great Cæsar led her legions forth
From victory on to victory,
And hung her royal pennons high
In tower, palace-hall, and throne;
The Roman sceptre swayed the globe.
Soft music soothed her savage ear,
Fine arts and sculptor were her toys,
And glory was her "starry crown."
But now we read the "Fall of Rome,"
The doleful lay that tells the tale
Of all who thus have passed away.
VII
To thee, fair Dame, we thus relate
The things which were but are no more;
That thou mightest know the worldly way,
And knowing, have no timid fear
To ever stir thy peaceful breast.
No fate like theirs awaits for thee;
For Fortune's maid shall tend with care
Thy every nod and beck—yes, place
Upon thy queenly brow a crown,
The "starry crown" by Freedom worn!
"Tis true no flint rock ribs thy base,
No stone thy corner marks; for that
What carest thou? For boasted pride?
Thy frame is of the sturdy oak,
Inlaid with ribs of stately pine;
The Prince and Princess twain are they
Of all Columbia's giant woods.
The sylvan songsters sing thy praise
From dawn till set of sun, and then
The nightingale, the queen of song,
In praise of thee poureth forth her lay
Till every mellow silver note,
Far floating in the silent trees,
Is taken by an elfish choir,
And chanted softly to the moon.
The eagle her wee eaglets tells
Of thee, that they may freedom love;
Then soaring full beyond the clouds,
She looks with vaunted pride on thee.
So must thy spirit fill the hearts
Of all Columbia's youth, as once
It filled old "Honest Abe," thy son,
Thy pride the first-born of thy love.
For when each lowly lad well knows
That ever upwards he may soar,
Beyond vain tyrants' galling sway
To fairer climes where Freedom reigns:
Then will the shadow of thy wing
For aye to them a shelter be!
LIFE IN A DREAM
THERE is nothing so sweet as our life in our dreams,
When we soar far on fancy's swift wing;
For a thing in our dreams is all that it seems,
And the songs are so sweet that we sing.
Ah! the sun shines the brightest, and stars twinkle lightest
At the moon in her silvery beams!
There is nothing so gay as the life in our dreams,
With its joy and its laughter and mirth;
For the pleasure that teems is far greater, one deems,
Than any he finds in the earth.
There are homes are our natal, and nothing is fatal
In the beautiful land of our dreams!
There is nothing so bright as the life in our dreams,
Far away from earth's trickery chance;
There the music's wild screams and the wine in its streams
Are both lost in the song and the dance.
Oh! our joy is the sweetest and life is completest,
Ah! the life in our beautiful dreams!
There is nothing serene as the life in our dreams,
When the dove to his mate softly cooes
In the groves by the streams and the moon's silver beams,
Where the swain oft his maid gently wooes.
There the swains are the rarest and maids are the fairest,
And their love is as true as it seems!
THE MORNING STAR
TO A. B. B.
THOU art, fair maid, the Morning Star,
The guide of dawning day,
And sendest diamond sparkles far
To wake the flowers of May.
Thou makest earth to bloom anew,
A boon thou'rt wont to give,
And spillest out the morning dew,
That all may blush and live.
Thou guardest with thy hand of might,
And never showeth frown;
Earth lullest sleep when cometh night,
And wak'st her with the dawn.
Fair maiden, God hast given thee
All power near and far,-
The rosy dawning's light to be,
The brightest Morning Star.
TO ESTELLE
Coy, sweet maid, I love so well,
Fair Estelle.
How much I love thee tongue can't tell,
Sweet Estelle.
But I love thee-love thee true-
More than violets love the dew,
More than roses love the sun-
Do I love thee, dearest one,
Dear Estelle !
Ah! my heart love's passions swell
For Estelle!
How I love my actions tell
Thee, Estelle:
That I love thy smiling face,
And thy captivating grace-
Love thy dreamy 'witching eyes
More than planets love the skies,
Wee Estelle !
Now I smite my lyre to swell
For Estelle;
Music's most entrancing spell
O'er Estelle.
With my fingers on my keys,
Like the balmy morning breeze
Stealing softly through the grain,
Will I gently wake a strain
For Estelle !
How I love my little belle,
My Estelle!
Deepest in my sacred dell
Is Estelle!
I esteem my maiden love
More than angels high above,
More than demons in the sea;
Love is light and life to me,
And Estelle!
A SONG OF THANKS
For the sun that shone at the dawn of spring,
For the flowers which bloom and the birds that sing,
For the verdant robe of the gray old earth,
For her coffers filled with their countless worth,
For the flocks which feed on a thousand hills,
For the rippling streams which turn the mills,
For the lowing herds in the lovely vale,
For the songs of gladness on the gale,-
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks,-
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the farmer reaping his whitened fields,
For the bounty which the rich soil yields,
For the cooling dews and refreshing rains,
For the sun which ripens the golden grains,
For the beaded wheat and the fattened swine,
For the stalled ox and the fruitful vine,
For the tubers large and cotton white,
For the kid and the lambkin frisk and blithe,
For the swan which floats near the river-banks,-
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the pumpkin sweet and the yellow yam,
For the corn and beans and the sugared ham,
For the plum and the peach and the apple red,
For the dear old press where the wine is tread,
For the cock which crows at the breaking dawn,
And the proud old "turk" of the farmer's barn,
For the fish which swim in the babbling brooks,
For the game which hide in the shady nooks,-
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks-
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the sturdy oaks and the stately pines,
For the lead and the coal from the deep, dark mines,
For the silver ores of a thousand fold,
For the diamond bright and the yellow gold,
For the river boat and the flying train,
For the fleecy sail of the rolling main,
For the velvet sponge and the glossy pearl,
For the flag of peace which we now unfurl,—
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks,―
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the lowly cot and the mansion fair,
For the peace and plenty together share,
For the Hand which guides us from above,
For Thy tender mercies, abiding love,
For the blessed home with its children gay,
For returnings of Thanksgiving Day,
For the bearing toils and the sharing cares,
We lift up our hearts in our songs and our prayers,-
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks,-
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
NOT YET A POET
AYE! many a rhyme my pen has flown,
In oblivion, all unknown;
Still many more, perchance, I say,
Float on in one unbroken lay-
But ask me naught of where or when,
Long as they ring in hearts of men!
Dear friend, I say these words to you,
Which through the ages will be true:
Though I have power to combine
These subtle rhymes of each sweet line—
Yet, I shall never live to see,
The title "POET" given me!
A BOUQUET
A BLOSSOM pink, a blossom blue,
Make all there is in love so true.
"Tis fit, methinks, my heart to move,
To give it thee, sweet girl, I love!
Now, take it, dear, this morn and wear
A wreath of beauty in thy hair;
Think on it, when from bliss we part-
The emblem of my wooing heart!
AN ODE TO THE SOLDIERS' AND
SAILORS' MONUMENT
THOU most majestic Queen of sculptural art,
What learned architect designed thy throne?
Who traced thy stately form in head and heart,
And sent the sculptor forth to carve the stone?
O speak, fair Queen, for thou art not alone;
Ten thousand unseen voices join refrain
That softly floats in one melodious tone,
As sweet as any ancient harper's strain
In odes to Indiana's silent victors slain.
Thy court well marks the conquest of the West,
A citadel sprung out the forest wild,
A mecca where the pilgrims quietly rest:
Each dame's content-content each sportive child;
The fiery redmen nevermore revile,
Nor haunt the footprints of thy daring sons,
Whose noble spheres are widening all the while,
Like as some brilliant star its orbit runs
And sheds on earth its light down from a thousand suns.
Thy throne emblazoned with the rarest jewels,
Each wall adorned with battered coats of mail,
Choice relics of some bloody fields or duels,
A legend or some untold battle tale.
I see the scouts go forth upon the trail,
And soldiers charging over battlements-
The weeping mother sends to God her wail;
While passion's rage the mortal heart laments,
The dove of peace is caged in direst banishments.
But see yon arms, full flushing victory
Brings hope, and joy is ringing everywhere
Beneath the "starry banner of the free,"
That shields her children from the tyrant's snare.
The peasant turns him to his lowly fare,
The rich pursues wild phantoms at his ease,
The rustic plies his long-forsaken share,
And lo! the dove is cooing, "Peace, sweet peace;"
For Mars has snatched his bolts from out the rosy East.
And when the last familiar scene has gone,
And brightest dawn has kissed the sable night,
Then thou shalt smile on faces yet unborn,
And be to them a gleaming beacon light;
For Might shall fall and on his throne sit Right,
When bloody wars and petty strifes have ceased;
Then thou shalt don thy spotless robe of white,
And say to man as hostess of the feast:
"My brother, sheath thy sword; the end of
life is peace."
TO A FADED FLOWER
To a violet that faded on my coat at Natchez, Miss.
March 8th, 1902.
ALAS! thou lovely floweret wee,
Fate blew a blighting breath
Upon the delicate form of thee,—
Thou'st met untimely death!
Thou blowest, blushest nevermore,
To drink the dews of night;
Thy sweet though short-lived life is o'er,
Thou seest no more the light.
'Twas vain! aye, vain! the selfish strife
That drooped thy purple crest;
Some swain or maiden took thy life,
To deck a love-lorn breast.
Ah, floweret wee, the God who made
All in the earth and sky,
Decreed that thou should blow and fade,—
All else should live and die!
Now, he who wails the floweret's fate,
And all the rest of man,
Must meet that fate, aye soon or late,
And scale their measured span.
We are but flowers that blush and blow,
As flight of years rolls on,
With time and tide's cold ebb and flow-
"Tis said "He's dead and gone!"
For as the maid clips off the stems
Where once the flowers have been,
So angels pluck earth's rarest gems,
Immortal souls of men!
The flower fadeth into air,
From whence its life is given—
But man's soul shining rich and rare
Ascendeth into heaven.
DAINTY DORA
TO D. M. M.
GREEKS Once sang a lovely song
To their maiden Cora;
But my lay floats soft along
To my Dainty Dora.
Frenchmen sing of Anne Belle,
Romans sang of Flora;
But I sing my song to tell
Of my Dainty Dora.
Scotchmen sing their songs to move
Mary or Debora;
But I sing my song of love-
Love for Dainty Dora.
Poets now a song may give
Psyche or Lenora;
But I'll sing long as I live
Just for Dainty Dora!
THE VIOLIN
THRICE hail the still unconquered King of
Song!
For all adore and love the Master Art
That reareth his throne in temple of the
heart;
And smiteth chords of passion full and strong
Till music sweet allures the sorrowing throng!
Then by the gentle curving of his bow
Maketh every mellow note in cadence flow,
To recompense the world of all its wrong.
Although the earth is full of cares and throes
That tempt the crimson stream of life to
cloy,
Thou mak'st glad hearts and trip'st "fantastic
toes,"
And fillest weary souls with mirth and joy-
The soul-entrancing cadence of thy strings
Proclaims thee Song's unconquered "King of
kings"!
WOMAN
I CALL thee angel of this earth,
For angel true thou art
In noble deeds and sterling worth
And sympathetic heart.
I, therefore, seek none from afar
For what they might have been,
But sing the praise of those which are
That dwell on earth with men.
For when man was a tottling wee,
Snug nestling on thy breast,
Or sporting gay upon thy knee,
Oh, thou who lovest him best;
An overflowing stream of love,
Sprung at his very birth,
And made thee gentle as a dove,
Fair angel of this earth.
Thou cheerest ever blithesome youth
With songs and fervent prayers,
And fillest heart with love and truth
A store for future cares.
Thou lead'st him safely in his prime,
True guide of every stage,
And then at last, as fades the time,
Thou comfortest his age.
Like as the sunshine after rain,
Far chasing 'way the mist,
Thou soothest human grief and pain,
Fleet messenger of bliss.
In battles where the sword and shield
Full lay the mighty low,
Thou hov'rest ever o'er the field,
To ease life's ebb and flow!
Thou standest, ever standest near,
Before man's waning eyes,
An angel true to him more dear
Than all beyond the skies!
No fabled sprites of chants and creeds,
Nor myths of bygone years,
For thou suppliest all his needs
And wip'st his briny tears.
So, if he quail in desert waste
Or toss life's stormy sea,
He turns his tear-stained eye in haste
For one fond glimpse of thee.
He longs to hide beneath thy wing,
And nestle on thy breast;
He lists to hear thee softly sing
Him into peaceful rest!
Oh, sing aloud Mt. Zion's songs,
To cheer each languid heart;
For now some feeble spirit longs
Thy blessings to impart.
And thus thou keepest the Master's will,
And showest all thy worth,
Through loving kindness thou art still
The angel of this earth!
THE BACHELOR'S SONG
WHILE I keep my lonely hall,
You are welcome one and all,
As I sing my little song;
Stay, I'll cheer you all day long—
And sow my bachelor-buttons,
And sow my bachelor-buttons.
While this world is wild with glee,
Chime I now my song to thee;
In my bosom lurks no care,
I can loiter everywhere—
And sow my bachelor-buttons,
And sow my bachelor-buttons.
Oh dear, what a happy life
For the man who has no wife,
To bind with sore distresses,
And silk and satin dresses-
While he sows his bachelor-buttons,
While he sows his bachelor-buttons.
His heart is ever merry,
His way is bright and cheery;
No peevish baby crying,
No jealous wife a-sighing—
While he sows his bachelor-buttons,
While he sows his bachelor-buttons.
Ah! praise the God who hath given
A life so much like heaven;
Quit it? Oh no, I'll never,
But live happy forever-
And sow my bachelor-buttons,
And sow my bachelor-buttons.
PUT NOTHING IN ANOTHER'S WAY
PUT nothing in another's way,
Who's plodding on through life,
But fill each heart with joy each day,
With peace instead of strife.
So then let not a missent word,
Or thought, or act, or deed
Be by our weaker brother heard
To cause his heart to bleed.
Put nothing in another's way,
It clear and ample leave;
For words and actions day by day
Life's great example weave.
'Tis then not meet that we should think
That we are solely free
In manners, dress, in food, or drink,
Or fulsome revelry.
Put nothing in another's way,
Just learn the Christian part
To let a holy, sunny ray
Shine in thy brother's heart.
Help him to bear his load of care,
His soul get edified-
"Twas only for the soul's welfare
That Jesus bled and died.
Put nothing in another's way,
Ye who are sent to teach;
No dark cloud cast across the day,
Ye who the gospel preach.
Ye twain must set the truth aright
With joy and peace and love;
For in your souls shines forth the light
From Jesus Christ above.
Put nothing in another's way,
Beloved Christian friends;
On through your toils, and cares, still pray,
Till life's fleet journey ends.
When at the resurrection dawn
Eternal life is given,
We'll get our harp, our robe, our crown,
The star-lit crown of heaven.
FLOATING WITH THE GALE
TO MY LOST BROTHER
SHIPS the angry sea is lashing;
But I launch my little bark,
Though the thunder peals are crashing,
And the sea is pitchy dark!
See by lightning's vivid flashing
How to shift my tattered sail—
Far across the billows dashing,
I am floating with the gale.
CHORUS
Floating, floating, floating ever
On the stormy deep blue sea,
Far from father and dear mother
And, true love, away from thee!
Go, ye zephyrs, sweetly laden,
Cheer my loved ones in their wail;
Tell my wee sweet bright-eyed maiden
I am floating with the gale!
When the siren maids are waking,
And are singing wild sea songs,
Dear, they start my heart to aching,
For its love to thee belongs.
Now my love-lorn soul is shaking
With a spell of bitter wail,
And my heart is sadly breaking,
For I'm floating with the gale!
CHORUS
Now my hopes are fading ever,
Gloom is chasing 'way the bliss;
Dear, I know that I can never
Come thy ruby lips to kiss!
But my heart will cling forever
To that love I oft did hail,
For those ties I can not sever,
Though I'm floating with the gale!
CHORUS
Dear, my heart is ever longing,
Longs surfmen my bark to save;
Through my brain these thoughts are
thronging,
Of a grave beneath the wave;
Of loved ones my heart is wronging,
And the belly of the whale;
'Round my soul their ghosts are thronging,
As I'm floating with the gale!
CHORUS
Dear, I fain would be returning
To the cove just where thou art,
While my languid breast is burning
Light and love full out my heart!
But cruel Fate my hopes is spurning,
And winds blow against my sail;
While out Death my life is burning,
I'm still floating with the gale!
CHORUS
LULA JOHNSON'S SONG
Written in Quinn Chapel, A. M. E. Church, Ninth and
Walnut Streets, Louisville, Ky., Wednesday evening,
October 16th, 1907, while Miss Lula E. Johnson was sing-
ing "Ave Maria."
I HAVE heard the mock-bird singing when the
orchards were in bloom,
And the sweetness of his music made the pea-
cock don his plume;
Ay! I've heard cock-robin-redbreast chirping
on a sunny day,
And the skylark soaring skywards, merrily
sing his festal lay;
And the brown thrush and the bluebird thrill
their little treble notes;
All the woodland songsters pouring songs
of gladness from their throats—
But not one has touched so deeply, and not
one has last so long
As the ever ringing cadence of sweet Lula
Johnson's song!
When the breeze has ceased to whisper and
the night is soft and still,
Save the awe-provoking shrilling of the ghastly
whippoorwill,
As the moonbeams pour down brightly on the
woodland, hill and dale,
I oft listen at my window to the queenly night-
ingale;
But no song of merry woodland, neither hill,
nor dale, nor dell,
Has ever smote my bosom, nor has made my
spirit swell,
Like the soul-inspiring music that so softly
glides along
Oh! so softly and so gently in sweet Lula
Johnson's song!
Oh! my soul has caught the music, as it softly
floats along-
Ah! the soul-entrancing music of sweet Lula
Johnson's song!
If my feet shall ever falter, it shall cheer me on
my way;
Ay, sustain and give me comfort, make my
feeble spirit gay.
All we need to have, my brothers, in our war
of peace 'gainst strife,
Is the cadence of sweet music sprinkled in to
sweeten life;
It will sweeten all our bitters, which now seem
so very long,
If we have it soft and gentle, as sweet Lula
Johnson's song.
In the lonely hours of midnight, when fair
Luna 'gins to pale,
I have heard her songs a-ringing, floating
softly on the gale.
And I hope when dawns the morning, when I
draw my fleeting breath,
When my friends are gathered 'round me, and
my eyes are closed in death—
Ere you throw the sods upon me, on my never-
heaving breast,
While my body's lying silent and my soul is
seeking rest-
Then I'll wing straight home to glory, for the
journey won't be long,
On the spirit-wafting music of sweet Lula
Johnson's song!
A TRIBUTE TO DUNBAR
THE sweetest singer once thou wast, but art
no more;
An elf thou wast of what thou now shalt be,
Where thou art in realms of that celestial
shore;
There thou shalt sing through all eternity.
We, peerless bard, bewail thy loss
And shed heart-broken tears,
Though meekly thou hast borne thy cross
And winged the flight of years!
Thrice blessed singer, wrapped in heavenly
bliss,
Of earth's poor souls thy fortune who can
tell?
Perchance thy splendid lot be solely this:
To change thy lute with the angel Israfel!
If so, then smite thy golden strings
With fingers nimble, strong,
Till all along fair heaven rings
With cadence of thy song!
Thee tyrant earth once held, imprisoned soul,
That suffered tortures of relentless strife,
Fair heaven now holds within her sheltered fold,
And gives thee robe and harp-eternal life!
Grant him, O God, unfaltering breath
To sing from heaven afar
A
song to cheer our souls in death-
The peerless Paul Dunbar!
WERE I A BIRD
WERE I a bird free born to fly
Aloof on two wee, downy wings,
My canopy would be the sky
When rosy morn its dawning springs.
Were I a bird I'd sweetly sing
Earth's vesper song in tree-tops high,
And chant the carol of the Spring
To every weary passer by.
Were I a bird, the sweetest voice
That human ear has ever heard,-
The mocking-bird would be my choice,
For he's the sweetest singing bird!
Were I a bird my life would be
In keeping with the Will divine—
I'd sing His carols full and free
In spreading oak and cony pine!
Were I a bird through air I'd roam,
Just flitting on the morning breeze,
In search of summer's sunny dome,
To live contentedly at ease.
Were I a bird I'd sing a tune
For farmers seeking shady rest
Beneath the spreading oak in June,
In swinging boughs that rock my nest.
Were I a bird I'd scale the cliff
When dawns the bleak December day,
Far from the ice and snow I'd shift
Until the fairest day in May!
Were I a bird, a mocking-bird,
The King of birdie's singing sons,
My music would fore'er be heard
As I sweet sang to cheerless ones.
Were I a bird I'd seek my rest
When jocund Day blows out his light;
In boughs that hover o'er my nest
I'd sweetly sing, "Good Night, Good
Night!"
AN ODE TO ETHIOPIA
TO THE ASPIRING NEGRO YOUTH
After years of patient study and historical research, I
have made the following deductions of parts played by the
Ethiopian in the annals of history, under the caption, "An
Ode to Ethiopia." It is true that questions will rise re-
garding the racial identity of some of my characters, in
view of historical statements which place them with the
Caucasin race; yet I firmly believe, were impartial history
written, my claims would be justified. However, Time,
the great Arbiter, will finally decide the equity of my
claims.
I
THOU Sovran Queen of Afric's sunny strands,
I smite my lyre to sing thy praise unsung;
In strains far sweeter than seraphic bands,
A lay deep in my bosom's core is sprung.
Fair Queen, although my years as yet be
young,
Deep thoughts and musings of thy history
old,
Where odes and fiery epics long have hung,
Live centuries in my immortal soul
And strike sweet Lydian measures
harp of gold.
on my
II
Therefore, my song floats softly up to thee,
Full soft as those sweet zephyrs of the
spring,
Of which it was and is and still must be,
The sweetest of aeolian strains that ring!
I breathe it on the soft sea winds which bring
Their cooling treasures from the rolling
deep;
They 'fresh my brow and make my sad heart
sing
And ever lure my drowsy eyes from sleep,
And bid thy vesper chorist strictest vigil
keep.
III
Of all the nations that have trod the earth,
In civil states or in the forest wild,
Thou wast the first of real enlightened birth,
Born in fair Egypt on the spreading Nile.
In valleys fertile, sunny climates mild,
Thou sternly taught the "chosen" Hebrew
race-
Madonna sheltered with her Holy Child,
Who came to plead man's all unworthy case,
And drained His sacred heart, earth's vilest
sin efface!
IV
Long ere the Grecian oped his classic lids
Or mould' true beauty with artistic hands,
Thou reared upon thy plains the lofty pyra-
mids,
With sphinx and obelisks 'decked thy burn-
ing sands.
Aye! Queen, thou then wast hailed in all the
lands
Long ere vain Babel 'fused the human
tongue
In dialects rude of wild barbaric bands;
Thou soared to Wisdom's realm, her sceptre
wrung,
And reigned the wisest queen the nations all
among.
V
Thou first taught man the mystic sciences
probe,
To scan earth's apex, median, and base;
Thou, too, inscribed the belt around the globe,
And made deep tracings on its hoary face.
Well fixed each angle, arc, and line in place,
Then soared thou far into the "milky way,"
Far in the bright, celestial span of space,
Where orbs and planets all their homage pay
Unto the sun, the ever reigning "King of
Day."
VI
Once in great splendor did thy Pharaoahs rule
In Egypt, with her glory flown of yore;
They laid foundations of the mundane school,
And taught the art of governmental lore.
And then from thy great military store
Thou sent the gallant Hannibal to war,
Taught Romans tactics never known before,
And filled their hearts with ever-cowering
awe,
And bowed their haughty heads to thy ma-
jestic law.
VII
But in this age is writ another story;
Then pen of arrogant, vain Caucasian sage,
Has thee full robbed of thy immortal glory,
And smeared thy name on History's sacred
page!
Forsooth, the Book, once closed for many an
age,
Is opened by thy sons-though fraught with
pain-
The curtain's drawn; they rise upon the stage;
And their valiant deeds and blood shall wash
the stain
As clean as April showers wash the dusty
plain.
VIII
I sing now of thy heroes of today,
Thy sturdy warriors and thy gallant
knights,
Who charge into the thickest of the fray,
And die for country and their free-born
rights,-
For orphans, widows and their little mites.
Thus, Attucks brave, without a moment's
pause,
(While reeled the Nation in her darkest
plights)
Full bared his breast in Freedom's holy
cause,
First fell and tore the code of Tyranny's
cruel laws!
IX
Now, if my lay is yet not sweet enough,
I'll bid a gentler, subtler strain awake,
And sing of fights with Jackson on the Gulf
And Perry's hard-fought battle on the Lake!
Of fights in fen and moor and hoary brake,
On Lookout Mountain and the rolling
main-
Through searing blasts of bleak December's
flake,
And drenching torrents of fair April's rain:
Their valiant deeds are springing ever up
amain!
X
They fought, the Union from State's Rights to
free;
At Vicksburg, Wagner, and Port Hudson
lent
Their aid; their deeds at Pillow and Olustee
Rose surge on surge like ocean billows rent!
The praises of the gallant Ninth and Tenth
Will ever rise and soft float to the sky-
They bagged Old Bull in Rocky Mountain tent;
Then stormed the Spanish block-housed
Hills on high,
And bade the tyrant Spaniard's heaving
heart to die!
XI
"High time, my Haitian islet must be free!"
Great Touissant thus his declaration tacks;
Then drives proud Frenchmen into the yawn-
ing sea-
"The bravest whites, by bravest of the
blacks."
Brave Maceo pursues the Spanish packs,
And Aguinaldo, in the mountain wilds,
Pours shot and shell into the tyrants' backs—
They save her throne and Freedom on them
smiles,
True heroes, and the Fathers of their sunlit
Isles !
XII
Thy sons have triumphed in the Halls of State;
Hamilton and Douglas were the first to gain,
With lightning eye and tongue of thunder
great,
The civic lead of thy illustrious train.
Next Bruce and Revels, senatorial twain;
John Lynch and Small emit a brilliant light,
And Langston, Pinchback, Cheatham
remain ;
all
With Dancy, Vernon, Anderson, and White,
Liang Williams, Lyons, Terrell stand for
"Civic Right."
XIII
In science's realm with Banneker we start,
Then read on Medicae's emblazoned wall:
"Dan Williams here first stitched the human
heart!"
Close by the names of Curtis, Boyd, and
Hall.
But others list'd and heard Invention's call,
In all its sweetness of the days of yore,
And Woods, the greatest foreman of them all,
Shouts on his voyage with Black and Bal-
timore:
"We come! we come! good Dame, thy region
to explore!"
XIV
"I, too," said 'Monia Lewis, "can make a
man!"
Then mould' his form with most artistic
ease
But all aeolian strains Blind Tom could scan,
And play as softly as the South Sea breeze
Upon his major and his minor keys!
Good Douglas gently wakes the violin's song,
And White leads home the zephyrs from the
seas;
While Coleridge-Taylor with an art more
strong
Full finds the key-note of Dame Nature's
vesper song!
XV
If shady nooks in Poesy's realm they choose,
Or barks to drift the smooth, prosaic stream,
There Phillis held communion with the Muse,
And Chesnutt woke the "Colonel" from his
dream!
Max Barber, Thompson, Knox and Fortune
beam;
Great Braithwaite scales the classic moun-
tain heights,
And Cooper, like a beacon light, will gleam;
While Dunbar, sun-like, sheds his holy lights
In dazzling splendor on his solar satellites!
XVI
These brilliant names shall never fade away:
Emblazoned in the sacred Hall of Fame,
They shall remain till dawns that direful Day,
The valid seal beneath thy sacred name.
Deft Tanner, artist, ever blazing flame,
With Pickens, Bruce and Locke of classic
dell,
Old Truth and Harper, Yates and Ruffin came,
And Walker, Terrell, Williams, known so
well
Long ere Marie had taught the hoary world
to spell!
XVII
The learned Scarborough writes the classic
Greek;
Dean Miller thinks in calculations cold;
While Cogman writes the annals of the meek,
DuBois reveals the secrets of the Soul!
But all shall read in letters gilded gold:
"Who teaches head and heart and hands, has
won
The priceless boon, the guerdon of the goal,
The portion due thy most illustrious son,
Tuskegee's seer and sage, the noble Wash-
ington!"
XVIII
Thy songs inspire and cheer the human soul,
Still plodding forth in search of Beulah's
vale;
Lead wondering lambs into the Master's fold,
When Flora Burgeon's notes far float the
gale!
Though Patti Brown we loud applaud and hail,
And Hackley's voice is heard in every
land,-
Black Patti is the queenly nightingale
That leads the chorus, as they singing stand
As Miriam stood, to sing thee to the “Prom-
ised Land!"
XIX
I see the Prophet's mandate to the land,
In golden letters glit'ring in the sky:
"Fair Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand,
Her sons shall sway the earth long ere they
die!"
As swift as lightnings with the storm-clouds
fly,
To light the path celestial feet have trod:
So be thy soaring to the realms on high,
When mortal feet no more shall tread this
sod,
And thy holy spirit wings its homeward
flight to God!
TO J. S. B.
On seeing her December 25th, 1904, after two years'
travel.
TAKE, fair maid, these simple lines
From my pen;
Think of strollings 'neath the pines,
Which have been-
Long and lonesome were the days
We were apart,
But may Love, now, have her sways,-
Bind heart to heart!
O'er main to isle and back to land
Have I been;
Beheld on either hand
A maiden queen:
But none with captivating charms
Like thine;
None to nestle in her arms,
Love of mine!
Charms unto thee God gave
To banish strife;
To glorify and save
One sweet life-
Take this, dear, before we part
From this bliss;
'Tis but love flowing from my heart,
Thine to kiss!
THE MAYOR'S RING
I HOLD a token in my hand,
A very tiny thing;
And yet within its golden band
A thousand memories cling.
Aye! thrice ten thousand memories cling
Of signal victories won,
Enshrined within this little ring,
Reward of duty done.
I ever shall this token prize,
And wear it with true grace—
The tie that binds the kindred ties
Of friendship race to race.
And when I soar full through the skies,
Yet ever will I cling
Within the gates of Paradise
This sacred little ring!
WHAT'S THE USE?
OH! WHAT is living but moving about,
Buoyed up with hope and crushed down by
doubt?
What is the draught of breath we harp on as
life?
Naught but a sip of peace, a cup full of strife-
What's the use?
What is the place we call our home, "sweet
home"?
Naught but a span of space where one may
roam:
Night's pitchy corner; a hard crust of bread;
Cot for your feeble limbs, pillow your head—
What's the use?
Now, what is loving but acting a fool?
And what is quitting?-Producing a rule:
Break short the flight of Dan Cupid's swift
dart,
Aimed at the core of an innocent heart!
What's the use?
Say, what is marrying but getting in trouble?
Trifling 'way joy while your sorrow is double?
What, then, is your state my friend, after
you've wed?
Naught but a vial of wrath poured upon your
head!
What's the use?
Ah! what is batching but living a man;
Sporting and sleeping—just running his plan?
Come when he's ready, and go when he please—
Brain's full of joy, his heart is at ease-
See, that's the use!
O GOD, WILT THOU HELP ME IN
SCHOOL?
On Saturday, March 1, 1902, I left Alcorn and went
home in order to earn money enough to defray my ex-
penses for the year 1902-03. I began work as soon as I
reached home and labored on father's farm until the last
week in June, 1902. I had seen by that time that there
was nothing to be realized from that source but disheart-
ening failure.
I then acted as agent for the "Zion Record," published
by Rev. R. A. Adams, 39 St. Catherine Street, Natchez,
Miss., until August 20, 1902. Knowing that there was a
dormitory to be built for girls at Alcorn, I went there,
hoping to get work and to be there when school opened.
On arriving, I failed to get employment. I had no money.
The Boarding Hall was run by boys who stayed over sum-
mer. Finding I was unemployed, they refused to let me
take meals with them. There I was friendless and
penniless-without a bite of bread and nowhere to lay my
head. To drive the wolf of starvation away and to keep
from being devoured, I made arrangements with President
Lanier to cut wood for something to eat, until school
opened Sept. 2, 1902.
When school opened, the Faculty met the first day and
distributed the positions to the eligibles. On going down
to the Hall to take my first meal, to my surprise I found
I had been awarded the position of waiter. To hold a
position, or even remain on the Campus, one must matricu-
late within three days after school starts, if there when it
opens, or after he arrives, if not. I then wrote home for
the matriculation fee ($13), as I had labored there all
summer. As that letter was sealed my destiny was sealed
in it. It was one that hauled my anchor of hope; yes,
one to bring glad tidings of great joy and crowning suc-
cess, or the gloom of disastrous failure. Thus, having my
hope sealed, I wrote across it "In Haste!"
The night of its return was a dark, rainy one. As all
sat discussing different events that had transpired since the
new session had begun, suddenly a whistle was heard.
How our hearts throbbed with gladness as we exclaimed,
"There, that's the mail!" Dear reader, you cannot
imagine how overjoyed I was. I knew that bag contained
a letter for me; so anxious was I to receive it I did not
trust anyone, but rushed to the office, and ere long my
name was called.
I opened it then and there, with an eager look for a
green piece of paper styled a "Money Order." I looked,
but found it not. All hope vanished; joy faded; and
gloom hovered over me-a feeling I never before had, nor
since, and I hope never again to have, electrified my body.
It was then raining at full headway: the lightnings flashed;
the thunders pealed out peal after peal, each succeeding
one louder than the first. By this time all had gone to
bed but me. I thought thought after thought, prayed
prayer after prayer, sent up cry after cry, shed tear after
I went to bed, but could not sleep. I then thought
of this subject: "O God, Wilt Thou Help Me in School?"
After writing it, my feelings were changed, the gloom was
dispelled, and 'Smiling Hope' returned with joyous tid-
ings of happiness and a blissful future.
tear.
O, GOD to Thee, who knowest all things,
To Thee each being his praises brings,
In heaven, or earth, or sea, or sky—
To-night to Thee I raise my cry.
To-night as Thou doth know the why,
The why I make each tearful sigh-
Hast Thou not crowned and blest my way?
Why 'st Thou forsaken me to-day?
To-night while in my deepest grief,
I calmly wait Thy sweet relief;
Thou knowest I have done my best,
Oh, give my pondering soul some rest.
To-night, O God, grant all to know,
For man to reap he first must sow;
To know to have both bread and wine
He must reap all at harvest time.
To-night, O God, to Thee I plead,
Thou must protect me, guide and lead
Through this which is my darkest night
To a day when Thou shalt give me light.
To-night my soul does bleed with pain,
As murky clouds drip down the rain!
O God, heal me of this heart ache,
For thy dear Son Christ Jesus' sake.
To-night me compass grief and fears,
To-night while drip heart-broken tears;
There seems to be no one to save
My weeping soul from chilly grave.
To-night as I, Thy servant, pray
To Thee, to turn my darkness day,
And change my many blinding fears
To brighter hope for future years.
O restless soul, thou canst not sleep,
For, ship-like, thou art tossed the deep;
Aye, tossed by surge of mighty wave,
With none to share and none to save.
O God, in Thee I now believe,
Since life in Thee I do receive;
I pray Thee now with trembling fear
To my sad soul draw near, draw near.
O God, Thou knowest this night I dread,
As 'twere to number me with the dead—
I plead to Thee as by a rule,
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
To-night, O God, the darkest gloom
Hangs o'er me like a cloud to doom;
I cry while sitting on this stool-
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
This wide world o'er my mind doth roam,
So many miles away from home,
With thoughts thread-like wound in a spool-
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
Dear Lord, I ask of Thee one boon,
Pure as the light of "harvest moon";
And cry as when bathed in a pool—
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
While time and tide flow o'er my mind,
For wisdom, Lord, I ever pine;
•
But not in folly of a fool-
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
Oh, may I now look up and smile,
As children, mirthful all the while,
When playing in the shade so cool-
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
When life's long journey nears its end,
And friend so dear must part from friend,
To bathe deep in Thy living pool-
O God, wilt Thou help me in school?
Oh days of woe, oh do relent,
For all my sins I now repent,
To bathe in Siloam's ancient pool-
O God, right now help me in school.
Ah, when this stormy life is o'er,
I'll moor my bark on th' eternal shore;
Then shall I cross life's mortal pool,
And God will then help me in school!
BEHIND THE BARS
I AM a pilgrim far from home,
A wanderer like Mars,
And thought my wanderings ne'er should come,
So fixed behind the bars!
I left my sunny Southern home
Beneath the silver stars;
A northward path began to roam,
Not seeking prison bars.
I sought a higher, holier life,
Which never virtue mars;
But Fate had spun a net of strife
For me behind the bars!
My mother's lowly thatched-roofed cot
My nobler senses jars;
And so I seek to aid her lot,
But not behind the bars!
"Tis said, forsooth, the poet learns
Through sufferings and wars
To sing the song which deepest burns
Behind the prison bars!
Thus I resign myself to Fate,
Regardless of her scars;
For soon she'll open wide the gate
For me behind the bars.
I plead to you, my fellow man,
For all who wear the tars;
To lend what little help you can
To us behind the bars.
O God, I breathe my prayer to Thee,
Who never sinner bars:
Set each immortal spirit free
Behind these prison bars!
HARVARD SQUARE
"Tis once in life our dreams come true,
The myths of long ago,
Quite real though fairy-like their view,
They surge with ebb and flow;
Thus thou, O haunt of childhood dreams,
More beauteous and fair
Than Nature's landscape and her streams,
Historic Harvard Square.
My soul hath panted long for thee,
Like as the wounded hart
That vainly strives himself to free
Full from the archer's dart;
And struggled oft all, all alone
With burdens hard to bear,
But now I stand at Wisdom's throne
To-night in Harvard Square.
A night most tranquil,-I was proud
My thoughts soared up afar,
To moonbeams pouring through the cloud,
Or some lone twinkling star;
And musing thus, my quickened pace
Beat to the printery's glare,
Where first I saw a friendly face
In classic Harvard Square.
"Ho! stranger, thou art wan and worn
Of journey's wear and tear;
Thy face all haggard and forlorn,
Pray tell me whence and where?"
"I came from out-the Sunny South-
The spot-on earth-most fair,"
Fell lisping from my trembling mouth-
"In search-of-Harvard Square."
"Here rest, my friend, upon this seat,
And feel thyself at home;
I'll bring thee forth some drink and meat,
"Twill give thee back thy form."
And then I prayed the Lord to bless
Us, and that little lair-
Quite sure, I thought, I had found rest
Most sweet in Harvard Square.
"I came," I said, "o'er stony ways,
Through mountain, hill and dale,
I've felt old Sol's most scorching rays,
And braved the stormy gale;
I've done this, Printer, not for gold,
Nor diamonds rich and rare-
But for a burning in my soul
To learn in Harvard Square.
"I've journeyed long without a drink
Nor yet a bite of bread,
While in this state, O Printer, think—
No shelter for my head.
I mused, 'Hope's yet this side the grave'—
My pluck and courage there
Then made my languid heart bear brave—
Each throb for Harvard Square."
A sound soon hushed my heart's rejoice-
"The watchman on his search?"
"No!" rang the printer's gentle voice,
"Deak' Wilson in from church.
O'er there, good 'Deak'," the printer said,
"The wanderer in that chair,
Hath come to seek the lore deep laid
Up here in Harvard Square."
"It matters not how you implore,
He can no longer stay;
But on the night's 'Plutonian shore,'
Await the coming day.
I'm sorry, sir," he calmly said,
"Though hard, I guess 'tis fair,
Thou hast no place to lay thy head-
Not yet in Harvard Square!"
"Good night!" he said, and we the same-
I sighed, “Where shall I go?”
He soon returned and with him came
An officer and-Oh!
"Now sir, you take this forlorn tramp
With all his shabby ware,
And guide him safely off the 'Camp'
Of dear old Harvard Square."
As soon as locked within the jail,
Deep in a ghastly cell,
Methought I heard the bitter wail
Of all the fiends of hell!
"O God, to Thee I humbly pray
No treacherous prison snare
Shall close my soul within for aye
From dear old Harvard Square."
Just then I saw an holy Sprite
Shed all her radiant beams,
And round her shone the source of light
Of all the poets' dreams!
I plied my pen in sober use,
And spent each moment spare
In sweet communion with the Muse
I met in Harvard Square!
I cried: "Fair Goddess, hear my tale
Of sorrow, grief and pain."
That made her face an ashen pale,
But soon it glowed again!
"They placed me here; and this my crime,
Writ on their pages fair:-
'He left his sunny native clime,
And came to Harvard Square!""
"Weep not, my son, thy way is hard,
Thy weary journey long-
But thus I choose my favorite bard
To sing my sweetest song.
I'll strike the key-note of my art
And guide with tend'rest care,
And breathe a song into thy heart
To honor Harvard Square.
"I called old Homer long ago,
And made him beg his bread
Through seven cities, ye all know,
His body fought for, dead.
Spurn not oppression's blighting sting,
Nor scorn thy lowly fare;
By them I'll teach thy soul to sing
The songs of Harvard Square.
"I placed great Dante in exile,
And Byron had his turns;
Then Keats and Shelley smote the while,
And my immortal Burns!
But thee I'll build a sacred shrine,
A store of all my ware;
By them I'll teach thy soul to sing
'A place in Harvard Square.'
"To some a store of mystic lore,
To some to shine a star:
The first I gave to Allan Poe,
The last to Paul Dunbar.
Since thou hast waited patient, long,
Now by my throne I swear
To give to thee my sweetest song
To sing in Harvard Square."
And when she gave her parting kiss
And bade a long farewell,
I sat serene in perfect bliss
As she forsook my cell.
Upon the altar-fire she poured
Some incense very rare;
Its fragrance sweet my soul assured
I'd enter Harvard Square.
Reclining on my couch, I slept
A sleep sweet and profound;
O'er me the blessed angels kept
Their vigil close around.
With dawning's smile, my fondest hope
Shone radiant and fair:
The Justice cut each chain and rope
"Tween me and Harvard Square!
Cell No. 40, East Cambridge Jail,
Cambridge, Mass., July 26, 1910
THE END
THOUGH man through life so swiftly wends,
And o'er its journey runs his race;
Though rough, or smooth, or 'round the bends,
In distance putting fleetest friend:
Alas! there comes a halting place,
A place of rest-the journey's end!

        <collex:text>Claude McKay's second book of poetry, Constab Ballads, appeared in Kingston in November 1912; the version used here bears exclusively a London publisher's imprint. As with his first book, Songs of Jamaica, it consists of poems written using the lexicon and voice of Jamaican patois. Unlike that earlier book, however, Constab Ballads appeared with only a preface by the author himself, and the footnotes to unusual grammatical formulations are considerably fewer in number than in the earlier book (in place of copious footnotes, here McKay includes an extensive glossary). On the whole, Constab Ballads seems to bear less of Jekyll's imprint, and be more clearly the product of McKay's own inspiration and vision. (Another influence on the text might be Rudyard Kipling's Barrack-Room Ballads.)
            Claude McKay served as a constable in the colonial Jamaican police force for six months in 1911. He was trained and largely stationed on clerical duty in Spanish Town, west of Kingston, though for some of his duty he was posted in a place called Half-Way Tree. Through the intercession of Walter Jekyll he was relieved of his duty only a few months into his five-year term. Shortly after the publication of Constab Ballads and the death of his mother, McKay would leave Jamaica for college-level study in the United States. That move would lead to major changes in the style and voice of his poetry and prose; among other things, his poetry after 1912 rarely, if ever, used Jamaican patois with anything like the density of this earlier work. (Dialect speech would be important in much of McKay's later prose, especially in novels set in Jamaica such as Banana Bottom.) 
            In his Author's Preface to Constab Ballads, McKay indicates that he was not temperamentally well-suited to serve as a constable: 
            
            LET me confess it at once. I had not in me the stuff that goes to the making of a good constable; for I am so constituted that imagination outruns discretion, and it is my misfortune to have a most improper sympathy with wrong-doers. I therefore never "made cases," but turning, like Nelson, a blind eye to what it was my manifest duty to see, tried to make peace, which seemed to me better.
            
            Moreover, I am, by temperament, unadaptive; by which I mean that it is not in me to conform cheerfully to uncongenial usages. We blacks are all somewhat impatient of discipline, and to the natural impatience of my race there was added, in my particular case, a peculiar sensitiveness which made certain forms of discipline irksome, and a fierce hatred of injustice. Not that I ever openly rebelled; but the rebellion was in my heart, and it was fomented by the inevitable rubs of daily life trifles to most of my comrades, but to me calamities and tragedies. To relieve my feelings, I wrote poems, and into them I poured my heart in its various moods. This volume consists of a selection from these poems.
            
            While the majority of the poems in Constab Ballads are direct accounts of life as a working police officer, some of the later poems appear to have been written after McKay obtained his release from service (see "Free"). 
            Several of the themes of McKay's later poetry can be seen in Constab Ballads. A sentimental poem like "Bennie's Departure" reflect hints of homoeroticism that will also recur in Harlem Shadows, in poems like "The Barrier," and "Alfonso, Dressing to Wait at Table." Poems like "A Labourer's Life Give Me" have a strong sense of the dignity of clean labor that one also sees in McKay's later communist-themed poetry. The poem "Pay-Day" has references to prostitution that will also be an important part of Harlem Shadows (the same poem hints at a critique of the corrosive effects of capitalism on the lives of working people that will also be a hallmark of McKay's "Workers Dreadnought" poems written a decade later). 
            Race-consciousness is not especially pronounced in Constab Ballads, though we do see references to the diverse population of colonial Jamaica in a poem like "Knutsford Park Races" ("Faces of all types an' kinds / Faces showin' diffran' minds, / Faces from de udder seas / Right from de antipodes"). 
            It is particularly illustrative to compare the poem titled "Sukee River" that appears in this collection (1912) against a poem with the same title that appears in Cambridge Magazine (1920) and Spring in New Hampshire (1921), after McKay has made the move to the U.S. and has spent time in England with influential Cambridge editors like Ogden Nash. The Constab Ballads version of "Sukee River" is joyous, romantic, and sensuously embodied, with verses like the following being especially notable for their innocence and eroticism: 
            
            Kiss my naked breast
            In its black skin drest:
            Let your dainty silver bubbles
            Ease it of its lifelong troubles,
            Dis my naked breast
            In its black skin drest.
            
            
            In 1920 in Cambridge Magazine, and then again in 1921, in Spring and New Hampshire, McKay printed a very different poem with the same title, which appears to be almost a lament for the loss of the world represented by the earlier poem: 
            
            Thou sweet-voiced stream that first gavest me drink,
            Watched o'er me when I floated on thy breast,
            What black-faced boy now gambols on thy brink,
            Or finds beneath thy rocks a place of rest?
            What naked lad doth linger long by thee,
            And run and tumble in the sun-scorched sand,
            Or heed the pea-dove in the wild fig tree,
            While I am roaming in an alien land?
            No wonder that my heart is happy never,
            I have been faithless to thee, Sukee River.
            
            In addition to the strong sense of displacement one sees in the 1920 "Sukee River," one can't help but notice substantial changes in diction and voice, even as the poet covers some of the same themes and images from the earlier poem ("What naked lad doth linger long by thee...").

        <collex:text>LET me confess it at once. I had not in me the stuff that goes to the making of a good constable; for I am so constituted that imagination outruns discretion, and it is my misfortune to have a most improper sympathy with wrong-doers. I therefore never "made cases," but turning, like Nelson, a blind eye to what it was my manifest duty to see, tried to make peace, which seemed to me better.
            Moreover, I am, by temperament, unadaptive; by which I mean that it is not in me to conform cheerfully to uncongenial usages. We blacks are all somewhat impatient of discipline, and to the natural impatience of my race there was added, in my particular case, a peculiar sensitiveness which made certain forms of discipline irksome, and a fierce hatred of injustice. Not that I ever openly rebelled; but the rebellion was in my heart, and it was fomented by the inevitable rubs of daily life trifles to most of my comrades, but to me calamities and tragedies. To relieve my feelings, I wrote poems, and into them I poured my heart in its various moods. This volume consists of a selection from these poems.
            The life was, as it happened, unsuited to me, and I to it; but I do not regret my experiences. If I had enemies whom I hated, I also had close friends whom I loved.
            One word in conclusion. As constituted by the authorities the Force is admirable, and it only remains for the men themselves, and especially the sub-officers, to make it what it should be, a harmonious band of brothers.
            C. McK.

        <collex:text>ALL dat week was cold an' dreary,
            An' I worked wid heavy heart;
            All my limbs were weak an' weary,
            When I knew that we would part;
            An' I thought of our first meeting
            On dat pleasant day o' June,
            Of his kind an' modest greeting
            When we met dat afternoon;
            Of de cáprice o' de weader,
            How de harsh rain fell dat day,
            How we kissed de book togeder,
            An' our hearts were light an' gay;
            How we started homewards drivin',
            Last civilian drive in train;
            How we half-feared de arrivin',
            Knowin' we were not free again;
            
            How we feared do'n to de layin'
            By of our loved old-time dress,
            An' to each udder kept sayin'
            All might be unhappiness;
            How our lives be'n full o' gladness,
            Drillin' wid hearts light an' free;
            How for days all would be sadness
            When we quarrelled foolishly.
            
            An' de sad, glad recollection
            Brought a strange thrill to my soul,
            'Memberin' how his affection
            Gave joy in a barren wul':
            As I thought then, my mind goin'
            Back to mem'ries, oh! so dear,
            As I felt de burden growin',
            Jes' so shall I write it here.
            We were once more on de drill-ground,
            Me so happy by his side,
            One in passion, one in will, bound
            By a boundless love an' wide:
            Daily you would see us drinkin'
            Our tea by de mess-room door,
            Every passin' moment linkin'
            Us togeder more an' more.  
            
            After little lazy leanin',
            Sittin' on de window-sill,
            Me would start our carbine-cleanin'
            For de eight o'clock big drill :
            To' me he be'n always ready,
            An' as smart as smart could be;
            He was always quick, yet steady,
            Not of wav'rin' min' like me.
            
            When de time was awful dull in
            De ole borin' Depot-school,
            An' me face was changed an' sullen,
            An' I kicked against de rule,
            He would speak to me so sweetly,
            Tellin' me to bear my fate,
            An' his lovin' words completely
            Helped me to forget de hate.
            
            An' my heart would start a-pinin'
            Ef, when one o'clock came roun',
            He was not beside me dinin',
            But be'n at some duty boun':
            Not a t'ing could sweet me eatin',
            Wid my Bennie 'way from me;
            Strangely would my heart be beatin'
            Tell I knew dat he was free.
            
            When at last he came to table,
            Neider one could ever bate
            Tell in some way we were able
            To eke out each udder plate:
            All me t'oughts were of my frennie
            Then an' in de after days;
            Ne'er can I forget my Bennie
            Wid him nice an' pleasant ways.
            
            In de evenin' we went walkin',
            An' de sweet sound of his voice,
            As we laughed or kept a-talkin',
            Made my lovin' heart rejoice:
            Full of happiness we strolled on,
            In de closin' evenin' light,
            Where de stately Cobre  rolled on 
            Gurglin', murm'rin' in de night;
            
            Where de rushin' canal waters
            Splashed t'rough fields of manchinic,
            Wid deir younger tender daughters
            Grow'n' togeder, lush an' t'ick,
            Bound' de mudder tall an' slimber
            Wid her scalloped leaves o' blue,
            In de evenin' light a-limber,
            Or a-tossin' to an' fro.
            
            Back to barracks slowly strollin',  
            Leavin' de enticin' soun'
            O' de Cobre proudly rollin'
            T'rough de old deserted town ;
            Pas' de level well-kept meadows
            O' de spacious prison-land,
            Where de twilight's fallin' shadows
            Scattered at de moon's command.
            
            So we passed 'long, half unwillin',
            T'rough de yawnin' barrack-gate,
            Our poo' hearts wid disdain fillin'
            O' de life we'd larnt to hate;
            Visions of a turgid ocean
            Of our comrades' noise an' woes,
            An' a ne’er-ceasin' commotion
            Sorrowfully 'fo' us rose.
            
            We mixed in de tumult, waitin'
            Fe de moment o' release,
            De disorder never 'batin',
            Never 'batin' in de leas';
            Wid de anger in us growin',
            We grew vexed from black to blue,
            All de hot blood t'rough us flowin',
            As we hungered for tattoo. 
            While some o' de men were strong in
            Rum o' Wray an' Nephew fame,
            We sat do'n wid ceaseless longin'
            Till at last de tattoo came:
            Jes' then we were no more snappy,
            But be'n even in fe fun ;
            Once again we felt quite happy
            After de roll-call was done.
            
            Claspin' of our hands togeder,
            Each to each we told good-night,
            Dreamed soon o' life's broken ledder
            An' de wul's perplexin' fight,
            Of de many souls a-weepin'
            Burdened do'n wid care an' strife,
            While we sweetly lay a-sleepin',
            Yet would grumble 'bout our life.
            
            Once his cot was next beside me,
            But dere came misfortune's day
            When de pleasure was denied me,
            For de sergeant moved him 'way:
            I played not fe mind de movin'
            Though me heart wid grief be'n full;
            'Twas but one kin' o' de provin'
            O' de ways o' dis ya wul'. 
            
            To' we tu'n good, came de warnin'
            O' de rousin' bugle-soun',
            An' you'd see us soon a marnin'
            To de bat'-house hurryin' down,
            Leavin' udders yawnin', fumblin',
            Wid deir limbs all stiff an' ole,
            Or 'pon stretchin' out an' grumblin',
            Say'n' de water be'n too col'.
            
            In a jiffy we were washin',
            Jeerin' dem, de lazy type,
            All about us water dashin'
            Out o' de ole-fashion' pipe:
            In a lee while we were endin',
            Dere was not much time to kill,
            Arms an' bay'nets wanted tendin'
            To' de soon-a-marnin' drill.
            
            So we spent five months togeder,
            He was ever staunch an' true
            In sunshine or rainy weader,
            No mind what wrong I would do:
            But dere came de sad heart-rendin'
            News dat he must part from me,
            An' I nursed my sorrow, bendin'
            To de grim necessity.
            
            All dat week was cold an' dreary,
            An' I worked wid heavy heart;
            All my limbs were weak an' weary
            When I knew dat we would part;
            All de fond hopes, all de gladness
            Drooped an' faded from our sight,
            An' an overwhelmin' sadness
            Came do'n on de partin' night.
            
            In de dim light I lay thinkin'
            How dat sad night was our last,
            My lone spirit weakly sinkin'
            'Neat' de mem'ries o' de past:
            As I thought in deepest sorrow,
            He came, sat do'n by my side,
            Speakin' o' de dreaded morrow
            An' de flow o' life's dark tide.
            
            Gently fell the moonbeams, kissin'
            'Way de hot tears streamin' free,
            While de wind outside went hissin'
            An' a-moanin' for poor me:
            Then he rose, but after bended,
            Biddin' me a last good-bye;
            To his cot his steps he wended,
            An' I heard a deep-drawn sigh.
            
            'Twas de same decisive warnin'
            Wakin' us as in de past,
            An' we both washed soon a marnin'
            'Neat' de ole pipe fe de last;
            We be'n filled wid hollow laughter,
            Rather tryin' to take heart,
            But de grief returned when after
            Came de moment fe depart.
            
            Hands gripped tight, but not a tear fell
            As I looked into his face,
            Said de final word o' farewell,
            An' returned back to my place :
            At my desk I sat me dry-eyed,
            Sometimes gave a low-do'n moan,
            An' at moments came a sigh sighed
            For my Bennie dat was gone.
            
            Gone he, de little sunshine o' my life,
            Leavin' me 'lone to de Depót's black strife,
            Dear little comrade o' lecture an' drill,
            Loved comrade, like me of true stubborn will:
            Oft, in de light o' de fast sinkin' sun,
            We'd frolic togeder aroun' de big gun;
            Oft would he laughingly run after me,
            Chasin' me over de wide Depot lea;
            Oft would he teach me de folly o' pride
            When, me half-vexed, he would sit by my side;
            Now all is blackness t'rough night an' t'rough day,
            For my heart's weary now Bennie's away.

        <collex:text>I TOOK my marnin' bat' alone,
            An' wept for Bennie dat was gone ;
            An' after, sittin', weepin' long,
            Some one came askin' wha' be'n wrong:
            But only chokin' sobs he heard,
            My mout' could never speak a word.
            An' so for long days all was grief,
            An' never could I get relief;
            My heart be'n full of emptiness,
            With naught to love an' naught to bless,
            
            I 'member de familiar scene:
            I sat out on de Depôt green,
            Restin' agains' de big great gun:
            De long rays o' de settin' sun
            Were thrown upon the sombre wall;
            I heard de rousin' bugle-call
            In chorus  soundin' o' retreat ; 
            A ray o' light shone on my seat,
            A soft dull shade of changin' gold,
            So pleasant, lovely to behold :
            A moment, an' I was alone,
            De wanin' evenin' sun was gone.
            
            I sat do'n still; de evenin' light
            Passed on, an' it fell night, dark night.
            'Twas autumn: feelin' rather chill,
            I rose, led by my aimless will,
            An' went up to the second floor,
            Sat on a bench agains' de door.
            A comrade came an' sat by me,
            Restin' a hand upon my knee;
            De lantern old was burnin' dim,
            But bright 'nough for me to see him:
            One searchin' look into his face,
            I gave him in my heart a place.
            
            I never knew a nicer mind,
            He was so pleasant an' so kind;
            An' oh ! the sweetness of his voice
            That made my lonely heart rejoice.
            It all comes back so vividly,
            The comfort that he brought to me;
            The ray of hope, the pure pure joy
            He gave a poor forsaken boy;
            In walk or talk his tender care,
            His deep concern for my welfare.
            His comin' filled the larger part
            Of de great void made in my heart
            When on dat cruel awful day
            My faithful Bennie went away.
            
            'Tis not de way o' dis ya wul'
            Dat any miserable soul
            Should know a little lastin' peace,
            Should taste endurin' happiness.
            De harmless tabby o' de house
            Plays kindly wid de frightened mouse,
            Till, when it nearly loses dread,
            Good Lard! de little thing is dead.
            So wid de man, toy of a Will
            E'er playin' with him to its fill,
            To-day alive, to-morrow slain,
            Thus all our pleasure ends in pain.
            
            Where'er I roam, whate'er the clime,
            I'll never know a happier time ;
            I seemed as happy as could be,
            When everything was torn from me.
            De fateful day I 'member still,
            De final breakin' o' my will,
            Again de sayin' o' good-bye,
            My poor heart's silent wailin' cry;
            My life, my soul, my all be'n gone,
            And ever since I am alone.

        <collex:text>I WATCHED him as his cheek grew pale,
            He that once was strong and hale;
            The red had faded all away,
            And left it ashen, dull and gray.
            
            One Monday night he came to me,
            Rested his head upon my knee:
            "Mac, me feel so sick," he said,
            "I t'ink me poor boy soon wi' dead."
            
            I did my best to calm his fears,
            He opened up his breast in tears;
            I'll ne'er forget the sight I saw,
            His body strewn with bumps all raw.
            
            That night we listened to his moans,
            The hot fever was in his bones;
            He tossed and tossed about until,
            All his strength spent, he lay down still.
            
            Many a weary weary day
            In the hospital he lay,
            Till one morn torture turned to peace,
            For death had brought him his release.
            
            The funeral, oh it was grand!
            We honoured him with arms and band;
            And not a man but turned away
            Wet-eyed from where his comrade lay.

        <collex:text>OF all de people I don't like,
            A chief one is de bummer;
            He bums around from morn to night
            Trough winter an' t'rough summer.
            
            Ef we should go aroun' John's shop,
            An' he ketch scent o' rum's up,
            You'll soon see'm pokin' up him nose
            Wid him bare-face an' comes-up.
            
            Ef we are smokin' cigarette,
            He wants a part of it too;
            An' ebery bluff you gi'e to him,
            He's answer got to fit you.
            
            Anedder thing I really hate
            Is, when de touris' come in,
            To see some people flockin' dem,
            An' ebery one a-bummin'.
            
            I think it is an ugly sight
            To see a bummin' bobby;
            Yet plenty o' dem tek it for
            A precious piece of hobby.   
            
            I proud 'nuff o' me uniform
            Not ever to be rummy;
            Much mo' fe lower do'n mese'f
            An' mek my min' feel bummy.
            
            If people like to see somet'ing,
            It is a bobby quaffin'
            A glass or two o' common rum,
            Then drunk, dey start a-laughin'.
            
            I tell you, all my comrades dear,
            Dough your pay might be little,
            Don't cringe an' fawn 'fore richer men,
            Deir pelf's not wort' a tittle.
            
            My pay is small, an' yet I live
            An' feel proud as a lord too;
            Ef you'll be men you soon will find
            How much it can reward you.
            
            De honest toil is pure as gold,
            An' he who wuks a penny
            Can mek his life as much wort' while
            As he who earns a guinea.
            
            Our trouble is dat those above
            Do oftentimes oppress;
            But we'll laugh at or pity dem,
            Or hate dem mo' or less.
            
            So we mus' mek de best o' t'ings,
            An' never be too rummish;
            'Twill help us many ways, an' 'top
            Us all from bein' bummish.

            Treat dem kindly, etc.
            
            Sometimes dey're a bit too noisy
            Wid deir long leave-taking bark; 
            But I tell you what, it cheers me
            When de nights are extra dark.
            
            So, dear comrades, don't ill-treat him,
            You won't mek me talk in vain;

            An' a great lump in me bosom, an' A canna' get relief:
            Walkin' up an' do'n de road, I see a whoppin' Syrian-boy,
            An' I grudge him, yes I grudge him for his heart so full o' joy.
            
            'Twas a hot, hot day o' brain-work, an' me heart was sick an' sad,
            As I staggered 'long de car-line, but de boy's cheek made me glad:
            Wid his han's dem set akimbo in a mannish sort o' way,
            Said he "Do wha' it you like, but A wi' wuk no mo' te-day."
            
            An' de Syrian grew astonished as he looked upon his load,
            Which de whoppin' big-tree boy had tumbled in de middle road:
            He was boun' fe Lawrence Tavern, business called him dere to-night, 
            An' he begged his ole-time carrier jes' to help him out his plight.
            "Nummo wuk at all fe me is my determination still;
            Me no care damn wha' you say, an' you can jes' do wha' you will:
            Me deh go right back to to'n, yah, underneat' me old big-tree;
            All dem boys wid eboe-light dem, dem is waitin' deh fe me.
            
            "Now I'm free fe talk abouten all de people whe' you rob,
            How you sell wha' no wut gill self to black naygur for a bob;
            But me eboe-light wi' sure talk, of dat you can have no doubt,
            Fe revenge de quantity o' poor poor people you play out.
            
            "Jes' becausen say dem poo' so, an' t'rough poverty dem mus'
            Tek a couple o' t'ings from you dat you're trick enough fe trus',
            You robbin' dem so badly;  but A sorry fe you dough,
            How we boys beneat' de big-tree really mean fe mek you know."
            
            Then I roared, I roared with laughter, although posted on my beat,
            Till I half forgot de sore pain in me bosom an' my feet:
            Ah! I wish I knew a little, jes' a little of de joy
            Dat Nature has bestowed on you, my whoppin' big-tree boy.

        <collex:text>You may sneer at us, madam,
            But our work is beastly hard;
            An' while toilin thus we scarce
            Ever get a lee reward.
            
            Our soul's jes' like fe you,
            If our work does make us rough;
            Me won't 'res' you servant-gal
            When you've beaten her enough.
            
            You may say she is me frien',
            We are used to all such prate;
            Naught we meet on life's stern road
            But de usual scorn an' hate.
            
            Say dat you wi' 'port me, ma'am?
            I was lookin' fe dat, well,
            Our Inspector's flinty hard,
            'Twill be few days' pay or cell.
            
            Pains an' losses of such kind
            To we p'licemen's not'in' new;
            Still A'd really like fe hear
            Wha' good it wi' do to you.
            
            Last week, eatin' a gill bread,
            Me t'row piece out on de lea;
            An' A ketch a 'port fe dat
            Which meant five roun' mac to me.
            
            Constab-charge, civilian-charge,
            Life's a burden every way;
            But reward fund mus' kep' up
            Out o' poo' policeman pay.
            
            Ef our lot, then, is so hard,
            I mus' ever bear in mind
            Dat to fe me own black 'kin
            I mus' not be too unkind.
            An' p'r'aps you too will forgive
            Ef I've spoken rather free,
            An' will let me somet'ing ask
            Which may soften you to me:
            In de middle o' de night,
            When de blackness lies do'n deep,
            Who protects your homes an' stores
            While de Island is asleep?
            
            When de dead stars cannot shine
            Sake o' rain an' cloud an' storm,
            Who keeps watch out in de street
            So dat not'in' comes to harm?
            
            Ah! you turn away your head!
            See! dere's pity in your face!
            Don't, dear madam, bring on me
            This unmerited disgrace.

        <collex:text>I WAS never ashamed o' de soil,
            So you needn't remind me of it;
            I was born midst de moil an' de toil,
            An' I'll never despise it a bit.
            "Sen' me back to de cutliss an' hoe! "
            I don't mind, Sir, a wud dat you say,
            For little, it seems, you do know
            Of de thing dat you sneer at to-day.
            
            If I'd followed a peasant's career,
            I would now be a happier lad;
            You would not be abusing me here,
            An' mekin' me sorry an' sad.
            
            Fool! I hated my precious birthright,
            Scornin' what made my father a man;
            Now I grope in de pitchy dark night,
            Hate de day when me poo' life began.
            To de loved country life I'll return,
            I don't mind at all, Sir, if you smile;
            As a peasant my livin' I'll earn,
            An' a labourer's life is worth while.
            As a labourer livin' content,
            Wid at night a rest-place for me head,
            Oh! how gaily my life will be spent,
            Wid de baneful ambition gone dead.
            An' when, after a day's wukin' hard,
            I go home to a fait'ful wifee,
            For my toilin' dere'll be its reward,
            A peaceful heart happy an' free.
            
            An' me children shall grow strong an' true,
            But I'll teach dem dat life is a farce,
            An' de best in dis wul' dey can do
            Is to bear with content its sad cross.
            
            So I'll make meself happy at home,
            An' my life will be pleasanter yet;
            I will take de hard knocks as dey come,
            But will conquer de worry an' fret.
            
            Oh! a labourer's life's my desire
            In de hot sun an' pure season rains,
            When de glow o' de dark-red bush fire
            Sends a new blood a-flow'n' t'rough me veins.

            We parted all in tears,
            An' each went his own way
            To shoulder life's sad cares.
            
            O comrades, my comrades,
            What is de lasting gain,

            A heart of unmixed pain?
            My comrades, loved comrades,
            I hear your bitter cry;
            But life's pain will end, boys,
            Will end yet -- by an' by.

            So lovely in its fruitful yield.
            
            De helpless playt'ing of a Will,
            We'll spend our short days here; an' still,
            Though prisoners, feel somehow free
            To live our lives o' misery.
            
            Dear comrade o' de constab life,

            Is more better now.
            All about me dashin',
            H'is'in' up an' splashin',
            Bubbles like de turtle-berries,
            Jostlin' wid de yerry-yerries,
            All about me dashin'
            H'is'in' up an' splashin'.
            Oh! dis blissful swim,
            Like a fairy dream!
            Jumpin' off de time-worn plank,
            Pupperlicks from bank to bank,
            Dis delightful swim
            Is a fairy dream.
            Kiss my naked breast
            In its black skin drest:
            Let your dainty silver bubbles
            Ease it of its lifelong troubles,
            Dis my naked breast
            In its black skin drest.
            
            Floatin', floatin' down
            On my back alone,
            Kiss me on my upturned face,
            Clasp me in your fond embrace,
            As I'm floatin' down
            Happy, yet alone.
            
            Wavelets laughin' hound me,
            Ripples glad surround me:
            Catchin' at dem light an' gay,
            See dem scamper all away,
            As dey playful hound me,
            Or in love surround me.
            
            T'rough de twistin' dance
            Onward do I lance:
            Onward under yonder cave
            Comes wid me a pantin' wave,
            Speedin' from de dance
            Wid me as I lance.
            'Neat' dis shadin' hedge
            Growin' by your bridge,
            I am thinkin' o' you' love,
            Love dat not'in' can remove,
            'Neat' dis shadin' hedge
            Growin' by your bridge.
            Love more pure, I ken,
            Dan de love o' men,
            Knowin' not de fickle mind
            Nor de hatred o' my kind;
            Purer far, I ken,
            Dan de love o' men.
            
            E'en when welcome deaf
            Claims dis painful breat',
            Of you I will ever think
            Who first gave me crystal drink;
            E'en when welcome deaf
            Claims dis painful breaf.
            
            For a little while
            I must leave your smile:
            Raindrops fallin' from de sky
            Force me now to say good-bye;
            Jes' lee bit o' while
            I must leave your smile.
            
            Foamin' Sukee Eiver,
            Dearer now dan ever,
            I'll ne'er roam from you again
            To a life o' so-so pain,
            Crystal flowin' river,
            Dearer now dan ever.

        <collex:text>WHAT Italian is to Latin, that in regard to English is the negro variant thereof. It shortens, softens, rejects the harder sounds alike of consonants and vowels; I might almost say, refines. In its soft tones we have an expression of the languorous sweetness of the South: it is a feminine version of masculine English; pre-eminently a language of love, as all will feel who, setting prejudice aside, will allow the charmingly naïve love-songs of this volume to make their due impression upon them. But this can only happen when the verses are read aloud, and those unacquainted with the Jamaican tongue may therefore welcome a few hints as to pronunciation.
            As a broad general direction, let it be observed that the vowels have rather the continental than the English sounds, while in the matter of the consonants the variation from English is of the nature of a pretty lisp.
            The exact values of the vowels cannot, of course, be described, but they approximate on the whole more to those of Italy and France than to those of England. One sound, that of aw, is entirely rejected, and ah is substituted for it. Thus bawl, law, call, daughter, etc., become bahl, lah, cahl, dahter, etc. 
            In the word whe', which sometimes means where and sometimes which, the e has the same sound as in the word met. Deh is similarly pronounced, and the e is quite a short one, the h being added merely to distinguish deh from de (the). This short e often takes the place of the close English a, as in tek (take), mek (make).
            My is almost invariably pronounced with a short y, and, to remind the reader of this, it is constantly spelt me. Fe -- generally meaning to, but sometimes for -- matches this short my exactly. In caan' (can't) the a is doubled in order to ensure the pronunciation cahn.
            It is difficult to convey the exact value of do'n (down), groun' (ground). There is a faint trace of ng at the end of these words, and they rhyme to tongue pronounced very shortly and with a dumber vowel sound.
            Vowels are sometimes changed out of mere caprice, as it seems. Thus we have ef for if, trimble for tremble, anedder for anudder (another), stimulent for stimulant, a -- pronounced short -- for I, sperit for spirit.
            In ya, originally meaning d'you hear -- but now thrown in just to fill up, like the don't you know of certain talkers -- the a is a short ah.
            We come now to the consonants. Bearing in mind what was said above of the pretty lisp, let the d so often -- generally, we may say -- substituted for th, be of the very softest, as it were a th turning towards d, or to put it in another way, a lazily pronounced th. The negro has no difficulty whatever in pronouncing it clearly: it is merely that he does not, as a rule, take the trouble to do so. In these poems the, they, there, with, etc., are not always written de, dey, dere, wid, etc.;  and the reader is at liberty to turn any soft th into d, and any d into soft th. And here let me remark, in passing, that in one breath the black man will pronounce a word in his own way, and in the next will articulate it as purely as the most refined Englishman. Where the substitution of d makes the word unrecognisable, as in moder (mother), oders (others), the spelling mudder, udders is resorted to; and for fear of confusion with well-known words, though, those are always written thus, although generally pronounced, dough, dose.
            As d supplants the soft th, so does a simple t supplant the hard one; as in t'ing, not'ing (or nuttin' , -- for the g in words of two or more syllables is very commonly left out), t'ink, tick, t'rough, met'od, wutless (worthless).
            V tends to pass into b, as in lub (love), hab, lib, ebery, neber, cultibation. Vex, though so written for the most part, is pronounced either with a decided b or with some compromise between that and v.
            Of elisions, the commonest is that of the initial s when followed by another consonant. Thus start, spread, stop, scrape, spoil, sting, skin, etc., become 'tart, 'pread, 'top, 'crape, 'poil, ''ting, 'kin, etc.
            Final d's are often dropped, as in lan', t'ousan', please' (pleased) and other past participles, min', chil' -- in these let care be taken to keep the long sound of the i' -- wul' (world), wud (word), en'.
            Final t's also; as in breas', cas', 'gains' (against), i' (it), las', wha', wus' (worst), tas'e (taste).
            Present participles, passin', brukin' (breaking), outpourin', etc., lose their g's; and final k's sometimes disappear, as in tas'. R's, too, as in you' for your, mo' for more, befo' or simply 'fo' for before: and they are even thrown out from the middle of words, as in wuk (work), tu'n (turn), wud (word). Will occasionally loses its l's and becomes wi'.
            Initial vowels have also a habit of vanishing: as in 'bout (about), 'long (along), 'way (away), nuff (enough), 'pon (upon); but the elision of these and of longer first syllables is sometimes made up by tacking something to the end, and for about, without, because we get 'bouten, 'douten, 'causen.
            On the construction of the language it is unnecessary to dwell, for it is fully explained in the notes, and the reader will soon master the mysteries of be'n with its various significations, is, was, were, have been, had been, did (as sign of the past tense); of deh, which may be either an adverb (there) or an auxiliary verb as in me deh beg (I am begging); of dem tacked close to its noun, to show it is plural; of tenses apparently past which are present, and apparently present which are past: for the unravelling of all which the needful help has, it is hoped, been supplied by the notes aforesaid.
            Readers of this volume will be interested to know that they here have the thoughts and feelings of a Jamaican peasant of pure black blood. The young poet, aged twenty-two, spent his early years in the depths of the country, and though he has now moved to the more populous neighbourhood of Kingston, his heart remains in his Clarendon hills. He began life as a wheelwright, but the trade was not to his mind, and he left it and enlisted in the Constabulary.

            You tas'e petater an' you say it sweet,
            But you no know how hard we wuk fe it;
            You want a basketful fe quattiewut,
            'Cause you no know how 'tiff de bush fe cut.
            De cowitch  under which we hab fe 'toop,
            De shamar lyin' t'ick like pumpkin soup,
            Is killin' somet'ing for a naygur man;
            Much less de cutlass workin' in we han'. 
            De sun hot like when fire ketch a town;
            Shade-tree look temptin', yet we ca~m' lie down,
            Aldough we wouldn' eben ef we could,
            Causen we job must finish soon an' good. 
            De bush cut done, de bank dem we deh dig,
            But dem caan' 'tan' sake o' we naybor pig;
            For so we moul' it up he root it do'n,
            An' we caan' 'peak sake o' we naybor tongue.
            Aldough de vine is little, it can bear;
            It wantin"not'in' but a little care:
            You see petater tear up groun', you run,
            You laughin', sir, you must be t'ink a fun. 
            De fie!' pretty? It couldn't less 'an dat,
            We wuk de bes', an' den de lan' is fat;
            We dig de row dem eben in a line,
            An' keep it clean-den so it mus' look fine. 
            You tas'e petater an' you say it sweet,
            But you no know how hard we wuk fe it;
            Yet still de hardship always melt away  
            Wheneber it come roun' to reapin' day.

            RUN ober mango trees,
            'Pread chock to kitchen doo',
            Watch de blue bannabees,
            Look how it ben' down low! 
            De blossom draw de bees
            Same how de soup draw man;
            Some call it "broke-pot" peas,
            It caan' bruk we bu'n-pan.
            Wha' sweet so when it t'ick?
            Though some call it goat-tud,
            Me all me finger lick,
            An' yet no chew me cud.
            A mumma plant de root
            One day jes' out o' fun;  
            But now look 'pon de fruit,
            See wha' de "mek fun" done. 
            I jam de 'tick dem 'traight
            Soon as it 'tart fe 'pread,
            An begin count de date
            Fe when de pod fe shed.
            Me watch de vine dem grow,
            S'er t'row dung a de root:
            Crop time look fe me slow,
            De bud tek long fe shoot. 
            But so de day did come,
            I 'crub de bu'n-pan bright,
            An' tu'n down 'pon it from
            De marnin' till de night. 
            An' Lard I me belly swell,
            No 'cause de peas no good,
            But me be'n tek a 'pell
            Mo' dan a giant would. 
            Yet eben after dat
            Me nyam it wid a will,
            'Causen it mek me fat;
            So I wi' lub it still. 
            Caan' talk about gungu,
            Fe me it is no peas  
            Cockstone might do fe you,
            Me want me bannabees.

            * * * * * * * * * *
            Mumma, you' Jim get 'way
            An' come back home to you,
            An' ask you to forgive
            Him all o' whe' him do.
            I want you to feget
            Dat I disgrace de name,
            An' cause de ole fam'ly
            To look 'pon me wid shame. 
            You come an' beg de judge
            Before dem call fe me,
            An' walk by de back gate,
            T'inkin' I wouldn' see. 
            But 'fore him let me go,
            Him lectur' me, mumma,
            Tellin' me how I mus'
            Try no fe bruk de law. 
            Mumma, I feel it, but
            No eye-water caan' drop:
            Yet I wish dat it could,
            For me breat' partly 'top.
            So, mumma, I come back
            Again to be your boy,
            An' ever as before
            To fill you' heart wid joy. 
            NOTE BY THE AUTHOR. -- On Friday I went to Court on duty for the third time since my enlistment. I happened to escort a prisoner, a stalwart young fellow, and as I was putting on the handcuff, which was rather small, it pinched him badly, making a raw wound. And yet he was so patient, saying he knew that I could not help it. Although it was accidentally done, I felt so sad and ashamed. The above poem grew out of this incident.

            LIFE will continue so for aye,
            Some people sad, some people gay,
            Some mockin' life while udders pray;
            But we mus' fashion-out we way
            An' sabe a mite fe rainy day--
            All we can do. 
            We needn' fold we han' an' cry,
            Nor vex we heart wid groan and sigh;
            De best we can do is fe try
            To fight de despair drawin' nigh:
            Den we might conquer by an' by--
            Dat we might do. 
            We hab to batter in de sun,
            An' dat isn't a little fun,
            For Lard! 'tis hellish how it bu'n:
            Still dere's de big wul' to live do'n--
            So whe' fe do ? 
            We nigger hab a tas' fe do,
            To conquer prejudice dat due
            To obeah, an' t'ings not a few
            Dat keep we progress back fe true,--
            But whe' fe do? 
            We've got to wuk wid might an' main,
            To use we han' an' use we brain,
            To toil an' worry, 'cheme an' 'train
            Fe t'ings that bring" more loss dan gain;
            To stan' de sun an bear de rain,
            An' suck we bellyful o' pain
            Widouten cry nor yet complain--
            For dat caan' do. 
            And though de wul' is full o' wrong,
            Dat caan' prevent we sing we song
            All de day as we wuk along--
            Whe' else fe do? 
            We happy in de hospital;
            We happy when de rain deh fall;
            We happy though de baby bawl
            Fe food dat we no hab at all;
            We happy when Deat' angel call
            Fe full we cup of joy wid gall:
            Our fait' in this life is not small--
            De best to do. 
            An' da's de way we ought to live,
            For pain an' such we shouldn' grieve,
            But tek de best dat Nature give--
            Da's whe' fe do. 
            God mek de wul' fe black an' white;
            We'll wuk on in de glad sunlight,
            Keep toilin' on wid all our might,
            An' sleep in peace when it is night:
            We must strive on to gain de height,
            Aldough it may not be in sight;
            An' yet perhaps de blessed right
            Will never conquer in de fight--
            Still, whe' fe do? 
            We'll try an' live as any man,
            An' fight de wul' de best we can,
            E'en though it hard fe understan'--
            Whe' we mus' do. 
            For da's de way o' dis ya wul';
            It's snap an' bite, an' haul an' pull,
            An' we all get we bellyful--
            But whe' fe do?

        <collex:text>If you lub me, Joanie, only tell me, dear,
            Do not be so cold
            When my lub is bold;
            Do not mek dis burning heart o' mine get drear,
            Tek it for your own,
            For 'tis yours alone.
            I hav ever lub'd you from I saw your face
            On dat Monday morn
            'Mongst de peas an' corn:
            Lightly did you trip along wid yout'ful grace,
            Wid de kerchief red 
            Wound about your head. 
            Durin' de revival we b'en use' fe pray,
            Spirit we b'en hab,
            How we use' fe sob!
            Yet how soon did all of it from we get 'way!
            Lub kiver de whole,
            We feget we "soul." 
            Though I could'n' see you when you younger b'en,
            It was better so,
            For we older grow,
            An' I can protect you now from udder men,
            If you'll only be
            Fe me one, Joanie. 
            How I saw you proudly draw up to your height--
            As we strolled along
            Gay in laugh an' song,
            Passin' by de peenies sheddin' greenish light'--
            Cos my lips did miss,
            Stealin' one lee kiss! 
            'Member you de days down by de river-side,
            I prevented you
            Your washin' to do,
            Teasin' you at times till you got vex' an' cried,
            An' I try de while
            To coax you fe smile? 
            Joanie, when you were me own a true sweetheart,
            I lived in de air
            'Douten t'ought of care,
            Thinkin', o me Joan, dat' nuttin' could we part,
            Naught to mek me fear
            Fe me own a dear. 
            When in church on Sunday days we use' fe sit,
            You dressed in light pink,
            How we used fe wink!
            Wha' de parson say we cared for not a bit,
            Nuttin' could remove
            Our sweet t'oughts from love. 
            I am thinkin', Joanie, when de nights were lone,
            An' you were afraid
            Of each darkened shade,
            An' I use' fe guide you over river-stone,
            How you trusted me
            Fe care you, Joanie. 
            'Member you de time when many days passed by,
            An' I didn' come
            To your hill-side home,
            How you wrote those sad, sad letters to know why,
            Till I comfort gave
            To my Joanie brave? 
            In those happy days, me Joan, you loved me then,
            An' I t'ought dat you
            Would be ever true;
            Never dreamed you would forsake me for strange men,
            Who caan' lub you so
            Much as thrown-up Joe. 
            Joanie, fickle Joanie, give up Squire's son;
            You wi' soon hate him
            An' his silly whim,
            An' your heart wi' yearn fe me when I am gone;
            So, 'fo' 'tis too late,
            Come back to your mate. 
            Joanie, when you're tired of dat worthless man,
            You can come back still
            Of your own free will: 
            Nummo girl dis true, true heart will understan';
            I wi' live so-so,
            Broken-hearted Joe. 
            An', Joan, in de days fe come I know you'll grieve
            For de foolishniss
            Dat you now call bliss:
            Dere's no wrong you done me I would not forgive;  
            But you choice your way,
            So, me Joan, good-day!

        <collex:text>DE Christmas is finish';
            It was rather skinnish,
            Yet still we are happy, an' so needn' fret,
            For dinner is cookin',
            An' baby is lookin'
            An' laughin'; she knows dat her pa owe no debt. 
            De pas' hab de debtor,
            An' we cannot get her
            To come back an' grin at us as in time gone:
            Dere's no wine fe breakfas',
            An' no one fe mek fuss,
            We all is contented fe suck one dry bone.
            No two bit o ' brater
            Wid shopkeeper Marter,
            I feel me head light sittin' down by me wife;
            No weight lef behin' me
            No gungu a line fe
            De man who was usual to worry me life. 
            We're now out o' season,
            But dat is no reason  
            Why we shan't be happy wid heart free and light:
            We feel we are better
            Dan many dat fetter 
            Wid burden dey shoulder to mek Christmas bright. 
            Some 'crape out de cupboard,
            Not 'memberin' no wud
            Dat say about fegettin' when rainy day:
            It comes widout warning
            'Fo' daylight a marnin',
            An', wakin', de blue cloud ta'n black dat was gay. 
            De days dat gwin' follow
            No more will be hollow,
            Like some dat come after de Christmas before:
            We'll lay by some money
            An' lick at de honey,
            An' neber will need to lock up our front door. 
            Jes' look at de brightness
            Of dat poor an' sightless
            Old man on de barrel a playin' de flute:
            Wha' mek him so joyful?
            His lap is of toy full,
            A pick'ninny play wid de patch on his suit. 
            Ours too de same blessin',
            An' we've learn' a lesson
            We should have been learnin' from years long ago:
            A Christmas 'dout pleasure
            Gave dat darlin' treasure,
            An' duty to Milly is all dat we owe.

            How I 'member de night when we meet,
            An' chat fe de first time of lub!
            I go home, an' den neber could eat
            None o' de plateful o' grub.
            An' de day it was empty to me,
            Wakin', but dreamin' of you,
            While de school it was dull as could be,
            An' me hate me wuk fe do.
            Oh, I knew of your lub long before
            My school friends tell me of it,
            And I watch at you from de school door,
            When you pass to de cockpit. 
            Den I hear too dat you use' fe talk,
            Say, if you caan' ketch me dark night,
            You would sure ketch me as me deh walk  
            In a de open moonlight.
            An' you' wud come to pass 4 very soon,
            For scarcely a mont' did gone
            When de light of de star an' de moon
            Shine bright as we kiss all alone.
            I can neber remember de times
            Ma scolded her little Nell;  
            All day her tongue wuks like de chimes
            Dat come from de old school-bell.
            I have given up school-life fe you:
            Sweetheart, my all  is your own ;
            Den say you will ever be true,
            An' live fe you' Nellie alone.

            For, as in udder t'ings,

            De cravin' has no cure.
            It always seem so strange to me,
            Dat you can satisfy to be
            A life whose daily food
            Is pain: de only good,
            Deat' dat will set it free.

            A man can't eben ketch a mac,

            De peas won't pop, de corn can't grow,
            Poor people face look sad;
            Dat Gahd would cuss de lan' I'd know,
            For black naygur too bad.
            I won't gib up, I won't say die,
            For alI de time is hard;
            Aldough de wul' soon en', I'll try
            My wutless best as ti me goes by,
            An' trust on in me Gahd.

        <collex:text>'Top one minute, Cous' Jarge, an' sit do'n 'pon de grass,
            An' mek a tell you 'bout de news I hear at las',
            How de buccra te-day tek time an' begin teach
            All of us dat was deh in a clear open speech..
            You miss somet'ing fe true, but a wi' mek you know,
            As much as how a can, how de business a go:
            Him tell us 'bout we self, an' mek we fresh again,
            An' talk about de wul' from commencement to en'.
            Me look 'pon me black 'kin, an' so me head grow big,
            Aldough me heaby han' dem hab fe plug an' dig;
            For ebery single man, no car' about dem rank,
            Him bring us ebery one an' put 'pon de same plank.
            Say, parson do de same? Yes, in a'dift'ren' way,
            For parson tell us how de whole o' we are clay;
            An' lookin' close at t'ings, we hab to pray quite hard
            Fe swaller wha' him say an' don't t'ink bad o' Gahd.
            But dis man tell us 'traight 'bout how de whole t'ing came,
            An' show us widout doubt how Gahd was not fe blame;
            How change cause eberyt'ing fe mix up 'pon de eart',
            An' dat most hardship come t'rough accident o' birt'.
            Him show us all a sort o' funny 'keleton,
            Wid names I won't remember under dis ya sun;
            Animals queer to deat', dem bone, teet', an' head-skull,
            All dem so dat did live in a de ole-time wul'.
            No 'cos say we get cuss mek fe we 'kin come so,
            But fe all t'ings come 'quare, same so it was to go: 
            Seems our lan' must ha' been a bery low-do'n place, .
            Mek it tek such long time in tu'ning out a race.
            Yes, from monkey we spring: I believe ebery wud;
            It long time better dan f'go say we come from mud:
            No need me keep back part, me hab not'in' fe gain;
            It's ebery man dat born -- de buccra mek it plain.
            It realIy strange how some o' de lan' dem advance;
            Man power in some ways is nummo soso chance; 
            But suppose eberyt'ing could tu'n right upside down,
            Den p'raps we'd be on top an' givin' some one houn'.
            Yes, Cous' Jarge, slabery hot fe dem dat gone befo':
            We gettin' better times, for those days we no know;
            But I t'ink it do good, tek we from Africa
            An' lan' us in a blessed place as dis a ya.
            Talk 'bouten Africa, we would be deh till now,
            Maybe same half-naked-all day dribe buccra cow,
            An' tearin' t'rough de bush wid all de monkey dem,
            Wile an' uncibilise', an' neber comin' tame.
            l Ief' quite 'way from wha' we be'n deh talk about,
            Yet still a couldn' help -- de wuds come to me mout';
            Just like how yeas' get strong an' sometimes fly de cark,
            Same way me feelings grow, so I was boun' fe talk.
            Yet both horse partly runnin' in de selfsame gallop,
            For it is nearly so de way de buccra puIl up:
            Him say, how de wul' stan', dat right will neber be,
            But wrong will eber gwon  till dis wul' en' fe we.

        <collex:text>I T'INK of childhood days again,
            An' wish dat I was free
            To res' me baby head once more
            Upon me mudder's knee:
            If we had power to change dis life
            An' live it back again,
            We would be children all de time
            Nor fret at childhood's pain.
            I look on my school life of old,
            Dem sweet days dat are pas',
            An' wonder how I'd wish to see
            Those dear times en' at las':
            It was because I was a boy,
            An' knew not what b'en good;
            All time I tas'e de supple-jack, 
            Bein' I was so rude.
            An' o' de marnings when I woke,
            'Fo' you can see you' han',
            I mek me way on to de spring
            Fe full me bucket-pan:
            I t'ought ofttimes dat it was hard
            For me to wake so soon;
            Dere was no star fe light de way,
            Much more de white roun ' moon.
            Still, childhood pain could neber las',
            An' I remem ber yet
            De many sorrows 'cross me pat' 
            Dat neber mek me fret:
            But now me joys are only few,
            I live because I'm boun',
            An' try fe mek my life of use
            Though pain lie all aroun'.

            I would see de ancient chair where England's kings deir crowns put on,
            Soon to lay dem by again when all de vanity is done;
            An' I'd go to view de lone spot where in peaceful solitude
            Rests de body of our Missis Queen, Victoria de Good.
            An' dese places dat I sing of now shall afterwards impart
            All deir solemn sacred beauty to a weary searchin' heart;
            So I'll rest glad an' contented in me min' for evermore,
            When I sail across de ocean back to my own native shore.

            When your brain's in a whirl. 
            You may smoke just a bit indeed,
            I like de "white seal" a well;
            Aldough I do not use de weed,
            I'm fond o ' de nice smell. 
            But wait until you're growin' old
            An' gettin' weak an' bent,
            An' feel your blood a-gettin' cold
            'Fo' you tek stimulent. 
            Then it may mek you stronger feel
            While on your livin' groun';
            But ole Time, creepin' on your heel,
            Soon, soon will pull you down: 
            Soon, soon will pull you down, my frien',
            De rum will help her too;
            An' you'll give way to better men,

 S. A. BEADLE. 
HOW active, longeval and fascinating, is hope; the accidents, reverses and misfortunes of today but invigorate it, and tomorrow it will be painting brighter goals, in all the colors of the rainbow, or embellishing the desert, where it faded yes'^erday, with the mirage. It follows but never comes up with the horizon; and when, at the end of its cable tow, it has reached the bourn, it is then, to many, so seductive in enchantment that death, in the hour of its triumph, is confused by the garlands hope wreaths upon the brow of faith. 
 Beguiled by this alluring vision, I have been seduced into 
 the difficult, yet pleasing labors of writing verse, a small collection 
 of which I am exposing to the consideration of the public, before 
 I have acquired the skill of a novice; who, I am sure, could have 
 done better, with less effort; and who will, perhaps, upon review- 
 ng my work, blush derisively at my poverty of thought and vague- 
 ness of expression: such is his pleasure. 
 It is enough for me to indulge the fancy that an asylum sur- 
 vives for him who is seduced by the muses, in the lenitive pas- 
 sions of those, whose love for the beautiful, causes them to tol- 
 erate its worshipers; whose affections for the esthetic, make them 
 partial to its vassals and whose loftiness of character and charity 
 of spirit impel them to be lenient where they might be rash, and 
 just where they might yield to malice; and who, in the exercise 
 of these happy virtues, do not forget that the daisy comes as 
 sweet from, the fallow as the rose from the garden. 
 In selecting a name for this poor work, I have, perchance, 
 done violence to the sensitive feelings of many zealous partizans 
 of the art of composition, who have, with the usurpation common 
 to squatter sovereigns, fenced off the domain of poesy, as an 
 exclusive sporting ground for themselves, where trespassers, such 
 as I am, are commanded to "Keep off the grass." To all such I 
 would like to say that the name is not chosen because the com- 
 position, for which it stands, is metrical; but rather because I am 
 a member of that unhappy race of people which are treated as 
alien enemies in the land of their nativity, and the victim of that 
 tyrannous public opinion which makes in them and me, what were 
 commendable in others, a bar to advancement; and since this 
 inclement public opinion has barred us from pursuing those civic 
 pursuits that distinguish** the civilian from the savage, and the 
 savage from the brute, may I not call this little volume "Lyrics o*^ 
 the Under World"? 
 The piece, "My Country," is but a fanciful flight of hope from 
 conditions that are to what ought to be the scope of one's environ- 
 ment in a country whose underlying principles are said to be, 
 "Equal rights to all, special benefits to none." And, since "My 
 Country" is a creature of fancy, may it not be palmed ofT on the 
 uninitiated as verse, if not poetry? Those of my fellows who 
 upbraid me for indulging the fancy, together with those who would 
 eliminate me under the doctrine, 'This is a white man's country," 
 will not, I hope, further deprive me from enjoying through the 
 imagination what seems to be impossible as a matter of fact. 
 if these truths are not self-evident, but false: "That all men 
 are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with 
 certain unalienable rights; that among these rights are life, liberty 
 and the pursuit of happiness, " let me at least hold them among the 
 things imaginable. I cannot abandon the position that this is my 
 country. 
 There is, I think, enough in the overt acts of some of the 
 worshipers of the idol, Color, to justify the "Lines to Caste," 
 until a master comes, who will give the subject its proper treat- 
 ment. "The Jaunt" is mere jargon, thrown in to take the place of 
 "The Black Knight, " a poem I had intended for this collection, 
 but which I prefer not to publish at this time. I may say, how- 
 ever, that in writing "The Jaunt" I was trying to build a continued 
 discourse in sonnets, and failed utterly with the soliloquy of age. 
 Of the other subjects of this collection I prefer to say noth- 
 ing, since the reader, a better judge of their merits and demerits 
 than I am, will render a decision for himself. 
 I would like, however, to thank my two friends. Dr. W. A. 
 Scott, the publisher, and Hon. W. E. Mollison, who have conde- 
 scended, the one to publish the book and the other to write its 
 introduction, for the encouragement they gave me in my labors. 
They are the only two college graduates, among my many ac- 
 quaintances, who did not think it humiliating to themselves to 
 recognize me, whom abject poverty during my youth and early 
 manhood deprived of the benefits of school training. 
 As to the illustrations, I give "Sam in Sleepy Corner" the 
 place of honor, because he is an old companion of mine who 
 used to sit with me while I munched my food on the curb, or was 
 kicked into the gutter by the haughty and proud for intruding upon 
 the public thoroughfare. And yet 1 am free to say that there is 
 as much happiness upon the curb as there is in the palace, and 
 tnat I haven't had a happy day since I left it. But — 
 I've heard so much of poesy, of art, 
 And mystic things, the plumed wings of thought, 
 Which none but genius has; none but genius ought 
 Prime for gay fancy's flight, of awe I start 
 Amazed! yet motive moved, by buoyant heart 
 I'd labor where the nobler souls have wrought; 
 But when I would I'm told, for me 'tis naught 
 To strive, since neither muse nor art takes part 
 Where spirit is dull; yet may I not, beguiled 
 By no incentive but the soul's flood swell, 
 Aheave like high tides when the seas run wild. 
 Awake a passion note, since that strange spell. 
 Love and not art's the suasive soul of song. 
 Genius, but labor toiling late and long. 
 I am indebted to my son, Richard Henry Beadle, for the 
 photographic illustrations, and to Mr. Boon for the cartoon, that 
 appear in this book. 
 I entertain for the children of my fancy a fond solicitude, I 
 part with them with a feeling akin to pain lest they will not give 
 you as much pleasure, dear reader, in their perusal as I found in 
 their creation. 
 If it were not out of place for me to commend them to you I 
 would like to say a good word for Eulelia, Alice, lona, Sam and 
 the others. As it is I but consign them to your consideration 
 without a word further than subscribing myself, 
 YOURS truly, S. A. BEADLE. 
W. E. Mollison, Introductor

Lyrics of the Under World 
 IT was Abraham Lincoln who said, "God Almighty must have 
 loved the common people, or he would not have made so 
 many of them. " It is not often that the bard makes any 
 effort to sing the songs of the lowly. The poet is prone to pay 
 court to the gods who dwell upon Olympus, rather than the delvers 
 in mines or the fellers of the forest. The author of this book has 
 seen lifein all of its phases. From the humblest of beginnings, he 
 has reached heights not dreamed of in his boyhood; has measured 
 swords with the best and master spirits of his age, and has held 
 his own among them. His heart must beat in unison with the 
 sufferings as well as the hopes and aspirations for such as are 
 not "brother to the ox." 
 Many of these poems voiced for the first time the dreams 
 and hopes of this Under- World; many of them have in the lines 
 glint of real genius, and while our author has not ridden Pegassus 
 like the Centaur, even Jupiter has nodded at times. Our author's 
 contribution to the literature of his people and his time will be 
 more appreciated as the years roll by. 
 He has placed all of us under lasting obligations to him for 
 having opened these new vistas into the hearts and souls of the 
 simple folk whose songs he sings with such consummate grace 
 and simple beauty. 
 Mr. Beadle has written many charming verses in earlier 
 years, many of them show sparks of poetic fire — but none come 
 up to the sustained height reached and kept in "Lyrics of the 
 Under World." 
 W. E. MOLLISON. 
MY COUNTRY. 
 MY Country God bless thee! God bless thee, my home! 
 With harvest and plenty, thy dark fertile loam; 
 The brooklet that bickers from hills far above, 
 And dances and dallies through vales that I love. 
 Go purling on, may it, the sun on its sheen. 
 The cress and the fern on its banks growing green. 
 The mead ever verdant where graze gentle kine. 
 And wide roam the herds of my neighbor and mine. 
 Thou dearer and grander than all other earth. 
 With clime sweet and balmy, fair land of my birth; 
 May valiant thy youth grow,, more stalwart, more brave, 
 Till ne'er a poor laggard, nor coward, nor slave 
 Is seen in thy valleys, nor met on thy hills, 
 Where babbles the brook, or the bright dew distills. 
 Oh, Country of mme! may thy humblest son be 
 Ever true to thy genius, "brave, happy and free," 
May palsied the hand grow that strikes not for thee, 
 When traitors would spoil thee, thou land of the free; 
 And the alien who dares to invade thy domain. 
 By the sword let him fall, and from sleep with the slain 
 Let him never awake in the morning to greet 
 The daisies that bloom o'er his dank winding sheet; 
 And freedom, my Country's great boon to the world, 
 Let me die on the day that thy banners are furled. 
 I love thee, adore thee, my Country, I do; 
 Thy faults, though, are many, "in pulpit and pew, 
 The work of the vicious, the mean and the vain, 
 Who, vile in their motive and weak in their brain. 
 Forget that the law is the strength of the brave. 
 And the man who would break it worse than a slave. 
 But thou art my Country, still grand and sublime. 
 The noblest in genius, the fairest in clime. 
 THE HAVEN OF THE LEES. 
 OVE is homeless in a palace and in company is lone; 
 She s a vagabond in riches, and a vassal on a throne, 
 In the gilded halls of fortune, on the airy heights of fame, 
 If she's unresuscitated by the husbandman or dame. 
 Love's at home within the hovel, on the curb or in the den, 
 With the highest or the lowest, in the varied walks of men, 
 When they feel the animation of her bouyancy and zeal. 
 Wielding big with exultation in the glory of their weal. 
 Love is all there is of heaven. It's the Eden gained by those 
 W ho, pursuing art and fortune, loved humanity and rose 
 By the aid they've given others; through this jewel of the soul 
 Leading many wayward brothers to the mead of honor's goal. 
Love's a pleasure to the farmer, and his beaming, lucky star, 
 When at eve he comes returning from his work in fields afar; 
 When his spouse awaits his coming with the grace-enthroned 
 brow, 
 Paying homage to his courage, giving honor to his plough. 
 Never knight was half so gallant, never man was half so brave 
 When he greets her in the gloaming as his wife and not his 
 slave, 
 When he gives his steed the bridle, when he flings aside the 
 flail. 
 To assist her in the milking and to bear for her the pail. 
 I.ove is outraged in the pulpit when the lord presiding there 
 Overlooks the man in homespun for the opulent and fair; 
 For the dazzle of the jewels and the jingle of the coin, 
 Which the nabob, suave and guileful, from the common herd 
 purloin. 
Love's a burden to a princess and a trifle to a throne; 
 For the glory of a monarch is a heart of brass and stone; 
 Else diplomacy would famish and intrigue and guile would 
 wane, 
 In the arms of ease and pleasure, find the certain way to 
 shame. 
 Love's a weakness to a soldier, and this fickle slave of fame 
 Better serves ambition's mandate when the carnage is his aim; 
 But to sailors love's a beacon, beaming bright across the seas, 
 To the glory of the passage, to The Haven of the Lees. 
Eulelia. 
 LAST night I lay dozing 
 When in there came, 
 And sat beside me, posing. 
 One whom I claim 
 Is neat, and sweet, and dutiful, 
 Bewitching, too, and beautiful, 
 Superbly grand in charm; 
 The glory of her jetty eyes. 
 The taper of her form, 
 Its taction and its guise — 
 But then 1 mustn't tell 
 Of that delightful swell 
 Of breast against my own; 
 Her touch of lips to mine, 
 Like Hebe's nectar wine, 
 Revived, refreshed and blessed me- 
 And still I mustn't tell 
 How that delightful swell 
 Of heart of hers, to soul of mine. 
 To mine, to mine, to mine! 
 Was like the flow of Hebe's wine 
 Upon a famished tongue. 
Waking, from dream, I found thee, 
 Too prone to pose 
 And others draw around thee, 
 And me with those 
 To taunt with airy flirting, 
 Too happy thou, in hurting, 
 Breaking the heart of me. 
 EuleHa, doth thou know thy crime, 
 Coquettish butchery. 
 Hath hut my spirit charmed to lime — 
 But then I mustn't tell 
 How cursed art thou and fell. 
 Locked in my rival's arms; 
 His touch of lips to thine, 
 A plague and curse to mine. 
 Doth demonize thee, dear; 
 So hence I mustn't dwell 
 On thought of thee, nor tell 
 How his lips touched to thine make brine 
 Of them for mine, for mine. 
 For mine, for mine, for mine! 
 Make brine of thine for mine. 
Eulelia, I'd be sleeping, 
 For then it seems 
 My old thought dome is keeping 
 Tab on happy themes, 
 Of one so rare, so beautiful. 
 With grace so sweet, immutable, 
 And like a Fay's concerned, 
 I can but fancy, love, that she 
 Is thine own self returned 
 With Hebe's cup for me — 
 But why should I disclose. 
 What charm dispels my throes — 
 Like Nepenthes' spell 's the heave 
 Of thy fond breast to mine; 
 So charming, rare, divine! 
 That is, so it seems, 
 When I am lost in dream, 
 My day dream's happy theme. 
 That captive holds the heart of mine. 
 Of mine, of mine, of mine! 
 That captive holds the heart of mine, 
 In vassalage to thine. 
Lines to Caste. 
 LINES TO CASTE. 
 THE things I love I may not touch, 
 But kiss the hand that shackles bring; 
 The thraldom of my soul is such 
 I can but nurse my thongs and sing, 
 And hope and pray that destiny 
 Will somehow yet unfetter me. 
 I simply trust fate as I ought, 
 While hate defames, malice reviles. 
 And so distorts the public thought 
 That even innocence defiles 
 All who are not adjudged by caste, 
 Superior and nobly classed. 
 I may not ponder here nor muse, 
 Nor let the plain truth designate 
 The things it would. The hangman's noose 
 Unmans, deters, doth reinstate 
 The inquisition and its hell 
 Of terror, tyrannous and fell. 
 Oh! that thou'd grant me ^race, despair, 
 My dread, my sore distress, my pain, 
 Or I could breathe some form of prayer. 
 Or might some suasive word obtain. 
 Through which to move to clemency 
 The iron hand that shackles me. 
 14 
Fanciful thought; I must not hope, 
 Nor question prejudice and hate; 
 For they who read my horoscope 
 Say that the stars which rule my fate 
 Designed me for vile tyranny, 
 And plunder while they fetter me. 
 They bid me grovel, squirm and whine, 
 Nor strive against vile calumny; 
 And vain the thought that would decline 
 Submission to such tyranny; 
 For like a wild beast from its lair. 
 The state doth hound me to despair. 
 My fancy, sure, revives at times, 
 Soars, but to beat its weary wings 
 Against a bar, that basely limes 
 Me in my hope; vilest of things. 
 So dire, so fell, but strong my prison 
 Hope to escape it is derision. 
 And yet there often comes to me, 
 1 know not how, from whence nor where; 
 But comes the thought perpetually. 
 That justice is not deft to prayer. 
 Though it seems barren, yet for me. 
 With good is pregnant destiny. 
Then wherefore should my soul repine, 
 Why be disconsolate and sad; 
 All things are well in Fate's design, 
 Nor great, nor small, nor good, nor bad 
 Has aught to boast of o'er the clay, 
 Tyranny plunders, day by day. 
 Fret not, dear soul, whene'r the proud. 
 The haughty proud, would press you hard. 
 Have they so far subdued the shroud. 
 That clay can now assume the God? 
 Whate'er its form, or hue, or clan. 
 Clay's not the measure of the man. 
 The cup where dazzles bright the wine 
 Was in some distant day and clime 
 Crysalis of a soul like thine; 
 There spirit, daring, once did climb, 
 There dwelt and thought itself a god — 
 'Twas but a tenant of the sod. 
 Who is so great among mankind, 
 His infancy knew not the womb; 
 And, coming thence, still is not blind, 
 To wombed life, as he the tumb 
 Enfolds within its dank embrace, 
 Whate'er his prowess, clan or race. 
And who's so small that, should he fall, 
 Jehovah takes no note of him? 
 Though he be spurned by kings, and all 
 Who frown men down with visage grim, 
 Methinks he'll be as grand in clay 
 As he who tortures him today. 
 I know not why I live or die. 
 Nor why of me the Lord should reck. 
 When like the bruis'd reed prone I lie, 
 The tyrant's heel upon my neck; 
 I simply know that Caste is blind. 
 And that its hope is vicious mind. 
 Because God loves He doth chastise, 
 And makes another race the rod; 
 Then let the chasten race be wise 
 And know the lash is not the God; 
 'Tis not the rod's; chastisement is 
 Eternally and justly His. 
 We have forgot our own household, 
 To take our tribute to the strong-- 
 The willing vassal, young or old. 
 Deserve chastisement late and long; 
 And ours is but the well-earned hell 
 Of wanton, faithless infidel. 
THE LOVE THAT WOULD NOT KEEP. 
 WE'VE reached diverging paths, dear heart, 
 'Tis pity, but 'tis true, we part; 
 It may be thine, itmay be mine; 
 But truly the fauh seems thine. 
 But place it, dear, just where you will, 
 The fault, let it be mine. 
 However deep the wound, dear heart. 
 Or slight, eternally we part, 
 No matter now who is to blame. 
 No matter who must weep. 
 The cruel fate that severed us; 
 The love that would not keep. 
 I long for rest, the quiet rest 
 Of home, and peace, and happiness. 
 That wedded hearts presage, 'tis mine 
 To know the emptiness of thine, 
 The jealousy of fick'e heart 
 To which thy fears incline. 
 No longer now I would conceal. 
 The blight, the pain, the curse I feel; 
 The misery you know, and yet. 
 Dear heart, I would forget. 
 The cruelties of nuptial ties. 
 The fatal day we met. 
THE DEED VS. ASSESSMENT ROLLS. 
 THE real estate assessment roll 
 Would be but plundering per se, 
 If still the courts did not control 
 And hold that deeds convey the fee. 
 Like holy writ and creed of fane, 
 Heart to heart, and cheek by jowl, 
 The courts their virtues still retain. 
 And keep the deed above the roll. 
 By it they stand, by it they fall. 
 What e'er the ambiguities. 
 They look to its intrinsic call. 
 For metes and bounds efficiencies. 
 And if they should consult a clue. 
 The deed itself must furnish that; 
 That rolls are not the points of view. 
 The courts stand uniformly "pat. " 
 IRENE. 
 IN the mid year's afternoon, 
 me and nature blushing June, 
 I go calling on my bonny girl, Irene, 
 And I meet her neath a bower, 
 Where the roses all a-flower. 
 Shed their fragrance in a deluge on Irene. 
 In all the world I know. 
 There's nothing just like this; 
 'Tis happiness, 'tis bliss! 
 And it delights me so; 
 There's nothing just like this. 
 In all the world I know. 
 Hers is blissful company. 
 And I'm happy, don't you see. 
 When I'm calling on my bonny girl, Irene; 
 In the haunts that harbor her, 
 There a scent of lavender 
 Blends its sweetness with the roses for Irene; 
 In all the world I know, 
 There's nothing just like this; 
 'Tis happiness, 'tis bliss! 
 And it delights me so; 
 There's nothing just like this. 
 In all the world I know. 
There is magic in her eye, 
 And the Graces seem to vie, 
 In the placing of their glories on Irene, 
 When I fold her in my arms, 
 Captivated by the charms. 
 And the fascinating taction of Irene, 
 In all the world I know. 
 There's nothing just like this; 
 'Tis happiness, 'tis bliss! 
 And it delights me so; 
 There's nothing just like this 
 In all the world know. 
 28 
 FORGIVEN. 
 I'D roamed around by no ties bound, 
 But fancy's vain and fickle will; 
 Squandered my youth and trampled truth, 
 Beneath my wayward feet, until 
 IVly carnal heart had taken part 
 In all that pride finds pleasure in, 
 While fathoming the depths of sin. 
 At this vile wantonness, one day 
 I lost my immortality. 
 And stood before the open door 
 Of sheol's grim reality; 
 Brought face to face with death, and grace, 
 Jehovah's loving kindness, spurned, 
 How cravingly to live I yearned. 
 Praying for life, immortal life, 
 I offered what I had in lands. 
 Silver, my gold, the fees I hold. 
 And all the labor of my hands. 
 The decalogue, through fear of God, 
 I vowed to keep; yet none of these 
 The king of terrors could appease. 
At last I prayed for light and said, 
 Show me, O Lord, the way; what Thou 
 Wouldst have me do I'll now pursue; 
 Forgive! Cool thou my fevered brow. 
 Teach me to share my brother's care. 
 To love mankind; and if not me. 
 Bless Thou, O Lord, mine enemy. 
 At this there came a great acclaim, 
 Hosannas from the hills of peace. 
 Angelic throngs broke into songs 
 And Mercy brought me sure surcease 
 Of blighting pain, and o'er again 
 Jehovah reckoned unto me 
 The righteousness of purity. 
 THE SHADY SIDE. 
 THERE'S something fascinating on life's dark and 
 sombre side, 
 When the worn and travel-weary seek for rest 
 at even tide; 
 In the shadows where the fallen come to muse 
 on faded hope, 
 Expectancies that vanished like to bubbles 
 blown from soap. 
 If you should reach the shady side of life me- 
 thinks you'll find, 
 Some who have found the upper world so 
 heartless and unkind, 
 And so disposed to torture with the despotisms 
 there 
 They had to seek the shadows as a refuge from 
 despair. 
 Take him who grubs for fortune in a systematic 
 way, 
 Till "biz" is rich in promise and responsive in 
 its pay. 
 And faith ascends the zenith lit with hope, his 
 lucky star, 
 And watch him when the nagger plies her 
 repartees that bar. 
 Then see him with the languor and forlorn in 
 all his air, 
 A standing on the curbstone in a semi-vacant 
 stare; 
 In pendulous vibrations 'twix the club-room and 
 his wife, 
 This a solace, that a nagger, to his swiftly 
 ebbing life. 
The wife is simply nothing if she can't assert 
 her rights; 
 Cannot attend the socials and the musicals of 
 nights, 
 And there forget the promise of our sunny years 
 flown long 
 With the graces of the angels and the eloquence 
 of song. 
 But the wayward, something wiser than your wife, 
 plays on your whim. 
 Veneering all your failures with the glow of 
 triumph's glim, 
 E'er sees in you some greatness, never finds in 
 you a fault. 
 You're every whit par excellence, though brim- 
 ming full of malt. 
 We cannot help but like them if we dared do 
 otherwise, 
 Their sympathy and fervor would their meaner 
 selves disguise; 
 So far transcend the nagging of our double- 
 tongued wives. 
 The nuptials were but prose beside the lyric 
 of our lives. 
 With naggers, life is painful if they do not roar 
 and snort 
 With frenzy and with fury, and the trespass of 
 retort; 
 And club men are so constant in their social 
 thought and air. 
 You just forget deception is the glory reigning 
 there. 
Men know 'tis wrong to wander, that to dissipate 
 is sin, 
 That the dazzle ol the harem is the web the 
 evil spin, 
 To inveigle and to plunder, and to deprivate and 
 spoil. 
 But to the flings of nagging wives the> make a 
 splendid foil. 
 You may moralize and blame them, you may put 
 them under ban. 
 And scourge them out of Eden, from Beersheba 
 unto Dan; 
 But they'll fly the track at intervals and seek the 
 Shady Side, 
 Though naggers all were angels and with deities 
 allied. 
 A lodge within the fastness of the desert waste, 
 or wild, 
 Is better^ than the castle hall and palace courts 
 defiled 
 By wielding of the epigram and reign of 
 repartee. 
 Where the housewife's pride and glory is to nag 
 and disagree. 
 Again, take her whose virginhood bloomed on 
 the Sunny Side, 
 Who had no whim unfavored and no wish not 
 satisfied; 
 But loved while young, and loving, took the first 
 mad leap and lost. 
 And see what door will open, and what lord will 
 be her host. 
If she, perchance a mother, friend, should visit 
 you today. 
 Are you not sure you'd drive her and her infant 
 child away; 
 What matron of the sisterhood of elite folks 
 above 
 Would comfort give a wanderer from the sunny 
 haunts of love? 
 Except, perhaps, they might take him whose 
 purse has golden strings; 
 Or him who has a title to estates and fees and 
 things; 
 Aye! truly they might lord the man who dragged 
 the maiden down. 
 And let him take his pick of hearts from 
 daughters of their own. 
 But she who young in loving took the first mad 
 leap and lost. 
 Must wander forth hereafter, friend, a vagabond 
 at most. 
 Unless she seeks the Shady Side, where high- 
 flown hopes are furled. 
 And take her portion and her chance with us of 
 the Under World. 
 And let her not be weary, nor in her soul cast 
 down, 
 We have no social tyrants here who murder with 
 a frown; 
 But noble men and women, too, with souls like 
 open charts, 
 Who take one's measure not from gold, but pur- 
 poses of heart. 
JOHN MARSHALL'S DIVORCE 
 Today this cause came to be heard 
 On bill, process and proof; 
 Averments usual, form and word, 
 Prolixity forsooth. 
 John Marshall was complainant's name, 
 Carrie, his wife, defendant. 
 He charged as being wanton dame, 
 To lecher rake intendant. 
 For Carrie loud they called by rote, 
 The "Oyez! oyez! oyez. 
 Come into court, come into court, 
 Or you'll be barred, oyez. " 
 If Carrie heard, she heeded not. 
 Default she wholly made, 
 And John has still a spouseless cot, 
 If not a buxom maid 
 41 
And having heard what was averred 
 Of Carrie's wanton acts, 
 And finding she had not demurred, 
 The Court reviewed the facts. 
 These marriage ties, the Court beheves, 
 Have grown so lax, corrupt, 
 It should and does by fit decrees. 
 Break all the nuptials up. 
 We find the process good and true. 
 With regular procedure; 
 And on the whole there comes to view 
 The proofs the facts concede you. 
 Unquestioned those, efficient these. 
 All costs and fees enforced, 
 The Court now orders and decrees 
 John Marshall is divorced. 
 Done in the merry month of May, 
 Year nineteen hundred leven. 
 And if you would exact the day. 
 Know you 'tis twenty-seven. 
IF I HAD A MILLION. 
 If I had a million dollars, friend, I don't 
 know what I'd do, 
 But now and then I think I'd roam and simply spend a few; 
 Again I think I'd steal away to rural quietude. 
 And spend the rest of life among the simple and the rude, 
 I hardly think with flippancies that I would 
 be imbued. 
 The new club woman and her fad, I know 
 1 would elude; 
 Nor should my person be spruced up with 
 dress immaculate; 
 A whole big million I don't think my old 
 pate would inflate. 
 'Tis true, I'd like to slip a cog, and go it 
 wild a bit. 
 My soul aglow with passion for my brother 
 in the pit^ 
 Ay! proud to be with commoners, I'd rusti- 
 cate a-while. 
 Nor would I care a cursed thing about the 
 latest style. 
 "Old brogan shoes and homespun socks? " 
 the very things I need; 
 For too much dress and fashion, sir, would 
 my lithe step impede; 
 An old cord "gallus," friend, would hold my 
 breeches on to me. 
 And I'd not care a snap about their bagging 
 at the knee. 
 45 
The fine silk plug and Panama are hats I 
 do not need; 
 I'd rather poise my head beneath the straw 
 of Dixie's mead; 
 Indeed, my friend, I'd be content beneath a 
 brimless cap, 
 To sport it with the urching all, a jolly, 
 romping chap. 
 With them I'd like to take just now a little 
 bit of ease, 
 A-Iounging where I used to, sir, beneath the 
 apple trees, 
 A-whittling and a-swapping jokes with Bill 
 and Tom and Ned, 
 The while our fancies flit across the lore of 
 trundle bed. 
 46 
Yea, over and above it all, this is the 
 simple truth. 
 Had I the coin, and could, I'd spend a mil- 
 lion for my youth; 
 Then with my true love I would go 
 a-sparking it again. 
 And look the love upon her grace my tongue 
 could ne'er explain. 
 I'd lead her once again, my friend, through 
 old Virginia reel. 
 Salute her there and balance all; again I'd 
 fondly feel 
 The same old bliss so oft I've felt, while 
 swinging corners all. 
 And stepping to the music of the jocund 
 country ball. 
 These things were worth a million to a 
 maimed old chap like me, 
 I'd give it if I could, sir, with a zest of 
 childish glee. 
 Oh! if I could but put away my gout and 
 rheumatiz, 
 And take an old-time outing from the pres- 
 sure of my biz! 
 47 
A bonny girl and youth I'd take to Cupid's 
 mystic shrine, 
 That sylvan haunt of Dixie, where the jes- 
 samine doth twine; 
 Where lilies, fiant of sweetness, and where 
 ever blows the thyme; 
 Where seasons all are summer and the 
 climate is sublime 
 The rose aflame of beauty, there drops 
 petals on the sod, 
 To scarlet blush geraniums, and passion 
 flowers nod 
 In breezy swells of zephyrs that strike up 
 the mystic chime. 
 While carol winged minstrels in'the'glory 
 of their prime. 
 48 
If you could take the silver from this hoary 
 pate of mine, 
 And make it so my bouyant youth could 
 never more decline; 
 And bring me back my bonny girl that 
 long-lost love again, 
 So vivified she might not feel another touch 
 of pain; 
 The million dollars you might have, and 
 millions o er and o'er; 
 Again I'd take my youth and love, and ask 
 for nothing more. 
 As long as we could stroll about the old, 
 familiar ways. 
 And feel the bouyant, throbbing hearts of 
 love and better days. 
 49 
THE THORN. 
 IS strange that those for whom we care, 
 For us so httle feel; 
 And those we shun would gladly share 
 So much of service, love and weal, 
 So much of life for us. 
 And stranger still, those whom we serve 
 So slightly hold the deed; 
 And they our acts would best subserve. 
 So seldom get, .so often need 
 Encouragement from us. 
 Too true it is, they hold the rose 
 And flay us with the thorn; 
 And stranger still, we're foiled by those 
 Our fervent hope is to adorn, 
 Our will is but to serve. 
 53 
Lines to Iona. 
LINES TO IONA. 
 HAD love an answer to its prayer, 
 Sweet lona, I would be there, 
 To solace and caress thee; 
 Had love an answer to its prayer, 
 How truly I wert thine; 
 But love seems prone to go alone. 
 Of first incentives shorn. 
 And thou art far away this eve. 
 And such an eve it is, believe 
 Me lona, believe! 
 How sorely doth thine absence grieve. 
 What happiness wert mine, 
 Could we now stroll and soul to soul 
 Unbosom and forget. 
 57 
Sweet lona, forget, forget, 
 Unbosom now and freely let 
 Vain, fickle pride depart. 
 Be thou thyself, come let us yet 
 Of love's nepenthe drink, 
 As in the olden and the golden 
 Happy, dreamy days. 
 For this I'd stroll with thee, sweetheart, 
 From all the social world apart, 
 I'd go once more with thee; 
 Nor would I care how keen the dart. 
 Sharp the wit, nor foul the tongue. 
 Of rumor, dear, that fills the ear 
 Of gossipers at large. 
 I'd rather stray, sweetheart, with thee, 
 Than know the sweetest ecstacy. 
 Of elite folks and grand. 
 Nor question I my destiny. 
 Be it but linked with thine; 
 For he lives best who is caressed 
 By the woman whom he loves. 
 58 
The moon is at its best tonight, 
 The sky is fair, the stars are bright, 
 The air, bescent'd with flowers, 
 Goes winging by in zephyrs light 
 As Aeolus can blow them; 
 And by the way he winds the lay 
 Of other youths and lassies. 
 It is the hour, the happy time. 
 When lovers strike their sweetest chime 
 Of deep and fervent wooing; 
 When looks are vows, and vows sublime, 
 That ripple into smiles and blend 
 Assenting thought to all they ought. 
 When words were mean expression. 
 And on the border line between 
 The upper and the lower sheen, 
 Of day and mystic night. 
 Our wounded love and pride, I wean. 
 Might find a charm to soothe them. 
 In mending all and blending all 
 Their broken chords of weal. 
 59 
WHEN TRUTH COMES HOME. 
 ONCE in a while in the hush of night, 
 Comes to hope's altar out of the dark, 
 A wanderer seeking light. 
 A wretched waif, in a wretched plight, 
 Comes to hope's altar out of the dark, 
 Once in a while at night. 
 She's not the blond and blue-eyed queen, 
 Whom Anglo-Saxon bards all sing, 
 With gauzy tresses of flaxen hair. 
 Falling in golden ringlets fair 
 Over a marble bust. 
 Bu'' simply stumbling in the dark, 
 Alone o'er desert, waste and wild. 
 She comes a child of the dark; 
 Poor queen, bewildered and beguiled, 
 Deserted, outraged and reviled, 
 She comes a child of the dark 
 Pleading for mercy's pitiful care. 
 Her weary eyes lose their leering light 
 Uplift from their awful dark despair, 
 A wistful beam o'er a luring dream 
 In prayer for charity. 
 61 
No powder flash for her has burned, 
 Nor cannon roared, nor boomed for her. 
 Nor sword in scabbard turned. 
 Blood of her bardel chief to spill 
 But all have sought to ruin her, 
 However much she's yearned 
 The aid of power's bristling steel, 
 That shields the pride of Dixie's dame, 
 And keeps her pure; lest she might reel, 
 And every cur that meets with her 
 Might satiate his lust. 
 The waif queen doth in horror drain 
 The dregs of shame, her woeful plight 
 Tells how the iron reign 
 Blights sire and son of Dixie's might 
 Their matron-spouse and lassies bright. 
 Their lords of State and fane, 
 In spite of caste, by thraldom's chain. 
 The moral blight which this entails 
 On human soul and human brain. 
 Is like a frightful destiny. 
 In tyranny run mad. 
 62 
Alike the lord of wealth and fame, 
 The renegade and plunderer, 
 The libertine inane; 
 When my waif queen appeals to such 
 They lead a dual life with her, 
 And ravish while they feign 
 To be immaculate in creed, 
 In utterance, infallible, 
 Par excellence in deed; 
 The vile and chaste, they foul and waste, 
 In harem and in church. 
 The iron hand her actions tone, 
 And mammon leads to perfidy, 
 Away from all her own, 
 When comes the lordly heir of caste, 
 Triumphant in his lechery. 
 To sow his oats upon 
 The fallow of the Under World; 
 And then at morn, what blasting horn? 
 What banners to the breeze unfurled? 
 He spurns the spouse of his carouse, 
 Murders when truth comes home. 
THE DRIVING OF THE CATTLE HOME. 
 m 
 ONG ago, when evening's twilight, 
 Came vermilion, touched with gold. 
 Save where nature penciled shadows 
 Of a lassie, herd and wold. 
 On the emerald of the meadow, 
 By a pathway to a fold, 
 Came a lassie o'er the heather. 
 Where the sleek kine browse and roam. 
 Calling of the cattle home. 
 Then I felt a mystic rapture, 
 I could never all explain; 
 Nor the why my heart a tattoo 
 Sets to throbbing in my brain. 
 When of nights I watch the embers 
 Of the yule-log glow and wane, 
 Through the long and dreary evenings, 
 While the ghosts of things that were, 
 O'er the waning embers stir. 
 There's enchantment full and plenty. 
 Where the cattle roam and feed, 
 In my reminiscent fancy, 
 On the em'rald of the mead; 
 Where the shimmers of the sunset. 
 From the sombre woodlands speed. 
 Fall but brightly on the pathway, 
 Till it beams a thread of gold. 
 From the moorland to the fold. 
 65 
Now, from ouf the icy claspings, 
 Of the sepulcher of years. 
 While the glow of dying embers 
 On my old hearthstone appears, 
 Comes an angel through the shadows. 
 Age encumbers with, and clears 
 All the clouds from recollections 
 Of my truant coming home. 
 With the lassie through the gloam. 
 But the lassie, heaven bless her, 
 Went a-calling long ago. 
 On a cherub up in glory, 
 Whom she did but scarcely know. 
 There the angels hold her captive. 
 Envying her beauty so; 
 But of evenings when they revel. 
 And I lapse to revery, 
 She as often visits me. 
 Comes with all her mystic beauty, 
 Budding on her like the rose, 
 Blowing wild upon the heather, 
 With a charm of grace that grows 
 On my mem'ry when I'm waking, 
 In my vision when I doze. 
 With her lobate bust a-heaving. 
 And a scent of lavender. 
 In the rustic robes of her. 
Then we stroll again, fond lovers, 
 Through the embers waning glovv'; 
 Not a crow-foot on her visage. 
 Nor a shadow on my brow; 
 Both as charmed, as free, as happy. 
 Now within the afterglow. 
 As when first we went a-sparking, 
 Down the verdant hills of loam 
 Driving of the cattle home. 
 Strolling homeward in the gloaming, 
 'Twix a nap and fancy's flight. 
 As the time upon the dial 
 Loiters towards the noon of night, 
 And the yule-log, gray with ashes, 
 Smoulders to a leering light. 
 And the cerfew bells of glory 
 Call the lassie back from me. 
 Through the hazy reverie. 
 Let the yule-log's embers smoulder, 
 And the angels sportive be. 
 While I sit in sleepy corner. 
 Nap and dream, sweetheart, of th( 
 Till the rare and brilliant glory 
 Of the by-gones come to me, 
 And we stroll, the happy lovers, 
 Hearts a-welling vvith the swells 
 Of the tinkling cattle bells. 
 67 
Ah, the subtle, pleasing fiction 
 That is bundled up in dreams. 
 Dreams that lead us on and ravish 
 With their sweet, alluring themes, 
 Diorames bright and sparkling 
 Kike to beacons over streams, 
 Or like some mirage, oasis 
 Of Sahara, oft they come 
 With their mystic polycrome 
 ONWARD. 
 LET us weld the bond of union, 
 Make the standard stronger stil 
 Till the fellowship of brothers, 
 All our dreams of hope fulfill; 
 Let us purge ourselves of error, 
 Spurn the villain from our midst, 
 Bring the shrine of honor nearer 
 Christian consciousness of heart. 
 Let us build a shrine to virtue, 
 Where the graces may sojourn; 
 Sacred to their cause forever, 
 There let honor's incense burn; 
 On that altar let religion, 
 Such as Christ has given us, 
 Be the sole inspiring mission 
 Of a nobler brotherhood. 
Let us strive, and striving, conquer. 
 First of all our erring selves; 
 Then we'll hope, and hoping, labor. 
 As one in the quarry delves. 
 Working on our racial heart. 
 Till it beams, in form sublime, 
 Like a precious stone, which art 
 Aided nature to adorn. 
 Onward, upward, high and higher. 
 Seeking each and all the light; 
 Press, ye legions, on and up to 
 Freedom's dazzling goal of light. 
 Grant us peace, O gracious Master, 
 Since our cause is one divine, 
 Never let thou fell disaster 
 Mai k our star of Fate's decline! 
BABY DARLING. 
 ONCE a wee bit baby darling, 
 Pure as beauty, sweet as grace, 
 Sat upon my knee and thrilled me 
 With her rare bewitching face; 
 Face so fair, so charmed, so pregnant 
 With the glow of buoyant soul. 
 That the angels paid her homage; 
 And, disputing earth's control, 
 Trooped about her crib and worshipped 
 Baby darling's virgin soul. 
 Lingered there and learned to love her. 
 And to envy us the child, 
 Till our jealousies grew frenzied, 
 As the spirit world beguiled. 
 Lured and charmed, and so enrapt her 
 With the ditties of the skies, 
 That she pined and looked the languor, 
 Through her fever-stricken eyes. 
 All our mortal love we gave her. 
 But the angels: — paradise. 
 75 
Yes, they took her, jealous angels, 
 Thus to take the baby child, 
 All because she was the fairest 
 That e'er looked on them and smiled. 
 Up in glory where they keep her. 
 Can they, will they really be 
 Half as careful, half as anxious 
 Of our baby's weal as we? 
 Did they really give her fever. 
 In their joyous ecstacy? 
 Sick of pain, she daily wilted 
 Through a typhus fever's blight, 
 Till her spirit dropped its body-- 
 Far from earthly things took flight. 
 With the cherubim then journeyed. 
 Up in yon ethereal dome, 
 Purest, fairest being, truly. 
 That e'er through it flitted home 
 To Elysian fields of glory. 
 Where the Savior bids all come. 
 76 
My Remington 
m 
 MY REMINGTON. 
 IN the still and silent night, 
 When I sit me down to write, 
 There is mystery and ease, 
 In the movement of the keys, 
 And the smooth and even run 
 Of my magic Remington. 
 Let the man who glories still. 
 In the ancient pen or quill. 
 Take it of all glory shorn, 
 Like that of his old ink horn; 
 Put his paste-brush in the ink 
 When, if ever, he should think. 
 I have now a wizard's wand. 
 Underneath my dexter hand. 
 Bringing happiness to me, 
 Through its runic melody. 
 Making time without the waste 
 Of the ink quill in the paste. 
 79 
Alice. 
m 
 ALICE. 
 TOMORROW 's but a dream, dear Alice, 
 In truth, it never appears; 
 The past, a tenantless old palace, 
 Where hope lies tombed in tears; 
 The urn is broken, Alice, 
 Whence incense rose above; 
 But you may see, if you will, today. 
 The magical haunts of love. 
 My fancy sees a chalice, 
 A harp all strung, attuned, 
 A famed, enchanted palace. 
 Where Cupid oft communed; 
 The theme of his dreaming, Alice, 
 In waking or sleeping the same, 
 A glory that ever dazzles. 
 Till it sets the soul a-flame. 
 88 
Like the burning bush on Horeb, 
 Or lit phosphoric seas, 
 The dream is metamorphosed, 
 And Cupid makes wild pleas. 
 For a glance of your dark eyes, Alice, 
 And a touch of your lips, my dear. 
 For all the bliss of caressing. 
 Laughter, and song, and cheer. 
 Tis to you and none other, Alice, 
 My thought reverts in its fTight, 
 A little perhaps out of ballas'. 
 Perhaps with too much delight; 
 So crude, so humble and callous 
 That a message it scarce can bear. 
 From a heart that wears your image. 
 And the passion that fixed it there. 
 84 
Come thou with me, dear Alice, 
 To where there's building for thee 
 A loved, charmed, magical palace, 
 Hard by the Mexic sea; 
 Where date, and spice and lemon 
 Doth blow perpetually, 
 By that enchanted palace 
 That looks out over the sea. 
 Tomorrow? That's cruel, Alice, 
 Why speak of a day that is not? 
 That spoils the bliss of living, 
 Makes mine a miserable lot, 
 And love's enchanted palace 
 A wild and desolate place; 
 No land of dates and flowers 
 Wert blessed without thy grace. 
HILAND-BUCKINGHAM. 
 The following piece was intended as a brief *satire on the 
 manner of conducting elections in the benevolent societies in'the 
 State of Mississippi. That the manner of conducting elections 
 in many of these societies is corrupt, no one who regards truth 
 will deny: 
 OH! have you heard the boastful song 
 Of Highland-Buckingham; 
 Who often in their zeal go wrong, 
 And never care a damn. 
 Gay, happy pals, the coin and bag, 
 The records and what not, 
 They'd hold by fraud, or guile and gag. 
 While Eddie "bulls" the pot. 
 87 
You hold the records and the seal, 
 And Buck '11 hold the bag, 
 While John and Ed, by crooked deal. 
 The delegates will gag- 
 The people's choice we may not be. 
 But what care we for that: 
 We've fixed it so that you and "me" 
 And Johnny can stand pat. 
 'Twas in the sunny month of May, 
 I think, or thereabout. 
 When Eddie Jones devised a way. 
 Of counting people out. 
 Since Eddie taught us how to buck 
 And gag the delegate, 
 ^\ e'll slime the people's choice with muck 
 And let the rascals bleat. 
 Our John will quack it like a duck. 
 And straddle like a clown; 
 Till 'twix vile roguery and luck 
 We steal for him the crown. 
 88 
For you the seal, for me the bag, 
 Or you the bag and me 
 The seal; we'll swap em as we wag, 
 'Twix guile and tweedledee. 
 We'll gull 'um here and gag 'urn there; 
 The delegates^ you see, 
 Have got no rights for which we care — 
 Friend Buck, that's you and "me." 
 You are my candidate, dear Buck, 
 And I your jolly pal; 
 You need not doubt your Hiland's pluck. 
 It's cheek by jowl with mal. 
 For me the seal, for you the bag. 
 For John the gavel's trust; 
 The people's choice we'll buck and gag. 
 And take the bag or bust. 
 Tis true, we've been a little lax — 
 Just twenty thousand short — 
 But still we have the gall to tax 
 The people while they snort. 
 89 
They are such queer, such simple things; 
 I mean the people, Buck; 
 They'd leave their rights to clicks and rings 
 And court the Boss and luck. 
 The Boss, by jingo, he is a bird, 
 There's magic in his name. 
 Not by our suffrage; but his word 
 We win or lose the game. 
 On rights, the people would not toss 
 A copper's head nor tail. 
 They'd rather, far, to know the "Boss " 
 Had drove a heeler's sale. 
 The days of patriot!^ have passed. 
 Their principles are dead. 
 The heeler has the sage outclassed 
 And sports a price per head. 
 For principles men used to fight, 
 To 'venge a wrong would die. 
 But now they slip a cog that's tight 
 And barter rights lor rye. 
 90 
And there's a trait that's glorious, 
 In diplomatic art, 
 'Tis making right so odious 
 That wrong seems "pure of heart.'

MY BROTHER JOHN. 
 MY brother John has beds of down 
 And mansions of his own; 
 The humble bed where I rest my head 
 Is Httle less than stone; 
 But peace is there to soothe my care 
 While Brother John has pride; 
 So I pity John and all who bear 
 Great fortune's weight and care. 
 My brother John has fertile farms 
 Of cotton, and corn and maize; 
 While naught have I but earth and sky 
 To look on all my days; 
 Mine's not the lot to own the spot 
 Of humble cabin home; 
 And ne'er the wi.ng of airy fame 
 Buzzes about my name. 
 My brother's hold is fixed on gold 
 And auto cars for tour, 
 That flash today in their gala way 
 With rush and dash by the poor; 
 When go I must, I tramp the dust 
 Whither my brother speeds, 
 Unawares to the common lot 
 Of peer, and sage, and sot. 
 95 
Brother John has a splendid lawn, 
 Scythed and rolled and^green, 
 A verdant spot where such a sot 
 As I am never seen. 
 To all that plod, "Keep off the sod,' 
 Is John's command today; 
 And I pass on and muse why clay. 
 Like mine, not John's, is gay. 
 96 
KISS ME AGAIN. 
 a 
 H, give me a kiss 
 To mate with the bhss 
 Of the heart I swear, love, is thine; 
 Let beam a smile 
 To cheer the while 
 I give thee of all that is mine. 
 Now, ere we part, 
 Let's feel your heart 
 In unison beat, love, with mine; 
 Your head at rest, 
 Sweet on my breast, 
 While my arms, dear, about thee I twine. 
 Kiss me again, 
 And then again! 
 Turn Cupid wild tonight, sweeth eart. 
 Thy soul and mine 
 By a kiss confine. 
 To love's wild dream, dear, ere we part.

MY DELIGHT. 
 About two miles, as the crow flies, south from Meridian, in 
 Lauderdale Countv, Mississippi, stands Mt. Barton, probably the 
 highest hill in East Mississippi. One can get a splendid view 
 of the surrounding country from this hill; and, in the early morn- 
 ing or late afternoon, the beauty of the landscape viewed from 
 its summit is pleasing. 
 I frequently visit Mt. Barton, which I call the Heights of 
 Lauderdale. I can see and contemplete Meridian better from 
 this point, and the sweet sensations which come when the winds 
 play among the pines, and the absence of the din and noise of 
 the city, make it a hap^y resort for a weary mind. 
 I CAN but feel a swell of soul. 
 Over my vision's broader scope, 
 When from the city's mart I stroll 
 And climb along the northern slope, 
 Of Lie Heights of Lauderdale. 
 Hard by, a heath of Lauderdale, 
 A verdant sweep of broken lea, 
 Rolls into knolls from out the vale, 
 And undulates and swells a sea 
 Of bil'-'wy emerald waves. 
 101 
Far off on that sea there lies, 
 North of the Heights of Lauderdale, 
 Meridian, 'neath a haze of skies, 
 And seems, upon that distant vale. 
 Fleet like, anchored on the deep. 
 How often have I lingered there. 
 To have my simple thought dome teem. 
 With fancy's fictions of the fair, 
 And catch a glimpse of beauty beam. 
 Scintillate and dazzle there. 
 And when beneath some lofty pine, 
 I muse on Nature's loveliness. 
 As oft it seems something divine. 
 Places a rare peculiar stress. 
 Of melody in the pines. 
 Among the pines of Lauderdale, 
 A whispered cadence sighs along, 
 And when the winds become a gale. 
 The verdant hills burst into song 
 And sweetly soughs ravien. 
 And far away down the cultured vale. 
 Echoing goes the evening hymn, ■ 
 Of some rude swain of Lauderdale; 
 Soothing and sweet, the lay of him 
 Chimes with the metre wild. 
 102 
The metre wild, the metre wild, 
 How many an eve I loiter where, 
 By its sweet melody beguiled, 
 I muse on nature's charms and share 
 Her metrical symposium. 
 Sublime the scene when twilight flies, 
 Up through the green tines of the pines, 
 As, on the deep vermillion skies, 
 Day, weary and worn, declines. 
 Beaming last on Lauderdale. 
 There, looking on him spent, supine, 
 How oft have I been filled with awe, 
 To see his gold on emerald shine. 
 And crimson fingered evening draw 
 The starry curtains of the night. 
 Again to hear the wild anthem, 
 The intonations of the pines, 
 And all the mystic airs of them 
 A-soughing through the vast confines 
 Of Lauderdale is my delight.

THE SOVEREIGN. 
 WE have a mighty government of high and brilliant fame, 
 Triumphant we the suflfrage wield and all our kith and kin; 
 And those who would the nation rule by equity, not awe, 
 Know the President is ruler only in the people's name; 
 For the sovereign is the people, and the people's will is law. 
 The voter he is royalized, his dame's a sov- 
 ereign's queen. 
 The millions ot them common heirs apparent 
 to a throne. 
 Whose prowess is invincible, whose glory 
 is supreme; 
 And whom they will they designate to wield 
 the mace, I wean. 
 Their common heritage, the mace, rotation its 
 regime. 
 And Washington, impregnable, did Freedom's 
 glory set 
 Above the rage of passion and beyond ambi- 
 tion's blow; 
 And Lincoln died to keep it there, the honor 
 of the West; 
 A government of commoners, that is tri- 
 umphant yet 
 In the suffrage of the people, for the people's 
 reign is best. 
 13 
Yet Roosevelt brought us princely whims, and 
 honor and renown; 
 And led the Russ and Japanese to pleasant 
 fields to peace. 
 And sent our valiant fighting tars a spinning 
 round the globe, 
 And boosted up the Cabinet, and held the 
 Congress down, 
 And kept the trust contending with the gov- 
 ernmental probe. 
 A brilliant man of letters, he eclipsed the 
 fourth estate, 
 And kept the galleys flooded with his seas of 
 manuscript. 
 So coached our representatives, with mes- 
 sages of whim. 
 The great became his echoist, "My policies 
 to prate. 
 And everything spectacular was left to fate 
 and him. 
 He found among our nation's hoards but one 
 who tells the truth, 
 And he is wasting dictums on the Ananias 
 clubs, 
 And holds in his opinion, and by all the 
 rules of law. 
 Apparent is presumption and self-evident 
 is proof. 
 That Harriman, and Tillman, and the World 
 once made a draw. 
 114 
All glory to the President, for truly he has 
 rights 
 Which weaker mortals haven't got and wise 
 ones wouldn't have, 
 For he can wield a mammoth club and wear 
 his cap awry; 
 With fiction's greatness he can come, crazed 
 by his frantic frights. 
 And frail the mischief out of many such as 
 you and I. 
 Ay, truly is the President sagacious, great 
 and wise, 
 Who keeps his soul in peace and reigns o'er 
 eighty million kings 
 Who are themselves the common heirs and 
 lords who emulate 
 The virtues of our patron sires who did to us 
 devise 
 The tenue of the suffrage and the legacy of 
 state. 
 The President is glorious, we think he is 
 sublime. 
 Whene'er he represents the will of eighty 
 million souls; 
 A commoner of commoners, by commoners 
 enthroned. 
 And made the peer of all the kings of every 
 age and clime, 
 Whose glory none will dare despoil, and none 
 has yet disowned. 
 115 
The patriots who built the realm, have in their 
 will decreed, 
 The sceptre is the people's and among them 
 shall rotate, 
 Till home rule is immortalized in ev'ry people's 
 reign; 
 For royal blood's a fiction and all royalty's a 
 creed. 
 And suffrage of the people still the hope of 
 state and fane. 
 So here's to Mister President, and here's to 
 Taft the man, 
 A commoner of commoners by commoners 
 enthroned; 
 And here is to the commoners, my country- 
 men, my peers, 
 And here's to law and equity, to party and 
 to clan, 
 And here's to equal suffrage in our govern- 
 ment's careers. 
 God bless our common country, and preserve 
 chief of state, 
 And solace him who has the charge, with all 
 Thy gracious love; 
 Lest many should, perchance, forget this ie 
 the people's reign, 
 We pray Thee, Lord, to keep it so the sceptre 
 shall rotate. 
 The common people e'er among in common- 
 wealth and fane.

Sam, the Garbager 
SLEEPY CORNER. 
 SAM, the Garbager, had carpet, 
 And some scraps of office jot, 
 Optomacy stooped to throw him. 
 As he passed from lot to lot. 
 And with these he decked his cabin 
 In a rather modern style; 
 But himself remained old-fashioned 
 Like — simple and true the while. 
 And the milk of human kindness 
 Seemed to bubble from his heart, 
 As he rolled about the city 
 In his two-wheeled garbage cart. 
 He could tell about the weather 
 From the corns upon his feet. 
 And he said, "De kind dat rests yer 
 Is de drizzle, rain or sleet." 
 119 
Dhar am sometin in de wedder, 
 Dat yer can't jist al'ays splain. 
 When the clouds am runnin' rivers 
 In de drizzlin' of de rain; 
 Ween de win' am jist ez quiet, 
 Ez de las' yer's mouldin' leaves 
 Wid nothin' breaking silence 
 'Cep'en murmurs on your eves. 
 Wid de night ez dark ez Hades, 
 An' er tinyus po in rain, 
 Er ripplin into murmurs 
 Off yer windo' sill an' pane, 
 Dhar am som'thin' in de weder 
 Lak er op'ate so it seems 
 Dat brings yer deeper slumber, 
 Dat wakes yer lighter dreams. 
 In dear ol' sleepy corner, 
 Whar lax'tion grows and grows, 
 Tell yer nap and nod ter music, 
 Dat's er lullin' yer to 'pose. 
 An' de study ripplin' measure 
 Dat am tumblin off yer eves. 
 Seems er lullaby of angels, 
 Forcin' worries all ter leave. 
 120 
Den yer soul all ober joyed 
 Wid de dreams de driz le weaves; 
 Kinder feels dat et am courted 
 By de nymps of reveries; 
 An' yer mouth er fallin' open, 
 Hangs yer chin erpun yer chest, 
 While yer soul goes splorin dream Ian 
 Ez de driz'le lulls ter rest. 
 121 
For A Woman. 
FOR A WOMAN. 
 DEN, lost to all but fancy, 
 Was it ever aught but legend 
 Handed down from sire to son, 
 As descriptive of the region. 
 Of the sunny haunts of love? 
 Famous garden where the passion, 
 Bursting first disclosed the morn 
 Whose effulgent, beaming glory 
 Cleft old Chaos, brain and spine; 
 Lit up incense burning shrine. 
 In the heart of man for Eve. 
 Round that shrine the zeal of Adam, 
 Glowing like the flaming sword, 
 Soon forgot his peaceful Eden, 
 And the order of his lord; 
 Left the garden to its thistles. 
 And his Master to His wrath, 
 Bartered Eden for a woman. 
 Braved the fates to please his wife; 
 Took her from the lap of nature 
 Just as God had fashioned her, 
 In her rare bewitchery. 
 124 
Ever since that fatal error. 
 Whether fart or mythic story, 
 From the ancient tombs of thought, 
 Brought by art through mystic glory, 
 They have journeyed, both astray, 
 Over many steeps of woe; 
 Through the fens and bogs of shame, 
 Fled from sorrow unto sorrow, 
 Sounding all the deeps of pain; 
 But never crossed, nor can again, 
 Eden in their pilgrimage. 
 Talked with God in burning bushes. 
 Held the seas till Isr'el passed; 
 Ate of manna fresh from heaven; 
 Took a town with trumpet blast; 
 Slept with lions, stood in Are; 
 And, in Price of Bethlehem, 
 Had a God to mourn their dead, 
 And vivify the corpse again; 
 But ne'er since man squandered Eden 
 On the fancy of a maiden. 
 Has he found the land of bliss. 
 1^25 
May be, after all, old Eden 
 Is wrapped within our meaner selves 
 Hid beneath our pride ard envy; 
 That the sword which us repels; 
 Is our secret wickedness: 
 Could we deftly lift the curtain 
 Which the cunning serpent draws, 
 Like the veil of night about us, 
 We would find that paradise. 
 Like a flower in winter, lies 
 'Neath the stubbles of our souls, 
 "So near and yet so far away". 
 For who has ever purged his heart, 
 Of all the guilt that in it lies, 
 Though the purging would impart 
 To him the bliss of paradise? 
 Who does not harbor in his breast 
 The fruitage of forbidden things 
 Culled from beauty's lips and heart. 
 And folded in between the leaves 
 Of memory's roll of reveries: 
 A charm, a hope, a dream! 
 126 
Whether truth, fancy or legend 
 Is what allures our faith through fears, 
 Let us hope beyond the shadows 
 Of this wilderness of tears. 
 We shall reach the blest dominion 
 That so long has failed us here; 
 Where our friends will cease to doubt us, 
 Where our foes will learn to love; 
 Still let's hope to find the Eden 
 Whence we wandered with our maiden; 
 If not here, beyond the bourn. 
 Let us hope life's pilgrimage. 
 Has some other goal than Hell; 
 Hope that we may find the glory. 
 Whence the first degenerate fell; 
 Hope to foil the shafts of envy; 
 Hope to sooth the pangs of pain; 
 Hope to find our dead are living; 
 Hope to find our living dead 
 To the errors time is weaving; 
 To lip service and deceiving 
 Hope to conquer death at last. 
 127 
The Jaunt, 
THE JAUNT. 
 SIRE and youth went out upon a jaunt, 
 Along a course as old, 'tis said, as time; 
 The scene was varied, beautiful, sublime; 
 None saw ne er landscape fairer nor was wont 
 And yet the course, with all its high blown vaunt, 
 Was but veneered fiction, still youth would climb 
 From vale and foot-hill to the mountain clime; 
 Fear could not check him, nor could danger daunt: 
 For hope and destiny, with mystic force. 
 Allured, and youth knew not that there lurked pain; 
 Yet how e'er fair the prospect, smoothe the course, 
 Few, who assension dare, can ever gain 
 The little hills of glory there hard by 
 The heights where Fame her plumage dips in sky. 
 II 
 They journeyed first a-down a verdured vale, 
 By sunny fountains, and by gurgling rills, 
 Where he amused himself by piping quills 
 To a fair damsel with a milking pail; 
 Then frowned the sire and at the youth did rail 
 Some suasive reprimand, and of the hills 
 Of fame would say, no man ascends who wills 
 To pipe his pibroch to a lover's tale; 
 Then youth, impatient, strolled alone and sire 
 Trailed after, like mother's hope, for he knew 
 The sure fatality of love's sweet lyre. 
 Then youth took winged ankles, swiftly flew 
 Unto the bowers of a floral grove, 
 Where Venus wooed him into dreams of love. 
 V29 
Ill 
 Umbrage and guile were there, and said "Ah friend. 
 The hope of fame's but fancy's fiction set 
 To the fitful music of life's calumet; 
 If you'd do well, be gay and happy, tend 
 The revelries and be content to spend 
 The time at song and laughter, and forget 
 The rampage of thy sire, just let him fret; 
 Ere you achieve life's honors: life will end: 
 The wise fret not but Jeast and let their mirth 
 Flood deep: for tomorrow shadows will be 
 Burdens, and hope a plague: the salt of earth 
 Is cheerfulness mixed with wit and levity, 
 No matter whether good or bad it be. 
 Cheer on, for mirth's a foil to destiny. 
 IV 
 At this youth vvandered from the beaten way, 
 Piping his pibroch to a festive air; 
 The maid, her virginhood a-budding fair. 
 Forsook her kine, the mystic rounderlay 
 A-carrolling, and tripping like a Fay, 
 At love's enchantment, wended with him there. 
 Her breast a heave neath silken gauze, her hair 
 With myrtle wreathed, both passion drunk and gay, 
 Forgot the care and wisdom of their sire, 
 And all he ever taught them of the course. 
 Its lapse of righteous law, the strife and ire 
 And carnivals of crime, the vicious force 
 Upon the sense of innocence at large. 
 And never grant it respite nor discharge. 
V 
 In such a plight the sire might well despair 
 Of converse with his wayward child; but he, 
 Still on the course did loiter long, to see 
 What late pedestrian would there repair; 
 But care possessed his soul and through his hair 
 Did nervous fingers dig his pate, to free 
 Its thought of virtue's ebb, and fate's decree. 
 Youth, spurning his solicitude and care, 
 Sang on, and danced in love's sensual haunt. 
 With Venus fair, until the gray dawn blushed 
 To crimson on the cheeks of morn; then gaunt 
 Did innocence lie on their wan brows, crushed 
 And wilted, like a wild rose on a stone; 
 And to his sire youth plied quibbles of his own. 
 VI 
 Misogymy's dead world you fled, 'tis said. 
 With woman fair and fickle. Sire, and strolled 
 Along life's sunny side an ardent soul; 
 If not a reed you piped, 'twas that you played 
 A stringed instrument and to Venus laid 
 Your heart, a tribute unto her control. 
 And thought the drama brilliant when the roll 
 A master should have played, the buffo swayed: 
 So Sire, away till I've sown my "wild oats, " 
 And scythe, keen scythe, has mown the grain of mine; 
 Hold thou! thy tongue, my lord until the moats 
 In my eyes grow to beams like those in thine. 
 And then the two grew reckless in their thought. 
 And neither saw the other as he ought. 
 131 
Vil 
 Then youth, a plunging heedless in the chase, 
 Went deeper down than honor e'er was wont 
 And lost his virtue in the dismal haunt. 
 Where vice and sloth doth chastity deface, 
 And love is but a license to disgrace. 
 What ever fair and gracious is; where gaunt 
 And reckless villians, shorn of shame, doth flaunt 
 Perfidy's triumph in the public place. 
 The lassie, lost to mother's love, and truth 
 Saw scenes where Grace had never placed her feet; 
 And at a time she knew not of, gay youth 
 Took wings and flew like beaming light, too fleet 
 For her, she sought the shades of solitude and yearned 
 For what age had taught her and she had spurned. 
 VIII 
 Many a Summer past them ere youth knew, 
 The purpose of his pilgrimage, and he. 
 Too often wayward, wilful, wild and free. 
 Returned unto the jaunt and would pursue 
 A wiser, if not better course; but few 
 Are those who do their childhood's errors flee; 
 They cling unto old customs and must be 
 Progressive in performing what they rue 
 The coquet, still a flirting, oft will feign, 
 Her waining summers are but budding springs, 
 And, in the realm of passion, long would reign 
 Where honor should preside o'er better things. 
 And later on, in wed-lock find that life. 
 Is noblest in the mother that's a wife. 
 132 
IX 
 Beware of women who are quoquetts, bard, 
 Their ruhng passion is a fatal dart, 
 Set to the fancy of sensual art, 
 Of zeal their souls are void, cold, sterile, hard. 
 The heart's vivacious flame in them is charred. 
 If they are old, and feign the maid, lose heart 
 And hope; for prone to drift from grace apart, 
 They'd crush the fervor of thy fond regard; 
 For, though they have refinement, graceand ease. 
 They have not love's enchantment nor its flame; 
 For they are outlawed by Hesperides, 
 Nor are, nor can be, ever more the same; 
 Bright, charming, gay; but neither wise nor good. 
 They are but shadows of their virginhood. 
 All who have seen them in their glory say 
 That men have rarely neath their sceptres passed, 
 Who did not feel that something awful massed 
 The passions carnal, in their souls; and they 
 Who fell not, look on that eventful day 
 As one, in which the fair dissemblers, masqued 
 As cherubim of light, were by them classed 
 Good friends immaculate, whom to inveigh 
 Wert madness; such were the whims of youth. 
 Who did the woman, fallen in her prime. 
 Adore; and, spurning virtue and fair truth, 
 Did hold the ways of wantonness sublime; 
 However much we chide them still they get 
 And dissipate our fortune while we fret. 
 134 
XI 
 And though you deem one gracious, fairer far 
 Than fabled nymph, or ought that lives in song, 
 Romance and drama, or the toilings long 
 Of art, at form and grace and charm — all are 
 But false conceptions of thy beauteous star. 
 She'll spurn thy hopes and will not right, but wrong, 
 Consider; free love's her realm; among 
 The sons of men her will doth often mar 
 Fortunes; passion is her sceptre; the ^reat 
 The good, the wise her prey; genius her toy; 
 Her smiles the gods doth conjure with and Fate, 
 Doth of her mien and beauty make decoy 
 For human souls: if life means aught to you, 
 Beware, lest her bewitchery you rue. 
 XII 
 Thus spoke the sire, to youth, who knew the force 
 Of woman shorn of blessed chastity; 
 And then he masqued the boy, that he might n't see 
 And led him down a by-path from the course; 
 But on the ears of him, from its sweet source 
 Some rythmic music swept its cadency- 
 "A damsel shook her tambourine at me," 
 Said youth, and then a stupor, like morose 
 Was his; for him the music witched and haunted, 
 Soothing in melody, like chords in flight. 
 By some fair being touched^and love enchanted. 
 Sent wandering and echoing through night, 
 So well the temptor plays .lis subtle role 
 That they who on the by-path fall lose soul. 
 135 
XIII 
 Then to the temple of the wise did age 
 Lead youth, and bade him with the muses mate 
 His soul, embelish and enrich his state 
 Of mind, and so enlarge his heritage. 
 That lucid wisdom might declare him sage; 
 And well the youth applied him long and late; 
 But ever and anon at wisdom's gate. 
 The song of sisters fallen rung; engage 
 Him as he would, with books, he could not part 
 With phantom beautiful, a woman's face, 
 Nor th' sweeter memoirs of his fickle heart; 
 So he, between his study and her grace. 
 Swung like a pendulum, in fitful doubt, 
 Till carnal passion won him and he spoke out: 
 XIV 
 Oh let the sage get what he can from books. 
 Divert from science and purloin fom lore, 
 All will but tax his energy the more. 
 Derange digestion and confound his cooks. 
 Where e'er his path of glory runs or crooks; 
 He'll find that mortals journeyed there before, 
 And found what he shall find on evVy shore; 
 The more he learns, the more the sage he looks. 
 The more he shows the same old grooves he treads 
 That fate allures him with the same old charms. 
 And gives him little else besides life's shreds; 
 The gold he hoards, his princely fees and farms, 
 All that fortune brings him, might commands. 
 Tomorrow fate will place in other hands. 
 130 
XV 
 It matters little who the tensures hold. 
 Who vassal is, who peasant, lord, or king; 
 Whether we laugh, or we weep, or we sing; 
 As we climb the heights, or go down the wold, 
 When Youth is fervent, or when Age is cold. 
 We grow immortal if we simply cling 
 To self denial and will kindly fling 
 Charity's mantle o'er the wilful souled; 
 He who goes thus to the end of his cord, 
 With which environment encumbers him, 
 To aid the fallen of mankind, is lord 
 Superior to him whose law, is whim; 
 Whose hope, is pedigree; whose God, is Caste, 
 Though his grace were crowned with dominions vast. 
 XVI 
 They sat them then upon a mossy stone. 
 Where glances of the eye could sweep the plain, 
 And Youth gave ear to him, who did explain, 
 The strife of those who before had gone, 
 To fame and glory, or oblivion: 
 How small the glory and how great the pain. 
 Of those who strive for opulency's vain 
 Pomp and show; how little their deeds atone. 
 The evil done, the paupers they have made 
 Of happy childhood and decrepid age, 
 That lucre might prance 'neath a gay cockade: 
 Tyranny have its minions, pomp its page 
 And avaricious misers hoard the coin. 
 They from the innocent and just purloin. 
 137 
XVII 
 While thus their light and happy discourse ran, 
 A hag came riding in a peddler's cart, 
 Drawn by a filly to the pnblic mart. 
 The hag was old, the filly for a clan 
 Of robers fit, or bold equestrian; 
 A horse she needed that was sure in start. 
 And not a filly that would jump and dart. 
 And prance and gallop in a trading van: 
 And sure there came a man with steed for trade, 
 That sturdy was, road-proof and bridle wise; 
 Ne'er had he shied and ne'er a balk had made. 
 Her nag she swapped with him; and what surprise: 
 The steed she gst had lost its eyes, its speed 
 Was ox-like and its urgent want was feed. 
 XVIII 
 The villain mounted, on the filly fled. 
 Nor looked he back, nor cared how ill her luck, 
 Nor in the mire how fast the hag was stuck, 
 Who o'er her filly's loss, lamenting, said, 
 "I wish the filly and the rogue were dead," 
 Then fell to nagging at the maimed old buck. 
 Till she forgot and in her anger struck 
 Him a blow so hard, on his dense old head. 
 He fell the carcass of a quadruped; 
 And then she journeyed o'er the course unknown. 
 Morose, unpitted and disquieted. 
 With nothing on earth she could call her own, 
 Brought from the harvesting of human strife 
 But steedless apple cart and such is life. 
 138 
XIX 
 As was the hag with filly, steed and cart. 
 So is it with whoever journeys here, 
 Whatever his endeavor, hope or fear, 
 In the contest at arms, the toils of art 
 Or barter and trade in the world's great mart; 
 In heart affairs, be it laughter and cheer, 
 Or what is better still, staunching a tear 
 A-drip from rupture in a stranded heart, 
 No matter which, experience alone 
 Is the supreme tutor of human thought; 
 With all the learning of the schools one's own, 
 Still he's a simpleton, who has not caught 
 The inspiration which contact brings, 
 To him who rubs elbows with serfs and kings. 
 XX 
 On youth the sire looked wistfully and smiled, 
 Wondering whence his wisdom came and he, 
 But yesterday a child, had grown to be 
 Pensived souled; and, sore of waywardness, whiled 
 Away the time; his mind, now unbeguiled. 
 At issue on the void; 'twix bound and free; 
 Why all who labor should not earn the fee 
 Of freemen; and, toiling, be undefiled 
 By odium, caste and greed, miscalled fate, 
 By men who feed their maws upon the hard 
 Earned wage of honest toil; degenerate 
 And fallen must he be who the award 
 Of serfdom does not spurn, though wide gaped hell 
 Him to coerce and he with Satan fell. 
 130 
XXI 
 Standing upon an eminence, they saw 
 As far beyond as mortal eye could scan, 
 Upon a plain, a myriad host that ran, 
 To and fro, its confines, to hum and haw. 
 And hesitate twix anarchy and law; 
 The vile negation fixed on the hide of man, 
 The vagaries of parties, sex and clan, 
 Where despotism's power sways to awe 
 The weaker man, by terror into thrall; 
 "It ever has and ever will be so, " 
 Said he to Youth, "If I aright recall, 
 Man is the prey of man the wide world o'er 
 Since Cain hid Able in the sand and fled 
 The stark, cold visage of a brother dead. 
 XXII 
 They now were well advanced upon the way. 
 Some forty leagues or more, and youth would fain 
 Of his companion's further discourse gain 
 Intelligence about the course, which lay 
 Before them still, a theatre where play 
 The great and petty lords of earth, with vain 
 Hope; there humanity, an ebbless main. 
 Floods on, and on, "Forever and a day," 
 The meed of its pursuit the same old toys, 
 Wealth, greed and power; or the tyrant's stroke 
 That makes of weaklings slaves, or them destroys; 
 Let him whose soul is weak accept the yoke. 
 Unhinge thp knee and kiss the liand that smites. 
 And grope the vassal shorn of human rights. 
 140 
XXIII 
 But he who feels his sou! within him yearn 
 To fly his thrall, and flying, sound alarm, 
 That laggards cow'ringmay have never calm; 
 And he who'd vassals into freemen turn, 
 Dethrone a tyrant and his minions spurn. 
 Should shield his soul against the dread of harm; 
 Should agitate the mass, direct the storm. 
 Until the hearts of patriots should burn, 
 Struck by the thunderbolt of righteous cause. 
 Youth, put thou thy frivolities aside. 
 Learn of Divinity's eternal laws, 
 That there's no question what the fates decide; 
 Though ne'er so frail the bark, nor rough the sea. 
 The fiat is, sail on or cease to be. 
 XXIV 
 Far out upon the plain the youth could see 
 An old cathedral lift its burnished spire, 
 Agleam into the sky. "Aye tell me sire. 
 The story of yon pile of masonry?" 
 He shook his hoary locks and sighed, "Ah me:" 
 The record there's a tale of tense desire. 
 There neither truth, nor faith nor hope aspire 
 Longer to light man to his destiny; 
 Full many and many an age has flown. 
 So run the annals of that pile of stone. 
 Since man for solace to its pews has gone. 
 With faith in creed and tenets there; 'tis known 
 The creeds are spurned, and yet some feign belief 
 While in their conscience they but malice sheath. 
 141 
XXV 
 But there in olden time the curfew rung 
 Its calm and rythmic melody, and there 
 A-weary did the peasant kneel in prayer; 
 And there the priesthood in its glory rung 
 The heart of might, and greed and wealth, and sung 
 Te-Deum airs, kings and vassals together there 
 With woman beautiful, glorious, fair. 
 Repaired, the penitential host among. 
 To the confessional; 'twas the vica's reign; 
 And well his highness did the sceptre wield. 
 Between the mighty and the poor, the fane. 
 Then arbiter of empire, hung a shield; 
 For whoever worshipped there, great or small, 
 Lost both, his caste distinction and his thrall 
 XXVI 
 By its grace judges at their trials swore. 
 And Justice did at its behest declare, 
 "Betwixt a shadow and a shade, " the tare 
 Of Equiiy and Law, and further more 
 Tis said, its chalice, pews and altars bore 
 The majesty of fate; and glory there 
 Beamed like a diadem in beauty's hair; 
 And to humanity the wide world o'er 
 The simple tenets of the place have been, 
 So all tradition and the records tell, 
 That liberty and life is the right of man; 
 Except when some infamous fiend of hell, 
 Escaping thence, has marred the common good 
 Of our own God-created brotherhood. 
 142 
XXVII 
 And there, in that majestic pile, was taught, 
 That our Creator, the eternal God, 
 Did make us from some simple bit of sod, 
 Regarding not the clay in which he wrought. 
 Whether it was muck of chaos, or ought 
 Else that then was inanimate, 'twas clod 
 Whicn took its being from Jehovah's nod 
 And moved a living soul; in its own thought 
 The first progenitor of human kind; 
 That mother. Eve, "Creations master-piece," 
 Did from his fancy spring endowed with mind, 
 And with the glory of the world's increase 
 So charged, that all the races of the earth 
 Their lineage doth reckon from her birth. 
 XXVIII 
 Forgetting he is one of transcient things. 
 Blind to his commonage and mystic love 
 Which placed him in his order nich above 
 The worn, vain man, grown haughty, proud, now springs 
 A petty god, and, gorged with pillage, sings 
 Of his own prowess, until the fleet wing'd dove 
 Of peace flies this unhappy vale, to move 
 Henceforth and forever on restless wings. 
 Contemned by man: he who is himself the law 
 Dethrones justice, and doth the virtues spurn; 
 And that he might some humbler brother awe 
 Into his service, oft fiend-like, doth burn 
 Some fellow mortal at the stake, and by 
 Caste makes the bench, as the shrine his ally. 
 143 
XXIX 
 For, so I take it, none will dare deny. 
 That there's a cism, as well as caste in church; 
 The pew and pulpit have a sep'rate perch. 
 They like dissension, and my, my, my! 
 When it comes to a fellow man, how they do lurch 
 And on the tangent fly, squirm o'er and smirch 
 Beatitude with vile hypocricy; 
 And of self-righteousness together vie 
 In feigning love to God: yet spurn the test, 
 Which says you love not him you've never seen, 
 While spurning fellow mortals from your breast: 
 It's in the ethics of the Nazarene, 
 They come the surest to the mercy seat, 
 Who !ove the people whom they daily meet. 
 XXX 
 The passion service of our Lord no more 
 Reminds men now that He will come again, 
 Nor does it show the anguish, care and pain 
 Of Him whose sacred heart for mortals bore 
 The sin accumulations of the sore. 
 Deluded wanderers from Eden's reign, 
 Who prostitute the sacraments with vain 
 Display; they who around the altar soar 
 In fashion's garb, love not the mystic shrine; 
 They congregate and babble there, not prayer. 
 But quibs of fashion while they sip the wine. 
 And claim God's mercy, since they there repair; 
 While sitting on the altar, cheek-by-jowl. 
 Devil and parson barter human soul. 
 144 
XXXI. 
 And there hard by the old cathedral stands, 
 An edifice of grandeur with a dome; 
 Tell me what ruler, sire, made that his home; 
 What of his passions, prowess, tenures, lands; 
 What people came and went at his commands, 
 In the olden times, ere he had passed to loam? 
 Ah, youte! Your query bids my mem'ry roam 
 Across a dreary waste of shifting sands; 
 A mighty ^eople they, who tribute paid 
 The lord of yon old castle in its prime; 
 But he, as well as they, have long since laid 
 His glory by with th' annals of his time, 
 Which show that he, of old, was held to be 
 A shield for high and low, for bond and free. 
 XXXII. 
 From time immemorial, the ruler there 
 Was king, and lord and vassal too; and high 
 From his exalted state he cast the die 
 That wrecked a throne, or made a crown; still where 
 A tyrant would have murdered, he heard prayer, 
 And then he'd put the sceptre's terror by 
 And clemency, its brighter glory, try 
 On penitent souls; yet withal, the fair. 
 The mean, the low, the opulent and grand — 
 ^^ hoever stood before him, king or serf. 
 No matter which, nor what his native land, 
 His prime anatomy he held but earth. 
 With all the rank and file of human kind, 
 With him, man's fitness came from upright mind. 
 143 
XXXIII. 
 And Themis was his patron, and his reign 
 O'er all man's civic glory was sublime; 
 The soul of virtue and the ban of crime, 
 He neither winked at felony, nor feign'd 
 Friendship to vassals while he gave them pain; 
 He took them as they came, from time to time. 
 Upon the records of their manhood's prime; 
 To fix a right 'twix man and man, he fain 
 Would storm a citidel, or spurn a crown; 
 Unknown to quibbles and to factions blind. 
 Caste was a fiction he could never Ovvn; 
 The soul of equity by him defined. 
 Excluded favor, pedigree and blood. 
 As blights destructive of the public good. 
 XXXIV. 
 Because of his imperial bent of mind. 
 His erudition and his lofty poise. 
 Aversion to vain glory's pompous noise; 
 And the ease with which he did of logic find. 
 The motive of an act and hope combined; 
 Just what was sterling worth, and what alloys, 
 That filled the measure of their carnal joys. 
 Men called him siern, inexorable and blind: 
 But Justice was his name, the law his shield, 
 And, say the legends of his time and age. 
 So long as Justice did the sceptre wield. 
 Men felt no terrors of a tyrant's rage; 
 But on a fatal day for them, bold caste 
 Did Themis rape and Justice strayed outcast. 
 146 
XXXV. 
 Why further scan the annals of the vile, 
 Since riddle seems to mystify the light; 
 And often crime is reckoned to be right, 
 When innocense it plunders to defile: 
 And Youth, the prey of vanity and guile. 
 Must die and age live on: by day, by night, 
 Harrassing soul till time and wear unplight 
 The heart? Why not let weary spirit file 
 Into the vista of the years that make 
 Eternity? Why not the curtains fall, 
 Since youth is gone and whither none can break 
 Intelligence, nor ever him recall? 
 For he comes not back when he and the sage 
 Jaunt down two score years of their pilgrimags. 
 XXXVI. 
 But hear his low soliloquy you may, 
 'Far, far away, in the land of dream and hope, 
 What leisure Time did gently take; to mope 
 And play the truant seemed his wont, delay 
 His virtue was, minority a stay 
 With which he vexed wild youth, a fetter rope 
 That held captive, so ne'er a sunbeam oped 
 The morn, but Time would dally it away, 
 So it seemed; but at forty, when I fain 
 Would rest. Time flew, fleet as a beam of light; 
 Then 'twas the flight of Time did give me pain, 
 How pitiless is Time! When I gloried in flight, 
 He bade me climb; now, old, lame and blind, 
 He bids me pace it with the rushing wind. 
 147 
XXXVII. 
 "Seeking repose, 1 slept, awoke and found 
 I d fifty summers gone, gone like a dream, 
 Ah me! how brief, huw silently they teem; 
 The years at fifty, winged years, that wound 
 The pages of youth's blotted scroll and bound 
 It to inertia, whence my foe, supreme 
 Nemesis comes, chanting a doleful theme, 
 The advent of Fate, and bids me with her sound 
 The requiem of all my hopes, or fiud 
 Glory in reminiscences of things 
 That were: but now, plumeless and bare, behind 
 IVIe lie the broken pinions of Fancy's wings 
 Where memory journeys in her pensive mood 
 To sit upon the tomb of youth and brood."

TO MY GRANDMOTHER 
 ELLEN JOHNSON 
 WHOSE LIFE WAS A POEM FULL OF TENDER SYMPATHY
 AND WHOLESOME STRIVING.
Foreword
I, the poor minstrel, wandering through the maze of time, come to thy palace,
O my King the Reader, with naught save my little lyre upon which I play my feeble strain.
The Gods grant that my songs may please thee and give thee cheer and sympathy for my people.

Dream of a Whisper
I
I shall dream! — shall dream
Of a whisper soft
From the lips divine,
From the lips aloft,
From the lips of Circe.
II
And my soul awakes,
Though my eyes are closed;
Pleasure fills my veins,
As when Venus rose
Sea-nymphs laughed so softly.
III
Fair enchantress, weave,
Weave a dream for me;
Let my Hellas live
Down beside the sea —
Sea of starlit strangeness.
The All-time
I
God is in the morning,
God is in the dawning,
God is in the All-time.
II
Morning lark is singing,
Heaven's harp is ringing,
God is in the All-time.
III
Baby's cheeks are dimpling,
Baby's laugh is rippling,
God is in the All-time.
IV
Lonely maid is sighing,
For her lover dying,
God is in the All-time.
V
Autumn leaves are dancing,
In the zephyrs prancing,
God is in the All-time.
VI
God is in the infant's creeping,
God is in the old man's sleeping,
God is in the All-time.
Dunbar
I
Bring me southern cypress,
Bring me weeping willow,
Let me mourn for Dunbar —
Bard of happiness.
II
Never shall a singing,
Of old passions clinging,
Come forth as from Dunbar —
Bard of grief and woe.
III
Joys of mirth and sorrow
Have been sung in accents
From the soul of Dunbar —
Bard of everything.
Beloved
I
Fair Lucille, my love is warm
As the honey-bees that swarm
In the June-time, happy time,
In the June-time, summer's prime;
Oh, my love is sweetly rare,
Like the breeze of evening air,
And a crystal touch from thee
Brings fresh zephyrs from the sea.
II
Love may come and love may go,
Like the winter's drifting snow;
Love may wither, shrink, and die,
Like the maize in hot July;
But my soul shall cherish one
With the fervor of the sun;
And, no matter what I feel,
I shall always love Lucille.
What Mistah Robin Sais
I
In de shady wood de weathah's cool,
Down beside ole Massa Ketchum's pool;
Dah Ah sits me 'pon de mossy logs,
Talkin' wid de hoppin, buhds an' frogs,
List'nin' to dey singin' an' dey noise, —
Happy kase it brings a thousan' joys.
Mistah Robin sais, "You nevah min' —
Striped am de watahmelyon rin';
Moistens all yo' insides, froo an' froo;
So you shouldn't 'peah so down an' blue."
II
Wondah if in haiven dey's a wood?
Wondah if 'twas dah mah mammy stood
When mah po' ole daddy piked away?
Wondah if de robins sing up daih,
An' de froggies, in dey coat o' green,
Wid de fluhtin' shaddahs may be seen?
Mistah Robin sais, "You nevah min' —
Striped am de watahmelyon rin';
Moistens all yo' insides, froo an' froo;
So you shouldn't 'peah so down an' blue."
Love's Good-Night
I
Good-night! Good-night! My love, good-night!
We shall meet here again when bright
The moon shines o'er the distant hill,
And mocking-bird begins to trill.
II
What though a parent's wrath should come?
It cannot make my loving dumb;
To-morrow night I shall await
You here, at our love's trysting-gate.
III
And in the days that shall be here,
Your love my full soul shall revere;
So, till the rounded moon comes bright,
Good-night! My love, good-night! Good-night!
Swinburne
I
Weep, ye Western isle! Swinburne is dead;
Far across the vale his soul has fled
To the shadow-land, the land of rest,
Where the poets sleep on Homer's breast.
Carve the myrtle with a gleaming pen
From the quill of robin or of wren,
For the night has come upon the land, —
Oh, the night has come upon the land!
II
In the yesterdays we saw the light
At a distance in the mystic night;
In the yesterdays the Muse came down
And in fire she painted Nature's sound;
But to-day the world's dull hour is here,
While old England crowds around the bier
Of the last of all the songster tribe, —
Last unloved of all the songster tribe.
III
Angels weave a crown of evergreen,
In the land no mortal eye has seen;
And, when stars are singing in the blue,
And the downy clouds are changing hue,
These white souls will deck their brother's brow,
And in reverence their heads will bow
To the sweet-voiced singer of the West, —
Last sweet-voicéd singer of the West.
Launcelot's Defiance
My liege the King, why burns the flame of wrath
Upon thy cheek? Is it for Guinevere?
Ah, well, sweet lord, I know that she is Queen
Of Britain and of towered Camelot;
But I am king of all the mettled knights
Who sit at Arthur's board when wine is red.
No, Arthur! sheathe thy sword! Excalibir
Is naught beside the wrath of Launcelot;
For I can pierce the sun, the stars, the moon,
And fiends of Hell do crouch with limping fear
When I am clothed in dark displeasure's robes.
The right is mine and I will draw my blade
Into the breach! For Christ and Guinevere!
Uncle Isham Lies a-Dyin'
Oh, de dahk an' dreahy night am camein,
Thru de cabin do' de night am camein';
All alone yo' Uncle Isham lies,
An' de def-lights shinin' in his eyes.
Chillun done fo'sook me good an' clean;
Lef' me 'out a strip o' bacon skin;
Took all dat Ah had, an' went up nofe,
Whah dey's nuffin' 'tall to do but loaf,
While dey Uncle Isham lies a-dyin',
Po' ole Uncle Isham lies a-dyin'.
II
What! am dat yo' flittin' 'round, mah Mandy?
Flittin' 'round in robes o' white, mah Mandy?
Po' ole Isham's on his lastes' now;
Kain't go out no mo' to hoe an' plow;
Gwine to jine de hebben ban' wid you;
Gwine to be whar skies am allus blue,
An' de Rivah Johdan's flowin' free
Down to hebben's big and mighty sea;
An' de chillun lose dey monstrus meanness, —
Heahtless chillun lose dey monstrus meanness.
Gift o' Love to Me
I
I was a very lonely lad,
I was a lad without a hope;
I was a lad who fought the world,
The king, the tyrant, and the Pope.
I was a lad who had a soul,
And many thousand ills could feel, —
Until the walls of stone fell down,
And God, dear God, sent me Lucille.
II
I wandered in the darkness drear,
Along the curvéd country path;
I shuddered at each little sound,
Like man when God is in His wrath.
The years had claimed their toll of pain,
The wounds of childhood would not heal;
I would have died in Sorrow's arms, —
But God, dear God, sent me Lucille.
III
And now at eve I pray to Him,
And find His face in every star;
His tender mercy has no end,
His guiding light shines from afar.
And when the moon is full and round,
Before His presence do I kneel;
For I can read from out my heart
That God, dear God, sent me Lucille.
Waters of Forgetfulness
Waters of forgetfulness,
Waters of the River Lethe,
Bearing on thy gentle waves
Souls of those who passed beyond;
Let me drink but one small drop,
Let my sorrows pass away,
Pass away and be no more;
Let my yearning cease and die,
Like the beating of a heart
When the Angel Death has come,
Ruthless, at the chamber door.
As the Trojan, homeward bound,
Saw the light above the Styx,
So my heart is glad when morn
Has descended straight to me.
Waters of forgetfulness,
Waters of the River Lethe,
Let me drink but one small drop, —
Then shall I have joy and peace.
Kentucky Moon
I
Kentucky moon outshines my sweetheart's eye,
Lullabye, lullabye;
Kentucky moon, for you each night I sigh,
Lullabye, lullabye;
Upon my love you shed your silver stream,
When she is veiled in midnight's mystic dream;
You kiss her brow and give her peace and rest,
And ever wish our troth were amply blest;
Lullabye, lullabye.
II
Kentucky moon, for you the blue-grass grows,
Lullabye, lullabye;
Kentucky moon, for you Ohio flows,
Lullabye, lullabye;
The black man looks from out his cabin door
To where your wingéd rays forever soar,
And deep within his heart he prays that you
Might ever grace the dark and silent blue;
Lullabye, lullabye.
The Plaint of the Factory Child
I
Mother, must I work all day?
All the day? Ay, all the day?
Must my little hands be torn?
And my heart bleed, all forlorn?
I am but a child of five,
And the street is all alive
With the tops and balls and toys, —
Pretty tops and balls and toys.
II
Day in, day out, I toil — toil!
And all that I know is toil;
Never laugh as others do,
Never cry as others do,
Never see the stars at night,
Nor the golden glow of sunlight, —
And all for but a silver coin, —
Just a worthless silver coin.
III
Would that death might come to me!
That blessed death might come to me,
And lead me to waters cool,
Lying in a tranquil pool,
Up there where the angels sing,
And the ivy tendrils cling
To the land of play and song, —
Fairy land of play and song.
Death of Love
I
Where sinks deep my love, dead love,
That so warmly glowed awhile?
Where the passion of my dreams
And the kiss of afterwhile?
In the City of Delight,
In the palace built of air,
In the smile of dying Day
And the vision of Despair.
II
Not where Morning shakes the dew
From the sunshine of her locks;
Not where Evening breathes her flame
And the moon so gently rocks;
But where gleams the firefly's wing
In the swamp of dead desire;
And a fairy shrinks amazed
At the passing of the fire.
Down Upon the Palatine
I
Once there stood beside the Rhine, —
Down beside the German Rhine,
Where the vines of grapes entwine,
And the vats are full of wine, —
Uhlfrid's castle, ancient mart
Of the noble and the grand,
In the great, romantic land
That we call the Palatine.
II
There the lovers sighed and sighed,
There the nobles drunk with pride,
Fought all night and fought all day,
And ne'er deemed it aught but play;
There the troubadours with song
Charmed the merry all night long;
There the knights rescued the weak;
There the priests were low and meek, —
Down upon the Palatine.
III
Oh, were I beside the Rhine, —
Down beside the German Rhine, —
All the day in happiness
Would my soul and I be blest!
And I would dream of that fair past,
And the richly sweet contrast
Of the red against the blue,
And a moonlight night with you,
Down upon the Palatine.
Flower of the Summer Night
Flower of the summer night,
Picture of the pale moonlight,
Love of youth, eternal love,
Borne from angels up above.
Night and day I sing a song
Of thee, my pretty, rosy Dawn;
And the sorrows and the pain
Live within my soul again.
Oh, to look into thy heart,
And find there sweet Cupid's part!
Such a joy no angel knows,
In the land where Jordan flows;
But the fate of love is fate,
Come it early, come it late,
So my lyre shall sing of her
With the songs that passion stir.
Rome Is Dying
I
Rome is dying, —
Rome the Mighty! —
The sea of gold engulfs her form,
And men are buying fellow-men.
The tide of prejudice rolls on
Beyond the Tiber, dark and cold;
The prophet sees the fading light,
And shudders at the growing night.
The land is red with crying blood;
The people murmur and are hushed.
Rome is dying, —
Rome the Mighty!
II
Rome is dying, —
Rome the Mighty!
And what the sinner sows, he reaps.
Ye made our women slaves and dogs;
The serpent lash was yours to wield,
O boastful Mother of the West!
Ye nurtured strangers in the land, —
A mongrel breed of humankind;
Ye made them grind the ripened corn
To feed patricians born to scorn.
Rome is dying, —
Rome the Mighty!
III
Rome is dying, —
Rome the Mighty! —
Who used the common tyrant clay
To mold a consul with the mermaid smile.
Rome passes down to Pluto's realm
With boasts that shock old Cicero;
She lauds the painted woman form
That sits and spins the roulette wheel;
She shouts to see her Crassus rise
On the toil-stained frames of men.
Rome is dying, —
Rome the Mighty!
Ruby
I
Dream of a sapphire,
Dream of youth's empire,
In a crimson stone;
Beauty rare sparkling,
Laughter deep startling
In a silver tone.
II
Soul of a day-dream,
Soul of a sunbeam,
In its liveliness;
Soul of the dreary,
Soul of the weary,
In its loneliness.
III
Like a sweet singing
Is the clear ringing
Of her happy voice;
Full of the pleasure,
Full of the treasure
That gives life its joys.
IV
Let us be drinking
With the glass clinking
To the charming name;
Let us lose trouble
In life's sweet bubble
And fair Ruby's fame.
Where is Fame?
I
"Where is Fame?" the dreamer asked,
"Where is gilded wingéd Fame?"
"In the land of dreams and sighs,
O'er the sea of bitter woe,
Where the burnished moon is dark
And the moans are never hushed,
In the desert of Nowhere,
Where the dead men grin all night
And the ghosts of camels whine,
Down by yonder row of graves,
Ever yawning for its food
Flies my gilded wingéd Fame."
The Lover's Soliloquy
I
Love's charm belongs to every age and clime;
To every sep'rate man the burning flame
Comes once or twice or thrice, as wills the God.
In Ethiop, beneath the rose-dipped sun,
My fathers wooed their dusky paramours,
As you and I, in this, our latter day;
And where the silver-breast Euphrates lies,
A mirror for the milk-white moon to shine,
Our common parent sighed for Mother Eve.
As you and I, in this, our latter day
II
Without the passion love, no sun would glow,
No golden moon would grace the summer eve,
The golden-rod would cease to charm the eye;
The gilded rose would wither ere its day,
And all the general universe be black;
For when within thy heart thou know'st that Love
Hath wrought his miracle, thou art a God,
And all that is of earth is slave to thee.
May
Come out, you buds, that sleep!
The year's glad time is here.
Rejoice with everyone;
The rivers dance with joy.
The gleam is on the boy
Who hears the grasses sing
This song of jubilee:
"Sweet May, sweet May is here —
The lovely May is here."
Mistah Witch
Say, who's dat a-comin' now?
Mistah Witch, Mistah Witch;
Jumpin' high from bough to bough,
Mistah Witch, Mistah Witch.
Ain't you tiahed o' skeahin' me,
Mistah Witch, Mistah Witch?
Wid yo' eyes lak hellish sea,
Mistah Witch, Mistah Witch.
My Love*
I
Young gallant from the fairer race of men,
Have you a love as comely as the maid
To whom I chant my lyre-strung passion songs?
Has she large eyes that gleam from out the shade,
And voice as low as when Ohio stream
Glides silently along a summer dream?
II
Her face is golden, like the setting sun,
Her teeth as white as winter's virgin snow;
Her smile is like a gleam from Paradise,
Her laugh the sweetest music that I know;
And all the wide, wide world is but a mite,
When she, my darling elf, is in my sight.
III
Let Sorrow wring the blood from out my heart,
Let Melancholy be my daily book,
Let all the earth be like a sinner's grave,
And let my wand'ring spirit never look
Upon the kingdom, if my damozel
From out my soul the charm of love dispel.

I
Def am but a sleepin'
Def am but a creepin'
From de Shaddahlan';

II
All de dahkies shoutin',

III

Farewell to Lucille
Farewell, Lucille! Love never dies,
But lingers till the end of time.
From Homer's day, the race of bards
Sang songs of thee in dainty rhyme;
And I, the humblest of the lot,
Made thee my goddess and my muse.
Fair Helen's lips were naught to thine;
Appelles would thy face peruse,
And in a rapture fine paint thee,
The deity of art and love and grace.
But thou hast chosen from the flowers
That bloom along this garden-place;
And I am cast aside to die.
Farewell, Lucille! Farewell! Farewell!
When I Reach Manhood
I
I have never lost the crimson joy
Of communion with the things of earth.
To-day roses have the rare sweet life
Of the great celestial dream-birth;
I go down to where the river flows,
And on soft green grass I lie and talk
With the spirits of the world around;
And with merry sunbeams do I walk,
As when but a child I walked, —
The same as when but a laughing child.
II
And when years have changed my hair to white,
Roses will be sweeter far than now;
Time will never dim the mystery
Of a blossom in its summer glow.
Sympathy is quality of man
When the twilight ushers in the hour
Of the withered limb and faded eye,
And the loss of every kind of power;
Soft the world of nature drinks it all, —
Wonder-world of nature drinks it all.
And the Wound Is Not for Man to See
I
Oh, the pangs of love, the cruel love,
That at morning-time is seen to creep
Stealthily into the victim's heart!
No new-born joy it brings to me,
Nor flowers of May, nor sweet song-time,
From an empty world and a vale of naught;
And who, when the evening-time has come,
Soars to other realms, and leaves the soul
To the tears and anguish of the night, —
To the moanings of the sorrow night, —
Pierce on! I am brave and I am strong,
And the wound is not for man to see.
II
In the solitude I sit and dream
Of a night that passed into the day
When I knew the hour of joy had come
And the June-time was not far away.
She was she, and all the world was naught,
As I read the story of her gentle soul
In the eyes of gray that looked on me.
But the time has changed! Her love is cold,
Like the snows upon the heights
Of icy Switzerland, — the land of frost, —
While this bourne of life is dark and void;
And the wound is not for man to see.
III
Now at noontime, when the sun is high,
And the earth is clothed in gayety,
Ever flitting on, the butterfly,
With his wings of gaudy hue and stripes,
Sips the honey from the rosebud's lips,
And the lily-cup is his as long
As the song of flattery he sings;
But at twilight, homeward goes this swain,
And the lily drops her fairy head,
While the perfumed rosebud sighs for him
As I sigh for her who is no more;
And the wound is not for man to see.
IV
Oh, the tears that Love exacts from all!
Oh, the tears that fall and ever fall,
Would fill the seas in all the lands,
While the rogue is laughing merrily.
Oh, the hearts that lie along the shore!
Broken, torn, and bleeding handiwork
Of the God that made all perfect things;
They are remnants of the summer hour,
Of the moonlight night, and stars sublime;
They are legion, and are everywhere,
With the legend written in red blood:
"And the wound is not for man to see."
Can You Tell Me?
I
Can you tell me where my lover lies, —
Where my thrice-kissed darling lover lies?
Down in Cuba, under starlit skies,
Where the ocean zephyr softly sighs,
And the palm leaves drink the pale moonshine, —
Sleeps in shroud of blue, your dear ensign, —
Sleeps for aye and aye your fond ensign.
II
Can you tell me if my lover sighs, —
If for me my darling lover sighs?
In his dreams — his sweet death-dreams — his eyes
Wander down to where a maiden's cries
Rend the stillness of the ancient night,
And he longs to be by Cora's side, —
Longs to be by lovesick Cora's side?
The Gleeman's Melody
I
Come, my gleeman, with your melody,
Angel melody!
Weave from starlight songs of tenderness,
Songs of tenderness!
Down beneath the curvéd jasper moon,
Down beneath the sea-green ocean croon,
Drop, drop, drop your azure melody,
Azure melody!
II
From the sea there sparkles melody,
Coral melody!
Arthur's maidens stop and listen long,
Stop and listen long!
Fifty fathoms down a minstrel lies,
Fifty fathoms down they hear his cries;
"Jesu!" sing they, "'Tis a crystal melody,
Crystal melody?"
III
And the lily croons a melody,
Golden melody!
O'er the gleeman whom she loved and lost,
Ay, she loved and lost!
Fifty breakers join the ocean choir,
Fifty fairies string the minstrel's lyre;
All the world is like a living melody,
Living melody!
The Ethiopian's Song
I
Where I go the lily blooms,
Where I go the ivy climbs;
All the earth is slave to me,
All the orbs are merry chimes.
White man longs to rule the world;
I am happy where I am, —
I, the Lord of sweet content.
II
Where I go magnolias dance,
Where I go the jonquils prance;
Strength and might and power are mine,
Song and cheer my freedom's lance.
Let Ambition die her death;
I am happy where I am, —
I, the Lord of sweet content.
Down to Eldorado
I
Down to Eldorado, Love,
Eldorado, land of song,
Where the canopy of red
In the dying day is hung;
Where the chill of summer sea
Brings a joy to you and me, —
Down at fairy Eldorado.
II
Down to Eldorado, Love,
On a palfrey, white as snow;
Up a chiseled mountain steep,
On a palfrey we shall go;
And our lips the dew shall drink
On the silver river's brink, —
Down at rosy Eldorado.
III
Down to Eldorado, Love,
Where the crimson songsters sing;
From the green, green bough at noon,
Notes of crimson songsters ring,
And the land is full of joy,
Like a happy, year-old boy, —
Down at golden Eldorado.
IV
Down to Eldorado, Love,
Over steeple, over spire;
In the darkness of the night,
Hangs the moon and all its fire;
And two hearts are wildly glad,
And two hearts are wildly mad, —
Down at moonlit Eldorado.
The Mulatto's Song
I
Die, you vain but sweet desires!
Die, you living, burning fires!
I am like a prince of France, —
Like a prince whose noble sires
Have been robbed of heritage;
I am phantom derelict,
Drifting on a flaming sea.
II
Everywhere I go, I strive,
Vainly strive for greater things;
Daisies die, and stars are cold,
And canary never sings;
Where I go they mock my name,
Never grant me liberty,
Chance to breathe and chance to do.
Cora
I
Romance, who sleeps and dreams with me,
In cup of amaranth and roses, too,
Once more thou stringest melody
Conceived of cloud and heaven blue;
Once more I look into thy eyes,
Kissed by the mellow summer moon,
And wonder where my wild heart lies, —
Wild heart that now is in its noon.
II
Ah, lazy dreamer, where the stars
Go swimming in the ether deep,
And play a hundred golden bars,
The sweetest maiden lies asleep
On barge wrought from the snowy cloud;
And she is Queen, my darling Queen,
My life, my hope, my angel proud, —
The first this gloomy earth has seen.
III
Romance, didst thou conceive her form,
Her life, so young and richly sweet,
And place her where the winter storm
Would cause her tender heart to bleed?
Romance, thou simple, dolting pest,
Thou mak'st me but an idle child,
A gazer on the charming sex, —
On Cora — Cora — darling child.
Come Along
I
Come along, mah honey, come along!
Lovin' time's de time tuh sing a song;
Mistuh Moon up daih am lookin' down,

Wants tuh make de way ob lub so bright

II
Come along, mah honey, come along!

An' you am mah honey an' mah deah.
Malindy
I
De cotton flowah's bloomin' in de fiel',
De sun frum out de dahkness 'gins tuh steal;
De dahkies happy 'mong de wavin' cohn,
Lak sinnahs w'en in God at fust dey's bohn;
Mah sweet Malindy stole away frum wohk,
De dev'lish hoein' Ah begin tuh shuhk;
We's kissin' down behin' de shingle bahn,
De ways ob love we's tryin' hahd tuh lahn.
II
W'en time makes de moon ez soft an' white
Ez snow dat covahs chill Ohio's side;
W'en bleedin' roses dot de grass o' blue,
An' di'monds spahkle in de dew,
Malindy's gwine tuh waih de orange bloom,
An' mahch wid me w'en sounds de weddin' chune;
Malindy's gwine tuh be mah honey bride,
An' happy lib fohevah by mah side.
In the Evening
I
In the evening, love returns,
Like a wand'rer 'cross the sea;
In the evening, love returns
With a violet for me;
In the evening, life's a song,
And the fields are full of green;
All the stars are golden crowns,
And the eye of God is keen.
II
In the evening, sorrow dies
With the setting of the sun;
In the evening, joy begins,
When the course of mirth is done;
In the evening, kisses sweet
Droop upon the passion vine;
In the evening comes your voice:
"I am yours, and you are mine."
Dream Song
I
Let me dream a while; the day is done;
Let me drift away in Charon's barge;
Moonlight pours upon the Isle of Love;
There the pleasure fairies rove at large;
Mab and sweet Titania are there,
Oberon and Puck, that rogue of night,
Garbed in wings that dropped from butterflies,
Ere the sun began to lose its light.
II
There the poets play on golden lyres,
And the shepherds, with their oaten reeds,
Sailing down the silver stream of song,
Change to angel flight the lover's deeds;
Like a mystic panorama show,
All the world of fancy comes to night;
Like a fading panorama show,
Dances here the minstrel and the sprite.
III
All the world's a dream, but men are mists;
All this living but a fading dream;
Life is merely night to Heaven's day;
We are merely grasping for the gleam
That, when morning comes in form of Death,
Shall be shining on the distant isle,
Clothed in all the splendor of the sun, —
Clothed in all the splendor of His smile.
When I Die
I
When I die my song shall be,
Crooning of the summer breeze;
When I die my shroud shall be,
Leaves plucked from the maple trees;
On a couch as green as moss
And a bed as soft as down,
I shall sleep and dream my dream
Of a poet's laurel crown.
II
When I die my star shall drop
Singing like a nightingale;
When I die my soul shall rise,
Where the lyre strings never fail;
In the rose my blood shall lie,
In the violet the smile,
And the moonbeams thousand strong,
Past my grave each night shall file.
Mah Mammy
Mah Mammy's haid am whitah dan de snow
Dat falls so lightly on de rivah sho';
Mah Mammy's eyes am tiahed ob dis hyar life,
Dat's full ob nuffin' but dahk woe an' strife;
Mah Mammy's face an' hands am shrinkin' up,
De fiah ob trubbles dried 'em to a pulp;
But evah night she sits upon de stoop
An' offen do Ah see huh eyelids droop,
W'en Uncle Ephraim plays his banjo song,
De ebenin' froo an' all de nightime long,
Daih's teahs dats sweetah dan de sugahcane,
Daih's teahs dat falls as gently as de rain;
An' mammy sheds 'em when she heahs de chune,
Dat's softah dan de moonlight in de June;
Kase w'en ole Uncle Eph an' she war young
Dey went a spahkin' whar de holly's hung,
An' at de sunset time gay Ephraim came,
An' on his banjo praised huh honey name;
But daddy won huh heaht, an' she took him,
An' now w'en all de wohld am cold an' dim,
She laks to heah de banjo ringin' cleah,
She laks to heah de banjo song draw neah.
The Song of the Titanic Victim
I
Water black and briny for my shroud,
Pillow made of seaweed, thick and green,
Couch of coral, pearl, and oyster shell,
Fairer bed no mortal eye hath seen,
And my dirge, the wailing at the bar,
Of the loving ones I left behind,
And my sweetest memory the hour
When I heard the playing of the chimes.
II
I am dreaming all the night-time long;
I am dreaming of a summer land,
While the mermaids swim above my couch,
Singing low a song so sweet and grand,
That I fain would rue the judgment day,
When I must return to whence I came,
That I fain would lie beneath the sea,
Even after Gabriel calls my name.
Kathleen
I
Fair the bogs and hills and dales,
Fair Killarney's mossy vales,
Ochone! Ochone!
But none looks so fair, I ween,
As my dimpled sweet Kathleen,
Ochone! Ochone!
II
Ah, the wraithies sing all night
Of her eyes a shinin' bright,
Ochone! Ochone!
Mary Mother, rest her soul,
Kathleen's purer than the gold,
Ochone! Ochone!
III
Let the droonin' bagpipes play,
Tunes on this, my weddin' day,
Ochone! Ochone!
We are one this very e'en
You and I, my dear Kathleen,
Ochone! Ochone!
The Whisper of the Wind
I
The wind is whispering to the blade of grass,
"I know a land beyond the lily moon,
Beyond the sun, beyond the melting blue
Where every month is but the month of June."
II
"And like the morning star that guards the East,
Are maidens dwelling in that summer land;
Upon their cheeks Aurora's crimson blush;
Beneath their feet the ocean and the sand."
III
"'Tis there I go when evening wraps the earth
In dusky mantle, and the sun retires;
'Tis there I go and woo the maidens fair
Like minstrel playing on a thousand lyres."
IV
"O lovely are the tunes for them I croon
Unlike the harsher note I sing on earth;
And all the giddy stars above come out
And in the spell of music cease their mirth."
The Awakening of Poesy
I
'Tis a joyous day in June,
(Crimson was the midnight moon)
And the lily clothed in white
Opes her eye to dancing light,
As the muse of Nature flies
Down to gaze upon their eyes.
Modest are the daffodils
Growing on bleak Berkshire's hill;
From its cave of ice and snows,
Kissed by every wind that blows,
Leaps eternally the brook
Down into a verdant nook,
Where a youthful dryad sleeps
And the sunlight softly creeps.
Eager for the drowsy bliss
Of a fairy's passion kiss,
From the heart of every rose
Blood of wounded Beauty flows
Deep into the bowels of earth,
Giving to the world the birth
Of a spirit fine and rare,
As the goal of fragrant air.
Swifter than an idle thought
Flies this child that Nature wrought.
(What rings true in earthly name,
She and Beauty are the same)
And the heart of man is warm
When he feels the love day's charm.
Southwind croons soft lullabyes,
Where the blue-eyed pansy lies;
Pan begins to tune his pipe,
For the singing hour is ripe.
Through the world we hear his horn,
"Wake! Sweet Poesy is born,
Sweet, sweet Poesy is born."
Alone
I
The moon came out of depth
And cried, "Art thou alone?
For I can feel thy grief,
Poor earth-fed soul, unknown
To those around thy hearth;
The frost-winds moan for thee,
The salt tears fill the sea;
Thy blood is on the reef;
Thy heart is weighed with grief.
Like thee, I am Alone."
Of the Rose
I
Oh, the wine of the rose is red!
Oh, the wine of the rose is sweet!
And the heart of the rose is love; —
Love who sleeps at the poet's feet,
In the dewtime.
II
Oh, the breath of the rose is rare!
Oh, the breath of the rose is fine!
And the soul of its perfume comes
Singing sweet to this heart of mine,
In the dewtime.
III
Oh, the night of the rose is here!
Oh, the night of the rose is long!
And the garden of my love is bright
With the bloom of a passion song,
In the dewtime.
IV
Oh, the wine of the rose is red!
Oh, the wine of the rose is sweet!
And the heart of the rose is Love;
Love who sleeps at the maiden's feet,
In the dewtime.
Mammy's Honey Boy
I
Down in Dixie lan' mah boy's asleep,
Many nights foh him Ah's had mah weep.
Wildes' chile Ah's evah raised at all,
Nevah minded once his mammy's call.
Loved de sinnah's pa'f ob flowahs an' smiles,
Gibben me a thousand pains an' trials;
Yet from him Ah'd nevah, nevah paht,
Kase dat boy am all mah achin' heaht.
II
Sleep on, sleep on, precious honey boy,
Sleep on, dreamin' 'bout yo' gals so coy;
Mak' ole Dixie lan' wid laughtah ring,
Pick a banjo chime an' softly sing;
All de wohld am lak de coldes' night,
When mah wand'rin' chile am from mah sight;
Mammy's heaht foh you will allus pine,
Sleep on, sleep on, honey boy of mine.
To an Afro-American Maiden
I
Sweet the perfume of an age bygone
When the gods breathed deep in every breeze,
Walked beside the sparkle of the sea,
Made their slumber haunt within the trees;
Now no censers swing along the groves
Of the land where swarthy men were brave,
Now the gods have faded as a dream
And dim yesterday lies in her grave.
II
But within the face of one whose race
Dwells exiled throughout this western land,
Comes in fancy all the days long dead
As tho' painted by a master hand;
Rich old Ethiop and Greece are there
In the swarthy skin and dreamy eye,
And the red man of the forest grants
Raven hair and figure tow'ring high.
III
Proud America to nurture one
Who has robbed the ages of their store,
Races three within her bosom strive,
"Races three within her bosom strive,
panting for the sweets of cant and lore;"
Panting for the sweets of cant and lore;
All the world romantic lives in her
With the minstrels and the knights of mail
And the nymphs that dance within the shade,
Journeymen within the dreaming pale.
The Burden Bearer
I
When the owl sits in the tree,
And from out the vapor moon
Quietly descends the night,
Bringing sleep for earthly boon,
I am restless like the leaves
In the tide of summer breeze;
And beside a dream-lulled stream
Long I chant my heart strung pleas.
II
I am lonely through the years
Like a shadow in the vale;
Never dryad's hand touched mine,
Gently soothing anguish wail;
In the gloom where howl the wolves
Long I lie enwrapped in gray;
And my eyes that drip with tears
Gently to my Maker pray.
Richard Byron
I
Brave soul, who through music's maddened charm
Made thy world another Paradise,
Let the boasting seraphs round the Throne,
Whilst thy spirit comes to them arise;
For thy lyre the sweetest viol song,
Though on earth as silent as the tomb,
Shall enflame the heavens with its fire
Till the hour that all must hear their doom.
II
Death is sweet reward for him whose toil
Makes a better home for fellow men,
Rest and peace, and crown of honey rose,
Shall the Master to His minstrel send;
And the tune of birds, his hour's delight
In the land where Night is but a name,
And the couch where Pan has gone to dream,
Shall receive at dew his weary frame.
III
We who dwell awhile within this vale,
Hopeless subject to the pangs of pain,
Long to be with thee in Avalon,
Where the life of man is not a chain;
Where the wine is poured from lily cup
And the song of June is always June;
Where the hours are golden like the flame,
Glowing in the crescent of the moon.
Abendlied
I
When the soul goes wand'ring in the night
On a moonbeam from the shrouded sky,
And the body rests beneath the light
Of the stars that in the morning die,
When dewdrop falls 'pon the pressed eyelid,
Sweet is every joy the nightime knows.;
And the worries of the day are hid
Where firefly mysteriously glows.
II
When the soul goes wand'ring in the night
Day descends into the silent stream;
From the throne of God the pale moonlight
Shines above as does a joyous gleam;
Spirits of departed hover near
Bringing peace and calm to aching heart;
Spirits of departed hover near,
Singing low a song of ghostly art.
Mine Rachel
I
Mine Rachel iss der Ghetto rose,
Hor lofe for me nobody knows,
Just like I do at Sabbath time,
When I am chanting psalms sublime.
She weaves a praying shawl for me,
And pours me once mine Shabbos tea,
Dot Rachel von Guttenheim.
II
She call dot pratin' Isidore
Just once a worthless schemin' bore;
She never trade at Cohen's place,
Although he sell der cheapest lace.
And when last night I asked her why,
I see der lovelight in der eye,
Of Rachel von Guttenheim.
III
So bring a flask of Yiddish wine,
And all der Kosher meat o' mine,
For once I think I spend a lot,
So happy 'cause a prize I got.
No Gentile ever knew a maid,
Dot put der others in der shade,
Like Rachel von Guttenheim.
Illion
I
I stood at Illion, and looked upon the world,
Beneath me rolled the ocean of my great desire,
The yesterdays that drift into a wasted mist,
And future hours that make my soul a living fire;
The love that once was mine descends into a vale,
Wherein the angels, man, and devil, never trod
(So long I laugh! So long I laugh! So long I laugh!
That Jesus smiles, and Mary weeps, and I know God).
II
Because I loved too well, from Heaven's august Throne
An angel brought the key of nature's mystery;
Unlocked the beauty of a smiling April morn,
Wherein is writ a woman's tragic history,
And led me where stars change to violets,
And sunlight pours into the daisy's gleaming eye,
Until I slept where moonlight drifts into the snow,
Where love is young, and clean-souled men can never die.
III
From out the depths of Illion a woman rose;
Her garments swept the dawn, her hair outgleamed the sun,
Her eyes were living coals, the testament of God,
For God is love, and love is God, and Eve their nun;
Within her breast the longing of the age I saw
And clasped her! Clasped her! Clasped her hard and clasped her long,
And kissed her once, and kissed her twice, and kissed her thrice,
And looking in her eyes I sang an endless song.
My Mother
I
She is the golden dream that never dies,
The unrestrainéd summer of my days;
Her arms have crooned my wond'ring eyes to rest,
When night-breeze round the murmuring river plays;
Her hand has guided me where paths are rough,
And storms conspire to turn my steps astray;
Her soul has ever played the mirror's part
And showed me good there lies in human clay.
II
I never know the night when she is near,
Nor tremble at the turning of the tide;
Her name brings music from a thousand lyres,
And draws from secret depths my buried pride;
I love her as the brook the river loves,
The springtime bud the sap of April moon;
I love her with a love that never dies,
On eve of snow or breath of rosy June.
III
Her hair is not a golden shade nor brown,
Her cheeks are not the flush of summer rose,
But she is statelier than all the queens
Whose splendor in Gallician garden glows;
My Mother o' the dusk, through thee anon
My God has taught me love for all my race;
And never shall the crowning glory dim
Of those who wear the image of thy face.
When I Speak of Jamie
I
When I speak o' Jamie, sunny lass,
A' the bonny bluebells nod their heads,
Clover dances long th' Highland pass,
Water lilies rise from out their beds;
She is a' the world from Glasgow town
To whaur lies me mither's heather down.
II
When I speak o' Jamie, sunny lass,
Storms that blaw and blaw they gang awa',
Know they waul her meltin' smile will last
Gin you know her you will die for her,
Ay, will lay you doon and die for her.
The Wanderer
I
I have wandered through the maze of Time,
Through the Valley of the shadow Death,
I have heard the song of nightingale,
And my cheek has felt the rosebud's breath.
II
I have drunk the dew from lily cup,
And have sailed my barge o'er heaven's blue,
But it seems no matter where I go,
I can live with none, my dear, but you.
Let Us Go Away
Let us go away,
You and I,
On a crimson ray,
From the sky.
Let us feel the blue
Soft and clear,
And the golden hue,
Be so near.
For the morn is fair
Where stars lie,
Let us two go there,
You and I.
To the Queen 'o the May
To thee, O Queen, the choice of lovely May,
To thee, the sovereign of the ripened spring,
I bring a coronet of daffodils;
A coronet of lilies white as snow,
That hands as soft as purest ermine fur,
Wove while the graces danced and sang
Upon the cloud-tipped peaks of Iduma;
And at the gentle May's request I beg
To place upon thy head this lordly crown
And cry with all the world, Long live the Queen!
B.B.
In my sorrows, in my joys,
In my evening, in my morn,
Beulah shall be like the star
That outvied the vaunting moon.
And my weary soul shall drink
Succor! — Succor from her eyes, —
Eyes that tell a strange old tale;
And my arms shall hold her form, —
Delicate as some sweet nymph,
Strayed from out her woodland home.
And when Wyrd shall mold to ash
This poor shell in which I dwell,
We shall rest, one dust in one.
The Vision of Lazarus
Come from the window, Mary, He has gone,
The night is here, and I would tell my tale
Of wondrous sights I saw among the dead,
And music sweeter than the minstrel song,
Of creatures fairer than the noonday sun,
And land where sorrow fades as in a dream.
For I was stretched upon a slab of stone
And laid by thee within a vault of rock,
I never saw thy robes of sombre ash
For I had gone upon the pilgrimage
Of Death, the last long pilgrimage called death.
It was a journey o'er the Milky Way,
Far past the golden stars that shine at night,
And o'er a mystic stream, whose waters black
Lay slumb'ring in a realm of sunless day,
I glided as a dove who bears sweet words
To some coy maiden by the Galilee,
Until I stood a thousand thousand leagues,
Above the crimson-tinted clouds that drift
As Cleopatra's barge a-down the Nile,
And there I saw a youth unlike the men of earth,
All clothed in robes as flimsy as the gauze
That separates the day from eventide.
Whose eye was like the nodding violet
When April weeps upon a grassy slope;
Whose voice came ever soft and low and sweet
As when the wind sings me a plaintive song.
"Good Lazarus, I am that Israfel
Who makes the realm of paradise to ring
With melody so wild and clear, the night
And all the stars that light the universe
Glide forth to hear the music of my lute.
To thee I come from Him whose majesty
The thunder and the waterfall have caught
To shew thee all the sights that men may see
When earthly life has run its merry course;
For thou art he who dreamed sweet dreams
Beside the Galilee while others toiled
Athwart the wheel or in the field of corn.
And worthy shalt thou be of Israfel,
And worthy Israfel of thee, my friend."
Thus spake the man of wondrous countenance
And took me by the hand and led me on
To where the gates of gold like Pyrrhan plate
Shine in the splendour of the mystic light;
I heard a chord so grand the thunderstorm
Whose music wakes the slumb'ring souls of men
To it was like the faintest ecstasy,
"My choir is chanting praise to God the King,"
Said Israfel, and thus the angels sang: —
LAUS JEHOVA
I
Sing to him, ye hosts of Paradise,
Great Jehova rules triumphant now,
Through the works of Lord Emmanuel,
All the erring sons of Adam bow;
When in sylvan vales His name is heard,
Cedar bends in willing suppliance,
Night-breeze croons His praise to all the trees
To the river and the running sands.
II
Sing to Him, ye hosts of Paradise,
He has chained the lightning and the fire,
He has calmed the spectre of the sea,
He has lifted man from out the mire;
Vaunting Pharaoh is prostrate now,
Jezebel lies reeking in her gore,
All the hearts of men through love and truth
Upward to His Judgment Seat must soar.
Like weird enchantment from the Chaldee's brain
Swung ope the portals, and a perfume sweet
From garden where the Tigris winds her course,
Enthralled my senses as a man of craft
Beholds a lovely maiden, fit to serve
In Caesar's palace, and with subtlety
Makes her his slave, a piece of chattel flesh.
It was a place so fair that Lebanon,
Whose cedars Venus planted long ago,
Has in her heart an envy of that land;
And Dawn, before her master's chariot
When Love describes the Vale of Paradise
Tints deep her olive cheek with crimson blush
(If ever death takes me from thee again
May I be there with Israfel and God).
High climbs the vines with grapes so deeply red
The harvest moon pales in comparison,
And wine, in Which the spirit Youth was born,
Flows freely down to where the angels quaff;
A river clearer than the crystal ray
Reposes near a bed of hyacinth,
And there on couch with coverlet of rose
Our master singers rest from earthly toil,
And coronets of laurel press their brows, —
The chief reward for pain and suffering;
The singing birds beguile their hours with song,
The lilies spring unbidden 'neath their feet,
The breezes croon to them a melody.
And Pain, which once was deemed their festive guest,
Lies panting far away, too weak to know
The triumphs and the joys the minstrels have.
Among this group reclined an aged man,
His hair and beard as white as virgin snow;
His eyes, which never saw great nature's realm,
Like eager maiden on her wedding day, —
Awaiting anxiously the coming of her swain, —
Grasped fervently the beauty earth denied.
"'Tis Father Homer; he who sang of Troy,
Of Troy, the land of fable and of song,"
Said Israfel, and to the aged spoke,
"O Father! here is one, sweet Lazarus
Who sings beside the banks of Galilee.
He gave the Son of Man a crust of bread,
A cup to drink, a place to lay his head,
And now that Death has ta'en him from below,
God grants that he may look on Paradise."
The Grecian master smiled, and clasped my hand,
"To thee, my son, I bid a welcome sweet,
And offer thee a bowl of ruddy wine,
Such nectar none but mighty poets drink.
And I who sang the fall of Ilium,
The wrath and vengeance great Achilles wrought,
Wouldst hear a word about the King of Kings.
Mayhap his feet are sore and travel bruised,
And Hunger with his tooth is gnawing him,
And all the earth rejects his teachings now
That in the years to come will call Him God."
Ah, willingly I quaffed that cup of wine
And told how Jesus comes to Bethany,
And how he preaches here about the love
That shall restore the throne of Israel.
"To us who sing," our Father Homer said,
"The gates are ope, though Christ be yet on earth,
This is Elysium, the poets' couch,
And every one who feels the lyric strain
Has caught the fire of God and lives anew,
Though he strew flowers before grim Ashtoreth.
Now, when I learned the mystery of God
I wept because no Hector greeted me,
No crafty-tongued Ulysses waited here,
No Hebe poured for me a nectar cup,
And high Olympus with her crown of snow
And mighty deities in Council state
Were vanished like the stars at morning time.
A purer heaven thrived than that of Greece,
And those who leapt into a demigod
When hot imagination seized my brain
Were like the mist that droops o'er Ida's mount,
Mere vapor rising from an idle dream.
My Aphrodite never looked so fair
As Israfel when chanting praise to God;
Great Juno's wrath was naught to Gabriel's voice
When giving message from Jehovah's seat
To wayward clay that lords his fellowmen,
Parnassus where the Muses played and danced.
Descended to the humblest garden spot
That flourishes in soft Illyria
When first I gazed upon the cypress grove
Where dwells sweet Israfel and all his choir.
O Lazarus, no wand'ring minstrel's brain
Could bring from fancy such a chimera,
No musing bard, whose eyes were dim with time
Could dream of such a land as Paradise."
The old man smiled as when a summer morn
Breaks gently through a gossamer of cloud
And all the cedar and the cypress trees
Their willing branches bent when he was done.
Another sate near him, whose harp of gold
Had sounded in the tents of Israel,
His robes were woven from the cloth of Tyre
And golden sandals bound his olive feet
"I am that David, he whose psalms ye sing
When sounds the cymbral in the plains of Gad.
My garments, washed of every crimson stain,
I am a wearer of the laurel wreath,
My heart as free as when in Bethlehem
I caused the blades of grass to dance with glee;
My soul each eventide goes forth with God,
A humble servant to His mystic will;
And in the morning do I wander wide,
Along the cool of every haunt and vale.
There lies a still brook deep in Heaven's land
Where milk-white sheep may stray and quench their thirst,
And there I nurse my memories of one
I wooed when in the house of lordly Saul.
A virgin like the rose when glides the wind
From out the Southland in the old year's noon."
And then a handsome man whose garments fell
Across his shoulders like a maiden coy
Whose wrists wore bracelets made of burning gold.
Spake, "I am Solomon, who once was king."
I kissed the crystal hand he held to me,
And from my heart there leapt a song of praise,
"O sweetest singer in the land of Jude,
The aloes and the pomegranates long
For thee, and nightbreeze sighs when falls the dew
Upon thy sepulchre by Jordan's stream
The pensive maid beside the garden wall
Lists eagerly to reading of thy Song.
For first was thou to chant the joys of love,
The dew of passion kiss upon the lips,
The heaving of the soul within the breast,
The bed of leaves beside dark Kedar's tent."
And then I bade the singing ones farewell,
"Oh, come again, sweet Lazarus," cried they,
"And fair and soft and cool thy rest shalt be,
Thy food and fare the sweetest honeycomb,
Thy drink, the wine distilled from beams of moon,"
From thence good Israfel and I fared forth
To where the stream of life sleeps in a wood
Beneath the glory of the throne of God;
And when I gazed upon the crystal sheet
Lo! like the quick phantasma of a dream.
The future danced before my wond'ring eyes,
I saw the Master nailed upon the cross,
The price the world must pay for holiness.
I felt a faith so new and strange the veil
Was torn asunder, and the pillars fell.
"Nay, shudder not," said Israfel, "'Tis writ
The Lamb of God must die to save the world."
Methought I fell a thousand thousand miles
Beneath the all-consuming fire of earth
Into a region void of light and peace,
Where Conscience broods with lash of scorpion
And raven shrieks the nameless deeds of men;
Where souls lie bare upon a mossy rock
And impish creatures prod their backs with prongs;
Where nothing comes into the anxious ear
Save moanings of the spirits Conscience lashed.
'Twas then the pallor came upon me thick
And to my angel friend I cried, "Sweet one,
This mystery is pricking ope my wounds,
Let me ascend to where the air comes forth
As goodly as the lily in the spring."
From out a cave I heard a trembling voice,
"Good Lazarus, art thou among the damned,
The wretched and the curséd seed of man?
Or art thou come to cool the parching tongue
Of him who once was King of Macedon,
Great Alexander, one whose name was law
From sunny isle in Greece to farthest Ind.
The pampered idol of a subdued world.
Between the flowing of a bowl of wine
And fever of a woman's honeyed kiss
Came I into this world of gloom and pain.
Far better death upon a bloody spear
Than such an end to earthly strife and woe.
Far better Poverty should gnaw the bone
Than dwell in anguish here and deep despair.
Go forth, sweet soul, to where the sunlight pours
And seek the one who knows Elysium,
For he will lead thee to where the fields are green
And founts of water cool the burning tongue."
(Quick from a crater red with belching fire
A hornéd form bestrided upper Hell;
His eye was dark and pierced me like a bolt
Of lightning in an angry summer storm;
Like thunder in the cave of Sinai
He roared and all the depths of Sheol shook.
"Thou, Israfel, who spoiled my chance to rule,
When I rebelled against Jehovah's throne
Thou traitor knave, thou fawning piece of air,
Thou whining dog whose music is thy bite;
Wouldst thou presume to walk this realm of mine
With one who housed and fed the Son of God?
'Tis mine, this piece of clay thou bringest here;
'Tis mine by primal right bestowed through Eve.
No golden Eden nor bright Paradise
For any sprung from sinful Adam's loins,
And I proclaim that he shall not escape
Though all the force of God oppose my aim!"
The angel trembled not, but stood his ground.
"Base spirit, ruler of the evil heart,
The destiny of Lazarus is where
The soul of Beauty is a god indeed;
Too base for intellect akin to His
The Godhead deems the home of Lucifer,
We merely come to gaze upon thy work
To pass away eternal idle hours.
But if thou dreamest that this poet's soul
Belongs to thee with all thy torturing
Then Israfel will wage a war with thee
Until the pillars of the universe
Go tumbling down into the Lake Chaos."
Then Satan stooped and swung a mighty stone,
So huge the fabled Cyclop was mere mite,
Mere mite, and swaying, plunged it toward Israfel,
Who, quicker than the breeze outstrips the stream,
Avoided it, and smiled to see it fall
So gently to the ground before his feet,
A better weapon had this singing soul
The mystery and sweetness of his voice,
Which loosened charms the roaring elements,
He sang a song so weird and strange and grand,
The devil cowered, wond'ring at the spell.
And thus a seeming age they fought o'er me
Who crouched behind a boulder, weak with fear
And neither fiend nor angel won the day,
Tho' Satan stood upon the prostrate form
Of Israfel, and raised his burning sword;
And then methought the vision died away
Into the light of glorious daytime.
And Satan blinded by the angel spell
Seized me, and tore to shreds my holiness.
Poor Israfel when this he saw wept loud
But God above had turned His willing ear;
I heard the Master's voice like thunder roll,
Into my dreaming, "Lazarus, come forth."
Afterword.
And now my chord is silent. The night has come upon the land, and I fain would rest. Perhaps I have pleased thee, perhaps I have not. There are many minstrels, O my King the Reader, and I am the humblest in all thy realm. May our parting be Auf Wiedersehen!
THE SINGER.

COMMENTS
I like your book very much, especially the poem Drifting. There is a high spiritual tone about it that is bound to please. "Voices" pleases me also.
Your book should be an inspiration to the women of our race, do not hesitate to quote whatever you may wish from what I say.
Sincerely yours,
PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR.
July, 1904.
The lines in the poem, "A Tribute to Paul Laurence Dunbar," have much merit in them. I think your command of English in prose is quite remarkable.
Sincerely yours,
ELLA WHEELER WILCOX.
INTRODUCTION
I have stood on the shore, and watched the waters surging land-ward, then receding ever in alternate motion. I have seen driftwood strewn along the sand, cast up by the restless waves.
I have heard the merry shouts of children, as they gathered, one by one, bits, for the driftwood fire which has warmed and cheered the lowly dwellings, scattered along shore, or perchance its gleaming blaze shining far out into the night has led some lone traveller to his home.
I have thought how oft these bits of driftwood are but the poor misshapen remnant of some bark wrecked on its homeward course and still the driftwood fire burns bright and still its warmth and glow cheers up Earth's dreary places.
These verses are but bits of driftwood cast up by the landward-surging and receding waters of adversity and prosperity, and the author has gathered them with the fond hope that some light shall gleam from these pages far out into the night of human perplexities, and brighten up the homeward way of some discouraged traveller.
OLIVIA WARD BUSH.
Driftwood 
Sung by the strand to the music of the wave.
MORNING
Bright glows the morn, I pace the shining sands,
And watch the children, as with eager hands
They gather driftwood for the evening fire.
Their merry laughter, ringing loud and clear,
Resounds like sweetest music to my ear,
As swift they toil, each with the same desire.
And now their task completed, they depart,
Each one with beaming face and happy heart,
They too, will watch the driftwood fire to-night,
And knowing this, they hasten glad and gay,
With willing feet, along the homeward way,
Their precious burdens bearing with delight.
I watch these little children of the poor,
Till they have reached each lowly dwelling's door,
And then, I too my footsteps homeward turn;
I fancy what a joyous sight 'twill be,
To see the children sitting in their glee,
Close by the fire and laugh to see it burn.
EVENING
From out my open window, I can see
The rolling waves, as fierce and restlessly,
They dash against the long, long stretch of shore,
And in the distance, I can dimly trace,
Some out-bound vessel having left her place
Of Harbor, to return perhaps no more.
Within my mind there dwells this lingering thought,
How oft from ill the greatest good is wrought,
Perhaps some shattered wreck along the strand,
Will help to make the fire burn more bright,
And for some weary traveller to-night,
'Twill serve the purpose of a guiding hand.
Ah yes, and thus it is with these our lives,
Some poor misshapen remnant still survives,
Of what was once a fair and beauteous form,
And yet some dwelling may be made more bright,
Some one afar may catch a gleam of light,
After the fury of the blighting storm.
DRIFTING
And now the sun in tinted splendor sank,
   The west was all aglow with crimson light;
The bay seemed like a sheet of burnished gold,
   Its waters glistened with such radiance bright.
At anchor lay the yachts with snow-white sails,
   Outlined against the glowing, rose-hued sky;
No ripple stirred the waters' calm repose
   Save when a tiny craft sped lightly by.
Our boat was drifting slowly, gently round,
   To rest secure till evening shadows fell;
No sound disturbed the stillness of the air,
   Save the soft chiming of the vesper bell.
Yes, drifting, drifting; and I thought that life,
   When nearing death, is like the sunset sky:
And death is but the slow, sure drifting in,
   To rest far more securely, by and by.
Then let me drift along the Bay of time,
   Till my last sun shall set in glowing light;
Let me cast anchor where no shadows fall,
   Full safely moored within Heaven's harbor bright.
Newport, June 12, 1898.
Bits
Fancies
Mid parted clouds, all silver-edged,
   A gleam of fiery gold,
A dash of crimson-varied hues,
   The Sunset Story's told.
A mirrored lake 'tween mossy banks,
   A lofty mountain ridge,
A cottage nestling in the vale
   Seen from a ruined bridge.
A woman longing to discern
   Beyond the gleam of gold
A rush of memory, a sigh,
   And Life's strange tale is told.
Regret
I said a thoughtless word one day,
A loved one heard and went away;
I cried: "Forgive me, I was blind;
I would not wound or be unkind."
I waited long, but all in vain,
To win my loved one back again.
Too late, alas! to weep and pray,
Death came; my loved one passed away.
Then, what a bitter fate was mine!
No language could my grief define;
Ah! deep regret could not unsay
The thoughtless word I spoke that day.
At Sunset
I stood in the doorway at evening,
   And I looked to the hills far away
Where the sun's last rays seemed to linger,
   Ere they faded in brilliant display.
Yes, lingered in beautiful splendor,
   And the scene was rare to behold,
A pale blue sky was its back-ground,
   With stretches of pink and gold.
What wonder that Nature's rare beauty
   So inspires the soul and thrills
Our beings with tender emotions,
   As we look far away to the hills!
To the "hills" of which "David" has spoken,
   "From whence comes my help," said he,
And we have the same blest assurance,
   As we gaze on their majesty.
And we think of the Power who formed them,
   They seem like a tower of defence
To protect and to ward off the evil
   Until we depart and go hence;
Where the sunlight fades not, but lingers,
   And to-night my waiting soul thrills
As I stand in the doorway at sunset,
   As I look far away to the hills.
Misjudged
Beneath Misfortune's dark and heavy cloud,
My heart sore wounded, unsubmissive bowed,
Hope after hope within me paled and died,
Until indifference and sullen pride
Usurped my nature's usual warmth and glow
And made Ambition's fire burn dim and low;
And then the world, in worldly wisdom said,
T'were better far that such a life be dead,
Than living thus, so selfish cold and drear,
Ambitionless, devoid of warmth and cheer.
And yet this comfort still remained for me;
The Finite differs from Infinity,
God understands, so I indeed am blest,
He knows it all, and knowing, judges best.
Overlooked
I turned the pages of my book,
With nervous haste and heedless care,
I searched impatiently to find
Some favorite verses written there.
At last upon the book's first page
I found the lines for which I sought,
But in my haste, had overlooked
And suddenly there came this thought,
How oft for some much-needed thing
We ask the Father o'er and o'er,
When, Lo! by simple faith and trust
We find the blessing at our door.
Inspiration
Within my soul, like flames of living fire,
I feel the burning heat of strong desire
And, speeding like full many an arrow's dart,
Thought after thought swift courses through my heart,
I seize my pen with eager fond delight,
Breathe on, sweet Muse of song, that I may write.
Voices
I stand upon the haunted plain
   Of vanished day and year,
And ever o'er its gloomy waste
   Some strange, sad voice I hear.
Some voice from out the shadowed Past;
   And one I call Regret,
And one I know is Misspent Hours,
   Whose memory lingers yet.
Then Failure speaks in bitter tones,
   And Grief, with all its woes;
Remorse, whose deep and cruel stings
   My painful thoughts disclose.
Thus do these voices speak to me,
   And flit like shadows past;
My spirit falters in despair,
   And tears flow thick and fast.
But when, within the wide domain
   Of Future Day and Year
I stand, and o'er its sunlit Plain
   A sweeter word I hear,
Which bids me leave the darkened Past
   And crush its memory,--
I'll hasten to obey the Voice
   Of Opportunity.
The Tide Surges
Heart-Throbs
We suffer and ye know it not,
   Nor yet can ever know,
What depth of bitterness is ours,
   Or why we suffer so;--
If we would know what anguish la,
   Ask of the dark-skinneo race,
Ay! ask of him who loves to onow
   The color of his face.
Then plead as he has often pled
   For manhood among men,
And feel the pain of rights denied;
   Thou canst not know till then.
Or share with him for one brief space,
   Ambition's fond desire,
Reach out, and strive, as he has striven,
   And aim for something higher.
Let knowledge cultivate, refine,
   Let culture feed the mind,
Then fondly dream of hopes fulfilled,
   And dreaming wake to find;--
That merit worth or patient toil
   Does not suffice to win.
Then learn the cause of this defeat,
   The color of the skin.
The mother of the dusky babe,
   Surveys with aching heart
Bright prospects, knowing all the while,
   Her off-spring shares no part.
The child attains to manhood's years,
   Still conscious of the same,
While others boast of Life's success,
   He knows it but in name.
Yes, aim, reach out, aspire and strive
   And know, "Twere all in vain,
And e'en in Freedom's name appeal,
   Then ye can sense our pain.
We suffer and ye know it not,
   Nor yet can ever know,
What depth of bitterness is ours,
   Or why we suffer so.
The Nation's Evil
A sound is heard throughout our land,
   A moaning, yearning, pleading cry;
"O mighty Arm of Right stretch forth,
   Crush out our hopeless misery.
I see a weary dark-skinned race
   Bend low beneath Oppression's weight,
I hear their off-spring wailing out,
   O, "Save us from our father's fate!"
I see a fierce, blood-thirsty mob,
   Add torture to a quivering frame.
I hear an agonizing cry
   Hushed by the cruel fiery flame.
I see the home left desolate,
   I see a father forced to die,
I hear a mother's anguished groan,
   I hear their children's piteous cry.
How long I ask shall these things be?
   How long shall men have hearts of stone?
My soul grown sick and faint within,
   Cries out in supplicating tone,
"Great God, send forth thy swift demand,
   Declare this evil shall not be,
That man give justice unto man,
   And cease this inhumanity."
Lights Along Shore
Abraham Lincoln
Like some gigantic, lofty forest tree,
   Shorn of its leafy garment in the storm,
With roots secure deep-fastened in the earth,
   Where naught can rob it of its noble form,
So stood this man, strong in his sense of right,
   Who faltered not, whose courage never failed,
Within the Nation's heart, his image stands
   For aye;--because o'er Wrong he had prevailed.
More than a friend, or brother, then was he,
   In very truth, a Martyr for the Cause,
Unflinching in his zeal-opposing wrong,
   Defending bravely God's own Righteous laws.
For, out of hard almost unyielding rock,
   Did he not hew a passage for our way?
Did he not cause the darkness to disperse,
   Did we not see the dawning of the day?
   Live ever in our memories, great soul.
   Tho' passed beyond the pale of human sense,
Thy work well done, hath found its just reward,
   Divine approval is thy recompense.
Federic Douglass
[Edtior's note: Above is the name as printed. His name was spelled Frederick Douglass] 
We would render fitting tribute,
   We would add to thy great fame,
We would crown thee with due honor
   And immortalize thy name.
Till Life's evening closed around thee,
   Thy great love remained the same,
Then from out the Land of Spirits
   Silently the summons came.
In the greatness of thy manhood,
   We can see thee even now,
Stamped upon our hearts thy image,
   Silver hair and noble brow.
"Grand old Statesman," Thou wast loyal
   To thy country and her cause,
By the right of such devotion,
   Thou hast won our just applause.
Orator of noblest order,
   Thine the power to declare,
Thrilling Theme, in tones portraying,
   Eloquence, divinely rare.
Once, in pleading for thy people,
   Who had suffered grevious wrong,
Words like these, intense with feeling
   Fell upon the list'ning throng.
"Judge us not, O! favored races,
   From the lofty heights of fame,
Rather measure our progression,
   By the depths from whence we came.
Telling words, O, Great Defender,
   Of a cause so dear to thee,
Not alone, thy love revealing
   But thy heart's deep loyalty.
Broad and liberal was thy judgment,
   One aim thine Equality
Caring not for creed or color,
   Man was man alike to thee.
If beyond this mortal striving,
   Man may reach a higher plain,
Thou wilt see Life's aim completed,
   And to greatest heights attain.
Carney, The Brave Standard Bearer
'Twas a time of fiercest conflict,
   Enmity and awful woe,
'Twist the North, the friend of Freedom,
   And the South, its bitter foe.
Day by day, the roar of battle
   Sounded forth its deathlike knell,
Day by day the best and bravest
   Died, amid the shot and shell.
Foremost in the ranks of warriors,
   Our black heroes took their place,
With the lines of fearless courage,
   Stamped upon each dusky face.
We recall with pride, the story
   Of the gallant Fifty-fourth,
Fighting on the field at Wagner,
   With the brave ones of the North.
There the dauntless William Carney,
   In the Union's sacred name,
Held aloft the flying colors,
   Won a never-dying fame.
He was first to plant the standard,
   On the fort he raised it high,
And he watched the floating banner,
   With a patriot's jealous eye.
Mid retreat and dire confusion,
   Oh! not once did he forget;
But he snatched the royal emblem
   From the lofty parapet.
On his knees he bravely followed,
   With one hand pressed to his side,
While the other, held the colors,
   Borne with patriotic pride.
What a cheer went up for Carney,
   As he held the colors high,
While a soldier's admiration,
   Beamed in every comrade's eye.
"Boys! I have but done my duty,"
   Carney said to those around,
"I have brought the old flag safely,
   And it never touched the ground."
'Twas a deed both brave and noble,
   And the loyal patriot's name,
Lives to-day and will forever,
   In our memories remain.
We can ne'er forget this hero,
   Or the gallant Fifty-Fourth,
Fighting on the field at Wagner,
   With the brave ones of the North.
Unchained 
1863
O'er the land, a hush had fallen,
   Hearts Thrilled expectantly,
Till from twice two million voices,
   Rang the glad cry, "We are free!"
Then the whole world caught the echo,
   "We are free! Yes! We are free!"
What a dawning from the midnight!
   What a day of jubilee!
Twas the New Year's song of triumph,
   That they sang so joyously,
Till it echoed and re-echoed
   "We are free! Yes! We are free!"
From the voice of one brave woman,
   Who, in human sympathy,
With a pen of love and pity
   Wrote the wrongs of slavery,
Came the glad new cry of triumph,
   "They are free! Yes! They are free!"
And the freedmen, still rejoicing,
   Sang of John Brown's victory,
Sang of Lincoln's Proclamation,
   Saying, "These have made us free."
Sumner, Garrison, and Phillips,
   All too fought to make us free.
Then the joyous song grew louder,
   By that price of loyalty,
Paid by us with our best lifeblood,
   We attest that we are free!
On the battle-field with honor,
   Our own blood has made us free."
Free indeed, but free to struggle,
   Free to toil unceasingly,
Naught of wealth, naught of possession,
   Was their portion, e'en tho' free;
But they faltered not, they failed not,
   Saying ever, "We are free!"
For their rightful place contending,
   They foresaw their destiny,
And they pleaded, never ceasing,
   "Give us opportunity!"
"Give us justice, recognition,
   'Tis our right! for we are free!"
From the lips of Frederic Douglass,
   Came these words of loyalty,
"Judge not harshly these my people,
   This is but their infancy,
From the depths they have ascended,
   Give them rights, for they are free!"
After years of ceaseless striving,
   Struggling for the mastery,
Over self and ill conditions,
   Still they're singing, "We are free!"
By the virtue of our struggle,
   We shall reap our destiny.
Though we suffer, in our freedom,
   By the hand of cruelty,
In the lawlessness of Evil,
   God is just, and we are free;
Life and love, not woe or slaughter,
   Are the birthright of the free.
When by prejudice untrammeled,
   Rich in manly liberty,
We receive that recognition
   Rightly given to the free,
Then the whole world shall proclaim it,
   "Free indeed! Yes! Ye are free!"
A Hero of San Juan Hill
Among the sick and wounded ones,
   This stricken soldier-boy lay
With glassy eye and shortened breath,
   His life seemed slipping fast away.
My heart grew faint to see him thus,
   His dark brown face so full of pain,
I wondered if the mother's eyes
   Were looking for her boy in vain.
I bent to catch his feeble words;
   "I am so ill, and far from home,
I feel so strange and lonely here,
   You seem a friend, I'm glad you've come."
"I want to tell you how our boys
   Went charging on the enemy,
'Twas when we climbed up San Juan's Hill
   And there we got the victory."
"The Spaniards poured a heavy fire,
   We met it with a right good-will,
We saw the 71st fall back,
   And then our boys went up the hill."
"Yes up the hill, and gained it too,
   Not one brave boy was seen to lag;
Old Glory o'er us floating free,
   We'd gladly died for that old flag."
His dim eye brightened as he spoke,
   He seemed unconscious of his pain,
In fancy on the battle-field,
   He lived that victory o'er again.
And I, I seemed to grasp it too,
   The stalwart form, the dusky face,
Of each black hero climbing up,
   To win fair glory for their race.
The Spaniards said, "That phalanx seemed
   To move like one black solid wall."
They flung defiance back at death,
   To answer to their country's call.
They fought for Cuban liberty,
   Up San Juan Hill they fought their way,
Until their life-blood freely spent,
   Marked how these heroes won the day.
March on dark sons of Afric's race,
   Naught can be gained by standing still,
Retreat not, quit yourselves like men,
   And like these heroes, climb the hill.
Till pride and prejudice shall cease,
   Till racial barriers are unknown,
Attain the heights, and thou shalt find,
   Equality upon the Throne.
Wendell Phillips
A mighty tempest swept the Nation's course
And strong men sank beneath the ruthless blast
And feared to rise amid the wreck and ruin
Of Slave-bound misery and woe,
Nor dared to rally to the Call of Right,
Yet still despising the ignoble reign
Of Serfdom and its pitiless design
      Upon man's helpless brother-man.
O, direful was the need in that sad hour
And blessed was the sound of that rare voice
Of those strong words of challenge and demand
To save a Nation from itself.
Full willingly this tender sapling bowed,
Yet did not break beneath the weight of scorn,
Beneath the hatred of his fellow-man
      Nor would not hold his peace.
How mightily he rose amid the ruin,
Amid the blighting blast of Slavery's power,
And wrought, full hopeful of the righteous end,
Until the souls of men revived
And caught a vision of the better way,
The nobler standard of a Nation's might,
The consciousness of human brotherhood,
      The priceless boon of liberty.
O, heart of love! thine was the fine desire
To aid thy helpless brother in his need,
To teach thy kind the error and the shame
Of holding back another's right.
May we, whose chafing fetters were unbound
By thine outspoken word of strong defence,
Keep burning on the altar of our souls
      The incense of thy sacrifice.
The Moaning of The Tide
To the Memory of Paul Lawrence Dunbar
Dunbar is dead! O Grief, thy cloud of gloom
   Hangs o'er his race! They sorely needed him,
That he should pass from them in his bright bloom
   Hath sorrowed deep; and troubled eyes are dim
With tears. To hear no more the voice that thrilled;
   To know his pen lies useless, undisturbed;
To know that evermore his songs are stilled,
   Hath filled their hearts with mournings, yet unheard.
O Singer-Artist, thy sweet tuneful lays
   Shall live, e'en though thy spirit swift hath flown
Back to its Maker; still we prize and praise
   The picture that thy skillful hand has thrown
Upon Life's canvass, that so well portrays
   The lot of him who close to Nature clings;
The joy, the pain, the pleasure of his days
   In field and cabin, where he weeps or sings;
It must be that thy soul-inspired Art
   Hath found, at last, in a diviner sphere
Its proper place, from earthly ills apart,
   To make complete its rare beginning here.
To the Memory of William Lloyd Garrison
The Autumn leaves, rich golden-tinted leaves,
   Have fallen, and all barren lie the fields,
For, t'is the Reaping-time, when full-grown sheaves
   Are gathered in, and kindly Nature yields
Her choicest gifts, while Nature's children share
   The Autumn Glory, flooding vale and hill,
And thus the man, with life so full, so rare,
   Ripe, in his Autumn time, sleeps calm and still.
How fearlessly, how fervently he wrought!
   While from his lips fell truth like scattered grain,
Enriching all the field of human thought,
   Restoring faith to human hearts again.
Now, o'er our memories the mellow glow,
   Of all his love, of all his words and deeds
Shines brightly, and t'is ours to feel and know
   That he who pled our cause, who knew our needs
Has left with with us the golden-tinted leaves
   Of hope, such hope as made his life complete,
That we, like him may bring our Autumn sheaves,
   And lay them at the Master-Reaper's feet.
The Brightening of the Hearth-Side
The Yule-Tide Song 
A Christmas Legend
Away in the mystical land of the Orient, there lived an ancient people who worshipped the Gift of Song, and they also believed that certain souls were chosen to minister to humanity through its power, but, first of all, such souls must have passed through so much of human sorrow, until it glorified their countenance, and none but the Infinite One could read the mystery of that Glory.
At every Yule-tide season, it was their special mission to go forth among the people, even across the great waters, and to wait until the inspiration came upon them, and, wherever they might be, the song would find its way into the hearts of those who were hesitating or faltering in their duty toward their fellowmen, and the words of the song would be sweetly strange to its hearers, but the beauty of its music would be unlike that of any earthly strain, and its force would be so compelling that man would clearly see his path of duty. Then the Singer, his mission accomplished, would depart silently from among them, until another Yule tide should lead him forth once more.
It was the Christmas-tide, and the heart of the great American city was beating and throbbing with restless eagerness, as the people hurried to and fro, each, in his own way, preparing for the morrow, the Sacred Day when Heaven's princely Gift, the Christ-Child, was offered human-kind.
The lights of the city gleamed and flashed, revealing too often the sight of misery, as weary, disheartened men, women and half-fed children of the poor, sought shelter from the chilling winds of the night.
From a small, low building, on one of the streets of that city where the endless row of ill-assorted tenement houses told of want and suffering, came the sound of mingled voices, and, a stranger, in passing, paused for a moment to listen, at the same time, catching sight of the word "Welcome" over its narrow doorway.
Unhesitatingly, he entered quietly, and seated himself among a mixed company of men, women and children.
The people gathered there represented that part of humanity who were too poor even to offer the simplest gifts, one to the other, but they had gathered there to hear the comforting words of the silvery-haired woman as she told the story of the Christ child and longing, love, and pity, to these poor children of men.
The stranger sat entranced, unmindful of the covert glances of those around him.
It was small wonder that they sought to view him closely, for the expression of his bronze, foreign face, so peaceful in its repose, yet so striking in its clear-cut outlines, seemed to weave around them a spell of enchantment from which they were powerless to withdraw.
Across the aisle from him, sat a young girl of eighteen years, and beside her, a little child looking up into her face, pleading to be taken home with her, for this child's mother and father had passed into the Land of Silence, and their little one knew not where to lay its head.
The girl sat struggling within herself. Should she take this homeless child to her meager abode, when she herself could barely live on the small pittance she received from her daily toil? No she could not. Again the little face looked up into hers, and again she struggled within herself. The child was homeless, friendless. O, what could she do when she herself was so bereft of daily needs!
Behind her sat a woman who had drank from the cup of disappointment and sorrow. These had over-shadowed her life, and she questioned. What have I to offer others, when my own soul knows no peace?
The silvery-haired woman had ceased speaking, and drawn by the eager face of the stranger, she courteously addressed him, saying, "Friend, our strangers are always welcome among us. Have you a word of Yule-tide cheer?" And the stranger, rising and moving gracefully forward, answered in tones that thrilled the people into perfect silence, "Nay, I cannot find the word that I would speak, though much I thank you for this kindness to an unknown guest, but, there is a power within me that bids me give to you freely of that for which I came, but I must wait in silence until I shall be bidden to fulfill my mission." He ceased speaking, and stood with uplifted eyes, as if in quest of a divine commission. The people sat in awed silence, never had they seen a face like unto his before! Who was this mysterious stranger, and why stood he thus in this silence, that they could not comprehend?
The woman who had tasted the cup of human sorrow leaned forward and quietly whispered to the girl of eighteen years, "He is inspired, and I feel that when the moment comes, he will give to us his message."
Suddenly, as if in answer to her waiting, the singer
broke forth into the sweetest song that man could ever hear, and, the words, although unknown to them, were fraught with strange sweet meaning to their waiting souls, and somehow, they knew he sang of love divine, man's service unto man, of duty, seen and lovingly performed, of sacrifice, and best of all, the final benediction of Heaven's unbroken peace.
O, the strains of music were passing sweet, unlike that of any earthly strain, and as they looked upon the Singer, they saw his face was glorified with a halo, not of earth. Sweetly the marvellous Song died away, and moving silently forward, the Singer passed out into the night, they knew not whither.
But the song had filled its mission. The silvery-haired woman bowed her head in humble gratitude for the blessings of the hour.
Over the soul of the woman who had tasted human sorrow, came a great wave of peace, and the girl of eighteen years, ceased her struggling, and clasping close to her breast, the friendless child, hurried homeward through the night.
The Gift of Song worshipped by those Ancient People had indeed come to them. The Singer had vanished and according to the beautiful legend, whether or not he came from, or had returned to the Land of the Orient, we know not, we cannot say, we only know that the Singer and the Song had filled their Yule-tide Mission.
The Burning Logs of Memory
Be Faithful
At the gate of the dear old homestead,
With hands clasped in lingering farewell,
We stood together in silence,
With feelings no language could tell,
As I looked in the face before me,
With its crown of silver gray hair,
I could see 'neath the lines of sorrow,
The image of Christ printed there.
Just a moment before, in her dwelling,
We had knelt together in prayer,
We had felt the peace of His presence,
And we knew that the Saviour was there,
And now came the moment of parting,
Standing there at the quaint rustic gate,
And somehow we felt but one impulse,
And that was to linger and wait,
For our hearts were too full for expression,
So we looked at each other and smiled,
And she with a voice firm, yet tender,
Said, "Be faithful, be faithful my child,
Remember the dear mother sleeping,
In the churchyard there by the road,
Oh, remember she gave you her blessing,
E're she entered her final abode."
Oh, remember she pled with the Father,
To keep you, her child in His care,
And to bring you at least to His Kingdom,
And she would be waiting there.
And He will my dear if you're faithful,
And then with a tear in her eye,
She whispered once more, "Oh, be faithful,"
God bless you my child, now, "Good-bye."
Good-bye! I could scarcely repeat it,
As I slowly turned from the place,
And I cast a longing glance backward,
For a glimpse of the dear old face
And there she was standing, still smiling,
And waving her dear withered hand,
While I in return smiled bravely,
With emotions I scarce could command.
Then I turned and lingered a moment,
At the churchyard there by the road,
And I thought of the dear Sainted mother,
Resting now at home with her God
Beyond lay the broad sparkling river,
Clear as crystal its bright waters shone,
And I thought of another we read of,
Winding its way by God's Throne.
Then I hastened once more on my journey,
Out into the world with its care,
Out into the world's temptations,
Which I knew were waiting me there.
But somehow new strength seemed given,
To battle and strive against sin,
And somehow I felt I should conquer,
And at last the victory win.
Be faithful, I hear the words ringing,
With sweetness, down, down through the years,
Giving hope in my hours of darkness,
Dispelling my doubts and my fears.
Oft in fancy I see the dear one,
As she looked in my face and smiled,
Oft in fancy I hear her soft whisper,
Oh, be faithful, be faithful my child.
Palm Branches
In the hush of the Sabbath evening,
The people were wending their way,
To worship in God's own temple,
Where so often, they met to pray.
They had said like the Psalmist David,
"Let us go to the House of the Lord,
We're athirst for the living water,
And we long to feed on His word."
So they entered His sacred dwelling,
And they sat in silence there,
While the man of God bowed humbly,
And offered a fervent prayer
That the peace of the Holy Spirit
Might enter each waiting soul,
That some weary wounded seeker,
Might believe and be made whole.
And the people's hearts grew tender,
As they heard the earnest prayer,
And their souls rejoiced within them,
For the Comforter was there;
Then followed the Holy Communion,
That Ordinance so divine,
And they ate of the bread, His body,
And they drank of His blood, the wine.
'Twas an hour of earnest devotion,
'Mid the hush and the holy calm,
Bringing its rest to the weary,
To the wounded, its healing balm.
Then a burst of heavenly music,
Broke over the stillness again,
And the sweet familiar "Palm Branches,"
Rang out in triumphant strain.
Louder and louder swelling,
Till it echoed with richness untold,
Till it seemed that the Master was coming,
As he did in the days of old
When He rode as a king in triumph,
Through the streets of Jerusalem,
And they cast their garments before Him,
And proclaimed Him the "Ruler of Men."
And to-night the people adoring,
Gave honor to Him above,
And they brought Him, each one an offering,
The beautiful palms of love.
While the rich full strains of music,
So sweetly their spirits controlled,
Till it seemed that the Hosts of Heaven,
Were striking their Harps of gold.
And bowing in praise before Him,
Crying, "Holy, thrice Holy our Lord,
As they stood on the banks of the River,
Which flows by the bright Throne of God,
And the people waited enraptured,
For the last faint echo to cease,
Then arose and passed from His temple,
And went on their way in peace.
They were glad like the Psalmist David,
That they went to the House of the Lord,
They had drank from the Living Waters,
They had fed on His precious Word,
In their souls the strain of Palm Branches,
Seemed to linger and gently abide,
They remembered with joy its sweetness,
In the hush of that even-tide.
The Organist's Dream
Yes, I know I am a stranger,
But when you came in that door,
I just felt that I could trust you,
Though we've never met before,
That white ribbon you are wearing,
Somehow makes me want to say,
Something that's been pressing on me,
It has troubled me all day.
Thanks! I knew that you would listen,
When I saw your bow of white,
So I'll just begin and tell you,
Of a dream I had last night.
It was strange that I should dream it,,
For my dreams are very few, 
But this seemed to be so real,
And I hope it won't come true.
I was in a great tall building,
Shut up in a dark, dark room,
And the darkness was so fearful,
That it seemed like mid-night gloom,
And I prayed, and begged, and pleaded,
For some friend to let me out,
But in vain my cries and pleading,
I was doomed without a doubt.
Then I ceased to call and listen,
For I heard sweet voices sing,
And their tones grew loud and louder,
Till they made the arches ring,
With these words that they were singing,
There is no more room in Heaven,
And to him who strays and wanders,
Entrance there shall not be given.
Ah! I thought of dear Old England,
How I've made the organ ring,
In the old church on the corner,
How the choir used to sing,
I have heard the sweetest music,
I have played the sweetest songs,
Grand old airs from Hayden Handel,
Music that has stirred the throngs.
But last night those voices singing,
"There is no more room in Heaven,
And to him who strays and wanders,
Entrance there shall not be given,"
Made me ask myself the question,
Is there no more room for me?
Am I shut outside of Heaven,
Now and for Eternity?
Then I prayed again and pleaded,
Begged that I might be released,
But they heeded not my pleading,
And the voices never ceased.
Singing, no more room in heaven,
And I knew I was denied,
Entrance through the Heavenly Portal,
I alone was shut outside.
All night long I heard the singing,
And the words were just the same,
And to tell the truth about it,
I was glad when morning came,
But somehow I can't help thinking,
That perhaps I'd ought to pray,
For I haven't heard a sermon,
Or a prayer for many a day.
Though I promised the dear mother
That I'd go to meeting some,
But it's been five years and over,
Since I left the dear old home.
And I haven't kept my promise,
But that dream I had last night,
Makes me feel ashamed and sorry,
That I haven't done just right.
Yes, I know I should be better,
And I'm really going to try,
For I've been so wild and reckless,
That I'm hardly fit to die,
But you've made me feel more cheerful,
For your words have been so kind,
And somehow the burden's lifted,
That was pressing on my mind.
Well, Good-bye, I'm glad I met you,
And I'll do just as you say,
I will write the dear old mother,
That her boy has learned to pray,
And although I've strayed and wandered,
Though I've lived so carelessly,
I will try to enter Heaven,
For I know there's room for me.
Dreams By The Driftwood Fire
A Dream of the New Year
Through the waning hours and moments,
Of the slowly dying year,
I sat watching, watching, waiting,
For the New Dawn to appear.
While the Old Year's strife and struggle,
Like a swiftly flowing stream,
Passed before me till I wearied,
Fell asleep--asleep to dream.
That I saw a lofty castle,
Vast in size, and wondrous bright,
And I stood outside its portals,
Waiting for the dawning light.
From its towers the bells were ringing,
In a strange discordant tone,
Wailing out their mournful measures,
Like a mortal's dying moan.
Still I waited, knocked and waited,
Lingered through the shadowed night,
For I longed to learn the secret
Of this castle, vast and bright.
Till a voice within, cried loudly,
"Thou shalt have that wish sublime,
Thou art knocking at Life's castle,
And the Keeper's name is Time."
"And the bells you hear above you,
Ring out all the dying years,
Ring out Man's past griefs and sorrows,
Ring out blasted hopes and fears.
With the coming of the New Year,
They will cease their sad refrain,
You will hear them chiming sweetly,
Ringing out a joyous strain.
Watch and wait awhile with patience,
Wait with hope, and not in fear,
For the New Year swift approaches,
Its bright dawning draweth near."
So I waited, watched and waited
Till the castle's door swung wide,
And the keeper bade me enter,
Saying, "Mortal, here abide."
'Twas indeed a wondrous castle,
With its arches gleaming bright,
E'en the keeper's face was beaming,
With a rare and radiant light,
Through the spacious halls, he led me
Over floors of spotless white,
Till it seemed that mortal vision
Ne'er beheld a fairer sight.
On its walls in blazoned letters,
I could trace each written line,
And the words were wrought most strangely,
Words no mortal could define.
And the keeper softly speaking,
Read them, one by one to me;
"Resolution, Faith and Duty,
Hope and Opportunity."
Then I asked him, "Can you tell me
Why these written words appear?"
He replied, "These are the watchwords
That shall guide thee through the year,
Just resolve to do thy duty,
Thine the opportunity,
Hope shall aid thee, in thy purpose,
Do it well and faithfully."
Then the bells pealed out so loudly,
Ringing out their joyous strain
That I started from my slumbers,
Found myself alone again.
Saw no more Life's wondrous castle,
Vanished now the keeper, Time,
Heard no more the joyful pealing
Of the bell's sweet, tuneful chime.
Day had dawned, the night was over,
Life's old year was safely past,
Now had come a brighter morning,
Life's New Year had dawned at last.
But the dream had filled its mission,
Made my path of duty clear,
Hope and Faith were now the watchwords,
Brightening up my glad New Year.
The Plains of Peace
Again my fancy takes its flight,
And soars away on thoughtful wing,
Again my soul thrills with delight,
And this the fancied theme, I sing,
From Earthly scenes awhile, I find release,
And dwell upon the restful Plains of Peace.
The Plains of Peace are passing fair,
Where naught disturbs and naught can harm,
I find no sorrow, woe or care,
These all are lost in perfect calm,
Bright are the joys, and pleasures never cease,
For those who dwell on the Plains of Peace.
No scorching sun or blighting storm,
No burning sand or desert drear,
No fell disease or wasting form,
To mar the glowing beauty here.
Decay and ruin ever must decrease,
Here on the fertile, healthful Plains of Peace.
What rare companionship I find,
What hours of social joy I spend,
What restfulness pervades my mind,
Communing with congenial friend.
True happiness seems ever to increase,
While dwelling here upon the Plains of Peace.
Ambitions too, are realized,
And that which I have sought on earth,
I find at last idealized,
My longings ripen into worth,
My fondest hopes no longer fear decease,
But bloom forth brightly on the Plains of Peace.
'Tis by my fancy, yet 'tis true,
That somewhere having done with Earth,
We shall another course pursue,
According to our aim or worth,
Our souls from mortal things must find release,
And dwell immortal on the Plains of Peace.
Her Offering
Lay aside your pen for a moment,
And listen, my dear to me,
While I tell you a strange, sweet story,
The sweetest that ever could be.
And perhaps, the theme will inspire you
And perhaps you will catch the strain
Of sweetness, and maybe you'll write it
When you take up your pen again.
So, there in the evening twilight,
I gladly laid down my pen
And listened to hear her story,
As sweet to me now, as then.
It was just at the close of daylight,
When shadows begin to unfold,
I remember the time so clearly,
And this was the story she told,--
Last night, my dear, in dreamland,
I sat in a princely hall,
And its arches were solid marble,
Its pillars stately and tall,
I saw before me an altar,
Exquisitely wrought in gold,
And the white-robed priest behind it,
Was saying, my people behold,--
To-day is the great passover,
Of thanks and of sacrifice,
Give ye of your best and purest,
The least of these will suffice.
Come then with sincerest devotion,
Bring all that ye can afford,
Oh, who will be first to offer
Thanksgiving and praise to the Lord?
Down the aisle of the princely dwelling,
Two maidens in spotless white,
Came bearing rich treasures of silver,
Their faces beaming with light.
And, ascending the steps to the altar,
They offered their gifts to the Lord,
They had brought Him the best and the purest.
The richest each one could afford.
Just behind them in humble submission,
A woman came, weary and worn,
With feeble, faltering, foot-steps,
With garments so faded and torn,
In her hand she was tenderly bearing,
Two tiny pieces of bread,
And, ascending the steps to the altar,
She bowed, and tremblingly said,--
"Not a morsel of food have I tasted,
Since yesterday's early dawn,
But I've waited, Oh, earnestly waited,
For the coming of this bright morn,
This is all that I have to offer,
This simple gift to the Lord,
It's the best that I have and the purest.
The richest that I can afford."
And the white-robed priest said softly,
"Your gift will indeed suffice,
In youth you have kept the passover,
Of thanks and sacrifice."
And then, as the priest was speaking,
The scene faded slowly away,
And the princely hall had vanished.
I awoke to find it was day.
"So, my dear I have told the story,
And I hope you have caught the strain,
Of sweetness,--and now I leave you,
Good-night, till we meet again."
And there in the evening twilight,
I gladly took up my pen,
And I wrote this strange, sweet story,
As sweet to me now, as then.
My Dream of Long Ago 
(TO MY AUNT)
I had a strange sweet dream long, long ago,
When in my years I yet was but a child,
And oft since then as I have dreamed it o'er
Its sweetness has my saddest hours beguiled.
It was that she who like my mother seemed
And I had travelled far and travelled long,
Her hand and mine together tightly clasped,
She with a thoughtful look, and I with song.
And walking thus our way led pleasantly
Mid winding paths on either side where grew
Rare flowers, their perfumes wafted on the breeze,
Which all around us their rich fragrance threw.
But soon our road turned suddenly aside,
Where rose a height of stony rugged ground,
No flowers bloomed upon this hilly waste,
Where sighing winds played mournfully around.
Below the hills, half-hidden, a tiny path
Went winding round and out into the road.
So smoothly did it keep its tiny way
It seemed a guide that nature had bestowed.
We paused, and she spoke there in tender tones,
"My child, you take the easy path around,
For I can better face the windy blast,
My feet can better tread the stony ground."
And I, who knew no will save hers alone,
Obeyed, and o'er the tiny pathway sped,
Oft looking up to see her bravely climb
The stony height with firm and steady tread.
And now the winds her garments roughly blew,
But she, unheeding their rude, blighting blast,
Pressed on, and when I from the pathway ran
We met, and hands again together clasped.
Before us stretched an endless smooth white road
Which ran beside the fairest verdant field
That ever mortal eye had looked upon
Or ever Nature's storehouse had revealed.
Above our heads the sun shone brightly now,
It seemed to thrill our hearts with hope anew
And shed upon our path a mellow light
Which all around us a soft radiance threw.
Thus hand in hand we lightly trod along
This pleasant road with neither curve or bend
When I awoke to find it all a dream
And we had never reached our journey's end.
And yet it may be that this very road,
The end of which we vainly tried to trace,
Might still have led to pastures far more fair,
We might have found some peaceful resting place.
A Floating Spar 
Hope
The driftwood fire burns brightly on, but dreamingtime is over. Stern reality sounds its convincing call to the time of our awakening.
Over the troubled waters of our civilization comes a human cry for human rights--a starting echo from the far cry of bondage over half a century ago.
Prejudice, the floating wreckage of chattel slavery, rises ever to the surface of the turbulent waters of a Nation's life, obstructing each best attempt toward a safe course to its highest citizenship.
The clanking chains of racial injustice, that bind and hold fast the infinite longings and fondest ambitions of a human soul, must be broken.
Doors that are closed against him who lives and breathes in this, a free Republic;--who battles for its preservation, who embraces its educational opportunities, who enters its arena with unswerving purpose to aid in its progressive interests by contributing his own thrift, industry, intellectual and spiritual activities--must be opened.
Had the artist of 50 years ago desired to paint a thrilling picture of human woes, he might have produced upon his canvass this painfully familiar scene--the auction-block--the slaver--and the enslaved, and beneath he might have written these words:
"The Barrier to a Nation's Progress."
But, if in the intensity of his soul, the artist of today desires to paint a true picture of the present attitude of the American mind toward a part of its citizenship, he might portray upon his canvass the following scene--an American citizen of darker hue, with manly bearing, standing, with outstretched hands before the closed door of a minature institution known as "Progressive Civilization," and behind him, a lawless mob. Beneath this he might well write the convincing words:
"Prejudice and Lynch Law--The Curse of the Twentieth Century."
But, happily, amid the wreckage, despite the turbulence, the floating spar of Hope is seen, making its way toward Right and Justice.
Julia Ward Howe beheld it, even through the gleaming camp-fires, when her soul longed for the "glory of the coming of the Lord." She saw its consummation in and through her mighty refrain, "His Cause is Marching On."
Harriet Beecher Stowe held fast to the firm support of Hope, in her vivid portrayal of Slavery, as a living dramatic reality, in that masterpiece of human history, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and, it may be that her mantle will fall upon one who knows and feels the heart-throbs of his race, who has tatsted the bitterness of the bondage of American freedom and, who will yet write a great American Story, in which he shall tell of the Nation's greatest injustice, the denial of the ballot in the South; he shall also reveal volcanic fires of prejudice in the North, over which we daily tread.
Happily for him, he shall weave into the fabric of his genius, the inherited originalities of his people, the development and power of their musical birthright, and the cheering influence of their native humor.
It may be that the romance of home and social life will add a touch of coloring to his narrative.
But the pathos of his story, and the intensity of his longings will be most deeply felt, when he writes of an unalterable faith in the ultimate triumph of justice and its equalizing power. Surely then shall the Nation's heart be touched, and the American conscience stirred to higher, nobler impulses.
O! floating Spar of Hope
'Tis ours to cling full fast to thee,
Outriding e'en the mighty wave,
And current, strong with black despair,
Not even these have power to engulf
Nor stay thine onward course.
Justice and Right are bearing down upon us,
Ay, holding out strong hands,
Of help and timely rescue.
They lead to that long-looked-for Haven
Where man at last plays fair with brother-man
And gives him back his ancient Right.
                  Equality!
ON THE LONG ISLAND INDIAN
How relentless, how impartial,
Is the fleeting hand of time,
By its stroke, great empires vanish
Nations fall in swift decline.
Once resounding through these forests,
Rang the warwhoop shrill and clear,
Once here lived a race of Red Men,
Savage, crude, but knew no fear.
Here they fought their fiercest battles,
Here they caused their wars to cease,
Sitting round their blazing camp fires,
Here they smoked the Pipe of Peace.
Tall and haughty were the warriors,
Of this fierce and warlike race.
Strong and hardy were their women,
Full of beauteous, healthy grace.
Up and down these woods they hunted,
Shot their arrows far and near.
Then in triumph to their wigwams,
Bore the slain and wounded deer.
Thus they dwelt in perfect freedom,
Dearly loved their native shores,
Wisely chose their Chiefs or Sachems,
Made their own peculiar laws.
But there came a paler nation
Noted for their skill and might.
They aroused the Red Man's hatred,
Robbed him of his native right.
Now remains a scattered remnant
On these shores they find no home,
Here and there in weary exile,
They are forced through life to roam.
Just as Time with all its changes
Sinks beneath Oblivion's Wave,
So today a mighty people
Sleep within the silent grave.

INTRODUCTION.
    The heroic deeds of their leaders and ancestral progenitors, their trials and difficulties, their successes and failures, their privations and triumphs have furnished to the bards and historians of ancient and modern times the themes from whence sprang forth those strains of choice literary thought which have tended to national and racial unity, and aroused the spirit of martial and civic conquests.
    Greek, Roman, Macedonian, Persian, Ottoman, European and American, Buddhist, Brahmanist, Mohammedan, Jew and Christian have been electrified by the recital of epics and sonnets from the pens of their poets, which portrayed the deeds of grandeur performed by the leaders of their respective clan or sect; a Homer or Virgil, a Tennyson or a Longfellow, a Milton or a Shakespeare has attuned his lyre to a note which struck a responsive chord in the breasts of his countrymen and incited them to noble deeds. But the harp of the Ethiopian bard whose melodious notes shake off the lethargy of centuries remaineth unstrung, and his tale of weal and woe untold.
    Among poets and writers of renown, Ethiopia's sons and daughters are found. Their writings have charmed and astonished the world, but the theme of their songs and verses was directed to humorous and solemn points in the lives of men, while the story of Ethiopia's dusky sons remained untold. Phyllis Wheatley and Paul Laurence Dunbar will hold a place among the most renowned of the world's great poets. They were the real poets, endowed with genius and ability whose places may never be filled. It is to be regretted that one or both of them did not direct their lives to the happenings of their race. This book (though poorly written) is intended to give the Negro a chance to hear the story of the lowly Ethiopian in bondage and freedom, in prosperity and adversity, in war and in peace, given in rhythmic cadence from the pen of one of her sons.
    The author has attempted to answer those critics who find so much to condemn in the Negro's political and civil history. His highest ambition has been to awaken the slumbering spirit of race pride, and if possible to unify the forces now striving to win by individual effort, so that the weight of their joint influence and the strength of their numbers may work to the betterment of their position in the land of their birth. He has dared to hope that the "Harp of Ethiopia" may arouse the sluggish pulse of the nation to a realization of the fact that the tree of liberty planted by the blood and suffering of the fathers and founders of the republic is being stealthily uprooted by the law-defying populace, and questionable decisions of the courts of justice. Repetitions may appear in some places, but examination will show at first a mere statement of facts and the last an explanation, or defense of the same proposition. The writer disclaims any intention to excite the passions of the members of his race or to stir the animosity of the most sensitive of other races. "The Harp of Ethiopia" is intended to state the facts bluntly, but politely, that the position of the Negro may be understood and that his case may have an impartial hearing at the bar of public opinion.
                                                                                                The Author.
PREFACE.
    I have known the author of this unpretentious and unheralded volume for fully twenty-five years. He was quite a while in public life in North Carolina and enjoyed the distinction of being a member of the state legislature from his native county, Caswell, where he was born March 31, 1859. He was educated at Shaw University, Raleigh. N. C.
    He was always a modest, cautious, thoughtful and useful man and citizen and won the respect and confidence of all good citizens of all races. As a teacher in his county and leader of his people he always wielded an influence that gave him considerable power and prestige both in his county and his state. He was never given to much speech making, but always spoke pointedly and with a full knowledge of the subject in hand whenever he did speak. His modesty and urbanity always gave weight and significance to his words, which better orators could not carry. 
    Mr. Corbett has held a government position in Washington, D. C., for a number of years, and in the meantime has developed a literary turn of mind, chiefly versification. In this little volume the reader gets a glimpse of a trend of his thought and the more serious matter that harrows his soul. His plaints are vividly expressed and his words sincerely uttered. In lighter vein he reflects his natural bent for humor and good fellowship. He would seem severe in some of his maledictions where he appears to attack some erstwhile sincere and loyal friends, but as it is his opinion the responsibility is also his.
    We earnestly share his large faith and spirit of helpfulness which run through all his predictions and prophecies. Upon the whole, the volume possesses merit, and being his first attempt, Mr. Corbett should be encouraged to continue the exercises of a talent which is inborn and we may discern in him another hitherto mute-inglorious son of genius. We heartily commend the "Harp of Ethiopia" to all lovers of helpful reading and to all who are in sympathy with an ambitious and able author and a much handicapped and struggling race.
                                                                                                John C. Dancy,
                                                                                                            Washington, D. C.
The Harp Of Ethiopia.
The Present.
Beginning with Freedom in 65. Real.
Invocation.
Oh Lord of Hosts, my thoughts inspire,
My mind with lofty ideals fire,
My song attune, my theme direct,
Guide thou my pen, my words select,
Thy wisdom give, thy grace impart,
Let inspiration fill my heart;
My helpless self in thy arms hold,
While I this tale of woe unfold.
On my weak effort shed thy light,
Courage impart, remove all fright;
Let latent powers within me wake,
Proneness to error from me take.
My tongue endow with proper speech,
Increase my wisdom, I beseech;
Me deluge with the needful aid,
Uphold me lest I be dismayed.
Address to the Harp.
Awake, O harp, and ring out clear,
Thy mournful notes let all men hear;
Start from Creation's early morn,
Speak ye to nations yet unborn,
In blood and sorrow do thou trace
The tortuous journey of a race
From superstition's vile discord,
Unto the knowledge of our Lord.
Of its beginning do thou ring,
Of its past glory, proudly sing,
Sing of its kingdoms perished gone,
Sing of its arts first to us known,
Sing of its architectural skill,
How nature yielded to its will;
Tell how as conquering warriors grand,
Subdued they all adjacent land.
Tell how in pomp and splendor bright,
Its haughty rulers did delight,
To dazzle with their wealth and gold,
The world's important kingdoms old.
Tell how the art to read and write
Its dusky solons brought to light;
Of all its lofty grandeur tell,—
Just how it rose and why it fell.
Sing thou of past Egyptian lore,
The greatest in the days of yore;
Sing thou of Sheba's noted state,
And how her queen did captivate
With matchless beauty and with grace
The ruler of the Hebrew race.
The wisest of all men most wise,
'And now he did her idolize.
Of Carthagena's power sing,
How she did consternation bring
Unto the rulers of proud Rome,
When to her gates its arms had come.
Tell how the moors did capture Spain,
Although her warriors tried in vain
To break the fierce oppressor's yoke
With axe and spear and sabre stroke.
Sing Ethiopia's checkered past,
How once she was an empire vast,
Known and respected in all lands,
Tribute receiving from the hands
Of kings, who lived in mortal dread,
Lest they should hear the martial tread
Of dusky warriors fully bent
Upon their speedy punishment.
Sing loud of Babylonia's pride,
How she all nations long defied;
Their captive king triumphant led,
Her rule o'er their dominion spread.
Bring forth lost Shinae's sabled sons,
Who ranked among the noble ones,
Enthroned, triumphant, in that hour,
Hamitic races were a power.
Sing how in Afric's burning clime,
Idolatry became sublime,
It bowed the knee to stock and stone,
Jehovah's sceptre did disown.
Tell how from learning soon they turn
And heathen worship's torches burn;
Of all their cruel tortures tell,
And how they did their brethren sell.
Tell how, at length, another race,
Across the briny deep, did trace
Her way to Afric's sunny shores,
Her cup of vengeance on it pours.
Tell how in sorrow, blood and tears
These cruel strangers did for years
Shoot down like dogs women and men,
And a brisk trade in slaves begin.
Tell how, in prison ships they bore
These black men to the white-man's shore;
Like cattle, crowded in the hold,
Shipped over to be bought and sold;
How the winds wafted back their groans,
How the deep glistened with their bones
Of their death by starvation tell,
How slavery is the child of hell.
Tell how like cattle they were bred,
How meanly they were housed and fed;
How they no marriage rights enjoyed,
And how their morals were destroyed.
How slaves the planters' wives became,
In everything except in name;
Tell how these planters, heartless, cold,
Debased, wicked, their children sold.
Tell how the overseer's whip
With human blood would often drip;
Tell how patrols all hours of night,
In chasing them took great delight.
Tell of the slaves who ran away,
While at their heels did bloodhounds bay.
How masters lived in mortal dread,
And slaves in ignorance were reared.
Tell how they fashioned wood and steel,
How toiled they in the cotton field;
How they did massive forests fell,
How bridged they stream in vale and dell.
How they the grain did sow and reap,
How they their masters' stock did keep;
How books and papers were denied,
How sorely was their patience tried.
Tell how, at length, they prayed to God
To lift the weight of their great load.
Of speeches of Fred Douglass tell,
How he his eager hearers held
Spellbound, with matchless eloquence,
While weilding telling blows against
The shameful curse of slavery,
And pleading that all men be free.
Sing of the men who wrote and spoke
Against the galling slavery yoke;
Forget not Harriet Beecher Stowe,
Who dealt it such a telling blow.
Sing of the fate of old John Brown,
Who wears to-day a martyr's crown.
Tell how, at length, Secession's hand
Wrought consternation in this land.
Sing how a rebel cannon shell
At Sumpter, sounded the death-knell
Of trafficking in human lives
Thrusting apart husbands and wives.
Tell how Abe Lincoln tried in vain
To coax the rebels back again;
How all his overtures were spurned
While on his troops their guns wers turned.
Tell how, at length, in Sixty-three,
Lincoln the slaves proclaimeth free;
Tell how they hastened from the farms,
And begged permission to bear arms.
Their deeds as soldiers do thou tell,
How, facing cannons, fighting, fell,
How charged they on the battle-field
And hand to hand met steel with steel.
Sing praise of those who at home stayed,
Who fervently for freedom prayed.
But who protected with their lives
Their masters' daughters, sons and wives.
Tell how when freedom came at last,
Their hearts with sorrow were downcast;
That from their masters they must part,
And for themselves in life must start.
Tell how without a stock or stone,
That they could justly call their own,
They started, and with courage bold,
Their place in life as men to hold.
Tell how for knowledge they did yearn,
How soon to read and write did learn.
Tell how they sought to renovate
The south, by war made desolate.
Tell how they hailed the right to vote,
How did they on their freedom dote;
Sing thou of ill-designing men,
Who did the blackman's woe begin
By being put in many a place,
Which they soon covered with disgrace.
Tell how they stole the funds of state
And left their friends disconsolate.
Sing of their sturdy loyalty
To those who fought to make them free;
Sing how they fell under the ban
Of the detested Ku Klux Klan.
Tell how, almost in every town,
For party's sake they were shot down;
Tell how they went to legislate
In Congress halls and native state.
Tell how, while facing adverse blows,
The South made blossom as a rose,
By increased value of the farms,
From labor produced their arms.
Tell how from poverty they come,
Masters of money, farm and home;
Tell of their schools for training thought,
Which foes have tried to bring to naught.
Sing of their educated men,
Who 'stonished earth, with tongue and pen.
Of their mechanics do you sing,
How make they drill and hammer ring;
How the professions vainly tried
To keep them from their domain wide.
Then tell how while the nation slept
Their rights as men were from them swept.
Sing of the nation's fearful stench,
Caused by the victims of Judge Lynch;
How men of Russian horrors prate
With worse conditions at their gate.
How colored men have never struck
Nor set on fire their landlord's truck.
How stood they with stern and peaceful face
While foreign labor took their place.
Tell how each sovereign Southern state
Against their rights did legislate;
Them justice in the courts denied,
On Jim Crow cars, them forced to ride.
How shot down on the least pretense,
Accused, but given no defense,
How songs of liberty are hushed
And how their spirits have been crushed.
Sing of the nation's sad decay,
Whose Magna Charta is today
Rejected, trampled and despised,
Though acts of treason are disguised
By subterfuges in the law,
Wherein each lawyer finds a flaw;
Sing how our statesmen false have grown
While weaklings to the fore have gone.
Sing of the dearth of party ties,
As each to fool the people tries;
Tell how they take their country's flag,
It in the dust, polluted, drag.
Tell how each day the people go
Upon a seething volcano;
Whose noxious fumes once put in play
Will cause this nation to decay.
Sing of the Hamite's future state,
Whether must stay or emigrate;
Whether must sit contented by
While everyone his rights deny.
Whether when tortured on the rack
In desperation must strike back;
Whether again they'll be made slaves,
Or £11 in honor heroes' graves.
Whether they will that adage know,
"Who would be free, must strike the blow;"
Whether emancipate the race
Or others help themselves efface.
Whether on others will depend,
Or stubbornly their rights defend;
Whether be driven to exile
Giving up cherished hopes the while.
Whether be true those words adored,
"The pen is mightier than the sword,"
Or whether true e'er since the flood,
Keform ne'er cometh without blood.
Ring out, let nothing be concealed,
Sing out till all our wrongs are healed;
Let old earth echo back the sound,
Until real justice doth abound.
Let nothing hush thy solemn notes,
Ham deep conviction down the throats
Of statesmen, churchmen and the bar,
Until is risen hope's bright star.
Sing while the thread of life doth last,
Ring till we weather death's cold blast,
Sing till we slumber 'neath the sod
And answer roll call unto God.
The Harp Awaking.
And lo, from out of space is heard
Attractive sounds but not a word,
Soft, enchanting, muffled, low,
And rippling, as from steady flow
Of brooklet o'er a stony bed,
Or if it was the stealthy tread
Of prowling beast in search of prey
Or sighing winds that die away.
Sounds that ghastly phantoms make,
When from their charnel house they take
Nocturnal visits to Life's shores,
And stop not for the strongest doors.
Sounds like silvery bells a clanging,
Sounds like tightening bowstrings twanging,
Sounds as heard by caged bird
When its prisoned soul is stirred.
'Tis the minstrel harp awaking
And the dust of centuries shaking,
From the strings so long in hiding,
And with constant faith abiding.
All the ages past reviewing,
And its broken threads renewing
'Tis the soul of the muse arising
From its grave and us advising.
From beginning of creation
To its limits of duration,
Every phase of Canaan's journey,
Which is like the ancient tourney
With its honored knights contending,
And their ladies fair defending;
Till they bettered man's condition
And raised women in position.
Thus the harp awakened speaketh,
And with good intent it seeketh
Man to teach a useful lesson.
And with force attempts to press on
The minds of Ham's, ill-used descendants
On themselves place their dependence.
Listen, ye people, to each word,
For ne'er was sadder singing heard.
The Harp's Song Begun.
Hark, oh men, to my story long,
Which to thee I give in verse and song,
Let all creation lend an ear,
Silence all sounds that men may hear:
Let callous nations read their doom,
As back to life, I, from the tomb,
Nations long perished do now call
To tell the story of their fall.
Let witness answer from on high
That I beguile thee with no lie.
Let blackened, hideous, burning hell
Lend cursed spirits, back to tell
What shameful deeds condemned their souls,
And why its fiery portals holds
Their souls as captives, bound in chains,
Their cries for ease the Lord disdains.
Creation.
Long, long before old earth was hung
Upon its axis, or was swung,
Nature's curtain of azure hue,
Or stormy winds, from chaos drew
Their first, untamed, life-giving breath,
Or had been known the monster, death,
When light and earth from nothing sprang,
And morning stars together sang,
The Past.
And sons of God shouted for joy,
Or sin's foul curse did but destroy
The things in nature held most dear,
Or snow-capped mountain peak did rear
Its glistening summit to the sun,
The Eternal Godhead three in one,
In Teman, shaped redemption's plan,
And then made like Him erring man.
Upright and holy was he made,
To revel in the cooling shade
Of Eden's garden; lovely, fair;
To reign unchecked, creation's heir.
To hold subjected to his will,
The fowls of air and the beasts that still
Are kept submissive to his power,
To do his bidding every hour.
Stationed within this pure retreat,
And bidden of its fruits to eat,
Except the fruit of just one tree,
Which was; most beautiful to see;
Yet weak man disobeyed and fell,
No longer was allowed to dwell
In Eden holy; but instead,
Must toil to earn his daily bread.
Soon he began to multiply
And learned also that he must die;
Because of Father Adam's sin,
No peace could he expect within.
But man got farther from his God,
And ruthlessly, His mercies trod
Under his vile, accursed feet,
And, beggar, came to mercy's seat
Justice demanded human blood.
And God, in anger, sent a flood,
Which earth of living creatures swept ,
Leaving no remnant here except
One Noah who saved his family,
Consisting of his wife and three
Sons, Shem by name, Japheth and Ham,
Who, in mercy, he did not damn.
From these three boys have all men sprung,
Each nation kindred, race and tongue;
Beginning from one common blood,
The bound and free, the bad and good,
Went forth the world to populate,
And the wide seas to navigate.
Young Shem showed no desire to roam,
But chose old Asia for his home.
Chose Japheth Europe as his own,
Where since supreme his sons have grown.
Ham chose old Afric's lurid skies
To be his earthly paradise.
His flocks found pastures by the Nile,
Where dwelt the clumsy crocodile.
His lot was cast on fertile soil,
Which yielded food without much toil.
Africa.
From nature fruitful vines had sprung,
And trees with rich fruit laden hung;
The busy bees their honey stowed,
And trees were found from which milk flowed.
The stars by night their vigil kept,
And cooling streams placidly swept
Down mountainside to far sea shore,
A means of transit evermore.
Grazing upon these mountain slopes
Were gazelles, deer and antelopes;
The buffalo and Afric bear,
The mountain goat and timid hare.
The trees were filled with singing birds
And gnus roamed o'er the plains in herds;
Giraffes took food from lofty trees,
And ostrichs mate in cooling breeze.
Anon, each sylvan vale is stirred,
Awed, silenced, stilled when there is heard
The distant roar of the king of beasts,
While searching prey on which to feast;
Leviathans feed on vast cane-brakes;
While in the bushes, hideous snakes
Glide silently from place to place,
And other reptiles for food chase.
'Twas here that young Ham pitched his tent,
But his offspring's were not content
To spend their lives in one lone spot,
But soon began this land to dot
With many cities rich and strong,
And each a fortress which ere long
Unites with other settlements
And formed the ancient governments.
Negro Peoples of Antiquity.
Memphis, a ruling city stood
When mighty Rome was standing wood;
Meroe, in commerce took a part
Before old Greece was on the chart.
Had Shinar's glory passed away
Before proud Britain had her day.
Thebes stood in grandeur long before
Old Troy importance held in store.
Was Babylon an empire vast,
Ere Macedonia had cast
Her warlike pennant to the breeze,
Or other lands began to seize.
Proud Carthage flourished like a rose
About the time had Grecians chose
The spot on which was Athens reared,
Or her victorious warriors cheered.
Egypt.
Egypt first taught letters to man,
And her wise rulers then began
National government to form,
And distant citadals to storm.
She held communion with the stars;
Crowded her ports with seasoned spars
Of gallant ship from each known land,
Which at that time, man's eyes had scanned.
By sons of Ham were founded these
Cities, and empires which were keys
Which opened civilization's door
From whence the seeds of ancient lore,
Enlightened nations permeate
And mother earth illuminate
With wisdom's grand inspiring light,
Which maketh day of darkest night.
Thus Ham's descendants now despised
Heiroglyphics first devised,
Which have improved with every age,
Until, today, the proudest page
Of any nation's history
Is that which holds the registry
Of noble deeds of worthy men,
As handed down by book and pen.
Astronomy is a lost art,
Recovered now only in part,
From what it was in former years
When by this means Egyptian seers
Not only taught time of eclipse,
Or rain, and wind, and measured trips
Of moon and stars around the sun,
And where the comets' course would run.
But by the stars would they foretell
Of births, and deaths, and coming spell
Of pestilence, and bloody wars,
Of dearth of grain, and tell the cause
Of adverse fate, or great success,
Or, when the land would see distress
Swoop down upon it like a pall
And spread its black wings over all.
But Egypt's granduer was not known
Because of her wise men alone,
For Persia, Media, and the rest
Of Eastern lands, can well attest
Unto her military skill,
And how did she her coffers fill
With gold, which they as tribute gave
The crowns of their own kings to save.
Babylonian warriors pitched their tents
In all adjacent settlements.
And captive kings triumphant, led,
Their soldiers brave to wild beasts fed;
Their children bore away as slaves,
While others hid themselves in caves.
Foremost among this captive throng,
Were Israel's children servants long.
Carthage.
Carthage, her grandeur had set forth
Before the people of the North;
They saw, they coveted, they came
To drive her from the halls of fame.
Down swept these conquering Northern hosts,
Whose leading generals made loud boasts
Her walls to raise, her wealth to take
And the power of her kingdoms break.
For many years the land was rife
With scenes of war and blood and strife;
The torch to house and grain applied,
Woman and child quarters denied.
The gentle maid, the babe, the old,
With hoary heads, in death lay cold,
Having been pierced by spear and sword,
For those stern men no mercy showed.
Met they in combat first the Greeks
In Sicily, where deafening shrieks
Of wounded men and women fair
In fright and sorrow rent the air.
After two centuries had passed
The Carthaginians were at last
In full possession of the Isle
And on their arms could rest a while.
Few were the years she had of peace,
A power greater by far than Greece.
Her fame had heard, and vow did make,
By arms, her fertile lands to take.
Thus Rome without apparent cause
Began those awful Punic wars,
When strife, and carnage, like a flood,
Deluged that land with human blood.
Proud Rome her strongest legions sent
Well officered and fully bent
Upon the speedy overthrow
Of Carthage, by one sudden blow.
In these fierce conflicts Greek met Greek,
While hill and dale and mountain peak,
Forest and distant cave resound
From year to year, with martial sound.
Hanno attacked the hosts of Rome,
Bat found he could not drive them home;
Then did the gallant Hasdrubal
With mighty force upon them fall;
But like the ceaseless drops of rain,
Those Roman legions would again
In haste, fill up depleted ranks
With men obtained from Tiber's banks.
Then came the valiant Hamilcar,
The hero of a former war,
Who strove to wrest his monarch's lands
From fire and sword and prowling bands
Of Roman subjects, whose sole aim
Was that they might bow down with shame
This hated rival nation's head,
And plant the power of Rome instead.
He, like his predecessors, failed
His seasoned warriors were assailed
In front and flank, both horse and foot,
Until completely put to route.
Then came the peerless Hannibal,
The greatest general of them all,
The ages, peoples, lands and climes,
Whether ancient or modern times.
Like avalanche on mountain slope,
With which no living thing can cope,
He down upon the Romans bore,
And swept them' from his country's shore,
Nor was he with this feat content,
But with desire for punishment
He took his troops away from home
To burn and waste the lands of Rome.
When but a youth, his life was spent
With soldiers 'neath his father's tent;
He mastered every act of war,
Was schooled to hate the Romans, for
His father to the temples led
Him daily, with uncovered head,
And made him swear whate'er might come,
Eternal enmity to Rome.
Then Hamilcar, his father, dies,
And to his son the nation flies;
And begged that he would have the grace
To serve them in his father's place.
The scattered forces gathered he
And sent them to the north by sea;
The towering Alps his legions crossed,
And Rome's proud soldiers were unhorsed.
For years fought he on Roman soil,
His troopers heaped themselves with spoil
Of Roman wealth of gold and grain.
So battled they till they had slain
Hundreds of thousands of the foe,
And that proud land was filled with woe.
And for a time her power crushed,
And her loud shouts of triumph hushed.
The whole empire he swept across,
Without his having ever lost
One battle to his gallant foe,
Whose ranks gave way like melted snow
Beneath the piercing rays of sun,
When fierce Numidian charge was done,
And Carthaginian sword and spear
Had pierced their ranks from van to rear.
And yet this mighty warrior died
With leading wish ungratified.
He lived to see the laws of Rome
Again ascendant at his home.
Although for years he had assailed
Her strongest forts, he found he'd failed
Her soldiers' song of war to hush,
Or her desire for conquest crush.
'Mongst empires old, Sheba is seen,
Whose very wise and lovely queen
Journeyed to distant Hebrew land,
That she be privileged to stand
Before the wise King Solomon,
And face to face to call upon
Him there to prove that he had right
To be called wisdom's leading light.
Questions and tests she freely plied
Until her mind was satisfied
That not the half was ever told
Of his great wisdom, power and gold.
And he with her was so impressed
That she became by his request
A favorite and loving wife,
The pride of his declining life.
We mention next the warlike Moors,
Like swarming bees their army corps
O'er Spanish coast and Spanish, main,
Village and dell, mountain and plain,
Their shining tents in triumph spread,
While placing tribute on the head
Of Spanish peasant, knight and lord,
Who stood in awe of Moorish sword.
For generations Spain was ruled
By them, and there her soldiers schooled
Into the Moorish arts of war.
And from that stock began to draw
By intermarriage, Moorish pluck,
While budded her fame as a flower.
And then for liberty she struck,
Freeing herself from Moorish power,
Each country, city, nation, tribe,
And settlement, which I describe
Vaguely, in tedious lines above
Is history from which we prove
The former power of this race,
Thus forming links by which you trace
Them from their proud exalted state
Through bondage to their present state.
Negroes were they, or of mixed blood,
Peoples' within whose veins there flowed
The dark rich blood of Ethiop's sons,
A tiny stream of which now runs
In Spanish, French and Latin stock,
A glaring fact with which we'll shock
The sensitive who claim to be
Of unmixed blood of first degree.
Blood Power.
One drop of blood of Negro race
Has always been enough to place
Its owner 'mongst the sons of Ham.
Really, I must admit I am
Puzzled, befogged, anxious to know
The reason why this should be so;
Because in every other case
Negroes are called the weaker race.
If his blood is stronger why not he,
In physique and mentality?
Since cross of breeds, makes heartier stock,
Cattle or fowl, why do we mock
Nature's great law, when say we men
By amalgamation soon begin
In all things to deteriorate
And be a menace to the state?
Search the whole world for a hardier race
Than these found dwelling on the face
Of our American continent,
A splendid race of mixed descent.
Indian, Norseman, and hated Jew,
German, Frenchman, and Irish, too,
And English, Spaniard, Negro, Greek
Are friends and neighbors, so to speak.
Where's, then the Anglo-Saxon race
That the unthinking populace
Take so much trouble to declare
That they must see preserved with care?
This is the Mecca for all breeds,
All tongues, all colors, and all creeds,
That dwell on land or hawsers drag,
Which forms one nation 'neath one flag.
Retrogression Begins.
Why ramble thus? Methinks I've strayed
Far from the theme which I essayed
By ancient history to prove
That Ham's descendants once did move
The world in science, and in art,
In letters, war and busy mart,
Where earth's supplies were bought and sold
With stock and grain, silver and gold.
Long was their reign, great was their power!
Their maidens charming as a flower.
With trees and vines that rich fruit yield,
Cattle and grain on fertile field,
Their ships in triumph rode the seas
With banners floating to the breeze;
Servants and wealth had they galore,
Their names were feared the known world o'er.
Burnt they sweet incense to their gods;
Ruled they their lands with iron rods;
Pictures and paintings decked their halls;
Cities were circled by strong walls;
In silken robes were nobles clad;
Diamonds and pearls were all the fad
With those who held the reins of state,
Laces, their garments decorate.
Their self-made gods they magnified,
While they the living God defied.
They worshiped wild beasts, stocks and stone,
Jehovah's laws did they disown;
Fetish and trick took place of prayer.
And next they stripped their persons bare,
Their priests, for human slaughter stood
And drenched their gods with human blood.
Letters and books they cast aside
For spear and sword and toughened hide,
Of slaughtered beasts fashioned to shields,
Then took themselves to battle-fields.
Made they themselves equal with beasts,
When human flesh adorned their feasts.
From ruling nations soon they fell
To lowest depths—an earthly hell.
No pen nor picture can describe
The savage battles tribe with tribe;
How old and young were foully slain
That they might forge the galling chain
Of slavery on their captured foes,
While death claims those who them opposed.
Women and men, the young and old,
Were by black men to black men sold.
For centuries, thus plodded they
Bereft of one redeeming ray
Of Hope's august inspiring light
With which to eradicate the blight
Of ignorance and superstition,
Of base ideals and lost ambition,
Of moral stamina and vice,
And seeds of innate cowardice.
Stagnant and cold on life's vast stage
Were Afric's sons for age on age.
Their lamps of wisdom bare of oil,
Their dusky sons shirking from toil,
Their women treated as if serfs,
Their children cast off as if scurfs
Upon life's busy, frothy sea,
Well trained in all brutality.
The Slaver Arrives.
Upon her coasts a ship is seen
With spreading sails and peaceful mien,
Bringing to them another race,
With flowing locks and pale of face.
Bringing to them the blasting breath
Of slavery's curse and horrid death;
Bringing God's curse because of sin,
In trusting gods fashioned by men.
Bringing dishonesty and vice,
For which they paid the awful price
Of bondage in a foreign land,
While at their doors a native band
With gun and sword, butcher and kill
Women and men that they might fill
The slaver's ship with wretched souls
At captains will like fish on shoals.
The hearts were many that they broke,
Many a prince who bore the yoke
Of cruel bondage, who till then
Had dominated over men,
But now is he himself in chains;
His faith in cherished idols wanes
He and his servant side by side
Are claimed, which breaks his haughty pride.
And now they walk the fatal plank
Of anchored ship mid constant clank;
Of heavy chains which bind them fast,
While terror-struck they look aghast
Upon the ship and boundless sea,
But find no means by which to flee
From captor's hand to native shore,
Where they could be with loved ones more.
So in their agony they moan,
They tear their flesh they utter groan
On groan, then tug they at their chains;
They call their gods, they rack their brains,
They howl and curse, they laugh, they weep,
They take no food, they cannot sleep.
They find escape useless to try,
And in despair they wish to die.
Like cattle crowded in the hole
Were they shipped over to be sold,
With stagnant air, gasp they for breath,
While hundreds gladly welcome death.
Like stricken cattle, hundreds died
While cruel captors vainly tried
By force and threats to keep them hale
That they might profit by their sale.
But still they, died like strickened sheep
And hungry monsters of the deep
Followed the ship by night and day,
Knowing full well they'd have for prey
A ghastly corpse, a lifeless worm,
That living walked in human form.
They threshed the waves with tails, they fought,
Until their cherished food was brought.
As course across the desert sands
Is traced by bones of Arab bands
Comprising yearly caravan,
So would the bones of captive man
Mark course across the trackless deep,
Were it but possible to keep
Them floating in the self-same spot
And huge sea monsters harmed them not.
Yet more survived than those that died,
Who soon began to cast aside
All thoughts of freedom, home and gods,
And try to understand the nods
And signs, by present masters given
Rather than be with lashes driven
To rouse them from their lethargy
And learn the ways of slavery.
Thus after being tempest tossed
For week on week, their old ship crossed
The mighty ocean with her load
Of human merchandise aboard.
Who trod on unfamiliar soil
On which must each for decades toil
To fill the coffers of his lord
Without one farthing of reward.
Like cattle are they made to breed,
That men may have their tender seed;
Trained in the ways they'd have them know,
Trained in the use of plow and hoe,
Trained in the use of cutlery,
And every kind of drudgery.
Trained up to honor and obey
White persons, whether young or gray.
In small log huts women and men
Were forced to dwell like pigs in pen;
Their forms exposed, their passions fed
Licentiously, untamed, unwed.
All women were by owners told
They must bear child or else be sold;
For each young Negro born in health,
Meant quite a boost to master's wealth.
Masters became the worst of knaves
By their adultery with their slaves.
They beat and drove them in the day
While after dark they snugly lay
Themselves in dusky damsels arms,
Taking delight in secret charms,
And from the pair were children born,
Who soon received their father's scorn.
Thus some slave owners, heartless, cold,
To other men their own sons sold,
Sent them adrift, disowned, despised,
To keep their parentage disguised;
Sent them like Ishmael from their doors
So that they may subdue the roars
Of pent up wrath of irate wives,
Who saw a shadow cross their lives.
Others retained them, on the farm,
Who soon found reason for alarm,
In unchecked love of sons, for slaves,
Both of his loins. Thus like fierce waves
Of angry deep, 'gainst ship or rocks,
This brand of enforced lewdness knocks
The prop from moral rectitude,
And fills the land with turpitude.
Search as you may, 'tis hard to find
A Negro of the purest kind,
Whose Afric lineage you trace
In woolly locks and sooty face.
Or whose black cheeks will show no shame
When he repeats his family name;
Whose dusky face will show to earth
That he descends from unmixed birth.
Scarcely a Southerner today
Who can with truth and honor say
That he escaped the immoral flood,
Of close kinship to Negro blood.
The rich, the poor, the middle class,
The haughty lords, the common mass,
All have close relatives (though poor)
Amongst those black men by the score.
Some planters calmly spent their lives
With colored women as their wives;
Not legal wives could these men show,
Because the laws were worded so
That no white man could take as wife
A Negro woman on his life;
Could not by any process wed,
So that they honor marriage bed.
These mistresses were given right
To rule the slaves by day and night;
Could have their persons bound and stripped
And with the bloody rawhide whipped;
Could favor, tyrannize, and scold,
Could give them power, or have them sold,
in short, were given the same sway
That legal wives had in that day.
Negro Labor.
But back to subject let us go,
And with the pen, attempt to show
How slaves, with aptitude and zeal
Soon skill acquired to fashion steel
Into plows, scythes and reaping blades,
Shovels and hoes, axes and spades;
To form horse-shoes, wedges and nails
Weld wagon tires and hoops for pails.
Repair all tools, and, for the sons
Of masters, fashion locks for guns.
In short, 'twas simply by their aid
The tools that brought forth wealth were made.
While black hands, with those plows and hoes,
Were seen in lengthy cotton rows,
Turning the soil or breaking clods,
And picking fibre from ripe pods.
Others take axes, wedge and maul
And on the giant forests fall;
Till vast expanse of land is cleared,
And crops are pitched and cities reared;
They hew the pillars and the beams
Which span the bridges o'er the streams;
They plant the vines and dig the ditch,
And southern planters soon enrich
They sow the seeds of oats and wheat,
They plant the corn and kill the meat,
They harvest fields of ripened grain,
They press the sugar from the cane.
They raise much sought tobacco crop,
They build the massive dam to stop
The water for the wheels of mills
That grind the grain, or houses build.
They tend the sheep and feed the stock,
They dig the marl and blast the rock,
They build the barn and dig the ditch,
They blaze the pine and make the pitch.
They build the forts, and these same slaves
Fight fiercely-painted Indian braves,
Who seek to take their masters' lives,
And keep as squaws their loving wives.
Overseers.
They worked in hunger and in cold,
They bore hardships like soldiers bold.
A sullen look was an offense
And no one spoke in their defense
When overseer's plaited whip
With their warm blood would often drip
If they the rock-bound custom broke,
And for themselves acted or spoke.
The dreaded overseer's place
Was filled in almost every case
With the worst class of poor white men
Who scorned to work, but who had been
Distinguished for brutality,
And wanting in morality.
They had no Negroes of their own
And loathed them for this cause alone.
Runaway Slaves.
And some slaves maddened by their lot
Would vow to leave the cursed spot
In quest of freedom; but behold!
Soon in their veins the blood ran cold!
For while in sheltered nook they lay,
They heard the unmistaking bay
Of blood-hounds, hot upon their trail,
But rushed they on like frightened quail.
Plunged they into the tangled brakes
Amongst wild beasts and poisonous snakes;
Across large streams and bogs they fly
Vowing freedom to gain or die,
But in the distance, still they hear
The bay of blood-hound drawing near.
They hear their master's eager shout
Urging the dogs to drive them out.
Soon do they feel the biting pangs
Of pain, as horrid blood-hounds' fangs
Bury themselves in quivering flesh
And down they fall into the mesh
Of tangled vines, mangled and sore
From whence they rise not evermore,
For those fierce monsters suck their blood
And leave them in their solitude.
And some in swollen streams were drowned
And others caught and firmly bound
And whip was plied to naked backs
While their warm blood flowed in their tracks.
Others with clubs kept hounds at bay
Until at length they got away
From cursed lot of slavery
Tq cherished spot of liberty.
Chief of the class that got away
And live in history today
Are Attucks, Walker, Douglass, Poor,
*Henry "Box Brown" and thousands more*
Of uncalled, unsought, untamed souls
Who strayed from home like sheep from folds,
Escaping beasts and savage bands,
And falling into friendly hands.
Who can describe the close, close, shaves
From captor's hands; or early graves
By water, famine, snake and beast?
Praise they deserve to say the least.
Their zealous efforts clearly prove,
How deep indeed is human love
Of liberty at any cost,
For life without it is but dross.
They had no safe, secure retreat
Where they could rest their weary feet
Aware that freedom had been won;
For place of refuge there was none.
Like fox that doubles on his track,
To shake from trail the howling pack
Of hounds, so dodge and double they,
Until at length they get away.
A rigid law had Congress made
Declaring that no one should aid,
Abet, hide, harbor or defend
A fleeing slave, but apprehend,
Deter, capture and advertise
Him thoroughly, color and size,
Hair, eyes, and feet, his height and name,
That owner might present his claim.
But found they many noble friends
Who harbored them in caves and dens,
Fed them then helped them on their way,
And for their safe deliverance pray.
Had they been caught there was no bail,
They would have spent a time in jail,
Then pay a fine, and furthermore
Make oath to shield them, nevermore.
They thought that human brother-hood
From Adam sprang—and men one blood.
They did not know, they could not see
How man got his authority
Brothers to shackle at his will,
To beat, to drive, to sell, to kill,
To strip of rights to all men due
Without regard to race or hue.
These men had sought to know the Lord,
And felt they got from his dear Word
Just cause to aid men when they saw
These words engraved in sacred law—
"To other men be sure to do
As you would have them do to you."
"He that contributes to the poor
Lends to the Lord, and shall have more."
"He that heaps man with charity
Doeth a favor unto me."
"The merciful, blessed is he
For mercy shall his portion be."
"He that sows kindness in my name
Abundantly shall reap the same."
"Turn not the hungry from thy door
But widows aid and sick and poor."
And other scriptures had they read
Of like import which made them dread
More the displeasure of the Lord
Than with man's laws not to accord;
Feared more the pangs of death and hell
Than shackles of a felon's cell
Rather to hear the Lord's "well done"
Than bask in rays of social sun.
Negro Religion.
Thus slaves were led from heathen ways
To know the Lord and chant his praise
For the fond hope his word had given
That Jesus had prepared in heaven
A place of rest—a loving home
For those who'd cease from him to roam
Who'd war against the Devil's arts
And give to him their contrite hearts.
Some Christian owners, early sought
To have them know that Christ had bought
Their souls from endless misery,
By death upon the cursed tree;
That they had precious dying souls
That he would welcome in his fords,
Were they redeemed from death and hell
He'd take them home with him to dwell.
Some tried their consciences to deceive,
So that they might themselves believe,
That God, when laying out the plan
Of nature's universe for man,
Elected as his firm decree
That sons of Ham servants should be,
To Shem and Japheth's sons and wives
The whole of their unhappy lives.
They prayed to God to give them grace
Abundantly, that they might trace
The meanings of his holy word,
And if from it could be inferred
That bondage was against his will,
Or whether it brought good or ill
To those possessing or possessed,
Of slavery which caused unrest.
The minds of men were soon divided
Upon the point, and some decided
By will, to set their Negroes free;
Some let them buy their liberty;
But the great mass would not consent
To freedom as a settlement,
Or ease of conscience, but read they,
"Servants, their masters must obey "
The Revolutionary War.
This subject had to step aside,
Because the tyrant king had tried
To force upon their heads, taxation,
While giving them no representation.
To this, they failed to give assent,
But urged the people to resent
Injustice then upon them thrust.
To satisfy the British lust.
From ship took they boxes of tea,
Open, and cast them in the sea.
The speakers, bolder every breath,
Shouted for liberty or death.
England, her army prepared
To subjugate all those who dared
Boldly, attempt her laws defy,
And treason's banner bear on high.
On Boston Heights the redcoats stood,
While facing them, in angry mood,
Is gathered a determined band
Of colonists, with clubs in hand,
Vowing the soldiers had to go,
But, dreading all, to strike the blow
That must, from tyrants set them free,
Or multiply their misery.
CRISPUS ATTUCKS.
The sturdy soldiers, solemn-browed,
Standing with loaded muskets, cowed
The bravest of this angry clan,
When there appears a Negro man,
Giant in form, and bravery
Who had escaped from slavery;
And none had better right than he
To strike down human tyranny.
He did not stop to meditate,
And on the danger speculate;
But bounding to the British line
Where bayonets gleam and muskets "shine,
He cried, "Brethren, why stand ye so?"
Forward' Strike down the hated foe!!!
Drive them from town as you desire,
Strike down their arms, they fear to fire!!!
And then a hero's place he won,
By striking down a soldier's gun,
Thus touching off the dreaded spark
To powder horn, which starts the bark
Of those rapacious dogs of war,
Which every man should dread by far
More than cyclones or pestilence,
For they destroy the best of friends.
The soldiers fired and Tttucks fell
As falls the faithful sentinel
Whose musket shot gives the alarm
To those in camp to rise and arm.
He fell first martyr to the cause
Of liberty and righteous laws.
He fell to wake the patriot's ire
And fill his soul with Freedom's fire.
Today a statue stands to tell
Where Attacks, Gray and Caldwell fell.
It stands, a token day and night
To prove that Negroes have a right
Upon the land to lay a claim,
By quit-claims, deed in Attacks' name;
They have a right assuredly
To sing "My country, 'tis of thee."
Bunker Hill.
The sound of fife and roll of drum,
Gave warning that the time had come
For vengeance on the hated foe,
Who dared to lay their comrades low
In death's embrace, and who must be
Driven across the spacious sea.
To Bunker's Hill the patriots hie,
And there begin to fortify.
For well their leaders understand
That Gage would give his men command
With bayonets, the hill to take,
And then those silly rebels rake
With cannon and with musket-ball,
Until, in penitence, they call
For mercy, and give promise, they
The laws of England will obey.
Began they soon to climb the hill
To drive the rebels back, but still,
Behind their works with bated breath
The peasants lie and wait for death.
"Reserve your fire" old Putnam cries,
"Until you see the whites of eyes
Of your oppressors, then aim well,
So that you make each bullet tell."
But when at last the British got
Within a few steps of the spot
For which they had a keen desire,
Old Putnam gave command to fire.
As falls the field of ripened grain
By reapers hands, so fall the slain
Vassals of distant British crown,
By sturdy yeomanry shot down.
Three times these works do they assault
And thrice their ranks are made to halt,
Then, down the hill retreat in shame,
Routed by that unerring aim
Of those despised militiamen,
With homespun garb and sunburned skin,
Who had, as means of self-defense
Been well taught how to use their flints.
Back came these red-coat lines again,
And the militia tried in vain
Adown the hill to drive them back.
But sadly did they fail for lack
Of powder, ball, and bayonet,
The need of which they soon regret,
For now they find that they must yield
To British guns, a well-earned field.
"Forward my boys, we've won the day,"
Cried Pitcairne, and then dead he lay,
Within the works, where he had got,
Before, by Peter Salem shot.
This Salem, and a Salem Poor,
And also several dozen more
Despised black men, some slaves, some free,
Battled that day for liberty.
And so throughout that long drawn strife,
Did many a black man yield his life,
In Freedom's cause, and for his pains,
Was heaped again with bondage's chains;
Though promised that he would be free
When war was done, deceived was he.
For liberty, the lash he got,
And Eight and Justice knew him not.
A Negro had with naked head,
Burst down the door, and pulled from bed
Prescott, a general of high rank,
When Major Barton played a prank
Upon his foes, as through the lines
With twenty men, Prescott he binds,
And back to camp in triumph bore
His prize, while British soldiers swore.
Likewise where-e'er upon the sea
Our navy gained a victory,
Among the men who manned the guns
And rigging, were the sable sons
Of Ham, sleeping amongst the dead,
Or holding high the victor's head;
Braving the storms and raging flood,
And buying manhood with their blood.
War of 1812.
In eighteen twelve, England possessed
With wanton deviltry, impressed
The sailors of the states, to man
Her battleships, and thus began
To try, the second time, to win
By force, her subjects back again
As tributaries to the throne,
Having no statutes of their own.
Again she placed on land and sea,
The best of British soldiery.
At length, at New Orleans they land,
With Packenham in full command.
Jackson, to meet him, had in haste,
Built works of cotton-bales, and placed
His eager soldiers, white and black,
In them, to drive the British back.
Ere there was smell of powder smoke,
Jackson, thus to his black troops spoke.
"Soldiers! Your general is proud
To find 'the nation is so loud
In praise of acts of gallantry,
Performed by you, on land and sea,
When we so nobly freed our lands
From avarice of tyrant hands."
"Well, did the black man do his part;
In action, brave, and stout of heart;
In cold, and hunger, side by side,
You, with the white troops bled and died.
And now my worthy comrades, I
Will not beguile you with a lie,
But swear, in all sincerity,
That if you win, you shall be free."
"Prove now your right to be made free,
By helping drive into the sea,
These hated red-coats, who, today,
Our homes will burn and bear away
As slaves,, your sons and wives, so dear
Unto your hearts. While you now bear
A freeman's arms, you have the right,
Your country's enemies to fight.
"Soldiers, our honored President,
And the great men, who represent
Our nation, in the halls of state,
Through me, shall know and venerate
Your deeds of valor! Look ye there!!!
The crafty enemy is near.
Forward!! Let everyone strike hard,
And victory is your reward."
They heard instructions, and obeyed
Their leaders voice, and, by their aid
The day, the young republic won,
And still, within it, there was none
Who for the colored soldiers stood
To plead their cause as well they should;
But praise was driven from their hearts
By noise of bidding in slave marts.
Insurrections.
That these poor slaves should hatch a plot
Of insurrection, wondered not.
Had they not Britons swept from plains
To see themselves again in chains?
Had they not for their country died
To find its statesmen had all lied?
Had they not proven themselves men
Only to toil as beasts again?
So plotted they to strike a blow,
The white man's rule to overthrow,
By first depriving of their lives,
Masters, their daughters, sons and wives;
Seizing their lands and property,
Setting their own descendants free,
Starting a kingdom of their own,
And warning men leave them alone.
These risings failed, except a few,
Until, in eighteen thirty-two,
There sprang a Negro leader, who
Had nerve to dare, and mind to do;
Who claimed he was a prophet, sent
By God, to visit punishment
Upon the cruel sinful whites
As Israel did the Canaanites.
Thus, by declaring that the Lord
Had bidden him to take the sword,
And, with; it, he must surely kill
The whites, both old and young, until
Not one was left to tell the tale
That he had Negroes held for sale.
Nat Turner soon began to see
His thoughts take root quite rapidly.
Fifty and seven whites were killed, 
And thousands had their warm blood chilled
By this uprising of the blacks,
When heard they of those stunning facts,
That Negroes did for freedom thirst,
And masters should expect the worst
Of horrors poured upon their heads,
By slaves, while sleeping in their beds.
Nat Turner's insurrection failed,
But every Southern white face paled
When he discovered with what ease.
The blacks could murder, if they pleased
Each one of them1, without a thought
That in the act, they would be caught;
That slaves were only held in check
By weighty yokes upon the neck.
They felt the danger was immense;
That they must make in their defense,
Some law the slaves to separate,
So that they could not formulate
Their plans, which once should they succeed,
Could not be checked before they'd lead
What whites they'd left alive, as slaves,
Or heaped the Southland with their graves.
Nat died as every martyr dies,
Glad to become a sacrifice
To cause on which his heart is set,
If, by his dying, he could get
His fond ambition realized,
And whites become so terrorized
By his demoralizing blow,
That they would let their bondsmen go.
Patrols.
Nature's old law, self-preservation,
Is leading thought with men or nation.
When danger lurks in every breeze
Whether in foes or foul disease,
Men then begin to cast aside
The things which certainly divide
Their ranks, and into union come,
To best protect themselves and home.
Thus patrol bands were organized,
And by the law were authorized
To see that Negroes did not mass
Themselves, unless they had a pass
From masters granting them the right
To congregate at day or night;
And it must show the day and date
That they had asked to congregate.
Consent, most slaves did not receive,
So they began to take "french, leave,"
Of their task-masters, after dark,
And, cautiously start on a lark,
To home of lover, wife or friend,
When down upon them would descend
Like hungry wolves upon their prey,
These patrol bands, to their dismay.
Slaves caught by them of clothes Were stripped,
And with the rawhide soundly whipped,
Without regard to sex or age,
The state of health or mighty rage
Of the offender, neither cared,
Their masters try to have them spared,
That thing called "slavery" must abide
Though every slave should loose his hide.
Patrols would often horses ride,
And slaves, to trees, stout grape vines tied,
So as to reach a rider's waist,
Then patrols call, and flee in haste,
Would start the riders in pursuit,
When suddenly they'd take a shoot
Through space, and land upon their spines,
By sudden contact with the vines.
Agitation of Abolition.
Next was begun an agitation
By some, to force emancipation
Of bondsmen, or, at least, to see
That not another state should be
Admitted to the federation,
Which stood for act or declaration,
That any man should ever be
Classed as another's property.
And soon did slavery's rising tide,
Men of the North and South divide
Into a crowd for abolition
And one that clamored for secession.
While slaves, the bone of their contention,
Were helping to create dissension,
As thousands fleeing North are found
By way of railroad "underground."
Under-ground Rail-road.
This road consisted in the main,
Of men, with covered wagon train,
Who shielded slaves, hid them, and fed,
Then, with them in their wagons, sped
Onward, at night, unto the place
Where men of the Caucasian race
Believed as taught by God's own word:
"Who helps the poor lends to the Lord."
And those good men believeing thus,
And having as a stimulus,
The pleasing promise of the Lord:
"The merciful will I reward,"
At laws of men took no affright,
Bait in this: work took great delight,
They felt a starry crown they'd win,
If they befriended those poor men.
This road on Southern soil began,
And through the Northern states it ran,
Until the boundry line was crossed
Of foreign shores, where owners lost
In man, as goods, to claim a right,
And where was there no slavery blight,
But where each man, himself felt free,
Though not called "Land of liberty."
Likewise, the Northern states "black laws,''
Did much indeed to help the cause
Of abolition sentiment,
Though made to be a detriment
To those who sought to change the fate
Of Negroes, they but consummate
The work which caused the agitation,
And brought the blacks, emancipation.
Grew burdens harder every day,
And harder did the black men pray
To him Who rules the universe,
That He'd in mercy move the curse
Of servitude, from shackled limbs,
That they could sing old Zion's hymns,
And high in worship hold the head
While none, them dared to make afraid.
As sighing wind in pine woods moans,
So day and night, were heard the groans
Of souls afflicted, stifled, hushed
In sorrow, for the day before,
Some mother saw the child she bore,
Snatched from her arms and sold away,
To meet no more till judgment day.
So daily was each, slave's heart stirred
With grief, although was heard no word
Of protest, but with souls aflame,
They learned to trust the holy name
Of Him, who in deep pity, came,
And freely bore the cross of shame,
That those sad hearts, loaded with grief,
Could find in Him a sweet relief.
And when the day's enchanting light
Succumbed to sombre shades of night,
When from their secret chambers! creep
The stars that nightly vigil keep,
When moon-beams peep on earth below,
And phantasmagoric shadows throw,
When birds have ceased their songs of love
And hushed the mourn of turtle dove,
When nature reveleth in sleep,
Except those prowling beasts that creep
With muffled tread, in search of prey,
Or watch-dog holding thieves at bay,
In lonely spot, with face to ground,
Souls bowed in fervent prayer are found,
With trembling voices soft and low,
They thus tell Jesus of their woe.
"Lord, dis your weak servants bow,
In humbleness, to tell dee how
I longs ter die an' be wid dee
Fur eber, in eternity.
My Lord, you knows jes why I moans,
You knows de meanin' ob my groans;
If on my head, your jestice fell,
My naked soul would be in hell."
"Lord, you has hearn my prayers befo'
When I was layin' at hell's dark do',
You promised dat you'd not fersake
Your chilluns, who your cross would take,
But what we axed yer fer in faith,
You would be sure ter grant in grace;
Dat you cant stan' ter hear us pray,
An' from us turn your ears erway."
"Dear Lord, you heared ol' Daniel pray,
When in de lion's den he lay;
Shaderach, Meshach, an' Bednego,
Prom, out de fire you heared, you know;
Jonah you heared from belly o' whale,
An' now my marster, please dont fail
Ter hear my prayer, if I prays right,
An' turn my darkness into light."
"Lord, I am but a feeble worm;
Hide me I pray, from howling storm
Of cruel men who daily mock,
Anchor my soul wifin de Rock;
Make hase an' help, 0 Lord, come quick,
Fer now my weary soul is sick.
O tender lam' come here I pray,
An' break dese slavery chains erway."
"Lord, you said "Seek an' you shall fin',"
Come now an' ease my troubled min'.
You bid us ax an' You would give;
Please make us free so we kin live
Nearer each day, my God ter dee
In faith, hope, love, an' charity.
You said, if we'd obey your laws
You'd fight our battles, plead our cause."
"As you led Israel froo de sea,
Come now dear Lord, deliver me;
As Pharaoh in de sea you drowned,
So do my enemies confound,
Please throw dissensions inder gang,
Den dem, as high as Haman hang.
Lord, I believes dat you is just
Den dese cole chains, remove you mus’."
"You said dat dem you jined in heart
No one should dare assunder part,
But my or marster, (cuss his hide),
Sol' my companion from my side;
An' while in agony I lay,
Dey come an' sol' my chile erway;
Dey lef me nuffin here ter luv,
Cep' you Dear Jesus, You, erbuv."
"You knows Lord, why dese tears I shed:
Deep waters overcomes my head,
My feet am stuck in miry clay,
Come now an' mbve it all erway;
You said ten Christians prayin' right,
Could er thousan' devils put ter flight;
You said you in our midst would be,
If too or three would jes ergree."
"O Lord, my way is very dark;
Sometimes I thinks I hears de bark
Of hell-hounds howlin' on my track;
Come my good Lord, an' drive 'em back.
You will not let er sparrow fall,
Come ter my rescue when I call;
You clothed de lillies of de fiel'
O let dy bosom be my shiel’."
"Lord, other refuge I have none,
So you mus' save an' you erlone,
Marster, de trufe I mus' declar'
My load is more dan I kin bar';
Come lay dese slavery chains hard by,
An' I will serve you till I die,
Free me from cruel marsters here,
An' I'll raise chilluns in dy fear."
"Sometimes when I kneels down ter pray,
I feels dat you is fur erway;
Sometimes I feels so fur I stray
Dat you can't hear me when I pray.
Sometimes my faith grows very slack,
But den your spirit draws me back;
You promised jestice wid Your lip,
An' I won't let your mem'ry slip.
"O Lord, in dee I'll put my trus'
Tho You should turn me back to dus',
Jes how kin ennybody pray
Whep kep' in bondage night and day?
How could I still believe in Dee
Ef you should turn yer back on me?
An' now my marster, come dis way,
Dont let yer chariot wheels delay."
The Vial of Wrath.
Thus hourly, came up to the throne
Of God, The Just, a prayer, a groan,
A query, weird, but innocent,
And yet, with faith so pertinent,
That He who rules the earth, was stirred,
And to his angels, gave the word
The vial of his wrath to take,
And down to earth a journey make.
Then North and South its contents pour
Causing to rise a mighty roar
Of anger, as to whether the
New states admitted, slaves should be,
Or free from enforced servitude
When taken in the sisterhood
Of states, called the confederation
Of America, a mighty nation.
These angels at the word of God
Took the vial and the chastening rod
Of heavenly justice, and the sword,
The power of the avenging Lord
And swiftly down to earth they came
And scattered in the Savior's name
Between these sections, bitter strife,
Which threatened soon the nation's life.
The Lord had chosen by this plan
To prove the Negro was a man,
Like other men in flesh and thought,
And that through him should come to naught
Those declarations daily made
By men who on his earnings preyed,
That he, no eminence could earn,
Nor could he books and letters learn.
Frederick Douglas.
A former slave at length was found,
Of judgment quick, of reason sound,
Of bearing grand, of spirit bold,
With character of the highest mould.
In speech, endowed with eloquence,
Which constantly he used against
That horrid form of knavery,
Practiced in human slavery.
When but a youth his heart rebelled
Against the thought of being held
In men's esteem as goods or chattel
Traded at will like common cattle.
He was not black, nor was he white
But of mixed blood, and sad his plight!
His father's name he dared to own;
His mother could bequeath him none.
He felt he had a right to be
Like his father's sons with wills aS free
To go and come, to think or do,
To give and take, to win or woo,
In his own way to worship God;
His course through life, unhampered, plod
By ardent toil to eminence,
In spite of adverse elements.
'Twas thus he reasoned night and day
Until at length, he planned the way
To break his bonds and hurriedly
To make a break for liberty.
Attempt he made and it was done,
Though in his flight, he had to run
The gauntlet made by legal lights
To bar black men from human rights.
At length his liberty was bought,
And his receptive mind was taught
The paths of knowledge, truth and right,
The weapons' needed in his fight
For manhood rights of colored men,
Which he long urged with tongue and pen,
Till men imbued with righteousness,
Would rise to lighten his distress.
The thunder of his mighty voice
Left honest men no other choice
As to what side they'd lend their aid,
In fierce fought contest to be made
To prove whether mankind should be
Held by this nation slave or free,
Or if the constitution lied
In its preamble amplified.
Through all the Northern states he went,
Arousing public sentiment
Till men beheld the grave mistake
Which people in the past did make,
Who held that Negroes never could
Possess themselves of fortitude,
And learning of sufficient weight
To gain attention in debate.
His soul aflame with fire seemed;
His e3res with inspiration gleamed;
His voice commanding, rich and deep ;
His gestures graceful in their sweep;
His. stature noble, comely, grand;
His bearing princely, and his stand
For Negro freedom, fearless, bold;
His words spellbound his hearers hold.
But Douglass was not all alone
Amongst the Negroes who had shown
That learn could they like other mien
To speak with force, and wield the pen
With power, and with grace
And helping thereby much the case
Of those who argued 'twas a sin
To dwarf the intellects of men.
Bait through all sections of the North,
Enlightened blacks were springing forth
To fame and fortune, and whose deeds
Did wonders to uproot the seeds
Of thraldom on this continent,
And for the change of sentiment
More friendly to the Negro race
Then only subjects of disgrace.
White Friends.
Soon with these Negro giants stood
White men of honor, brave and good,
Determined, zealous in the cause
Of human rights; not for applause
Of fickle men, not for reward
Or tempting gold; but they abhorred
Of men in chains the very thought,
Driven like beasts, and sold, and bought.
Few were the numbers they could boast
When firm they stood at duty's post,
Where every act was criticized
And they by friends were ostracized;
But firmer grew they in the cause,
And harder fought to change the laws,
So that America would be
In truth, "The land of liberty."
Good Lundy battled through the press
Against this form of wickedness;
Old Greely sang the self same tune
Through his great organ—"The Tribune,"
But agitators, there were none,
That equaled William Lloyd Garrison,
Who, by his enemies was mobbed,
His papers burned, his office robbed.
By percutors sent to jail,
But not a moment did he quail,
Nor from his former purpose swerve,
But with a hero's grit and nerve
Dared he to wrestle with disgrace,
And loss of prestige with his race,
If by so doing he could see
All black men set at liberty.
The other champions of the race
Were Wendall Philips, Seward, Chase,
Thaddeus Stephens, Cassius M. Clay
And dear Charles Sumner, whose display
Of oratory, facts, and zeal
Soon battered down the cherished shield
Used by slave owners in their fight
To prove in slaves, inherent right.
Slavery received its saddest blow
From the pen of Harriet Beecher Stowe,
Who taught the world to see aright
How slavery was the nation's blight,
While on the cruel overseer
Her censuring was most severe,
And Negro traders, heartless, mean,
Immoral vultures, first were seen.
She showed how men were bought and sold
To satisfy the lust for gold.
And on a lofty plane she stood
And taught the common brotherhood
Of man and fatherhood of God,
And that the stern, unswerving rod
Of Justice, would afflict the land
Should the walls of human slavery stand.
Her book, "Cabin of Uncle Tom,"
From Southern men, produced a storm
Of protest, while to people North,
Those well directed lines set forth
The shameful, baneful, blighting sin,
Of ownership of other men,
Till the nation's sinking pulse was roused
To see the bondsman's cause espoused.
John Brown.
But deep as was the Southern ire
Towards the men who sought to fire
Against their cause, the Northern mind,
A greater cause for hate we find
Had they, and moments filled with dread
As down on slavery's cursed head,
John Brown, at Harper's Ferry fell,
Wringing from slavery its death knell.
Each, great reform, its martyrs had
Whose deeds heroic were called mad,
Wild projects of a diseased mind,
But which, in after days we find
Was but a flash of inspiration
To prick the conscience of a nation
Or state, grown callous, morbid, dead,
Towards the right to turn its head.
Brown's life was but the incarnation
Of courage, grit, determination,
Push, daring, faithfulness, devotion,
Pluck, coolness, truth, and constant motion,
Which in himself could see no beauty
Other than that which came from duty
Well performed as best he knew it,
And the chance he had to do it.
In his mind he calculated
How the slaves emancipated
Best could be, and he decided
On the blow, and then confided
To his friends, his plans of action
Which he knew would cause distraction,
And the greatest consternation
Of his day and generation.
He, with twenty men as daring,
Each the other's purpose sharing,
Calm, determined, brave, and sober—
The seventeenth day 'twas of October
Fifty-nine, the fort assaulted,
But his enterprise was halted,
And a hero grew by dying
Thus, the black man's freedom buying.
On the way to hangman's halter,
Not a moment did he falter
Except to gather to his breast,
A Negro child, and softly press
Upon its lips, a burning kiss,
While guards and rabble curse and hiss,
Thus showing those who stand near by
For right and truth he'd gladly die.
Within the heart of every Negro,
John Brown remains their greatest hero;
Who, in his death and past behavior,
Is likened to the blessed Savior
Who gave his life upon the tree,
That man, from sin, should be made free;
While Brown gave up his life to know
Black men would into freemen grow.
His body laid they in the clay
But his proud spirit swept away
The cornerstone on which had stood
The firm, united sisterhood
Of states, which had been one in heart,
But now, in anger torn apart
By the very cause for which had died
This soul immortal, sanctified.
Divided Sentiment.
The breach grew wider day by day,
And louder did the black men pray
That God would raise another Brown
With Justice's sword to batter down
The crumbling walls of slavery
And muster men of bravery
To strike another fatal blow
Like Brown's, till thralldom came to woe.
The people's minds were much divided
So that they were no longer guided
By their old party politicians,
With their same threadbare propositions,
Wherewith to reach a compromise,
On slavery, the shameful vice,
Which held the nation in its grip
Nor would agree to let it slip.
To further show their discontent,
The voters split on president.
Four candidates were in the field,
Not one would to the other yield.
Thus Douglas, Breckenridge, and Bell,
And Lincoln battled for a spell
Like gladiators of the past,
To have men's votes for their cause cast.
Bell's doctrine was: "That hold we should
The constitution as it stood."
And Breckenridge's motto was, to fight
For slave expansion and states' right:
Douglas believed in slave assertion
But stood also for states' coercion;
Lincoln stood for freedom of the nation
By gradual emancipation.
Secession and Sumpter.
Secession's parliament was held,
Which sent out word the South rebelled
Gainst laws and customs, arms and rates
And flag of the United States;
Then set they up a government,
And chose Jeff Davis, president.
A statesman of much note was. he
Who championed human slavery.
On South Carolina's jagged coast,
The rebel chieftains led a host
Of well armed men, who made demand
Upon that little Spartan band
Who formed Fort Sumter's garrison,
That they surrender fort and gun,
Haul down the gallant stripes and stars,
And hoist instead the stars and bars.
The gallant Anderson refused
And then the dogs of war were loosed,
-The echo of a cannon shell
Upon the startled nation fell.
Slowly, did drowsy Justice wake,
And vengeance's cup in anger take,
And, of its wrath, pour out a flood
Till the sinful land was drenched in blood.
The fort received a leaden hail
Yet its defenders did not quail,
But answered rebel shell with shell,
Upholding country's honor well.
The rebels, increase force applied,
Nor would their leaders be denied
Till from the fort and its redoubt
With arms and flags those Yanks marched out.
Of Sumpter's fall the nation hears
And Lincoln calls for volunteers
To shoulder arms, from hamlet, town,
And state, to crush rebellion down;
And to his call, on every side,
Men came to camp, a steady tide,
Giving up daily occupation
To shed their life's blood for the nation.
Negroes Denied the Right to Enlist.
In front of those enlistment stations
Daily, the Negro stood in patience
Asking that he should have the right
The nation's haughty foes to fight.
Now were his prayers for aid denied
And he was rudely thrust aside
And told to mind his business, for
The struggle was a "white-man's war."
    And, seemingly that was the fact,
For whether states could break the pact
Which linked them in confederation,
And set up a separate nation,
Or whether once a government
Was formed by conquest or consent
Ne'er could there be a dissolution
Unless it came by revolution.
Was held by men to be enough
To cause the use of sterner stuff
Than argument, and resolution,
Or digests on the constitution,
To prove that not an inch they'd yield,
But on the bloody battle field,
With sword and gun and cannon shell
They'd die for cause they loved so well.
No living statesman had the thought
That in this conflict they'd be brought
To answer if this land should be
From slavery forever free.
Nor would the whites have left their farms
And factories, to take up arms,
Soon to be filling heroes' graves,
If they had known they fought for slaves.
But God moves in mysterious ways
That men may on his wonders gaze.
With wings, he clothes the lowly worm,
And speaks to earth in howling storm.
He bends the lightning to his will,
He bids, and angry winds are still;
He frowns, and earth begins to quake;
He wills, and worlds from nothing wake.
His purposes He keeps concealed,
Until by acts they are revealed.
He willed that slavery should go,
In spite of all that men could do;
That men might strive in every way
To bar the Negroes from: the fray,
But that conditions would arise
That would demand their services.
Bull Run.
At length the hostile armies met
At Bull Run, and the soil they wet
With brethren's heated blood and tears,
Which would like water flow for years;
For, by such sacrifice alone,
The nation could to God atone
For heart-aches, deaths and misery
Produced by human slavery.
Great was the nation's consternation,
When it received the information
That Northern arms were put to flight
By rebel hosts, in their first fight;
And deafening was the joyous cry
Of rebels, o'er their victory;
And harder did the Negroes pray
When heard they first news of the fray.
But deep as was the country's gloom
O'er vanquished arms, she found no room
Within her ranks for Negro men,
Who begged that they be taken in;
But Irish, German, Russian, Pole,
And Frenchmen did their names enroll,
Who fought not for the Union's sake,
But for the money they could make.
Other Battles.
Met they again at Maiverne Hill,
Fair Oaks, South Mountain, and Boonesville,
At Warrenton and Fredericksburg,
Seven Pines, Anteitam, or Sharpsburg,
Manassas Junction, Murfreesboro,
And Pea Ridge, could be heard the bellow
Of belching guns, and screeching shell,
As thousands in each army fell.
So met they at Mechanicsville,
And Harper's Ferry, Berry'sville,
Roanoke Island, New Orleans,
Shiloh, and Donaldson, where scenes
Of military skill were wrought,
And fierce and bloody battles fought,
Where each combatant's loss sustained,
Balanced, account with that they'd gained.
Nor could the yankees make advance
'Gainst chivalry of Southern lance;
One day could they a victory claim
And on the next retreat in shame;
One day a noted general praise,
The next, remove him in disgrace.
Not one placed in authority
Equalled the brilliant R.E. Lee.
Negroes Contrabands of War.
Began the South to use the blacks
As cooks and teamsters for their packs,
To bridge the streams and build redoubts,
And trees to fell for wagon routes.
To have done by these Negroes sooty,
The army's heavy fatigue duty;
Relieving thus thousands of men
To mingle in the battle's din.
But that awoke the sleeping North
To realize the Negroes' worth.
Since built they works Yank's way to bar,
Why not as contraband of war
Be given right to wear the blue,
And heavy fatigue duty do;
Relieving thus those valiant men,
Who yearned for firing lines again?
At length was tried the novelty,
And a success it proved to be.
No task so hard, no hour too long;
No risk so great but that these strong,
Muscular limbs and willing minds,
With eagerness and skill combine,
And prove to army lords at length
Were those black boys a tower of strength.
But fiercer still the conflict grew,
And not a Southern state withdrew
Its soldiers from secession's cause,
Nor in its work of treason pause;
The humble slaves were not deceived;
The days of freedom they believed
Were coming rapidly their way,
And strong in faith they daily pray.
Failures of Yankee Generals.
Each Federal Commanding Chief
Who clashed with Lee was brought to grief.
McClernard tried at first, but failed,
And George McClellan next was hailed
As conquering hero—but, alas!
As shatters fallen pane of glass,
So, broken were his strongest lines
By the force of Lee's martial engines.
Halleck then took McClellan's place,
But could not stand Lee's rapid pace.
Next tried they out the dashing Pope,
But soon he failed with Lee to cope.
McClellan seemed to be in prime
And tried, but failed the second time.
Felt Burnside, he could turn the trick
But Lee's men fixed his business quick.
Then Hooker, known as "fighting Joe,"
Believed that he could overthrow
In tilt at arms, this southern knight,
Were they to meet in finish fight.
The nation his. petition grants,
But broken was his heavy lance
By forcible compact with the shield
Of southerners on battle-field.
Emancipation Proclamation and Arming of Blacks.
The first day of the year A.D.,
Eighteen hundred and sixty-three,
Issued Lincoln his proclamation
Of Negro slave emancipation,
Thus adding strength to cause of the nation,
But filling the south with desperation.
Swore they to fill the lands with graves
Before they'd liberate their slaves.
Recruiting the Blacks.
Reluctantly, at length they yield,
And from the cane and cotton-field,
From turpentine and orange groves,
The Negroes flocked in groups and droves.
They care not what they're bid to do,
So that they wear the cherished blue;
They care not what may them befall,
So that they answer bugle's call.
Let hunger, cold and hardships come,
So that they march by beat of drum;
Let sword and bullet end each: life,
So that they follow sound of fife;
Of home and riches give them none,
So that they handle loaded gun;
Whether they died it mattered not,
If at their lords they got a shot.
Then came the day for which they prayed,
That they no longer be afraid
Their lords to answer blow with blow,
Or use a gun instead of hoe.
Happy the hour, sacred the place,
They'd meet their masters face to face,
And, savagely each other fight,
Until in death they'd vent their spite.
So fast come they to meeting place,
Which serves as a recruiting placed
That their petitions were denied,
Because they could not be supplied
With clothing, arms, accoutrements,
And rations, the habiliments
Needed in every soldier's life,
Him to prepare for ardent strife.
Reared to accept authority
From childhood to majority,
To act when given a command,
Without having to understand
The purpose of or reason why,
With strict command should they comply,
A hardship then, they found it not
When burdened with a soldier's lot.
Awkward and ignorant were they,
But tried their orders to obey.
What was their lack in sense or skill,
They overpaid in pluck and will. 
To free their kinsmen from their chains
Was the one thought that racked their brains.
Slaves had they been, and well they knew
What men in chains had to go through.
White Officers Refused to Lead Them.
But now arose another cry
Against the Negro soldiery;
No officers were to be had
Who would accept command so bad;
None cared to stake his reputation,
By leading men of such low station,
Who, in obedience had been reared,
And white men's faces always feared.
The Revolution they forgot;
How black men answered shot with shot.
Of New Orleans they had no thought
How bravely black men british fought;
Forgot they Perry's victory,
Who used black men on Lake Erie;
They needed history to tell
How Attucks first for freedom fell.
At Monmouth and at Valley Forge
Met they the soldiers of King George;
At Trenton and at Yorktown, they
Were found in the thickest of the fray;
Not once had any one denied
That they'd proved true wherever tried;
That any doubt should now arise
Whether they'd fight, was a surprise.
The First Colored Regiment (1st South Carolina) and Port Hudson.
To Florida at length was sent
The South Carolina regiment
Of colored troops with the intent
Of making an experiment.
Their officers firmly believed
That they would never be deceived
In these black boys when the time came
On war's grim fields to gather fame.
A frowning fortress, strong and good,
For Southern arms, Port Hudson stood.
To capture it Hunter had planned,
With the mixed troops of his command.
Arrived at length the fateful hour,
When colored men must face a shower
Of flying missies, shells and shot,
To prove that they would falter not.
Charge!" rang out the sharp command,
And, up the hill, in order grand,
With eager strides, these troopers go,
Anxious to strike a telling blow
On those who held them in their grip,
And on their persons plied the whip,
Who, them on equal terms must meet,
And with cold steel their owners greet.
The rebels fire, they feel the blow;
They waver, Do they falter? No!
By the right, flank their lines deploy,
Then face to front, with shouts of joy;
Madly towards the fort they run
Not stopping once to fire a gun;
While right and left the rebel shell
Filled with explosives, bursting, fell.
But on, not heeding death, they go,
When falls brave Captain Callioux,
The black hero, who, filled with shot,
Return unto the rear would not,
But shouting, "Forward, boys," he fell,
Dying of wounds from bursting shell,
His white companions standing by
Were taught how blacks could bravely die.
"Colonel, this flag in honor'll fly,
Or God shall know the reason why,"
Spake Planciancios, just before
The flag he into battle bore,
And ere the ground with blood was red,
A cannon ball took off his head.
Stretched were his limbs on the thirsty sod,
While he reported unto God!
Two Sergeants at his banner caught,
And, to possess it fiercely fought,
Till death, by shot from rebel gun,
Declared who'd be the honored one.
This banner leading, on they go,
Anxious to grapple with the foe;
Nor can the rbs this war-cry stop:
"The bottom rail is now on top!"
The moat they reach, and there they meet
A deadly fire and they retreat;
They halt, they wheel, their ranks they close,
Then charge again upon their foes.
Seven times advance and fall back they,
Because they cannot find a way;
Charge as they will, to reach the fort,
Because of depth and width of moat.
At length the curtains of the night
Upon them fall, stopping the fight;
And twinkling stars their halo shed
O'er bloody field of Negro dead.
Peeps down the moon in sympathy
Upon black men in agony
From gasping wounds from which they lie
Stretched on the battle-field to die.
To take the fort, these men had failed,
Yet they with loud acclaim were Hailed.
Why do men praise, what had they done
To win respect from every one?
Why do white soldiers raise a shout
When these black boys came near about?
Why do the rebels rant and swear
When Negro soldiers' names they hear?
There must be cause why men despised
As were these men, are lionized;
Something they must have done averse
That rebel leaders fume and curse.
Sing of their valor, let all know
Why men had changed toward them so;
Speak out, that every man who reads
May know of Negro soldiers' deeds!
Their pluck had opposition moved
'Gainst them as soldiers, when they proved
That cravens they had never been,
But brave were they as any men!
Taught they the 'stonished world to know
How nobly would they strike a blow
The nation's life to help preserve,
And in her cause in honor serve!
Stepped they the biting words of scorn
which pricked their hearts as poisonous thorn
Flesh punctured by it, sore inflames,
Or horrid fang of serpent maims,
And poisons those within whose veins
A particle of it remains.
All were amazed, had none a breath
Of scorn for men who laughed at death!
Proud felt they of the name they'd won;
That day a mighty deed they'd done;
They'd sounded in the nation's ears
Where she'd find willing volunteers,
Ready to answer battle call,
Fearless of hissing cannon ball,
Happy to suffer, bleed and die,
If thus they might a man's rights buy.
No more had men reason to doubt
That black men would their blood pour out
In storming fortress or redoubt,
Or that their hearts were brave and stout;
No more could scoffers prophesy
That belching guns would make them fly,
Or that a single white man's face
Could more two hundred Negroes chase.
A rain of shells they bravely bore,
And then they beg to be once more
In battle sent where bullets, singe,
That they their comrades' deaths avenge;
But they no longer plead in vain,
For to the nation was it plain
That the rebellion would decline
With black men on the firing line.
Milliken's Bend.
Next they their country's flag defend
From rebel hoards at Milliken's Bend.
Their command fourteen hundred strong
Regaled themselves with mirth and song,
When suddenly upon them fell
The unmistaken rebel yell,
And furious also grew they
As heard they hated blood hounds bay.
Brought up the rebels a brigade
Of seasoned troops, which they arrayed
In battle form, then sent a tender
Of life to all who would surrender.
And had those rebels taken pains
To carry handcuffs, ropes and chains,
With which to bind those Negroes well
And give them here a taste of hell.
First were the blood-hounds brought in play,
But these the Negroes laid away
With butts of guns and bayonet,
And next in turn their masters met.
"No quarter!" was the rebel cry,
And black men knew they had, to die,
Whether they yielded arms or not,
And they in fight much fiercer got.
The rebels charge with deafening yell,
While in great heaps their best men fell
Spattered with blood, wounded and dead,
While on their maddened comrades sped,
With shot for shot and steel for steel,
Till from, the shock their comrades' reel;
Then in confusion break and fly,
Leaving their wounded men to die.
Five cannon were to rebels lost;
Three hundred dead had Jordan crossed;
Five hundred wounded rebels moan;
Two hundred rebel prisoners groan
With inward wrath and indignation,
And great was their mortification
That they submissive had to be
To hated blacks' authority.
Wagner.
Fort Wagner gave the world a light
On how the blacks in blue would fight.
A regiment was mustered North,
The Massachusetts' Fifty-Fourth),
Which was of colored men composed,
And they full confidence imposed
In their commander, Colonel Shaw,
A braver man none ever saw.
With frowning guns Fort Wagner stood,
With rebels manned, in warlike mood;
Her garrison had confidence
That well were they for her defense
Prepared, the bravest men to halt
And if insiege or by assault
Make they attempt the fort to take
With raking fire their lines to break.
At length the Yankee lines advance,
But saw they stood a sorry chance
The fort to capture from the foe,
But still they into battle go.
In place of danger sending forth
The Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth,
Who question not the reason why
In forlorn cause they're made to die.
These men known always to obey,
Stopped not to question why should they
As oxen, sent to butchers' knives,
In helpless cause yield up their lives.
"Forward!" they heard their leader shout,
And instantly wheeled they about
And charged, although they knew full well
Were they to meet a leaden hell.
The open fields swept they across
Only to suffer fearful loss;
As all around them cannons roared,
And deadly muskets, bullets poured
In steady flow, a leaden rain,
Which through their lines cut many a lane;
Still on went they o'er plain and moat,
Until in joy reached they the fort.
They carry bastion and redoubt;
Drive they those brave defenders out;
They found in walls of fort a breach,
And this, through blood, at length tRey reach;
Mount they upon the parapet,
But down went they from fierce onset
Of those determined boys in gray,
Who fought like wounded beasts at bay.
The first to fall was Colonel Shaw;
And instantly was filled with awe
His regiment of colored men,
For midst the fearful battle din
No voice heard they to cheer them on,
No sure support to lean upon,
No one was there who seemed to know
How should they strike another blow.
Sadly they stagger from the field,
Unwilling still the ground to yield;
With shattered ranks and troubled minds
Reach they the halting reserve lines.
The fact to learn that they alone
The rebels' raking fire had borne,
And had reserves given support
Taken had been the sullen fort.
Then charged those fresh white regiments,
And, from the rebel battlements
Those guns just silent get in play,
And soon retreat they in dismay.
Lay fifteen hundred Union dead
On battle-field, and it is said
Of those the earth had taken back,
Ninety per cent of them were black.
Their record is their monument
To greet them on this continent.
Must live their gallant deeds as long
As heroes speak through verse and song.
Their spirits rise to question why
Should men their children's rights deny.
Their graves are landmarks men to shame,
Who in derision call their name.
So let the just historian tell
How those black boys in honor fell
On James' Island and Hatcher's Run,
Fair Oaks, Paducah, Deep Bottom,
At Petersburg and Chapin's Farm,
And by their pluck the rebs alarm.
Win they great honor at Farmville,
Wilson's Wharf and Overton Hill.
Fort Pillow.
Ye tender hearted mortals, weep,
As hear ye how brave men like sheep
At Fort Pillow in meekness stood,
And there were murdered in cold blood!
Thousands of hardened men in gray
To storm this fortress, came that day;
Six hundred men, both white and black,
Within, attempt to drive them back.
Withstands, the fort the fierce onslaught,
And then a flag of true was brought,
Asking that they capitulate,
As that would not necessitate
The play of guns, carnage and strife,
And needless sacrifice of life;
For it was plain no hopes had they
To keep the rebels long at bay.
But armistice and flag of truce
Gave chance for shameful rebel ruse,
For, while they parley 'neath the walls
The rebel army on them falls
Like frenzied beasts on helpless prey,
And dastardly begins to slay
Like dogs that feeble garrison.
A crime without comparison.
Spared not the youthful nor the old;
Spared not the timid nor the bold;
Spared not the women nor the men;
Spared not the wounded, oh the sin!
Spared not the white troops nor the black;
And by their damning, brutal act,
Steeped they themselves in infamy,
In ridicule and villiany.
Sacred the spot where martyred blood
Is on its country's altars poured!
Adored the hero, black or white,
Who yields up life in the cause of right;
Preserved that nation which succeeds
In keeping green its heroes deeds.
Cursed be "the soldier who would dare
Of conquered foe to harm a hair.
Were men reminded "War is hell,"
As men by shot and sabre fell.
As fall the fields of ripened grain
By the hands of reapers, or the slain
Of buck or birds by hunter's gun,
So dead and wounded in the sun
Lay, with damp earth a dying bed
And pack, a pillow for the head.
As ebbs and flows the fickle tide
Of war, from North to Southern side,
So ebbed and flowed the minds of those
Who labored for or still opposed
The giving arms to Negro men,
And give them chance a name to win
As soldiers brave, worthy and true,
Who mocked at death and dangers too.
Said some, a coward would he be
When facing fire of musketry;
Some said he'd run from battle-field
If he were threatened with cold steel;
Some held he could not be controlled
If right were his a gun to hold;
Some said his arms he would disgrace,
Were he to fill a soldier's place.
Said others, that they couldn't see,
That now the colored men were free
By sudden impulse of the nation,
Why there should be a hesitation
When they again for arms applied,
To let them battle on the side
Of Union, right and liberty,
To give the land tranquility.
Negro Soldier's Welcomed.
But on the tide of battle goes,
And fiercer still the conflict grows.
Each battle fought would nearer tend
To bring the conflict to an end.
The Union cause fresh victories won
Since had been given hope and gun
To colored soldiers, while the South
Of army recruits had a drought.
No longer was there army corps
In which no Negro small arms bore.
The army on Potomac's banks
Had thousands serving in her ranks;
The army of the Tennessee
Their presence welcomed heartily;
The army of the Cumberland
Had Ham's dark sons in its command.
The army serving in the West
To Negro valor could attest;
The army of the James had stayed
In Dixie land by black men's aid.
As scouts and spies, formed they the key
To Sherman's march through South to sea;
In Sheridan's splendid cavalry,
Bore they their part most gallantly.
When Richmond fell in Yankee hands
The trooper black 'mongst victors stand;
At Appomattox, there was he
When Grant received the sword of Lee;
On honor's wall carved he his name,
Gained he a place in halls of fame,
At the bar of justice proud he stood,
Asking the price of patriot's blood.
Negroes Not Called Criminals.
While some to save the Union fought,
The bulk remained at home and wrought
With might and main, supplies to raise
For Southern arms, so that the days
Of their enslavement stretched had been
By arduous toil of colored men,
Who'd toil in sadness through the day,
And in the night for freedom pray.
Saw they their masters go to war
And knew full well what fought they for;
But patiently bore they the yoke,
And few of vengeance ever spoke,
Nor planned to rise and burn or slay
Defenseless heads that sleeping lay.
The mistress ruled in the master's place,
And they obeyed in childlike grace.
Nor had they then to burn or shoot
Or lynch a vicious colored brute,
Or threaten to exterminate
The Negro race, or speculate
Upon their speedy separation
As fiends—a menace to the nation;
Nor had a woman thought of fear
When were there trusty black men near.
Freedom in '65 Real.
In April, eighteen sixty-five,
The rebel forces ceased to strive
Against the federal government,
And conquered, though not penitent.
To Grant surrendered they their arms,
And on parole went to their farms
Much weakened from their many fights,
But still believers in states' rights.
'Twas then and not in sixty-three
That Negroes learned that they were free;
'Twas then their hearts could witness bear
That God above would answer prayer;
'Twas then did' they their voices raise
Towards his throne in shouts of praise;
'Twas then felt they, and not till then,
That God had no respect of men.
The Christian Negroes, firm, devout,
Would pray to Jesus, sing and shout,
And tell of his redeeming love,
Whereby he did from them remove
The chains of bondage and of sin;
So now had they sweet peace within.
From men and Satan free were they,
And Christ alone need they obey.
Though sweet to them was freedom's charm,
Still toiled they gladly on the farm;
The crops they house, the stock they tend,
To wounded Southern soldiers lend
They kind assistance, dress their wounds,
Rebuild their houses, till their grounds,
Secret their goods from greedy hands
Of plunder-hunting soldier bands.
WMle in the day they labored long,
Filled was the night with mirth and song;
The sound of banjo and the beat
Of happy colored dancers' feet,
And all around was; filled the air
With songs of praises and of prayer
Of those, rejoiced that they could meet
Unharmed, around the mercy seat.
Leaving Old Homes and Masters.
Now comes the day they learn to know
That must they from their old homes go;
Must from the care of masters part
And for themselves, in life must start.
The sober-minded fear the step.
And they, with masters/sorely wept
O'er turn of tide in their relations,
Which forced them from the old plantations.
Nor till that moment was it clear
How heart to heart of each was dear;
Not till that moment was it shown
How God's own hand the seeds had sown
Of love, dependence, tenderness,
Devotion, trust and friendliness
Between the members of each race,
Which time nor fortune can efface.
The tears therefore unbidden leap
From reddened eyes, as sorrows deep
Down within their troubled souls
Kindle afresh the slumbering coals
Of their affections, and they know
That their Creator willed it so
That this war was part of Wisdom's plan
To teach the brotherhood of man.
Their masters, helpless, knew where they,
If all their slaves should go away.
To toil, they'd never learn the art,
And now they dread to make a start.
The slaves had neither home nor food,
And thoughtful ones were not in mood
To cater to the elements
Of changes and experiments.
Meanwhile, as vagabonds and tramps,
There poured into the Yankee camps
The young and shiftless by the scores,
Until their presence greatly bores
The officers and soldiery,
And placed them in a quandary
To figure out what disposition
Of them would better their condition.
Self Dependence.
The black man now that he was free,
Had cause enough for industry;
Since with his master he must share
The products raised for food and wear.
For not a morsel had he stored,
Nor had he place for an abode.
He not a dollar could command,
And thus was left to fall or stand.
It would be idle should you ask
If he proved equal to the task,
Or if by recent legacy
Of freedom he, in beggary
And pilfering, would try to live,
Or to the world a lesson give
In patience, pluck and industry,
Grit, cheerfulness and constancy.
The Southern farms once desolate,
The blacks begin to renovate
By causing nature's heavy yields
From those neglected cotton-fields,
Until again the people sing
That in this land is cotton king;
That by the Negro and the hoe,
The ruined South would rise once more.
Nor did he with the cotton crop
Which he produced, his labors stop;
But every product of the farms
In Dixie land were by his arms
Produced as if by magic wands,
From those devasted war-torn lands,
Until the South, from heavy blows
Of strife, had blossomed like a rose.
The shops which forged the musketry,
Make tools for farming industry;
The powder causing men's death groans,
Finds better use in blasting stones
Were turned the swords to reaping blades,
And bayonetes to useful spades;
The roar of field artillery
Gives place to hum of industry.
The fields once strewn with warriors slain,
Stand now adorned with waving grain;
Where stood the shameful auction block,
Stands school to which the children flock;
Where wheels of industry stood still,
Now stands the busy cotton mill;
Where stood as sentry poverty,
There now abounds prosperity.
The greatest wonder of the nation
Is found in the sudden transformation
Of the land of Dixie from starvation,
The scourge of war and desolation,
Lost credit, misery and shame,
To prestige restored, wealth and fame
Until today her happy lot
Ts, she's the nation's garden spot.
Negro Labor Changed Dixie.
Have we considered what has brought
The changes which we see are wrought
Within the South in forty years,
Which like a fairy tale appears?
Was it produced by magic wands.
Or came the change by horny hands
Of toil, with zest and will applied
Till the bleeding South is beautified?
Labor is health, the doctor cries;
Labor is wealth, the earth replies;
Labor is monarch of the earth,
Labor is life and joy, and mirth,
Labor is rich blood of the nation,
Labor defined means civilization,
Labor is God's best gift to man,
Save Jesus and redemption's plan.
The man that labors adds to health,
And by his labor pileth wealth;
This rule unto the South applied
Leaves us but one thing to decide:
That since the Negroes' daily toil
To extract yield from fertile soil,
In every sovereign Southern state,
'Tis they, the South do renovate.
Was slavery but the black man's tool
His all-important training- school,
His safe and sure foundation stone,
For base of structure of his own,
For without aught was he set free
But held to labor's legacy;
Though owning not a foot of soil,
Rich was he found in art of toil.
As toilers in the Southern heat
No laborers can with them compete;
No task so hard, no day so long,
That it disturbs their mirth and song;
No race so readily as they
Do their employers' laws obey;
No other working men would live
Upon the wages they receive.
No set of men, no other race,
When placed within a trusted place,
With every chance a wrong to do,
As have they been, have proved as -true.
Are Negroes hired on large plantations
Upon their own recommendations;
And, be it known that just a few,
Unto their trusts are found untrue.
Why, one a home will get today,
And on the morrow he will say,
Without the slightest hesitation:
"Our crops, our house and our plantation."
In one day's time his tender heart,
In "boss's" interest feels a part,
And he will labor night and day
To drive all enemies away.
He who with eloquence of mouth
The praises heralds of the South,
For rapid strides in life's, great race,
But somehow fails, to give a place
Of praise to what the blacks have done,
Will find, before his course is run,
While traveling o'er familiar route,
That half the story is left out.
Accustomed as he'd grown to be
To hardships and adversity,
Since, had he entered freedom's ark,
No phase of life to him seemed dark,
But worked he with celerity,
To leave to his posterity,
Not laborer's legacy alone,
But something real to call his own.
Education of the Race.
Feeling his need of education,
To fit him for his new relation
As freedman and a citizen,
Rather than mate for denizen
Of dismal swamp, or jungle wild,
A reptile spurned, a beast defiled,
His rustic children as a rule
With books were found hastening to school.
To study were their minds applied,
And anxious parents had the pride
To hear their children read and spell
And learn to use their pens as well.
Slave owners by these deeds were dazed,
Were filled with wonder, jarred, amazed.
To them 'twas cause for much concern
That blacks to read and write could learn.
The Ballot.
While education proved a charm,
Those freedmen found a greater balm
For slavery's sting, in the right to vote,
Which was to them an antidote
For long oppression, cruelty,
And wedlock's insecurity,
Which masters taught was not a sin,
Since Negroes were not counted men.
But now stands he and loudly knocks
At the door of cherished ballot box,
A citizen, a man indeed,
'Mongst other men, a life to lead
Of duty done to home and state,
And on life's problems ruminate;
Though wearing marks of slavery's brand,
Stands he a ruler of the land.
Know, in our form of government,
The men who votes doth represent,
The functions of a ruler, king,"
Or emperor, or greater thing—
A president; for he alone
Can say who shall ascend the throne
With sceptre of authority
To rule the great majority.
Though ignorant, they, as a rule,
Were students from experience's school;
Knew not what letters might denote,
Put well they knew their wish to vote
Was but to carry out the ends
Of white men they believed their friends,
Whether they from the North had come
Or had been Union men at home.
None can deny that they were true
To every one who wore the blue;
None will deny they then did make
A fatal and a vast mistake;
None can deny that reason taught
That they should vote as they had fought;
None can deny that they were right,
Their masters' views at the polls to fight.
What more repugnant, mean or rude,
Is there than base ingratitude?
What showeth more nobility
In men than known fidelity?
What fills the soul with more disgust
Than when a man betrays his trust
What act in man is more depraved
Than wronging those, his life has saved?
To uproot slavery from the earth,
Was the cause of republican party's birth;
That Negroes might be held as slaves
The Southern whites found early graves;
To bring to Dixie consternation,
Was issued Lincoln's proclamation;
To bring the war to a speedy end
The North enlisted colored men;
To punish Dixie for secession,
The Negroes came into possession
Of the greatest prize to freemen given,
Which can be had this side of heaven—
The right to choose their governors
And brainy men to make the laws;
A right to freedom till he hears
A jury's verdict of his peers.
Carpet Baggers.
Thus 'twas the Northern carpet-bagger,
The scoundrel and the scalawagger,
Elected were to many a place
Which they soon covered with disgrace.
The blacks were first to be dismayed,
When saw they how they were betrayed
By men who wore the sacred blue,
Which they believed no vileness knew.
For in official acts they blundered,
And then, the states' exchequers plundered;
The South made desolate by strife,
And threatened to destroy its life.
By wanton theft 'tis made to bleed,
To satiate the lust and greed
Of looters, robbers, sneaks, and knaves,
Who'd tomb-stones steal from dead men's graves.
What cared they for the South's starvation,
Its misery and desolation,
Its poverty and devastation,
Its loss of prestige with the nation?
What cared they for the people's groans
Occasioned by the heavy loans,
And weighty bonds which must they, pay
For thieving scamps to bear away?
What cared they for their useful tools:
The black men whom they take for fools,
And on them into office ride,
Letting a few but peep inside?
But these were not seen near the spot,
Where stood the tempting boodle pot,
Which ransack they and pot did hide,
While stolen plunder they divide.
What cared they for the commonwealth
They ruled in shame, or for the health
Of business that taxes yield,
In either trade or growing field?
Of nature's products, rich and choice,
If they were still allowed a voice
When that auspicious hour appears
The spoils to filch like buccaneers?
And when the prostrate South they'd bled,
They, with their stolen treasures fled
To other climes, in wealth to roll,
But left the black man in a hole;
They found out then to their disgust
How these white men betrayed their trust,
Then ran away in blackest shame,
And left the blacks to bear the blame.
Negro Suffrage Not a Mistake.
The politicians, North and South,
Do now proclaim by pen and mouth,
That Dixie got its ruination
Through so-called Negro domination;
That Congress made a vast mistake
When it in wrath did undertake
To put into the hands of blacks
The ballot, when they paid no tax.
These people never stop a season,
And with themselves, begin to reason
What would have been the blacks' condition
Had they been left in a position
Of freedom, shorn of the protection,
Which suffrage gives for the correction
Of all abuses, fancied, real,
Or otherwise, which freedmen feel.
Were bristling guns to awe the whites
To be sole guardians of their rights?
Must the South be ruled by martial law
As though she still had civil war?
Were blacks just snatched from slavery's jaws
To be still ruled by masters' laws?
Could men in a republic be
Deprived of votes and still be free?
Why was Columbia first to be
Called "Blessed land of liberty?"
Why have the men from foreign shores
Crowded into her open doors?
Why did crowned heads in self-defense
Declare for people's parliaments?
Why did their colonies rebel
And the mother country's power repel?
What but Columbia's constitution
Caused Prance to face a revolution?
What but the freedom of our land
A republic made of Switzerland?
Why do mien term the present state
Of Russian laws degenerate?
Why are the Chinese sluggish, dead,
And to their ancient customs wed?
Each time the reason is the same:
Men got a glimpse of the sacred flame
Of freedom's light which shown afar,
As shone in Judea Bethlehem's star;
And as the rays of its bright light
Proclaimed man's ransom from Death's night,
So did the light of liberty
Foreshow the end of tyranny.
Saw Congress nothing else to do,
Since black men were now freemen too,
But to apply the only test
Which raises men from nothingness.
They had no standing in the law
To shield them from the tyrant's paw;
The nation's wards, they could not be
Because they labored steadily.
That Camby's laws receive support,
Were black men" urged to come and vote;
Urged thus to rally to the cause
Of the adoption of such laws
As were the South to dominate
Until her sons should nominate
By acts of loyalty to prove
That they for country's laws, had love.
What else could have the nation done?
Must it into confusion run
By placing power in the hands
Of late disbanded rebel bands
Who fought four years for dissolution,
To ratify a constitution,
Which brushed aside the measures for
Which, they contended in the war?
Was it for years and years to wait
For Dixie to assimilate
Love for the flag and those who died
To keep the nation unified?
Was it to doubt or hesitate
While subjects insubordinate
Must have some form of government
To hold in check their devilment?
Magnanimous was it to be
To such an unusual degree
As to defer to its late foe?
Let reason's echo answer NO!
Let every loyal soul be proud
That such a nauseous, blackened cloud
Of burning and eternal shame
Rose not to taint his country's name.
Recapitulations.
Here let us recapitulate
Why Congress did not hesitate
On blacks, the franchise to bestow,
Whether it pleased the South or no:
Must either wards or citizens be
Declared these blacks, by war made free.
As citizens they'd not remain,
If right to vote did not obtain.
Was classed the South both out and in
The Union, and its leading men
Were by rebellion disfranchised
Until the North re-organized
Their commonwealths into free states
Repugnant to the South's mandates.
In loyalty were they so lax,
The state must be restored by blacks.
The blacks must vote these stubborn men
Into the Union’s grace again,
For had some passed a resolution
'Gainst amendment to the constitution,
Which gave to black men equal rights,
Which they oppose with all their mights.
The blacks must vote if men would bar
The causes of another war.
'Twas wise they voted then, because
The course of wind is told by straws;
Unlettered, poor, and destitute
As they were then, will none dispute
That with their strides in education,
Refinement, wealth and adaptation,
To the ways of freenien, sad to say;
Stronger is prejudice today!
The Intelligent Negro Most Despised.
The ballot I'll not dwell upon,
A-s its place cometh farther on
In tale of woe, but look, I pray,
What men are looking for today:
Forty long years since the close of war,
Statesmen petition justice's bar
To grant them speedy dissolution
Of amendments to the constitution,
Which gave to black men equal rights
Before the law, and in the fights
Or wars that come, then in no case
*Let Negro soldiers fill a place;*
Let none as jurors ever serve
But see that they the laws observe;
Class them as creatures so abject
That whites need not their rights respect.
Let honest mortals bear in mind,
Some states have long since cast behind
Their scorn of Negro ignorance
Their poverty and incompetence,
And at the wealthy and upright,
The educated men of might,
The honest and industrious,
The lawful and illustrious.
The men who for their country fought,
The men who much for good have wrought,
Men blazoned high in halls of fame,
Men who the minstrels like to name,
Men loyal to their government,
And striving for its betterment,
These men the statesmen of today,
Attempt, their rights to sweep away.
The ignorant are checked, because
Of what is called "Grandfathers' Clause,"
Others with splendid educations
**Checked are by property qualifications;
While some with both, are stopped at the bar
***To satisfy the registrar.
Closed thus to black men manhood's doors,
Those puny statesmen goard them more.
No Negro has in their dimmed eyes,
It matters not how rich or wise,
How brave and good he tries to be,
How much done for posterity,
How great to flag is his devotion,
How dared to die on land and ocean,
How high his rank 'mongst worthy men,
Man's right as full-fledged citizen.
We pray this nation ne'er may make
A law which proves no more mistake
Than that conferring on black men
The duties of the citizen.
Let's pray as all good Christians must,
That those who rule our land be just;
So that we blush not when we brag
That freedom dwelleth 'neath our flag.
Let's strive to cast away the beam
Which mars our visions, so things seem
When done by others, painted black;
Let's for our most stupendous lack
Of justice, find an antedote,
Then can we better see the mote
Of statesmen forty years ago,
Who wisely wrought as time will show.
Were Garfield, Blaine, and Sumner fools?
Or were they but the filthy tools
Of scoundrels and designing men
Who only labored for the end
Of their own self-aggrandizement
And not the country's betterment?
Were statesmen then so far below
Those filling seats in Congress now?
Why no, though now we've men of weight
As rulers high, and learning great,
Of courage and of eloquence,
Of cherished world-wide prominence,
Of dignity and courtesy,
And unsurpassed integrity;
Yet of these statesmen great, not one
Outranks the men of sixty-one.
Negroes in the Senate.
Why blacks were enfranchised we've shown,
And why official robes have worn;
Hundreds of whom were not prepared,
And thus the Southland badly fared;
Yet have there been black men of weight
In Congress halls and native state,
As legislators, true and tried,
To whom black men may point with pride.
One Hiram Revels early came
To sit in the Senate halls of fame;
Then Blanche K. Bruce, from the same state
Of Mississippi, proud and great,
The Senatorial garments wore
And he himself with credit bore
While shaping laws an honored part,
Quite worthy of the statesman's art.
They with their country's statesmen share,
Although their names no measures bear
As authors, which the records show,
Have made the country prosper so.
Yet were these great men ever found
On current issues safe, and sound
Of judgment, pointed in debate,
Which traits a statesman indicates.
This fact historians well may broach;
Their country suffered no reproach
Because they graced the council halls
Of those much honored Senate walls
Mongst cultured men and dignified
Of learning great, experience wide,
But failed in all those years to make,
In public life just one mistake.
That they were wise and dignified
Men of their race may boast with pride.
If men reared slaves of note could be
Mongst giants intellectually,
Could stamp themselves as men of worth
In the greatest council hall on earth,
What would their trained descendants do
As statesmen, some decade or two.
Few men who to the Senate go,
As that grand body's records show,
Are ever classed as being great
Because of prestige in debate.
It thus devolves upon the few
The speaking for the crowd to do,
While most of them their worth denote
By faithfulness in work and vote.
Thus these black Senators will stand
Proudly among that worthy band
Of Senators whose deeds are seen
In righteous laws and records clean;
Not Sumner's, Plato's, Webster's, Blaine's,
But stand they forth as. men of brains
Like Edison and Angelo,
Whose sterling worth their works best show.
House of Representatives.
While they the Senate thus adorn,
The "lower house" is called upon
Its doors to colored men to ope,
Thus throwing wide the "door of hope,"
Which some declared should never close
Through machinations of their foes
Or two-faced friends, whom, we are told,
In black men's cause blow hot and cold.
Let the historian call the roll
Of those inscribed upon the scroll
Of men in Congress since the war,
And see if any black men are
Amongst them found, then let us see
What kind of men proved they to be;
Whether they brought the house disgrace,
Or shed new lustre in the place.
The first to come proved to be great
As worthy foremen in debate,
And as their numbers greater grew,
So came new orators to view.
The links of that important chain
Of Congressmen were Richard Cain,
And Robert De Large, James Rapier,
Jefferson Long, J. D. Ransier,
Willis Menard, Israel G. Lash,
John M. Langston and Charles E. Nash,
Joe H. Raney, G. Robert Smalls,
Jerry Haralson, Josiah T. Walls,
Benjamin Turner, John R. Lynch,
And R. B. Elliott, who'd grace the bench,
George Wash, Murray, H. Plummer Cheatham,
Were "black belt" men—'twas hard to beat 'em.
John Hyman from the Old North State
Was mongst the first, though mentioned late;
James E. O'Hara, polished, grand,
Would take high rank in any land;
Thomas E. Miller won his seat
By contest with the man he beat;
And then the last to greet our sight,
Was that old Roman, George H. White.
Some mentioned here by my weak pen
Stand equal with the world's great men,
As lawyers, statesmen, orators,
Soldiers and rich contributors
To that august, illustrious page
Found in the annals of this age,
Which shows Yankee dexterity,
Our wealth and great prosperity.
Shame on Columbia.
Sad is the thought that they are gone.
In halls of Congress, there's not one
Now left, the blacks’ rights to defend,
Or upon whom they may depend.
O shame on thee, Columbia fair!
Wearing thy sacrimonious air
Of equal justice, mercy, truth,
And righteousness, when thou, forsooth,
Hast grown with thy commercial lust
To be untruthful, base, unjust,
And blinded by the goddess, Wrong,
To yield the sceptre to the strong.
Thy former precepts cast aside
And God's known laws are unapplied,
While thou, with calm, unblushing cheek,
See unjust laws oppress the weak.
Then think a race can be content
Without a voice to represent
Their aims, their needs, their civil rights,
Their cries for justice through the nights
Made dark by prejudicial wrath,
While stones of hatred block their path,
And storms of opposition leap
Around their couches as they sleep?
Columbia, pray, in justice's name,
Does not thy conscience shrink in shame
When thou thyself herald to be
"Home of the brave, land of the free,"
The only true democracy?
Are all thy claims hypocrisy?
Say, do the people make the laws,
Or are they held beneath the paws
Of trusts and giant corporations,
Of filthy rings and combinations
Of scheming, lying politicians,
Who buy and steal their high positions,
As judges, leaders, legislators,
Governors, mayors and conservators
Of all the people's vested rights
For which they've waged their hardest fights?
Who are the People—How Classed.
Columbia, as thy numbers grow,
Wilt thou let anxious mortals know
Who are the people thou dost boast
When thou, computing thy great host,
Of eighty million busy souls,
Sayest thou that thy broad domain holds?
Has thy boasted democracy
Become one vile autocracy?
Shall one-eighth of thy population
Be shorn of all consideration
In voicing what shall be the share
Of the country's burdens they should bear?
Dost thou suppose they'll rest content
To count in the apportionment
Of Congress men, as subjects patient,
But stripped of voice in legislation?
Who are the~people? Let us know
Whether they be the rich or poor,
The stupid, ignorant or wise,
The dwarfs in form or large of size,
The black or white, the working men,
Or the ease-loving citizen,
English or Greek, German or Jew,
Tell us Columbia, who is who?
In a republic, every man
Equal in rights, is said to stand;
And should the humblest so desire
He may for president aspire.
Nothing forestalls his rights sublime
Save treason or a heinous crime
Against the laws made by the state
Which Justice will not tolerate.
Then proud Columbia, tell us why
Tlfou standest unconcernedly by
And seest thy garments filled with slime,
Thy strong descendants steeped in crime,
Thy doctrines held in ridicule,
Thy laws evaded as a rule,
Thy statesmen solving, it would seem
If state or nation isi supreme?
Within thy borders, German, Russian,
Irish, Scottish, Polish, Prussian,
English, Swedish and Mexican,
Brazilian, Dutch and Chilian,
Frenchman, Spaniard and Panamese,
Italian, Swiss and Portuguese,
Mohamedan, Christian, Jew or Greek,
Thy land has captured so to speak.
Their ranks have bred the anarchists,
The infidels and socialists,
And foes of law in every form,
That shake the nation as a storm
The ships at sea hurl to and fro
Until they on the breakers go
Dismantled, wrecked, plunged in the deep
Where fearful monsters round them creep.
And still their wishes are respected,
And members of their bands elected
Their people's cause to represent,
Though have we more than ten per cent
Of loyal subjects native born,
But seemingly the nation's thorn,
Without one soul to plead their cause
In the nation's citadel of laws.
Let Justice break her sacred scales,
And have them fashioned into nails,
Wherewith to close the door of hope;
Make of her robes a mighty rope
To hang the Goddess Liberty,
Let Truth and Right in mockery
Her honored sword in atoms break
And arm her with a slimy snake.
Representation Necessary to Existence as Freemen.
Sad as this picture seems to be
Another just as sad we see
Existing in the different states
Where human law originates;
The will of the majority
Must yield to a minority
All legislative place and power
Whether the pill be sweet or sour.
When freedom came men recognized
The black's rights would be jeopardized
If in the draft of legislation
Their race was barred from representation,
And though despised and poor and weak,
A tribune needed they, to speak
Their wills, their aims, their just complaints,
Of measures that they were against.
And with the government's intentions
For constitutional conventions,
The Gordian knot to tie again
'Tween North and South then burned ill twain
By fiery brands of cruel war
'Twas then the nation black men saw
Officially, in those conventions,
Attracting diplomats' attentions.
Guided by laws of human nature,
Strove they to reach the legislature,
A place exalted in their eyes
Unto the joys of Paradise;
The very thing a former slave
With manhood robed, would surely crave;
And few have ever been accused
That they the honor had refused.
From North and South and middle West
As these states' records will attest,
From cotton fields and vast cane-brakes,
From Southern gulf and Northern lakes,
From bondsman's rags to robes of state,
Went forth black men to legislate;
"Went forth absolved from master's hand,
Honored law-makers of the land.
Some were ignorant and vicious;
Some were cultured and ambitious;
Some were an honor to their race;
As statesmen, some were a disgrace;
Some of them, bigots were and fools;
Some others were but useful tools
Of carpet-baggers, thieving, mean,
As foul a class as ever seen.
Some of these men in later years,
In Congress halls were filling chairs;
Some in their states took highest gifts
As officers, whom suffrage lifts
To an exalted altitude,
High up above the common brood
Of citizens, while others fell
So low, as to their suffrage sell.
Within one single Southern state
At one time there were sixty-eigbt
Members of the legislature,
(Were politics of such a nature),
And of that number, fifty-four
Were Negroes, and we must deplore
This fact, while picturing their plight;
Twelve men could neither read nor write.
And half of those that I have left,
Wholly and sadly were bereft
Of the knowledge of the use of pen.
But all the rest of those black men
With their white comrades, equal stood,
As patriotic, wise, and good,
And eloquent, who at the start
The state's uplifting had at heart.
So long as men their praises give
To worthy men, so long shall live
These men, in memory and in song,
These men who dared oppose the wrong,
These men who bribes of scoundrels scorned,
These men who ever stood forewarned
JOf their sworn duty to their states
Should live while old earth gravitates.
Scalawags and Renegades.
But bad as do these black men here
As worthy men seem to appear,
Their records shine just twice as bright
As do the records of their white
Colleagues; those men of ease and grace,
The seed of the Caucasian race
Did loot and steal and bring to shame
The party bearing Lincoln's name.
Methinks that it is very meet
That I should here some things repeat
Which I have uttered once before,
That we may see the very core
Of the disgraceful incidents
Which crept out in the governments
Of Southern states in these dark days
That know we reconstruction's ways.
The thing once said, again I'll say
Is, that black men were kept away
From plunder chests and treasury vault.
Nor has it ever been their fault
(Except in an unconscious way),
That politicians do now lay
The blame for Southern poverty
Caused by white men's rascality.
These white men, by their prominence,
Betrayed the utter confidence
Which black men had in them imposed,
And thus their party's name exposed
To everlasting infamy,
And the eternal enmity
Of the taxed burdened populace
Who paid the price of their disgrace.
And then these greedy jackals fled,
Leaving the South's tax-payers red
With righteous and undying wrath
Against their party; thus the path
Of honest men, both black and white
Republicans, see not in sight
A silver lining in the cloud
Which wraps their party like a shroud.
What else would men expect to see
Of people just from bondage free,
Who life's grave duties undertake,
But that they'd make some great mistake?
What should we term it but unjust
That they be censured for their trust
In those who broke their galling chains?
Should blood of ingrates course their veins?
Cries honor, no! The Negro race
May never hold the highest place
In art nor science, name nor law,
Nor may they boast their fame in war,
Still may the race hold high the head,
While all the world upon them shed
The well deserving platitude:
That they disdain ingratitude.
Justice demands that it be said
That some had "swelling of the head";
That freedom won by cruel war
Made license take the place of law;
Seemed some to think, since free were they
No longer orders they'd obey
From any man, but they must show
No fear of mankind did they know.
Their former masters took offense
At what they called impertinence.
The former mistress would not brook
An answer from her former cook;
Negroes were trained to be too meek
That they should dare to have the cheek
When they the voice of white-folks heard
Give answer with a single word.
The Ku Klux Klan Born.
At length the whites became inflamed
With passion that would not be tamed
Until their feelings had found vent
In the accustomed punishment
Of the offender, nor did they
Dare now to do this in the day;
Thus came they to adopt the plan
Of the infernal Ku Klux Klan.
This vile mysterious order new
Had first the object in its view
Of placing Negroes in the plight
Of living constantly in fright
*Of midnight visitors "from hell,"
Who'd drink ten gallons from a well,
By means of a long rubber hose
They bore beneath their outer clothes.
Regaled were they in robes of white
Which could be seen the darkest night;
And, by a rod hidden from sight,
Could raise their mask-heads twice the height
Of common mortals, and each horse,
Like his weird rider, was of course
In trappings long and white arrayed,
Which thoughts of ghostly haunts conveyed.
Nor failed they in their sworn intent;
Those strange nocturnal riders, sent
Through Negroes' blood, a sudden chill
That made them subject to the will
Of those they served, and soon they came
To tremble, when they heard the name
Of Ku Klux Klan, from foe or friend;
Their wooly hair would stand on end.
This plan was worked with such success
That this new Klan did soon address
Themselves to use of leathern thongs,
For the correction of the wrongs
Which they imagined to exist
As a great evil in their midst;
Meant they to hold the Negroes down
By force and fear, on farm and town.
Women and men they soundly beat
For any cause which raised the heat
Of fierce resentment of some deed
By blacks committed. They decreed
To take advantage of the clause
Encouched within those recent laws
That gave to black men equal rights
Which lifted them to loftiest heights.
But whipping failed to cure the ill.
So next determined they to kill
All of the leading politicians,
White men or black, who held positions
Supposed to be of consequence
To stamp them men of prominence
For leadership in black men's eyes,
That men of note would recognize.
Some men w£re by them, foully shot
Whether their deeds were bad or not;
Others to limbs and posts were hung;
Others in swollen streams were flung;
Some had their persons mutilated,
And some were found decapitated;
Some left their children, homes, and wives,
And fled away to save their lives.
And yet these blacks were not deterred
From manhood's path, for they preferred
To sleep in death than again to gain
The fetters of a master's chain
Feel, crushing either limb or will,
So they determined they would fill
Like valiant soldiers, martyrs' graves,
Rather than be accounted slaves.
With courage bold, those faithful souls
In spite of threats, went to the polls
And cast their ballots for the men
Thought they most likely to defend
Their freedom from the fierce attacks
Which men would make upon the blacks
As citizens; but this incites
The pent up anger of the whites.
Ballot-Box Stuffing.
And when the nation's war scarred chief
Ulysses Grant, had brought to grief
The order of the Ku Klux Klan.
The Whites fell on another plan
Concealed in hellish wickedness,
The Negroes' manhood to suppress;
And by well sought devices strange
Planned they the people's wills to change.
So they the ballot-boxes stuff
Until they got in votes enough
To change a weak minority
Into a big majority.
And later, when they come to see
That vote and registrar must agree,
Hit they upon a novel plan
To rob of vote the colored man.
*They metal ballot-boxes got
With rounded top and lengthy slot,
With two small passages within,
One slanting out, one slanting in,
The slanting one opened below,
So ballots dropped unto the floor;
The straight one let the ballots fall
Directly in the boxes all.
The black men's votes went to the floor,
While just the self-same number more
Into the boxes then were put,
The voting slots with seals were shut,
But showed when opened as before
The whites had put in hundreds more
Than had the blacks, though on the book
The blacks as winners surely look.
But these machines soon met their fate;
Proved they to be inadequate,
The wishes of the whites to meet,
So that these pesky blacks they'd cheat
Out of elections fairly won;
Resort they next unto the gun
In the hands of mounted red-shirt bands,
Who try intimidation plans.
Kept they the colored men away
From voting on election day,
By riots, threats and precious blood
Of Negroes in the neighborhood;
And by these methods desperate
Rose they to power within the state.
While did their leaders soon begin
To check all rights of colored men.
Before these facts do I relate,
Let us herein enumerate
Some of the things by black men done,
By being lofty, from men won
The very highest admiration
From every great enlightened nation
Which judge men by their brilliancy,
Save this great land of liberty.
Skilled Workmen.
Such splendid working men are they,
That o'er America today,
When unions turn to trouble makers
By standing forth as contract breakers,
Threatening the land's industrial life,
And causing hardship, hatred, strife,
And the curse of Cain to blanch men's faces,
Black men are found to take their places.
Men often ask how this is done,
And how on earth have black men won
Their treasure of industrial knowledge,
And where located was the college
Whence sprang such skillful denizens
Competing with the citizens
Whose unions barred them at their doors
To find them paying off old scores.
Know then that slavery was their school.
The large slave owners as a rule,
Had each, a slave to learn a trade
Embracing every useful grade.
And when came freedom to the nation,
The Negroes soon found occupation
As trained mechanics in demand,
And they, the only ones on hand.
The frugal and the thoughtful ones
Had as apprentices, their sons,
Who, by their sturdy pluck and will
Inherited their fathers' skill.
No great school of technology
Taught them the etymology
Of those skilled trades, although 'tis true
Of college bred ones were a few.
Black boys can now obtain such knowledge
Through study in some native college,
Known to the states as "A. and M.,"
The youths' industrial lamps to trim.
Then there is Hampton Institute
Kittrell, Tuskegee Institute,
And other worthy seminaries
Which are to these auxiliaries.
Likewise the schools of higher learning
Have shown of late that they were turning
To manual training some attention
Thereby avoiding much dissension
'Mongst factions of our population
As to the kind of education
Best suited to the queer condition
Of men found in the blacks' position.
And in the future, should they fail
As sons of Harvard and of Yale,
In life's great work to share a part,
Still masters will they be of art,
*From institutions noted, great,
With teachers fully adequate
Wisdom's choice teachings to impart
To him who shows a willing heart.
A most magnificent array
Of standard schools do we portray
When taking time their names to call,
Of those that stand a mighty wall
Of strength, and monument of light,
As trusty guides through pitchy night
Of ignorance compact and gross,
Which blights the lives it comes across
Academies not in the list
Are products of philanthropists,
So common at the present day,
And thus have we a good array
Of colleges and standard schools
To train our youth to know the rules
Which nerve them for the cares of strife
That they must overcome in life.
Though jealous and malicious foes
Their future usefulness oppose,
Though make they efforts to prescribe
The kind of learning blacks imbibe,
And though they swear the blacks must curb
Ambition's thirst, lest they disturb
The fountain of the nation's peace,
These institutions will not cease.
On, in their upward course they'll go,
And wisdom's fruitful seeds will sow,
Till those who do the blacks deny
Their rights, shall not give reason why
That they could find none qualified
Among the number that applied,
With needed intellectual skill
That could the place with honor fill.
Besides, where wisdom's flag has flown
Who dares attempt to haul it down?
What wretch would dare to show the "brass"
To pick a nation or a class
Of freeborn citizens to be
Debarred from reaching knowledge's tree?
Of cowardice the language smacks
Opposing educated blacks.
What have these institutions done
Which should have endless praises won
From men bestripped of prejudice?
What agency or edifice
Through whose influence you can trace
The uplift of the Negro race
From beasts of slavery consigned,
To creatures cultured and refined?
Preachers.
Let the historian's pen devote
A page to colored men of note.
And let their splendid records show
Whether high schools should stay or go;
Let those who teach the world by pen,
Proclaim the deeds of colored men
Who in life's struggles play their parts
In the fields of science and of arts.
As theologians, do we see
Great doctors of divinity,
The rivals of the world's great preachers,
Its Spurgeons, Talmages, and Beechers,
Polished, refined, and eloquent,
And in equipment, competent
The Master's teachings to expound,
And scoffing infidels confound.
Their mission at all times has been
The race to lead from paths of sin,
Dishonor, vice and laziness,
Into the ways of righteousness,
Forbearance, truth, and rectitude,
And that they have their hearts imbued
With Christ, the Lord's redeeming love,
Descending from His throne above.
When in the land the air was rife
With seeming inter-racial strife,
When angry factions sullen stood
Ready to shed each other's blood,
When man, inspired by burning hate
Could not his fellows tolerate,
When one a glaring deed had done
To aggravate the other one,
When busy-bodies plots would hatch
To set to powder-horn, the match,
These preachers On the scene would loom
And labor to avert the doom
Of carnal strife, to God prayed they
That men, their country's laws obey.
Do they abiding patience preach
And doctrines of forbearance teach.
When men are roasted at the stake,
When men their thirst for vengeance slake
In lynching bees and lawless mobs,
When fiendish orgies drown the sobs
Of Justice, outraged, bleeding, crushed,
The mutterings of revenge are hushed,
And torch and axe are unapplied
Because black preachers stem the tide.
Nor does it matter what they preach,
The vicious class they cannot reach,
Because the scoundrels stay away
From the place where good men preach and pray.
Their beastly passions hatch and thrive
In whiskey shops and hellish dives
Where ministers would fear to go,
Lest they the seeds of scandal sow.
Still are black preachers ostracised,
And by traducers ill advised
As to the sermons they should preach
So that the lawless class they reach.
They're forced by rude intimidation
*Preach "Hell eternal and damnation "
When they'd remove the cause of strife
By teaching men eternal life.
Dare hypocrites to place a ban
On messages God sends to man
By men with holy zeal inspired?
Informed are they what is desired
By the Omniscient Trinity
**As sermons for his ministry?
Should they preach what men order, then
I'd hold, religion sprang from men.
Lawyers.
Most men disdainful pictures draw
Of learned Counsellors at Law,
But I this declaration drop:
That, not since from Mt. Sinai's top
Was handed down the law from God,
To Moses, has there ever trod
On mother earth, men more profound
Or, for their country's good more sound.
'Tis theirs to guard the rights of men,
The alien or the citizen;
To thwart the purpose of the strong,
By laws of might, to right the wrong;
To punish those who violate
The sacred mandates of the state;
To see that justice never fails
To balance true her time-worn scales.
The law has been a stepping stone
For those who sought to gain renown
In the fields of statesmanship so grand
Where they can other men command,
Or where the laws by them are made
Or they must see they are obeyed.
The law's bold Guardians will here stand
Mongst men most honored in the land.
Within a land of prejudice,
Stands there a rocky precipice
Between the mountain of success
And distant valley of egress
Of Negroes to the legal field,
But, armed with resolution's shield
Those clifts, with courage they've assailed
And by sheer pluck, their heights have scaled.
These knights have golden laurels won,
And stumbling blocks have overcome,
And proved that hidden legal lore
So highly prized in the days of yore,
Has yielded to the Negro's blade,
Them taught that they be not afraid
Mid visions dark and treatment cold,
But forward press with courage bold.
So let their legal efforts be
In the cause of civil liberty
With might directed. Make men know
That they on breakers sharp will go
When they the law attempt to twist
To suit the whiners who insist
That manhood rights are for a class
And not intended for the mass.
    Noted Negro lawyers are: Macon Allen Williams, H. H. Hart, John M. Langston, Albert White, R. B. Elliot, George H. White, James Fiddler Dennison, Edward H. Morris, George Jackson, Josiah T. Settle, George Woodson, W. Justin Carter, James Napier, Charles W. Chestnut, D. A. Straker, Lloyd Wheeler, Thomas Walker, Samuel McElwee, B. S. Smith, T. McCant Stewart and his son, Gilchrist Stewart, William Pledger.
Doctors.
The doctor, with his drops and bills,
Prescribed to remedy our ills,
Importance showing in his face,
Has been an honor to his race;
Has shown to superstitious blacks
The worthlessness of filthy quacks
And "conjurers," who claim they fix
Their patients' health by means of "tricks."
Two thousand strong their ranks advance
Like armored knights with polished lance,
Leading the charge ag-ainst disease
Which they have overcome with ease.
The blacks' unsanitary laws
They found to be the leading cause
Of vital loss, and pestilence,
Due largely to their ignorance.
They fill a long-felt racial need,
For, ever since the blacks were freed,
But few have given any thought
To ills with which their lives were fraught.
Now black physicians eminent,
Have shown the dangers prevalent
From carelessness and crowded homes
Whence most of their diseases come.
Authors.
The world with veneration, looks
On authors of instructive books.
He who has written such an one
Has much for civilization done;
In fact, the most of knowledge gained
Of lasting import, was attained
From standard books and busy pen
Of leading educated men.
What has the Negro in his time
Accomplished in this field sublime?
Has his so-called benighted brain
Been found well fitted to attain
By hallowed inspiration's flight
And culture, to ascend the height
Of authorship's great mountain steep
With books instructive, weighty, deep?
Has climbed a race in forty years
From ignorance gross, to be the peers
Of men of letters? Have they shown
That they have brain as well as bone?
Does this not show upon its face
That genius knoweth none by race,
Religion, color, cut of hair,
But by their mighty works laid bare?
Black authors have we manifold
Well stored with wisdom, manly, bold,
And pregnant with a burning zeal
Through splendid books, to make appeal
Unto enlightened sentiment
That there be some acknowledgement
Where merit counts in wisdom's plan
The Negro proves himself a man.
Historians, poets, text-books, songs,
And magazines repeat the wrongs
The colored race has undergone,
And their ill treatment has been shown
By colored writers, minstrels, clowns,
And orators; and yet their wounds
Afresh, in pain are made to bleed
By many a dark Satanic deed.
Poets.
Those soft, poetic melodies
Whose strains the muses recognize
As from the gods, a gift inspired,
To daring deeds, men's hearts have fired.
With love have set the heart aflame,
With scorn, the traitor clothed in shame;
Have brought the Christian inward peace
And given wounded spirits ease.
They who with seraphs would commune.
To verse their voices must attune;
Must revel midst the thrilling rhymes
On noble deeds or sacred hymns;
Must soar to mystic regions sought
Beyond the realms of vulgar thought.
Of right, enamoured must they prove,
And nature's beauties must they love.
Must worship virtue, hate the wrong,
The weak must help and praise the strong,
On Christian teachings must depend,
And helpless mortals must defend.
A name immortal will appear
Within the lines Which follow here,
Who, like Shakespeare and Tennyson
Through verse the world's esteem has won.
Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Life's tournament is being run,
And in the contests there must none
Save men of world-wide fame appear
And trappings of knighterrants bear.
A black knight, bearing sword and shield,
A stranger on this honored field
Unbidden comes; the brazen thing
Has shied his castor in the ring!
This knight in sable armor clad
The best knights challenged! Is he mad
That he should dare the courses run
With Shakespeare, Byron, Tennyson,
Longfellow, Bryant, Pope and Poe?
How dares he thus such spirit show
When giant knights like these contend
For honor's wreath and glory's end?
The bugle sounds; the knights advance
Sword clangs to sword, lance points to lance,
The Black Knight's plume is seen to wave
Amongst the bravest of the brave.
He reels from many a well-aimed blow;
'Tis over! Is he unhorsed? NO!!!
Unscathed he rides from honor's field
With victory written on his shield!
Who is this dauntless, sable knight
Who won his way to yonder height
Of eminence? Give us the name
His shield will bear in the hall of fame!
Paul Laurence Dunbar, Afric's son
This day the wreath of fame has won.
His name for aye is handed down
Mongst bards and poets of renown.
Paul Laurence Dunbar, thou hast won
Renown not for thyself alone,
But for thy persecuted race
Have thy great poems won a place
Mongst men of letters, and have taught
The men who delve in realm of thought
Jehovah, in creation's plan,
Equipped the Negro as a man.
Financial Success.
Since earth dropped from the potter's mould
Have men bowed down to worship gold.
For gold, was taught the sword to kill,
For gold, the earth was sowed with ill,
For gold, will most men plot and lie,
For gold, will some men freely die,
For gold, some reprobates will sell
Their souls for aye, to death and hell.
Gold forged the chains of Negro slaves;
Gold makes the ship to ride the waves;
Gold forms the diplomatic corpse,
Signs treaties to increase its store;
Gold strikes the scales from Justice's hands;
And bids her yield to its demands;
Twas gold the nation's anger hushed
When manhood rights lay bleeding, crushed.
The Negro, penniless, forlorn,
When he to freedom's world was born,
Soon grasped this disposition old,
To join the miaddened rush for gold.
Necessities have been denied,
And pomp and pleasure cast aside,
And through fierce hunger, cold and rain,
Toiled he, this tempting gold to gain.
Let writers of the future show
How wealth to him began to flow
Despite the fact that men in wrath,
With opposition strewed his path;
And as for snares, there was no lack
Of them, devised to hold him back,
The busy marts to him were closed
And his debut in arts opposed.
By practicing frugality,
And keeping will, vitality,
By patience, care and industry,
Within the half a century
From mendicants have thousands come,
Masters of money, farms and homes;
Have helped to give the nation health
By sharing largely in its wealth.
Those who have made the estimate,
Declare the figures indicate
A billion dollars more or less
Would purchase not what they possess;
And with their well-earned wealth they've brought
Debasement to the men who've taught
That they were lazy, shiftless fools
Who'd shirk the use of workman's tools.
A case of fatal irony,
Shows Isaiah T. Montgomery
Has by the labor of his arms,
Made funds to buy Jeff Davis' farms,
Which must have caused the owner tears
To have the savings of his years
Revert to creatures whom! he said
Had not the sense to earn their bread.
Now this is not the only case,
For through the Southland you can trace
Hundreds, yea, thousands of the same,
Where former owners now in shame
Behold their farms by Negroes owned,
Themselves in want, their sons dethroned,
And they, almost in every case,
Have envy for the rising race.
'Tis not the Negro tendencies
For ill, that stir up prejudice;
'Tis not because of shiftlessness
That oft he's found in idleness;
'Tis not because he labor shirks
That blocks his path to public works ;
'Tis not because that he is poor
That hope must close to him her door.
'Tis not because of ignorance
That he's denied an equal chance
To conquer in the raging strife
For mastery in the walks of life;
But 'tis because the rules of caste
Declare that he has climbed too fast;
He therefore must be held in check,
Or else the walls of caste he'll wreck.
Know then, in forty years alone
A landed acreage they own,
More than two kingdoms, rich, refined,
Holland and Belgium combined.
Let some one answer—at this rate
How long before they'll own a state
Or tier of states, on native soil,
Where they in slavery learned to toil?
The old log huts they've cast aside,
And in their places they provide
Themselves with costly mansions fair,
With furnishings and comforts rare.
Their farms, sufficiently are stocked,
Their graneries are filled and locked,
Their children in the school are found,
And peace and plentitude abound.
Hayti.
Amid the great Antillian isles
Where tropic sun in grandeur smiles
On San Domingo's fertile plains,
Where Afric's children once in chains
The whole of that republic own,
And rules as rules a king his throne,
Was born of parentage obscure,
The great Toussaint L’Ouverture.
Scan the whole race for worth within,
He greatest was of Negro men.
For fifty years an humble slave,
Though of a heart both stout and brave.
He yielded meekly to the will
Of his indulgent owner, 'till
In desperation, secretly,
The slaves struck for their liberty.
Though planned he not the overthrow
Of slavery, he to the fore
Of those commanding, soon did rise,
When genius to organize,
And great ability to plan
Were seeking for the proper man
With courage bold to lead the way,
And sense enough to win the day.
King Alexander was called great
(As ancient histories relate)
Because the whole known world ruled he
When he was only thirty-three;
'Tis a3so said he wept because
In conquering kings, he had to pause;
Because of kingdoms, there were none
Whose monarchs he had not dethroned.
His father, Philip, ruled a throne,
And he no other life had known
Save one of war and pomp and power
And giving orders every hour;
Was cradled in experience's school,
And tutored how to lead and rule
His countrymen, in war and peace,
As well became a son of Greece.
Stands Hannibal in bold relief
As the greatest military chief
Of all the ages; yet he too 
Up, in the camp, a soldier grew;
In arts of war was taught the ways,
Engaged in warfare all his days,
And was unconquerable because
lie knew all military laws.
Scotland, in singing her sad fate
Can boast her Bruce, in prowess great;
That country's sovereign for a while,
And then was chased into exile.
He calls his followers once more
And wins his kingdom back before
The proud usurpers of his crown
Could muster men to hold him down.
Gained Caesar greatness on that morn
He crossed the tempting Rubicon,
Which marked his sphere of rule in Rome,
And won the empire for his own.
This know, who are with Caesar charmed,
He conquered Rome with Roman arms,
And Roman treasure in his trust,
To satiate ambition's lust.
Napoleon, the warrior he,
The favored son of destiny,
The kingdoms of the world o'erturned,
Their kings uncrowned, their cities, burned
Their fields were strewn with soldiers dead
And France's proud banner o'er them spread
This fact upon men's minds I'd stamp:
This man was cradled in the camp.
In youth, the rudiments of law
He mastered, and the arts of war
In will, in purpose, and in heart.
Knew he, and was himself a part
On life's great stage, he only wrought
On other men what he was taught;
How best to wield the sword to kill,
And mankind bend to do his will.
Then let us take our favorite son,
The first in all things,—Washington,
This nation freed he for our own
And first received the ruler's crown,
And, from the laws which have been since
Enacted here, all governments
Their form of rule have modified,
So that the ballots now decide,
Who holds a seat in parliament,
Congress, and chair of president,
But Washington had won applause
For gallantry in Indian wars,
Which fitted him in after life
For leader in the fiercer strife,
When by a well-directed stroke
Freed he this land from British yoke.
You men who laud our Grant and Lee
For deeds of valor, must agree
That in the civil war, they fought
As they at West Point had been taught.
If by assault, or. in defense
Their soldiers gained great prominence,
The world decided as a rule
They'd prove the merits of their school.
But not a command ever knew
The great Toussaint L'Ouverture,
And in his youth he never saw
Within a book of common law,
Was reared to be another's tool
Without a dream he'd ever rule
His native isle, a shining star,
A very king—an emperor.
When revolution's banner red,
O'er San Domingo's soil was spread,
This untaught man, this trusty slave,
Was found the bravest of the brave.
By far the wisest of the wise,
The cynosure of wise men's eyes;
The organizer, leader, judge,
Without whose orders none dared budge.
He broke the heavy bondsman's chain
Whicfr bound Domingo fast to Spain,
Then with" the Warrior's polished lance
Beat back the soldiers of proud France,
And' with a will preeminent,
He took the reins of government
And "First among the blacks became,
By valiant deeds as well as name.
In state-craft, General L'Ouverture
Had builded wiser than he knew.
And hundred years have rolled away,
And still triumphant stands today
"The Black Republic" pertinent
Unto his worth, a monument.
A land where black men make the laws
Despite their many civil wars.
Although her colors show the scars
Of insurrections, civil wars,
And their attending poverty,
Still theirs has been the novelty
Of black men's rule without the sights
Of cannibals and heathen rights
Which haters of the blacks declare
If blacks should rule would be their share.
This wholesome truth the world should know:
That these black people war no more
Than do their neighbors 'round about,
Who war within and war without
Their country's borders, year by year,
Till nations start not when they hear
That some mad tropic Lochinvar
Has loosed his howling dogs of war.
Liberia.
Behold! A bright oasis green
On" Afric's Western coast is seen
To rise to an important post
Where dwelt a long benighted host
Of savage men, untamed, untaught,
Whose barren minds on which a thought
Of higher life had found no root
From which intelligence could sprout.
Where once no sun of hope appeared,
Behold how heathen hearts, are cheered
By rays of light which penetrate
The clouds of their benighted state;
And?1 wisdom's stream now ripples by
Where once the soil was parched and dry;
Is seen to grow a government
Where tribal strife was prevalent.
'Tis thus Liberia has shown
What blacks can do when left alone,
When once the seeds of liberty
Are planted in their memory.
Though treachery brought him to grief,
His country found a worthy chief
In Dessalines, the warrior
The black hot-blooded emperor,
Who by his cunning, wisdom, pluck,
And daring mixed with splendid luck
Crushed out Domingo's opposition,
And she, a nation, took position.
Let those who daily find excuse
The Negro's progress to traduce,
Behold Liberia's showing grand
With obstacles on every hand.
Conscience, that monitor which comes
Into the worse sin-ridden homes,
Vile man to warn of pending fate
Should he continue in a state
Of disregard of God's decrees,
The hearts of some slave owners seized
And pricked, till they had seen it fit
That they their slaves should manumit.
But fit it would not prove to be
That Negroes bound and Negroes free
Should be permitted side by side
In daily contact to abide;
For those who were with freedom blessed
Would soon inoculate the rest
With freedom's germ, when must the wall
Of hellish human slavery fall.
To save this institution then,
From sudden death, did these white men
Unto the government apply
To have it plant a colony
For blacks, on Afric's Western shore,
Where might loosed blacks in freedom go,
Unhampered, and begin to build
A home according to their will.
Liberia was found to be
The spot to found this colony;
And slaves now freed by will or court,
Such would the government transport
Unto this land 'neath tropic skies,
Where they must either fall or rise,
According to the grit within
Just as the world tried other men.
Slave owners held it was a sin
To send these Negroes back again
To Africa, for soon they'd be
Addicted to idolatry
And superstition's magic charms
Would soon enfold them in its arms,
While idleness and poverty,
Would bring to settlement decay.
That cannibals, the land would breed
And lives of wretchedness they'd lead,
And guided by the knowledge here
Attained, would be the leaders there,
In fetish lore and tribal wars
And prove a menace to the cause
Of mission work, and slavers' plans
For treatment of the heathen lands.
To Haiti do they love to point
As a republic out of joint,
And, as a nation, a disgrace,
"Which should be banished from the face
Of this progressive hemisphere,
But ne'er in print does it appear
How well Liberia stands the test
Of government, with all the rest.
Liberia, though weak and poor
And unprotected, has done more
By splendid rule to show to earth
That Negroes have intrinsic worth
As other men, and when content,
Are capable of government
Of selves and their upgrowing seed
As men of any race or breed.
She holds the world's respect, because
Of honesty and righteous laws;
Her treaty obligations kept,
As treasures stored within the depth
Of iron vaults, and none have cause
To rail on her organic laws;
And equal rights are not denied
To those who in the land abide.
Long may Liberian Statehood live,
And may all Afric's sons receive
Through her, progress and racial pride,
That they may early cast aside
Their idols crude, their heathen rites,
Their proneness to engage in fights,
And their detested custom old
That they should men in bondage hold.
Liberia, thou art the door
Through which should missionaries pour
To Afric's teeming millions lost,
Who know not of the Holy Ghost,
Nor that the Savior bled and died
That their souls might be satisfied
Through his life blood, to live for aye
In realms of everlasting day.
Abyssinia.
Thou Abyssinia, Afric's own,
Show forth the deeds which thou hast done
Of gallantry. Tell of the hoards
That perished by thy trusty swords;
Let history's page tell how thy name
Arose from ridicule to fame,
And why great nations pay respect
To thy great ruler, Menelek.
The kings of Europe did decide
That they'd among themselves divide
The dark benighted continent
Of Africa: they therefore sent
Our strong detachments, adequate
These heathen lands to subjugate,
And that each nation's flag should fly
An emblem of authority.
Spain, England, Germany and France,
And Holland, made the natives dance
To music, by their soldiers made,
And Portugal likewise essayed
Her sphere of action to extend
That she and Holland in the end
Each an important ruling power
Would stand a proud colossal tower.
The grasping sons of England steal
The known world's richest diamond field
And bursting mines of precious gold
Which Southern Afric's bowels hold;
And her possessions, East and West,
O'er that doomed continent attest
That John Bull's mandates are supreme
On every mountain, plain and stream.
O'er Egypt's ancient dynasty
The British's claim of sovereignty
Unchallenged stand, thus putting forth
Her conquering legions to the North.
The Germans, too, in Afric sieze
Some rich possessions, West and East;
The doctrine bringing forth to light
That with strong nations, might makes right.
The French laid claim unto the land
Of the Sahara and the Soudan,
While o'er the three Barbary states
She claimed to have protectorates.
Contented were the Portuguese
To claim two of the provinces
Of distant Ethiopian kings,
As though were they unfeeling things.
Proud Italy declared that she
Held by her majesty's decree,
That strip of territory known
As stately Abyssinian throne,
But Menelek, the king, demurred,
And by a solemn oath averred
That when uncrowned was seen his head,
Would lie his body bleeding, dead.
What ruler of the land or sea
Could greater than the Negus be?
Who'd on his soil incur his wrath?
As foe, who'd dare to cross his path?
He warned Italians to beware
Should they attempt his lands to share,
For should they on his borders tread,
The land would bristle with their dead.
But the Italian greed was stirred
So that they heeded not a word
He said, nor of a danger dreamed,
For not in history was it teemed
That the detested African
Would dare attempt to place a ban
On the Caucasians, who had grown
To think the world was all their own.
Went forth the arms of Italy
Resolved to punish bitterly
This Negro king, this heathen fop,
Who dared to threaten that he'd stop
With his weak arms, the white man's will.
He needed grinding in the mill
Of the gods of war, until his pride
And kingly dreams were cast aside.
Failed they to reckon with their host,
For when had they the borders crossed
Of Abyssinia's broad expanse—
For landing scarce had they a chance,
Then like a well formed hurricane,
Which devastates the populous plain,
The Negus, who his warriors led,
Bestrewed the landscape with their dead.
Those brave Italians charged in vain,
For soon they were repulsed again
By scions of the Numidian hosts,
Which years agone, had swept the coasts
Of the immortal empire—Rome,
When Carthage to her gates had come
With Hannibal, the strategist,
So Menelik they now assist.
Fought for rich treasure, Italy,
While Abyssinians, gallantly
For love of king and country fought ,
Nor would her soldiers stand for aught
Of yielding to a foreign power
The throne, till slain had been the flower
Of Abyssinia's noble sons
And none were left to handle guns.
But soon the bloody work was o'er,
As everything was swept before
The fury of those black brigades,
With modern guns and shining blades;
Those proud invaders turned and fled
With thousands of their comrades dead
And dying on the battle-field,
And Abyssinia's fate was sealed.
For now she stands a nation proud,
Her claim for membership allowed
Within the bound of sovereign states,
A fact which plainly indicates
That guns and swords of Menelek
Have won his country great respect
From those great nations of the North,
Who loudly sing his country's worth.
Cuba.
The Cuban soil from last to first
Has been with insurrections curst;
Her fertile fields untitled, neglected,
Her sons and daughters unprotected,
Her sturdy children made to feel
The grinding of the tyrant's heel;
Her crops destroyed, her cities razed,
And Cubans by injustice crazed.
But now has dawned a brighter day,
Her harsh task-masters swept away
Have been, by means of trusty guns
And daring of her noble sons.
She had as gallant leaders these:
Bandera, Garcia, and Gomez,
But he who struck the hardest blow
Was the intrepid Maceo.
The cruel Weyler, baffled he
By his great feats of bravery.
Crossed he the "Trocha" at his will;
His fierce attacks planned he with skill,
And as the hawk in open day
The farmers' poultry bears away,
He took this leader's Spanish forts
And Spain to foul deceit resorts.
She knew no peace would Cuba know
While lived the fearless Maceo;
So she concocts a dastard's plot
To lure him to some lonely spot
With flag of truce and false pretense,
And, when removed from his defense,
To kill him basely in cold blood,
While all the world in horror stood.
The Cuban War.
When those misguided sons of Spain
In deviltry, blew up the Maine,
Their monarch heard the eagle's scream,
And bayonets were seen to gleam
Like polished brass before the sun,
The Negro soldier took his gun
In answer to his country's call
Which sought the aid of yeomen all.
Together with white troops they land,
Together on strange soil they stand,
Together with the whites they share
Their rations of the poorest fare;
Together fall they by disease,
Together camp they 'neath the trees,
Together 'neath their country's flag
Charge they the yellow Spanish rag.
Together faced they cannon's breath,
Together lay they cold in death.
'Gainst Spanish trench at Siboney,
And block-house forts at El Caney,
'Gainst musketry from hidden foe
'Gainst barbed wire in marshes low,
The colored soldiers side by side
With their white comrades, bled and died.
On San Juan Hill is seen to fly
The flag of Spanish tyranny,
While in the valley far below
Is heard the thrilling bugle's blow.
Men clad in khaki uniform
Began that deadly hill to storm;
'Tis but a Spanish compliment
From the Rough Rider regiment.
The hill they climb with flying feet;
When suddenly the Spaniards greet
Their dauntless ranks with shot and shell,
And from the lines their comrades fell;
But on, with courage bold they go
Not heeding wounds nor death, when lo!
Their lines become inmeshed in wire,
And hotter grows the Spanish fire.
And while they stand like beasts at bay,
Those Spanish lines are swept away,
Their ranks completely put -to route
And Roosevelt's troopers with a shout
Acknowledge their delivery
From massacre and butchery—
By colored troopers true as flint
Known as the "Fighting Ninth and Tenth."
No military history
Can show that works of infantry,
By cavalry dismounted, form,
And with their carbines, take by storm.
But this by colored troop was done,
And by the victory which they won
Was Roosevelt succored in his tent
To be "Rough Rider President.
A nation for its fairness famed,
Stands in the eyes of nations shamed,
Reviled, condemned, and held to scorn,
Its boasted love of justice gone,
Its flag no more a shield to those
Escaping from oppression's doors,
Its honest men ashamed to speak
When other nations press their weak.
The cloak of right is cast aside,
The club of might is now applied;
Fair Justice has been gagged and bound;
Injustice reigns, in harshness gowned;
Proud Liberty lies murdered by,
A beam is thrust in Mercy's eye;
Dame Charity on stones is fed;
Religion is to hatred wed.
*Brave Mingo Sanders, grizzled, scarred
From years of service, now stands: barred
From soldier's rights; his honor gone,
Though not for aught that he has done,
And though were spent his days in strife,
An outcast must he be for life.
Of nobleness he shows no lack,
But none the less—his skin is black.
Not in disgrace, alone, he went;
Three companies of his regiment,
All veterans of many wars,
All, covered with their battle scars,
All, of the foulest crimes accused,
All, trial by the law refused,
And all as felons, cast adrift
Forever, for themselves to shift.
This seems the irony of fate 
For Negro men who serve their state.
Their bravest deeds are all forgot
And they are styled a sorry lot,
Unworthy of the rights of men,
Because some brute with dusky skin
A crime revolting should commit
Which would a savage beast befit.
Philippine War.
On that auspicious first of May,
When Dewey, at Manila Bay
The nations of the world amazed,
And his loved country's prestige raised
By his unequaled victory
O'er hostile ships in open sea.
Black sailors were amongst his crew
And did their share of fighting too.
And through those military scenes
Enacted in the Philippines,
Where men who fought for liberty
From Spanish greed and tyranny,.
Their forces with the Yankees joined
To have their lands by them, purloined,
Their hopes of freedom cast aside,
Their chiefs, as traitors, crucified.
And now their very blood runs cold
When Negro soldiers they behold
Mongst their despoilers; this alone
Transforms their noble hearts to stone,
To see their brethren shot to death
By men just snatched from slavery's breath,
While fought they then, that they might see
Their lands from despotism free.
National Ingratitude.
And though great wonders have they wrought,
And though in every war they've fought,
Though largely owners of the soil,
Though showing willingness to toil,
Though thrusting ignorance aside,
And for themselves do they provide,
The nation's conscience soundly slept,
While manhood rights were from them swept.
0, callous nation, have a care,
Thy soil's defenders dost thou dare
The boon of equal rights deny?
Why sit'st thou unconcernedly by
And see these men and sons debased,
Their deeds on battle-fields effaced,
Their loud appeals for justice hushed
While ill use has their spirits crushed?
Know thou that fell the mighty Rome
From cliques and discontent at home?
Beholdest thou, proud Russia's state
With dissolution at her gate?
Hast thou observed that it is caused
By the injustice of her laws?
Think'st thou canst thou to wrong incline
And her sad fate will not be thine?
Sad is the thought, the nation slept,
And peeping stars in pity wept,
The Devil saw, and danced in mirth
To see his minions rule on earth;
All nations watched with bated breath
And said it meant the country's death.
The Negroes saw and gasped for breath
For well they knew that sleep meant death.
The nation slept, while plotting heads
Its Magna Charta tore in shreds;
That precious document so dear
To patriots, they curse, and sneer;
Its declarations sanctified,
Do they attempt to set aside;
Its plainest meanings, mixed have been,
By men's interpretations mean.
The nation slept, while lawyers sought
That bill of rights to bring to naught
By subterfuges in the law,
Wherein each lawyer finds a flaw.
In this their work, they find support
In rank decisions of the court
*Which gave as cause in one great case
"Characteristics of the race."
The nation sleeps, while anarchy
Roams o'er this wretched country, free;
The howling mob has been enthroned
While outraged law in anguish, groaned;
The air is stifled with the stinch
Of ghastly victims of Judge Lynch;
The courts of law disfavored stood,
While cutthroats smeared the land with blood.
The nation sleeps, while human frames
Are fed alive to hungry flames
For crimes unproven, or a word
Of legal evidence is heard.
Black men accused, are hung and shot,
Whether the mob is sure or not
The deed so charged was ever done,
Or if they have the guilty one.
The nation sleeps! "Grandfather's Clause"
Enacted is, among the laws
Of commonwealths, with the intent
The Negro's manhood to prevent.
The Constitution's rule, applied,
Allows no set of men denied
The right, a freeman's vote to cast
Despite his color or his past.
The nation sleeps, and men, for gold,
Like dogs, are into bondage sold;
Yea, peonage methinks, is worse
Than any form of slavery's curse,
Because the owner tried to be
Protection for his property,
But those now sold in peonage
Have none their bruises to assuage.
The nation sleeps, injustice stalks
Within the courts, and justice balks
Whenever blacks, accused, are tried,
Their evidence is set aside;
The worst is theirs, it matters not
If they unjustly have been shot;
If whites their daughters should insult,
'Tis death to mention the result.
The nation sleeps, black men of pride
On "Jim Crow" cars are forced to ride;
Not for the betterment of state,
But proud blacks to humiliate;
Aliens to teach, and citizen,
That Negroes are not counted men,
But that inferiors must they be
Despite their wealth or energy.
The nation sleeps1, while on they go
To the crater of a volcano;
A seething, whirling tongue of flame
Has shot aloft in justice's name,
Which soon the nation's life will choice
With fire, and blood, and battle-smoke,
With frenzied shriek, and dying groan
Unless injustice they dethrone.
The nation sleeps 'mid constant groan
Of patient blacks, while doleful moan
For murdered sons, from mothers rise
To Him who rules in Paradise;
Like Rachel, they their children mourn,
And comfort's blessings they'll have none,
But from their hearts with sorrow gored
They cry aloud for vengeance's sword.
The nation sleeps, while racial hate
Is growing rife in every state;
Banished has been the dove of peace;
The vulture, malice, from its leash,
Unloosed, the nation's breadth has flown,
And horrid tares of hatred sown;
The serpent envy, from his lair,
Has scattered poison everywhere.
Appeal to Heaven.
The nation sleeps, Jehovah, Jove,
Thou Archive of incarnate love,
Our First, Beginning, Middle, End,
Thou man's Creator, Father, Friend,
Alpha, Omego, Source of Light, 
Great God, Immortal, Infinite,
Exhaustless Fountain, Highest, Best,
Eternal Rock of Righteousness.
Thou Uncreated, Thou the Just,
Thou ruler, Whom Thy servants trust,
Preserver, Maker, Counsellor,
Omniscient Spirit, Governor,
Our Life, our Hope, our Guide, our Reed,
Our Refuge in the time of need,
Thou Dazzling Sun, incline thine ear
Unto thy servant's humble prayer.
Eternal God, Thy grace impart,
Look down in pity, Thou who art
The Ruler of the universe,
We pray Thee, Lord, remove the curse
Of hate and prejudice that stand
With ill design and fiery brand
Men's hearts to torture; on a race
Of helpless creatures, turn Thy face.
O God, this sleeping nation wake,
Ere men in desperation, take
To vengeance, as their moral guide,
And those now dwelling side by side,
Will ruthlessly be thrust apart,
While murder stalks in every heart,
And desolation's barren arms
Invade our factories and our farms.
Great God! Before me smells a flood
Of revolution's crimson blood;
Blood of the youthful and the old,
Blood of the timid and the bold,
Blood of the babe on mother's knee,
Blood of that mother, ruthlessly
Butchered to slake the raging thirst
For human blood, by men accurst.
O Lord, these visions chase away,
Bid Thou Thy tender love allay
The storm approaching, Mighty God,
Wilt Thou in mercy stretch Thy rod
O'er this tempestuous hemisphere;
Let Thou the sun of peace appear
In glory from this mirky sky,
Proclaiming death to enmity.
O let Thy voice, this nation hear,
And may its rulers live in fear
Of Thy just wrath, and may we see
Religion in its purity
Throughout this favored land prevail;
Let not the Savior's teachings, fail
The purpose they to men were sent,
That men of wickedness repent.
Jehovah, let not patience cease
To be a virtue. Let men's knees
In prayer before Thy throne be bent;
Let man, Thee worship 'neath his tent
Or in the forest's cooling shade
And none shall dare make him afraid.
Let wicked men no longer rule
That they may tarnish Thy footstool.
In nature, all things stay in bound;
The planets in their place are found;
The angry waves break on the shore;
The mountains check the deafening roar
Of raging storm; the gentle spring
Disarms grim winter of its sting;
Must not beyond a certain height
Ascend the eagle in its flight.
Vile man alone exceeds his bound,
Not where Thou placed him is he found,
For covetous has grown his heart
And conquest has become an art;
His brother's birthright doth he take,
Thy ten commandments doth he break,
Against Thy law doth he rebel,
And, knowingly sinks down to Hell.
Thou Righteous Lord, Thy spirit send
America,     Do Thou defend
The helpless, yea, the poor and weak,
The destitute, the just, the meek,
From persecution's cruel lash;
The unjust Judge do Thou abash,
Confound, debase, expose, ungown,
And from his honored seat bring down.
O God of mercy, wilt Thou stay
The sword of vengeance; drive away
The fiery clouds of deadly wrath,
Let strangled conscience block the path
Of creatures on destruction bent,
Let love's entreaties eloquent
The rising tide of hate becalm
And men, of murder's thoughts disarm.
Avenging God, bid Thou be still
The winds of lawlessness which kill
The nation's conscience; let the light
Of Truth's bright garments chase the night
Of false pretensions far away;
Let visions of a brighter day,
In rainbow hue illume the sky
To warn men of thy watchful eye.
Father, Thou hast all nations made
Of kindred blood, and Thou hast laid
The base for earth's foundation stone.
When Thou commandest there is none
Who dare oppose thy sovereign will,
Thou canst create and Thou canst kill,
The worlds are holden in Thy hand,
By thy decree, the heavens stand.
My God, Thy loving spirit give
To sinful man, that he may live
After the fashion of Thy son,
That when the monster death, doth come
For him, with summons in his hand,
To join that silent caravan
For unknown regions swiftly bound,
That he with thy mark may be found.
And now my Maker, to Thy trust
Do I consign the living dust.
A right to urge Thee do I claim
Through Thy dear son, the Savior's name,
That I these weak petitions make,
Which Thou wilt grant for his dear sake
And Thy name's praise shall never end,
Both now and ever more, Amen.
Amen! all Negro hearts, reply,
Amen, is echoed from the sky,
Amen, all upright men repeat,
Amen, cries Virtue, from her seat,
Amen, says Justice, bruised and sad,
Amen, joins Mercy, looking glad,
Amen, Religion shouts in glee
To Him who died on Calvary.
The Mob Spirit.
And still the drowsy nation sleeps,
While men and women slain in heaps
Appease the passions of the mob,
Who, deaf to pity, groan, or sob,
The soldiers' muskets brush aside
And minions of the law deride,
And men and women, innocent
Of any crime, to death are sent.
The humble black in lowly hut
Asleep with doors and windows shut,
Is stifled by the fumes of smoke
And as he wakes receives the stroke
Of death, though nothing has he done
Deserving it, bait that some one
Said to be black, commits a deed,
And then escapes, must this man bleed.
Another, guilty said to be,
Is bound securely to a tree;
And though he swears he's innocent,
His murderers, with hearts of flint,
Heap round his body wood and thatch
While standing with a lighted match
Is seen a woman's garb and form,
With woman's instinct glimmering gone.
Within that God-forsaken throng
Are seen the aged and the strong,
The beardless youth, the tender child,
The brazen maid, with shouts as wild
And heart as black as hardened men,
With patches of the victim's skin
As souvenirs, in high glee borne
Her quiet bedroom to adorn.
No tears of pity Wet the cheek
When there is heard the piercing shriek
Wrung from the victim, as the fire
Upon his person creepeth higher;
But louder grows the frenzied shout
Of those hyenas round about;
And blacker grows their callous hearts:
As o'er that wretch the fire darts.
Ye who of heathen tortures rant,
Stop criticising, drop your cant;
Behold the Christian's; model plan
Of torturing his fellowman!
See what they hold before the gaze
Of other nations; hear him praise
The equal justice of his laws
Midst thunders of the mob's applause!
Ye Gods! What savage orgories
Are equal to such scenes as these?
*The preacher clad in sacred gown
Incites the mob to batter down
The prison doors, and leader stood
Of those who thirsted for the blood
Of one committed to the law
Though blacker wretch none ever saw.
No living man should raise a breath
Of protest at a villain's death,
Whose wanton violence would dare
Attempt to outrage virtue fair.
A beast incased in human form,
A serpent vile, a filthy worm,
A thing too foul on earth to dwell
Whose domicile should be in hell!!
But who shall take that life away?
What tribune has a right to say
How he should die? By whose decree
Must he in horror roasted be?
Whence came the power of the court
Which for his death decides to vote?
Will some one state the place and time
'Twas proved that crime was cured by crime?
Lynching.
The howling wretch burnt at the stake,
With awe, the stoutest heart would shaKe,
The villain swung from limb of tree,
Presents a ghastly sight to see;
The creature foully shot to death
Should make good people gasp for breath;
The victims of the white-caps' ire
Should men with fierce resentment fire!
But sad as do these scenes appear
A sadder picture draw we here;
The people have religion spurned,
And on the goddess Justice turned
In ridicule;
Her scales they break,
And her avenging sword they take
And strike her, bleeding, to the ground
While Vice and Ruin dance around!
The burning victim spake no word,
But that heart-rending shriek you heard
Was but the wail of outraged law;
That dangling body which you saw
You thought was lynched on yonder's tree,
Was but the tattered drapery
Which did the sacred law adorn
Before 'twas crucified in scorn.
The blood of men and women, shot
Unlawfully by mobs, is not, 
(As horrifying as it seems),
One half so shocking as the streams
Of anguished blood from Justice's heart,
Which mobs and lynchers cause to start
Each time attempt they to correct
What they may term the law's defect.
A fiend the law doth violate,
A set of cutthroats delegate
Themselves the court of last resort
To which the culprit must report.
One criminal had we before
But now we have a hundred more;
The first knew he a wrong had done,
The last, so hardened, they see none.
From lynching for a nameless crime,
These bands began to lynch in time
For murder, arson, knavery,
Back-talk, assault and battery,
Horse stealing, vagrancy and debt,
A stolen calf, to win a bet,
For careless handling of a gun,
And finally, they lynch for fun.
The law an arrant coward stands;
Thrice stabbed, it raiseth not its hands,
But like a spaniel flogged, it whines,
And, with its bleeding arms, entwines
Its persecutors, It fails to act
To keep its self-respect in tact,
While in contempt the lawless hoot,
And men who cross them, hang, and shoot.
Russian Horrors.
Compare the Russian monarchy
With this great land considered free.
Their government is absolute;
The Czar, unchecked, can execute
And promulgate the country's laws;
None can enact a single clause
Contrary to his sovereign will,
Those who offend, his word can kill.
His subjects must his will obey,
Their eyes have seen no brighter day,
His soldiers emphasize his will,
Who dare oppose, their weapons kill,
Let him be Cossack, Pole, or Jew,
The unsubdued is made to rue
The hour that he for freedom speaks,
Or for an education seeks.
In Russia, torture they the Jew,
While here, have they the Negro, who
Must suffer daily on the rack
Of persecution, for the lack
Of rulers worth a blade of straw,
But not for lack of statute law.
Its folds are ample to protect
The weakest man from disrespect.
In Russia, helpless Jews must die
When things of state are all awry,
Their anti-Christian sentiment
Is held as cause for punishment.
The Negroes here are hunted down
In every hamlet, section, town,
And city, when a crime is laid
To one of them from honor strayed.
The Russian laws are not abused
When are these helpless Jews ill-used,
Because all law is in the Czar,
In peace as well as time of war;
But this is a democracy,—
(Or land of rank hypocrisy),
Where every man a ruler stands
With scales of justice in his hands.
Russia, no model government
Declares herself, in speech and print,
But boasts of her autocracy,
Where there's no banner of the free.
But here, of freedom! do men prate
With law dethroned in every state.
A model government we claim
While burning flesh cries out in shame!
Self-government the Russians say
Their people cannot have today,
For men are brutal in effect,
And brute force must their passions checks
So just our laws, do we reply,
That not a nation 'neath the sky
Can measure to the standard set
By those who shaped the laws we get.
O nation blind, why others see
Reeking with crime, while black you be
With every crime beneath the sun?
Why others chide for what is done
To subjects 'neath their flag, while you
Are practicing the same thing too?
It seems but rank: profanity
That fought thou for humanity.
Shouldn't some enlightened nation be
Enamoured of humanity
*As was America, when Spain
On Cuban soil had thousands slain?
Should not the smell of roasted men
Give voice above the constant din
Of our commercial men abroad,
Till men in mercy take the sword?
Humanity is not confined
To any nation, race or kind
Of men; its garb the same appears
To soldiers brave and buccaneers.
Its advocates today are found
Where'er enlightened men abound;
It pleadeth at this nation's door
As loud as on a foreign shore.
The painted redskin on the plain,
Its help, should not entreat in vain;
The poor, benighted Esquimo
Should hail it in his hut of snow;
The islanders of every sea
The objects of its care should be;
The Ethiopian's sooty skin
Its sympathetic ear should win.
Legislated Against.
Humanity should not stand by
While men in shameful torture die
Without a protest or a blow
Struck by its arm, to end the woe
The makers of the law should be
The first to live by its decree,
Nations should practice what they preach.
And by example should they teach.
The law, the proud Caucasians make,
And, daily, every statute break;
They murder, swindle, forge and fob,
They scheme to get another's job,
They press the foot upon the weak,
They bring to shame the maiden's cheek,
They covet to insanity,
And practice vile profanity.
But if the blacks the law should break,
These men, the sword of vengeance take
While by the law are white men fried
For arson, rape, or homicide;
But mobs, that handle shamefully
Their country's law, in peace, go free;
They, arms, and treason's, banners fly,
And the minions of the law defy.
The Negroes, framing not a law,
Are handled for the slightest flaw
In what a written page contains,
And by law-makers, thrown in chains,
And for the chains that they have worn
Whites look upon their race in scorn.
No one could feel as treated right
When forced into so sad a plight.
Should Negroes help the laws to make,
Then so much better could they take
Its punishment; so they insist,
(Just like the English colonists),
That they must represented be,
In legislative halls, to see
The justice of the law's demands
Or they grow restive in its hands.
Should humble blacks, despised and poor,
About their country's laws know more
Than those who made them? Is it right
That they be shut out from its light
In halls of state, and stand forth then
As lawful as their countrymen?
Were criminals the colonists,
Who dared, Great Britain to resist?
Can they respect the "Grandfather's Clause?"
Can they endure those "Jim Crow" laws?
Must they submit to blatant fools
Who strive to kill their higher schools?
Can they, as loyal citizens
Remain away from voting pens?
Must they submit freedom of speech,
Or hesitate the Christ to preach?
No! Less than men they'd prove to be
If they resented not the plea,
That men debased and ignorant
Should find themselves inheritant
Of suffrage rights, on the lone score;
Their grandfathers, a man's rights bore,
Not that they're competent to know
What issues with the ballots go.
Those men, three hundred years ahead,
Ashamed should be, to have it said,
On their grandfather's: rights of yore,
They must gain access to the door
Of suffrage. They should be the last
To be allowed the right to cast
The ballot, if it cannot be
Prepared by them intelligently.
But with all books kept from the blacks,
And bondsmen's burdens on their backs,
Their grandfathers, unwilling slaves,
Their thirst for lore kept down with staves,
The whites, who boast superior blood,
Have long before the country stood
Praying grandfathers in their graves
To save them from their former slaves.
Let those best posted, tell us why
They on grandfathers, should rely?
The Negroes ask no favor more
Than other men, but they are sore
When they are charged with heedlessness
Of law, when they are getting less
Than the worst scoundrel of the race
That makes the laws that them abase.
Just let the self-same rule apply
To blacks and whites for registry;
The ignorant, keep from the polls,
Or else admit all honest souls,
Regardless of the hue of face,
Or antecedence of the race;
Let men of wealth and learning vast
Ne'er be debarred a vote to cast.
Jim Crow Laws.
The "Jim Crow" laws do blacks oppose,
Because investigation shows
There was. no need to separate
The races, in a single state
On common carriers, for each race
Knew well enough what was its "place";
Only the best of blacks would care
To pay the price of first class fare.
The low and vicious element
Were always perfectly content
To travel in the second class
Coaches, where they could take a glass
Of rum, or smoke a filthy pipe,
And where they'd mingle with their type
Of men, they had no minds to be
Encased in robes of decency.
Negroes refined, must smell the smoke
Of drinking men, and hear the joke
Of vulgar toughs who beastly stare
Into the face of ladies fair,
Because by law, all Negroes are
Compelled to ride within one car
Without accommodations good
To keep them in a cheerful mood.
This know: 'tis, but the set intent
To crush their pride that they resent
These "Jim Crow" laws, 'Tis not to be
Allowed in white society
That they are heard to make complaint,
But 'tis because it tends to paint
The Negro as. a creature vile
That decent people will defile.
Black hands prepare the food they eat,
They mix together on the street,
They toil together on the farm,
Their babes are nursed in Negro arms,
They blacks, engage to drive the coach,
They wait upon them in the porch,
Blacks vote with them election days
And imitate them in all ways.
Black porters serve them in the cars,
Black waiters are the leading stars
At hotels, on the ocean's shore,
Blacks, first must meet them at the door
As butlers, or as chamber-maids,
Blacks patronize them in their trades;
When they are sick, blacks stand near by
And weep around them when they die.
To this, the whites do not object,
But seem to think it incorrect
That Negro passengers should be
But treated with the courtesy
Due decent folk in any place,
Regardless of their rank or race,
And that a crime do blacks commit
When they within a Pullman sit.
This fact, I've tried to make quite clear:
The whites, of contact, have no fear
Or disapproval of the blacks
When they are tools and jumping jacks
And servants meek, but foul they grow,
When they to wealth and honor soar,
'Tis then upon the blacks they frown
And make new laws to hold them down.
Remember that it teaches hate,
When men the races separate,
Not having shown a single cause
Why they adopt such stringent laws;
The Negro takes the law to be
An evidence of enmity,
The whites see in it a disgrace
To treat as men, the Negro race.
The smallest child on hatred feeds
And such foul food, begets the seeds
Of coming trouble on that day
The older men have passed away.
The boys who study history,
Themselves their country's rulers see
In promise of the future bright,
Whether those boys be black or white.
There could not be a greater sin
Than thus to teach a set of men
To highest places to aspire,
And then attempt to check the fire
On manhood's altars once aflame,
No greater crime, in Justice's name,
Could a democracy commit,—
Such deeds, republics, ill befit.
The world should know this is the cause
Why blacks oppose the "Jim Crow" laws.
Let it be known that they oppose
Their designation as "Jim Crows";
In this repulsive name, they see
The dagger of an enemy,
Who seeks to cast around their name
The stigma of eternal shame.
Foreign Labor.
The convict from a foreign shore
Has scarcely reached this land before
Its laws and statutes he defies
And the flag of anarchy he flies.
The magnates' property he loots,
The workmen in the mines he shoots,
With arms the nation's life he'll seek,
Before its tongue he learns to speak.
And when as unionist, he's struck,
And set with fire his landlord's truck,
The wheels of industry he stops,
In fields, and harbors, mines, and shops,
And factories, while on this land
He only waits to get command
On ships and forts to keep an eye
Unchallenged as a prowling spy.
Not one such crime do blacks commit,
But here indignantly they sit
With looks of sadness on each face,
As foreign labor takes the place.
No torch nor bomb have they applied;
Their country's flag they've not defied;
They've kept no set of men from work;
Their country's flag ne'er did they shirk.
They love the flag which set them free,
They love the name of liberty,
They love this form of government,
They love the nation's president,
They love the fundamental law,
But bitterly do they abhor
The law's interpretations vile,
That now some statute-books defile.
Their institutions are their own;
This is the only land they've known,
No "Fatherland" nor kindred shore
Have they to lure them any more
Their sworn allegiance to divide
Between this country where abide
They now, and that from whence they came.
No other race can say the same.
Yet men have tried to their disgrace,
To treat them as an alien race,
Despite the fact that they alone
Columbians are in blood and bone.
No Irish, Scotch, nor Russian Pole,
No foreign born do their ranks hold.
From emigration, get they none,
So they increase by births alone.
Riddance of Criminals.
When earth and sky from naught had sprung,
And nature's children yet were young,
Man learned to trace the monster crime
By its disgusting filth and slime.
When Cain, the blood of Abel shed
And from the haunts of mankind fled,
Yea, crimie first introduced by Cain,
Till Gabriel blows, will here remain.
'Tis not the legacy of race;
'Tis not confined to any place
'Tis not a stranger to the strong;
The old and young have practiced wrong;
'Tis found to be a foul disease
Inoculated by degrees;
Hereditary has it grown,
From father handed down to son.
A knave or fool must be the man
Who tells a race it never can
Become respected as a class
Until it rids its entire mass
Of men who practice petty crimes.
'Twere best to wait to hear the chimes
Of golden bells in paradise,
Descending from the starry skies.
Good people should their means unite
That they make a stubborn fight
To check the tendency to crime;
They can't afford to take the time
That it would take to find a race
Has been a stranger to disgrace;
They can't afford to be content
With strictly racial betterment.
Helpless would be the Negro's lot
If fruits of justice he'll have not
Until of criminals he's rid;
No race or nation 'neath the lid
Of earth's vast cauldron has been known
To be of evil-doers shorn,
Nor do they ever dream to be
Of their unwelcome presence free.
Chun Chus are hated Chinese fiends,
Ladrones disgrace the Philippines,
The Russians fear the terrorists,
The Frenchmen dread the terrorists,
Italians watch the Mafia bands
England in fear of strikers stands;
This land can boast so many crimes
That I can't place them in these rhymes.
Those who the daily papers read
Will find they'll have but little need
Their fertile brains to exercise
To find some one to criticize
Because of shocking scandals done
Of every kind beneath the sun,
For here in this enlightened land
Crimes stalk abroad in every hand.
Not from among the Negro ranks
Find we the men who rob the banks
Of thousands worth' of stocks and bonds
And, loaded with their loot, absconds;
Nor have they learned to counterfeit,
Nor with the robbers made a hit;
The whites, as criminal in class
Their compeers black do far surpass.
No one should say a race should wait
For Justice, 'till it regulates
Its bad men to oblivion,
A thing no other race has done.
The man who utters such remarks
But fans alive the smoulderings sparks
Of criticism of the race,
Whom all are seeking to efface.
Statesmen Digressed.
Few are the men who dare to speak
For justice for the poor and weak,
But everywhere is heard the horn
Of those who hold them up to scorn,
Few are the statesmen now we see
Who cry aloud for liberty.
Few Patrick Henrys spend their breath
While shouting "Liberty or death!"
Few Hancocks, Washingtons, and Greens
Appear in any modern scenes
Few Daniel Websters, Henry Clays,
Lees, Calhouns, Sumners, John C. Hays,
Few Horace Greeleys, Thomas Reeds,
Few Breckenridges, Jackson, Meades,
Few William Garrisons appear
For right, insults and shame to bear.
Few Alex Stephens, George F. Hoars
Adorn our legislative floors;
Few Lincolns, Douglasses, and Tombs,
The statesman's firmament illume;
Few are the men who dare oppose
The public sentiment of those
Who have the power the votes to cast
Which can their future greatness blast.
Few have there been since Hoar, to be
The champions of the oppressed free;
Few choose as cause for party fights
The championship of human rights.
Such statesmanship is of the past;
Now, leading men will stand aghast,
With terror written on their brows
If asked this doctrine to espouse.
The nation, giants once could boast
In Congress halls, while now that post
Of honor is by pygmies filled;
Great millionaires, in finance skilled,
But who, in statesmanship and law,
Must be considered rank and raw,
When with past statesmen we compare
Their present worth is not at par.
The reason why I'll try to give:
Though true it is that now we live
Within the most enlightened age
That is recorded on the page
Of this old world's known history,
The key to this great mystery
Is, that a past democracy
Stands now, a huge plutocracy.
The plutocrat with ill got gains
Usurps the place of men of brains;
The rights of men, they'll freely own,
Is matter unto them unknown;
The poor they've practiced to oppress,
But wrongs they've learned not to redress;
Their hearts are hardened by their greed,
They have no thought of poor men's need.
Ambassadors fill places which
Are only given to the rich.
So sordid has the nation grown
That now its agents must be known
For wealth, and not ability,
While men of capability
In private life must make their mark,
And at the wrongs in office bark.
What we most need, is fearless men
*Like "Fire-alarm Joe" and "Patrick Ben,*
Who stand immovable and strong
To their convictions, right or wrong,
No changelings do they prove to be,
But men of fixed integrity;
No flag of compromise they fly,
But right or wrong, they do, or die.
The men now held in public light
Place self before the cause of right;
On vital questions take no side
But drift according to the tide
Of fickle public sentiment,
But loud are they and eloquent
When they are sure their words will be,
A bid for popularity.
The creators of sentiment
Are like the sparks of steel and flint,
Which lying singly side by side
Send forth no fire until applied
Has been to one a goodly blow,
When from the impact will there glow
The spark which kindles to a flame
That once in force, no man can tame.
Columbus, though rebuffed and sneered,
Still to the firm belief adhered
That in the future, 'twould be found
The earth, not flat would prove but round.
Old Galileo fought until
Proved he to men, the sun stood still,
While all the planets held in space,
Around it moved, each in its place.
Unpopular indeed was seen
The doctrine of the Nazerine
Still he hypocrisy assailed,
Until the light of truth prevailed;
And righteousness began to sweep
The earth, as angry waves, the deep
Lash into fury; and His name
Savior of men, do all proclaim
Were Garrison and Sumner cursed
Because they stood among the first
To advocate that slaves should be
Declared by law, forever free.
Luther, and Roger Williams fought
For what they felt the scriptures taught;
And Lincoln's life of duty done,
From men, undying praise has won.
The party lines in years agone
O'er doctrines great were strictly drawn;
The Constitution, men adored,
And not a statesman could afford
To say in jest or earnestness,
It had outlived its usefulness;
Sat none supremely satisfied
And saw its teachings set aside.
No Advocates.
No one doth for the Negro speak,
But that some one is heard to shriek
That such defense is "slinging dirt,"
Or "waving of the bloody shirt;"
The South attempting to insult,
For such will be the sure result
Of speeches in the blacks' defense,
Has grown race hatred so intense.
Men rack their brains to find excuse
This patient people to abuse;
Their deeds of shame go to the press,
Their deeds of honor they suppress;
Harp they upon their ignorance,
But frown on their intelligence;
They scorn them in their poverty
And hate them in prosperity.
They give their highest mead of praise
To those who served through slavery days
Unlearned, and of ambition stripped,
For life's stern duties, unequipped,
Who on themselves do not depend
And who will not themselves defend;
But with their lot are satisfied
It matters not HOW cast aside.
But those who strive to reach renown
By honest means are hounded down;
'Tis said they "started at the top,"
Therefore 'tis best that they should stop
And from the bottom make a start,
Where they would play no leading part
In proving that the race can rise
As high as any 'neath the skies.
No other people, kith or kin,
Were ever told where to begin,
If bottom, middle or the top,
Or when and where they ought to stop,
But they are kindly let alone
To choose a basis of their own,
And from that base begin to climb
By leaps and bounds, to heights sublime.
Where would such stupid dolts as these
Have kept the gallant Japanese?
Just sixty years since they began
And now among the first they stand
In science, learning, war and art;
Not at the bottom did they start,
Nor by slow process did they creep,
But landed at a single leap.
'Tis true the ruling dynasty
Is traced through many a century;
'Tis true did they of learning boast
Ere Perry's ships had reached their coast;
'Tis true brave soldiers had they been
Before they met with Western men;
But the whites declared that they were blind,
And near a thousand years behind.
Their rapid rise but goes to show
That progress is not for the slow.
Let gifted Negroes of today
Begin to build where'er they may;
Let them act like the Japanese,
And start in life just where they please.
Most of their hardships are the fault
Of their own race, who halloa—halt!!
Let Them Alone.
Let the poor Negroes have some peace,
And let their own traducers cease
To charge them with incompetence
And lack of push and common sense;
Let men not strive to hold them back,
But help them overcome the pack
Of human wolves, who howl and bark
Each time a Negro makes his mark.
Let them but have an equal chance
With other men to make advance
Along the highway to success;
Let none his energies suppress;
Tear down that prejudicial wall,
Then see if he will rise or fall;
Look not upon him as a foe
Who should receive a telling blow.
Open to him "The door of hope,"
And then let's see if he can cope
In fierce combat with other men
Of longer start and fairer skin;
Remove the blighting curse of caste,
And recollection of his past,
From intercourse in civil life,
And then confront him in the strife.
Remove the shackles from his feet
And bid him in life's race compete,
With every people 'neath the skies,
And if he then should fail to rise
His warmest friends must then admit
That he has shown himself unfit
On honor's scroll to gain a place,
Mongst men now styled the favored race.
We do not mean by let alone
That of restrictions he'll have none;
Not let alone so much that he
Will license take for liberty;
Not let alone to breed disease,
Nor to disturb his neighbor's peace.
Let him have peace while he makes bold
To lay on progress' plow, firm hold,
And turn the soil, and sow the seeds
Of thriftiness and worthy deeds,
His problem taking from the shelf
Of politics, while he himself
By honest means and firm resolve.
Will finally that problem solve.
The problem greatest in his mind
Is to discern why have combined
Against his uplift all the world,
And stones of hindrance are hurled
Upon his poor defenseless head.
Why not for stones, pelt him with bread
Of trust and milk of kindness give,
So that he may the better live?
Why not feed charity for wrath?
Remove oppression from his path;
From civil rights remove the ban,
And treat him simply as a man.
No special favors does he ask;
He can and will perform his task,
However hard, wherever placed,
If he in justice is incased.
Black Not a Disgrace.
Why place him daily on the rack?
Is it because God made him black,
Or just because he once has been 
In bondage held by other men?
Is it because the ruling class
Has fear their race he might surpass
Or is it on account of hate
That they cannot him tolerate?
Is it because he climbed too fast
That they upon him malice cast?
Is it because he's patient stood
While men upon him did intrude,
And when assaulted, showed a lack
Of inclination to strike back?
Is it for lack of unity
Men chase him with impunity?
No man should think it a disgrace
Because he has a dusky face
If he can prove to all the earth
That it has come from honest birth.
Let every colored youth take pride
In the cut and color of his hide;
His pearl-like teeth, and bright eyes rare
Let him admire his curly hair,
No living thing that God has made
Is found possessing one fixed shade
Of color, be it man or beast,
Whether the greatest or the least
Of things created do we speak,
Where'er in nature we may seek,
Of many colors will we find
The animals of kindred kind.
The horse, the cow, the sheep, the dog,
The goat, the ape, the bear, the hog,
The prowling beast within his lair
The fowl that navigates the air,
The creeping things upon the earth,
The cricket chirping on the earth,
The wondrous monsters of the sea,
Do not in color all agree.
The horse, the dog, the cow, the bear,
Are never judged by skin or hair,
Nor are the fowls by feathers known,
But by the quality they've shown.
The horse for speed and gentleness;
The dog for his intelligence;
The singing birds for pleasing airs;
For length of fur, choose we the bears.
The cow is judged by cream and milk,
The hog for compactness of build,
The fowl for flavor and for eggs ,
The grey-hound for his lengthy legs,
Is judged the whale by oil and bone,
The ostrich for his plumes alone,
Is due the friendliness for cats
To their affinity for rats.
'Tis not the texture of the hair,
Nor if the skin be dark or fair,
Tis not the color of the eyes,
Nor is it strictly for the size
That animals are widely known,
But by their qualities alone.
For usefulness, their breeds became
Admitted to the scroll of fame.
The sequel is: let men be known
For what of merit they have done
In carving out the destiny
Of selves and their posterity;
And that the villian and the drone
According to their deeds be known,
And not allowed a yeoman's place
Because of color of the face.
Let upright conduct blaze the way
To recognition. Let none say
That he no effort need put forth
To indicate his present worth
In the equation of life's plan,
And still be the peer of any man;
Let man's most lofty standard be
His merit and integrity.
Let none the worthy thrust aside;
Let none the scoundrel's actions hide;
Let worthy men together herd,
And let them speak a friendly word
For those attempting to ascend
To higher ground. Assistance lend
To those encompassed by distress
Or fighting wrong with earnestness.
Judge not a man by dress or skin,
But judge him by the things within;
Not by his father's pedigree,
But by the evidence we see
Of his ability and thrifty
And his desire to help to lift
The burden from his brother's back,
And not upon him burdens pack.
The Future.
Neither Emigration Nor Segregation.
Equal to those of any race
Which comes to dwell upon the face
Of this known Western hemisphere,
As sacred do his rights appear.
Let this to all the world be known:
This is the land he calls his own,
By birth, by sacrifice and toil,
And blood that drenched the thirsty soil.
Deceived are they who speculate
That they'll be forced to emigrate
To distant lands beyond the seas;
Remove such fickle thoughts as these,
And in their stead, bear it in mind,
That nations of the earth combined,
Them, cannot force to emigrate
Unless they them exterminate.
Here were they brought against their will,
Here were their hands refined to skill,
Here learned they of the living God,
Here rests their dead beneath the sod,
Here snatched they wealth from mother earth,
Here dwelt in sorrow and in mirth.
Here learned the sweets of liberty,
And here will stay until they die.
But thirteen years do separate
The whites and Negroes' landing date
Upon this cherished continent,
And it would seem impertinent
That one should claim lay to the place
And aliens call the other race
Which by their sides toiled night and day
The nation's corner-stone to lay.
In other lines, methinks I've shown
How, with the country's growth, he's grown,
How he in every war has been,
How he in every trade is seen,
How he the soil has come to own,
How he to heights of fame has flown,
How he has conquered ignorance,
How that he only asks a chance.
Suppose that he was forced to go,
Will some one well informed please show
The land, the place, the spot, the state,
To which could he now emigrate,
And build a nation of his own
Where to molest him there was none,
And where he'd have a chance to show
What he is well prepared to do?
His motherland—old Africa,
Is no more his than Canada.
'Tis swallowed by the white man's greed
To found an empire for his seed;
Apportioned are its fertile plains,
Its mountain slopes and vast domains
Amongst the European courts
By means of weapons of all sorts.
This government and tongue, blacks know,
And when to reap and when to sow;
How best a conflict to avoid,
How best their means may be employed,
What from the nation to expect,
And what is needed to inject,
Into the drowsy nation's pulse
So as to yield the best results.
We've shown they will not emigrate,
Nor will they ever segregate
Within the confines of a state
For reasons I enumerate:
Again, my words must I repeat,
No place is there to rest his feet
Without some form of government
Under the white man's management.
Never an acre or a field
Unto the black man will he yield;
Never surrender what he owns
Except for profit or as loans;
Never to black men lend a hand
To prove that equals they can stand;
Never their statesmen grow so bold
That they will such a doctrine hold.
Nor will the black man sacrifice
At the behest of enemies
His life's accumulation dear,
Because of prejudice or fear,
Renounce allegiance to his own
And hie to lands to him unknown;
The country of the white man too—
And there begin his life anew.
Happy would be the Negro race
If on this globe, there was a place
Where, unmolested might they be,
To work out their own destiny.
But, like the Jews, whose people roam,
With not a place to call their home,
Must they receive the world's applause,
And here, help shape the country's laws.
Oppression's rod, the Pilgrims sent
To settle in this continent;
They braved the dangers of the sea
To gain religious liberty;
Preferred they death from savage bands
To unjust blows from tyrant's hands;
They left for lands to them unknown
To found a country of their own.
And that new land to which they went
Was to their former government
An offspring, called a colony,
Which would pursue such policy
As might the motherland suggest
That the conditions fitted best
Another tract of land to bring
Under the banner of their king.
Oppression's ever grinding heel,
Severely do the Negroes feel.
Without the nation's sympathy,
Or country unto which to flee;
No means of transit do they own,
Nor will their white friends lend them one;
Tis therefore true that here must they
For generations have to stay.
To blacks who wish to go away
To other lands take heed, I pray,
Unto the warning given here:
No nation's borders, venture near,
Till you have reason to believe
That justice will your sons receive,
And that their service to the state,
The nation will appreciate.
A country need they like old Rome,
Where all .who entered, could become
Good Romans in the fullest sense
Who bared their breasts in its defense;
She did not dwell upon their past,
Or hesitate because of caste,
But, for their gallantry in war
Stood equals all before the law.
Let blacks who have a settled will
To emigrate, go to Brazil—
The only land we call to mind
Which has no caste or color line;
A country famed for vast extent,
But sparce indeed in settlement;
A country where each man is known
For good or ill that he has done.
Her fertile soil would yield produce
For more than half the whole world's use;
Her rulers stand with open hands
To welcome thrifty emigrants;
Her climate, very much the same
As Africa's, from whence you came;
Her people brave, her statutes just,
Her promises the people trust.
No other clime, no other place
Presents such promise to the race.
Her citizens, not white, nor red,
Nor black, nor brown, live not in dread
That they'll be known by act or law,
Save as Brazilians, similar
In treatment, point of law, and chance
Along life's highway to advance.
Contend For Rights.
Here will the Negro ever stay,
But not so patient as today
Will appear a decade hence,
For there will rise in his defence
A Patrick Henry, who will seek
To teach them they are not so weak
As men would have them to suppose
Who do their manhood rights oppose.
He'll tell them those who yield to wrong
Will weaker grow instead of strong;
He'll ask if blacks must wait With pains
Till they are loaded down with chains;
He'll bid them take experience's lamp
To guide them from the dismal swamp
Of persecution, and his breath
Will shout for liberty or death!
Nor will his pleadings be in vain,
For love of freedom will again
From sea to sea, this nation shake,
Till men the mighty pen will take
Their cause to plead in daily press
Till men have reason to confess
As being true those words adored:
"The pen is mightier than the sword."
A Frederick Douglass will there be
Pleading the love of liberty;
A William Garrison will rise
To rail against men's tyrannies;
A Sumner on the Senate floor,
The lack of justice will deplore;
A G-reely stand a champion for
The constitution and the law.
Men through the press will seek to show
Whether are true those words or no,
That in the strife 'twixt sword and pen
The latter would the battle win;
And by the pen 'twill be their bent
To work on public sentiment
Till those who have the wrong condoned
From the place of power will be dethroned.
Leaders and Martyrs.
But should the pen and speeches fail
For manhood rights aught to prevail,
Then in the cause of right and truth
Must needs there to arise forsooth,
A Cranmer or a Polycarp
To furnish food for minstrel's harp;
A Wycliffe, Knox, or Latimer
Who'll brave the fire and rapier.
Must look Nat Turner's spirit down
With pride, upon a black John Brown;
A Mirabeau or a Monet,
Whose daring will in motion set
The never failing wheels of fate,
Which in the end will culminate
In crushing out the tyrant's power
As do the mills grind wheat to flour.
There must be martyrs to the cause
Of revolution in our laws;
Some daring colored William Tell
Who for his race his life will sell;
Some sainted Arnold Winkelreid,
A name to thrill the dullest Swede;
A Martin Luther or a Hale
Whom threats of death will never quail.
Must have the race a Rhoderick Dhru,
Who never fear nor falter knew;
'Tis theirs to rear a Robert Bruce
Whose leadership the yoke must loose
Of cowardice and! impotence
So that they'll strike in their defense.
Armed Resistance.
And should these means accomplish naught,
Then must be tried the last resort.
To every man beneath the sky
Hath nature willed that he must die;
Nor can he choose the time nor place
In which to end his earthly race.
Though cowards cringe and beg for breath,
No mercy shows the reaper—Death.
Since must men die by nature's laws,
Then why not in a righteous cause
Yield up the ghost? Why not a name
Write with their blood in the halls of fame?
Why "scourged unto their dungeons go
Like galley slaves?" Why not bestow
A hero's lustre on their seed
In meeting death in gallant deeds?
What nobler death can heroes die
Than in the cause of liberty?
WThat could more clearly prove a wrong
Than that the weak attack the strong?
For dying at Thermopylae
Leonidas will sainted be.
The Greeks in war are lauded most
For beating Artaxerxes' hosts.
Was dazed the world by Boer pluck
When they at British prestige struck;
So must the Negro rise to fame
By being tried in battle fame.
True has it been e'er since the flood
Reforms come not except by blood.
The men oppressed must learn to know
"Who would be free must strike the blow."
When man in disobedience trod
Beneath his feet the will of God,
And culprit, at His bar he stood,
'Twas only by the precious blood
Shed on the cross of Calvary
Could he escape the misery
Of death eternal, and the smell
Of brimstone fumes—the smoke of hell.
Through blood, the earth reforms has known;
Through blood have leading empires grown;
Through blood the world is Christianized;
Through blood are heathens civilized,
And blood the means will ever be,
By which men gain their liberty.
Not blood of some one in their stead
But blood which they themselves have shed.
The Leader.
Throughout creation do we find,
Of classes, are there but two kinds
Of beast or bird, of fish or man
As the fulfillment of the plan
Of nature's law, which has decreed
That some must follow, others lead.
The followers are never gone;
The leaders are not made, but born.
The sceptre of the honored queen,
In every hive of bees is seen;
The ant, no food to heap will bring
Without an order from the king;
The cattle roaming" o'er the hill;
Are guided by their leader's will;
The schools of fish that swarm the deep,
The mountain goat, the wolf, the sheep,
The elephant and bison herds,
The goose and all migrating birds,
The beaver and the prairie dog,
The antelope and fierce wild hog,
The proud wild horse upon the plains,
With independence in his veins,
Each, all of them their leaders know,
And where they lead, there will they go.
So in the government of man
There's no exception to the plan;
But rather more is seen the need
Of followers and men who lead;
Of cultured men the world to sway,
And men born only to obey;
Some born for buckler, sword and shield,
The sceptre, some were born to wield.
Of millions who are daily born,
But few indeed live to be known
Unto the world; few win a name
That will receive the world's acclaim;
Thousands contend in every cause
Just one or two win men's applause.
Who were the men who made their mark
When Father Noah built the ark?
When men accomplish worthy deeds,
All men revere the man who leads;
The thousands who the work have done
Will go unto their graves unknown;
Though gallant men they prove to be,
They die unsung in history;
BHit should they fail, the badge of shame
Will be attached to the leader's name.
'Tis not when we are blessed with peace
Without a single adverse breeze
To beat upon our little bark
Do we behold the men of mark.
But when oppression's cruel heel
Our hearts transform to hardened steel,
When tyrants stand with galling chains
The blood to chill within our veins,
When all around is pitchy dark
With not a life-boat nor an ark
Wherein the tempest tossed may hide,
While 'round them rolls destruction's tide,
'Tis then the leader's voice is heard
To give command, and, at his word
Confusion into order flies,
And hope's bright sun illumes the skies.
Thus 'twas that Moses Israel led
From Egypt's coast, across the Red
Sea. Thus did Joshua overthrow
The Canaanites at Jericho.
So Gideon slew without a sword,
His tens of thousands for the Lord.
So David with a sword and sling
Soon won a crown as Israel's king.
So Alexander, called the Great,
Made Macedon a mighty state;
So Hannibal was known in Rome
When to her walls with arms he's come;
So Caesar had a kingdom won
When he had crossed the Rubicon;
So William came from Normandy
And took the land of Brittainy.
So did Napoleon's skill acquire
The world to be a French empire;
So Wellington leaped into view
When he had won at Waterloo;
So Scipio became adored
When Hannibal gave him his sword;
Frederick the Great was hailed with pride
When he had Prussia unified.
So wrought Toussaint L'Ouverture
When he a nation did procure;
So Washington o'er earth was known
When he this land from England won;
A naval god will Perry be
For Battles won upon the sea;
And so must Grant a hero be
For his defeat of Robert Lee.
Know we, a crisis now is near,
And on the scene will there appear
A Negro leader, brave and true,
And firmly ground in race pride, too;
A new Toussaint L'Ouverture,
An Attacks or a Maceo,
Some one who dares to do the right
And who will shirk not from a fight.
A man who will not hesitate
A blow to strike, nor meditate
Upon results sought to be gained,
Or if the end can be attained;
A man who'll seek to do his best
By might of arms, his race to wrest
From unjust laws and misery,
Or in such cause to die nobly.
That liberator standeth near;
His star, to us will soon appear;
And black men when they hear his words,
The pep will yield, and take to swords;
The farmer will discard his hoe,
And to the front with musket go;
The preacher will his Bible close
To deal out death, unto his foes.
A traitor will he be proclaimed,
And vagabonds his followers named,
Unworthy of the name of men
When they the work of death begin,
But once the coals of wrath are stirred
These wronged men will not be deterred
For butchery and thirst for blood
By rantings of the multitude.
But onward will their columns go,
And fiercer will the conflict grow,
'Till death in every hamlet stalks
And pestilence and suffering walk
Throughout the land in ghoulish glee,
And blacks and whites alike will flee
The wrath of the avenger's sword,
Which, with the dead, the land has strewed.
No quarter will these fighters show,
Nor sex, nor age, nor friendship know,
But with the musket, sword and flame
Will they the fiercest savage shame
By deeds of cruelty so black
That their commission will but smack
Of fiendish spirits; born to dwell
Within the lowest depths of hell.
And through a livid stream of hell
Produced by shot and bursting shell,
And plunged within a crimson flood
Which forms a lake of human blood
Undaunted will their columns go;
Nor will they fear nor falter know
Till those who rule will recognize
Their claim for legal rights is wise.
Africa.
Old Africa, the Lord must know;
Good men, the gospel seeds must sow,
And if the heathen they convince
First must they win their confidence;
Must in their lifework bear a part,
Must practice no deceptive art,
For Christ his hearers never taught
That faith could be with muskets bought.
The Christian blacks the word must take,
Wherewith the bread of life to break
Unto these long benighted men,
Their racial friends, their kith and kin;
They must the deadly climate brave
Those precious souls from death to save;
The knowledge gained in other lands
Must civilize those heathen bands.
Black Kingdoms of the Future.
Kingdoms and empires will they form
In Afric's fertile bosom warm;
Liberia will important grow;
An empire great will be Congo;
Ashantee's greatness will return;
The Zulus, great distinction earn;
Proud Abyssinia's lurid skies
To leading kingdom will arise.
Not subjects nor protectorates,
But honored independent states
With -polished kings and emperors,
And with a code of upright laws;
With warships riding on the seas,
And armies large to keep the peace;
With schools and splendid halls of art,
And in life's drama taking part.
The Aryan peoples now so great
And strong, will soon deteriorate
In art, in science and in law,
And in the finer points of war;
Will in their morals retrograde,
Their splendid governments will fade
Or crumble by the heavy hands
Of darker race invading bands.
This fact, the careful student greets;
That history itself repeats;
That what was done in days agone,
May we prepare for later on;
That nothing 'neath the sun is new,
Though lost art oft is, brought to view,
And, as past nations found decay,
So must the present pass away.
Malay or Mongol, Jap or Turk,
Or Negro, will begin the work
Of dissolution, which will grow
Till Aryan prestige, none will know;
Till present ruling empires vast
Become but relics of the past;
And where, upon the mighty seas
Strange pennons flutter in the breeze.
This sad catastrophe will come
From discontent and war at home,
And disregard for law and right,
Ere comes the damning, withering blight
Of foreign conquest, when must fall
These cherished institutions all;
And when must rise to take their place
The statutes of another race.
Proud India, when the British wane,
Her independence will regain
And prosper as in days of yore,
A province to be nevermore.
Her thrones and temples as of old,
Bedecked will stand, with purest gold;
In statecraft, arms: and industry,
Sublime, her dusky sons will be.
Will Europe's rulers rue the day
The Chinese wall was swept away;
As their defenseless coasts they see
Alive with Mongol soldiery
In vengeance come, to strike the blow
To crush their country's standing foe.
The "Yellow peril" is no myth
The people's minds to conjure with.
Awakened have these people been
By contact with dishonest men,
Who sought their country to despoil,
\And drive them from their native soil
Or rule them with an iron hand
Subject to kings of foreign land;
So now these yellow hoards prepare
To beard the lion in his lair.
And Nippon, empire of the seas,
Stands proud possessor of the keys
The door of hope to open wide
Unto that Oriental tide,
Which, like the Goths and Gauls of old,
To conquer Europe will make bold;
Nor will they from their conquests cease
Till haughty Europe sues for peace.
The distant Philippines will be
An independent nation, free
From foreign rule, and none will dare
Her starry flag1 to treat unfair.
Will be her cities beautified,
Her coasts and harbors fortified,
Her merchant-ships like busy bees,
With treasures filled, will sail the seas.
Her long lost science, wealth and fame,
Dark Ethiopia will reclaim.
Important cities will she boast,
Built inland, and upon the coast;
Her rivers, rivulets and rills,
A swarm will be with busy mills;
Her soil with railroads all around,
A perfect network will be found.
Great centers of the world's best trade,
These cities will in time be made:
Adis, Abeba, Ankobar,
With Harrar, Harper and Dondar,
Old Cape G'oast Castle, Kunassi,
Boma, Banana, Matadi,
Monrovia, Akkra, Great Bassum.
Buchanan, Edna, and Atsum.
Old Zanzibar and the Soudan,
Guinea, and Bechuanaland,
From, years of slumber will awake,
And resolution's sword will take
And to the battle-field will go
The tyrant whites to overthrow. 
And Zanzibar will hold a place
As high in fame as any race.
Its walls, with frowning guns arrayed,
A fort impregnable is made
Where slowly and majestically
The Congo flows into the sea,
Its Western borders to protect
From foreign greed, which would subject
Their sons to be but crawling things,
The property of distant kings.
With wisdom born of suffering,
The Negus and the native kings
Their latent race pride will arouse
And this new doctrine will espouse
Of "Africa for Africans,"
While Kaffirs and Numidians,
Ashantee bucks, and Zulu braves;
Well armied will rise to punish knaves.
Nor will these people be content
To be on peaceful callings bent.
Ambition's omnipresent wiles
Their kings will bind, and vengeance's smiles
Besistlessly will draw them on
With mite, to strike a blow beyond
The confines of their native shores
To settle up long standing scores.
O'er Southern Europe will they crowd
Till they appear a dusky cloud
Which marks the approaching' hurricane,
Whose forward rush 'twill be in vain
By human power, for men to check,
Till they have taught them to respect
The prowess of the sons of Ham
Like those of France or Uncle Sam.
As honored will their rulers be
As those of Spain or Germany.
Their subjects, should they choose to roam,
In other countries far from home,
Who now by all men are despised,
Will then by men be lionized;
Men's present; prejudice will flee
Before their gallant soldiery.
Their kingdoms, for defense allied;
Their subjects firmly unified;
Their soil, the richest of the earth,
With mines beneath of untold worth;
Their boundless forests, stately, grand,
The greatest known in any land
Whose timbers are with wealth replete
To bring the world unto their feet.
The pyramids and stolid sphinx,
In architecture form the links
Between their skill in ages gone
And what they'll bring forth later on
When giant structures will they rear,
To which "sky-scrapers" will appear
As ant-hills, to the mountain steep
Or to elephants, the barnyard sheep.
Will look the world to them, for bread
As Egypt once all nations fed;
For barley, rice and Indian maize,
Will these enlightened Negroes raise
Upon their fertile virgin soil
Without the worry, care and toil
Of other lands, with folks so filled
That they have left no land to till.
Finis.
Thou father Time, whose wrinkled face
Can men through all the ages trace,
Whose fleecy locks and weary feet
In every stage of life we meet;
Whose voice breaks through the shades of gloom
To point us to our future tomb,
Who holds the seal of destiny
Of earth's created progeny.
Thou, who with nature's God began
Ages before had erring man
Culled from the dust, received his breath,
Thou, who will live when ghastly Death
His reaper's blade has cast aside,
And he who kills himself has died,
Thou who didst nature's course begin
And who must cause its final end.
Thou whom the living God must slay
When earth and sky have passed away—
Do thou but let the seasons roll
By rapidly, till mien behold
What God had hidden in His plan,
When He at first created man
Of kindred blood, upright and free,
Who later dwelt in enmity.
Mounted within thy chariot old,
Thy rig of ages manifold,
With lnos§y coat, and creaking wheels
From whence anon are heard the peels
Of thy long, tarnished, brazen gong,
Whose sounds, remind the passing throng
That by thy clock, the hour has come
When must they sleep within the tomb.
Do thou this evil era chase,
Annihilate the giant space,
Yea, lash thy ancient gory steed,
Ages to fly with lightning spfeed,
That earth may early realize
God's justice and his purposes
In earth dividing by the seas,
For marks of racial boundaries.
Roll on, till realized have been
The prophecies of holy men,
That Ethiop, the land of Nod,
Her hands shall stretch forth unto God;
And when the islands of the sea
With harps and voice atune will be
With praises loud, on hill and plain,
Of Christ, the lamb for sinners, slain!
Roll by the days of strife and blood;
Roll on till man in rectitude
Again is clothed as at the first
In Eden fair he stood, 'til cursed
For disobeying- God, he fell
From heir of grace to child of hell,
From whence was he redeemed alone
By the blood of Christ, the holy one.
Roll on, 'til here on earth has come
The long-looked-for millennium,
When sweetly sleeping side by side,
Will lion and the lamb abide;
'Till soldiers' swords brought from their nooks.
Fashioned have been to reapers' hooks;
'Till beasts and prey, together feed,
And them a little child shall lead.
Roll on, till throughout earth is hushed
The murmurings of spirits crushed
By other spirits, stronger, vile,
That feed on wickedness and guile,
Till driven from the haunts of men
Has been the Devil, chained again,
Condemned eternally, to dwell
As ruler of a burning hell.
Let rapidly the ages roll,
Till have the heavens as a scroll
Been gathered, and the earth doth quake
As Gabriel will the trumpet take
And flying through the air will blow
Thy doom, for Time, thou Death, must know;
But in thy stead shall God above
Give endless life and perfect love.
Roll on, the dreadful judgment day,
When men shall reap what sown have they
In life; the day of days most feared
By wicked men, but most endeared
To those who've persecutions stood,
While striving for the Master's good;
The day when men must venture forth
To sell according to their worth.
The day when brought before the throne,
Nor race, nor nation will be known;
And when from earth's remotest bounds
The seraphim will catch the sounds.
Of rustling wings and happy songs,
As those redeemed, enraptured throngs,
Who for the Cross have labored hard,
Shall come to gather their reward.
And when iniquity and sin
The cause of wickedness of men
Appear, their sentence to receive,
The Savior will His angels give
Command to bind them hand and feet,
And hurl them from the mercy seat
Into the burning lake beneath,
Where they shall wail and gnash their teeth.
Roll on, the day when Christ as king,
Those whom His. blood redeemed shall bring
With Him, to dwell forevermore
On Canaan's bright celestial shore;
Who carry palms of victory
And harps of sweetest melody,
Down at His precious feet will fall,
And help to crown him, Lord of all.
And on their golden pinions borne
His saints will circle 'round the throne
With hallelujahs, and again
Will sing the Christian's sweet refrain
Which never heaven heard before,
But then will hear forevermore,
Of "Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
Redeemed we've been through Jesus' blood."
And harp and psalter will repeat
The chorus in communion sweet;
And at the throne will angels meet,
Their crowns to cast at Jesus' feet,
And shout: "Hosanna, Christ the slain
For sinful man, now lives- again,
Where life shall never have an end
Now and forevermore—Amen."

 COPYRIGHT, 1914, BY SMITH &amp; SALE 
 Of this edition two hundred copies 
 have been printed. 
THE dominant note of the first volume of Leon Laviaux, the young Creole poet, is a glorification of the fille de couleur — a theme unique in literature. His poetry, except in so far as it pertains to an appreciation of natural beauty in the tropics, is unreservedly laudative of the dark-skinned races. This singular predilection is due, as he tells us, both to heredity and environment. He seeks to give it expression in strange and erotic songs, through whose fulgurant smoke break flashes of lyric fire. They are brief bursts of passion, like volcanic puffs, too fierce and impetuous for prolonged fervor. Even this can be noticed in the fragmentary character of "The Ebon Muse," his only attempt at sustained utterance. It would seem that the imaginative impulse, in those somnolent lands where inertia rules, was incapable of any enduring flight. This is undoubtedly the effect of climatic conditions on the mind. But Laviaux is still young. A cool whiff of more virile air, from zones alien to the eternal blue, may yet invigorate his Muse. Then we may have something worthier than these songs that voice the ultra-emotion of youth over plastic beauty — songs that shall breathe to us, through the scent of jasmine and the lure of palm, the soul of the Creole isles.

 Out of thy large fruit-luscious mouth, zaire

 sluggish as some palm-fringed and placid flood

 Fafine

 though fair, o north, thy nymphs

You will find the colors of the flesh are even more varied and surprising than the colors of fruit. Nevertheless it is only with fruit colors that many of these skin-tints can correctly be compared. There are banana-tints , lemon-tones, orange-hues, with  sometimes such mingling of ruddiness as in the pink ripening of the mango. Agreeable to the eyes the darker skins certainly are, and often very retnarkable — all clear tones of bronze being represented ; but the brighter tints are absolutely beautiful. There is one rare race type, totally unlike the rest; the skin has a perfectly golden tone, an exquisite metallic yellow ; the eyes are long and have long silky lashes; the hair is a mass of thick, rich, glossy curls that shoiv blue lights in the sun. What mingling of races prodttced this beautiful type? I do not think the term olive always indicates the color of this skin, which seemed to me exactly the tint of gold; and the hair flashes with bluish lights like the plumage of certain black birds. 
Physically the fille de couleur may certainly be classed, as white Creole writers have not  hesitated to class her, luith the most beautiful women of the human race. She has inherited not only the finer characteristics bodily of either parent race, but something else belonging originally to neither, and created by special climatic and physical conditions — a grace, a suppleness of form, a delicacy of extremities, so that all lines described by the bending of limbs are parts of clean curves. 
 Among her class there are figures to make you dream of Atalanta — and all, whether ugly 
 or attractive as to feature, are finely shaped as to body and limb — a type of the human thouroghbred representing the true secret of grace — economy of force. 
 — LAFCADIO HEARN
I am, by fates decree 
And my heredity. 
Of soul a hedonist, 
Of flesh an ebonist. 
THE EBON MUSE 
THE EBON MUSE 
I SAW two palms, like temple columns, soar 
 Into the night, and under far, the shore 
 Encircle with its arms of sand the sea 
 That sighed upon its bosom drowsily; 
 And all the slopes that fell in flowers to meet 
 The wave receding foamless at their feet, 
 As wide and gradual steps of purple seemed 
 Ascending to the summit where I dreamed; 
 Above the palms that mingled crowns and made 
 An arch where rustling verdure overswayed. 
 Full-orbed, and like a splendid lamp, the moon 
 Hung golden in the starless dusk of June; 
 The very air was odor, and the calm 
 Was that of love's own sleep on sea and palm; 
 And on my lids and in my heart the spell 
 With irresistible insistence fell; 
 Each drowsy sense was yielding, but before 
 The ways of dream had closed the final door. 
 Out of a sudden flash of lyric flame. 
 And virginal for me, the vision came! 
She came for me, out of a cloud of fire, 
 A regal evocation of desire; 
 For me, sole dreamer of a Creole isle, 
 Sole wooer of her world-forgotten smile ; 
 She came from some dim haunt of spirit-peace, 
 The asphodel of shadow and surcease ; 
 Across the sea, as o'er the Stygian stream. 
 Leaving the hidden shore of dusk and dream ; 
 I saw her dimly, gazing from afar, 
 As through horizon mists a sable star ; 
 The banished Muse, released from that malign 
 Decree that doomed her to her sister Nine ; 
 In Song's far dawn they first beheld her nude. 
 Abashed before a goddess ebon-hued ; 
 Drooping their lids, they turned from her in shame, 
 A being branded with almighty blame ; 
 Swiftly repulsing her they turned away, 
 Mnemosyne's white daughters of the day; 
 And left her, child of chaos, with the blight 
 Born of the black abysses of the night. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Like a bronze statue, in the softer glow. 
 She stood immobile, near to me, and lo ! 
 Where well a laureled throng might bend to her, 
 I was alone, her poet-worshipper ; 
Her lids, unlifted still, were thrall to sleep, 
 Sweet where the underworld is poppy-deep ; 
 Unravished still the lips that parted mute. 
 Riper and moister than a luscious fruit ; 
 One hand was raised while one was pressed to feel, 
 Against her heart, its passionate appeal ; 
 The surging thrill of life in every vein. 
 Glowing and potent for delight and pain ; 
 Erect and tense, lifting their pointed pride, 
 Inviolate her breasts in fervor vied; 
 Between her shoulders shone a glossy track. 
 The dented slope of her imperial back ; 
 The contour of her torso seemed to me 
 A polished buckler of black ivory ; 
 Her loins' curves like a lyre's whose symmetries 
 Dipped faultless to the dimples of the knees ; 
 Her arms with darkling sheen were sleek and fair. 
 Her throat blue-shadowed where the lustrous hair 
 Clung as the crater's smoke that densely drifts 
 When the far cloud below it breaks and lifts ; 
 And fruits and flowers, upon her burning mouth, 
 Bruised juice and drenched the perfume of the South ; 
 The mystery of the heavens was in her eyes. 
 Creation's vast and fathomless surmise ; 
 Elusive vision of immortal love 
Falling through shadow from the dome above ; 
 She seemed the incarnation of the night, 
 The glorious antithesis of light ; 
 As darkness deepened all her beauty shone 
 Fairer than any underneath the sun ; 
 And leaping upward, a triumphal span 
 Of sudden stars from wave to zenith ran ; 
 The lustre of the moon, a paling power, 
 Lingered as for a god's own bridal hour ; 
 And up the purple steps she came to me. 
 The last between the summit and the sea. 
 She came with passion in her eyes that were 
 Dewy with languor, and with lips of myrrh ; 
 Beneath her lashes lurked volcanic fire. 
 Her breath was fragrance and her glance desire ; 
 Fervor and flame of song were in her face, 
 All memory of beauty in her grace ; 
 Promise of swift fruition and the fair 
 Largess of virile years to live and share ; 
 Fresh flowers to hide the faded ones below, 
 An aureole to crown the waning glow ; 
 Rapture for torture, smiles for futile tears. 
 And satiation for the pang that sears ; 
 Illusion upon illusion, and the arts 
Of great dead lovers, earth's memorial hearts ; 
 All this and more my soul was conscious of, 
 Delirious with her beauty and her love ; 
 She came and stood before me, and delight 
 Half stifled speech and almost blinded sight ; 
 I dared not look, so stirred by all I felt, 
 But every sense was conscious that she knelt. 
 She leaned to me and laid her lips on mine, 
 Imperiously bending but benign ; 
 I drank the lyric fervor of her mouth, 
 The soul to sing the glamor of the South ; 
 High inspiration and the will to make 
 A vital strain to which the world would wake ; 
 Leaving the beaten paths of Song to blow 
 Strange music where a fameless people go ; 
 The equal glory of the night and day. 
 Wresting from light its long unchallenged sway ; 
 A hymn of racial beauty, rare and new. 
 The rival lure beneath the ebon hue ; 
 The radiance of the suns that triumph in 
 The finer lustre of the golden skin ; 
 Burnished as bronze or sable as the rise. 
 Velvet and deep, of moonless midnight skies. 
This was the gift, my heritage, that she 
 Gave with the kiss whose fire is memory ; 
 Whose freshness is of Heliconian dews. 
 The consecration of the Ebon Muse. 
CREOLE IDYLS 
LIKE slave and slave 
 With mighty plumes, 
 Great palm trees wave 
 Their clustered blooms ; 
 Along the shores 
 A curving mile 
 Of blackamoors 
 In giant file. 
 Their trunks that show 
  An ebon gleam, 
  A shining row 
 Of torsos seem ; 
 Each crest of green 
 As madras wound 
 In silken sheen 
 Their brows around. 
 And unelate, 
 This pageantry 
 A potentate 
 Has made of me ; 
The yellow sand 
 Is my divan 
 That perfume-fanned 
 I bask upon. 
 Red rifts above 
 The waves that break, 
 A circle of 
 Flamingos make; 
 My slaves I mark 
 With listless eye, 
 And near me dark 
 Sultanas lie. 
DARK on the seaward dawn, 
 Into the roseate fire, 
 The palms aspire ; 
 Into the void they yawn,  
 Summit to summit wed, 
 Green-helmeted. 
A FOAMING line 
 Of waves define 
 The outer bar 
 Of shores afar ; 
 Beneath the beat 
 Of blinding heat, 
 The ocean's hue 
 Is molten blue; 
 Where shoreward wide 
 The surges ride, 
 Two buzzards stand 
 Upon the sand ; 
 And high in air, 
 Against the glare. 
 Two others fly 
 And blot the sky ; 
 Between the sun 
 And soar of one 
 Colossal palm 
 That lords the calm. 
NOON! 
 Silence and heat ; 
 A Creole tune 
 On the lips of old Fadette ! 
 Noon! 
 Drowsy and sweet 
 The. patois croon 
 On the lips of old Fadette ! 
MYRIAD murmurs hush 
 A haunt of sloth, 
 Heavy with heat and lush 
 With giant growth ; 
 Masses of cyclic mold 
 Impede the way, 
 Pungent with scent of old  
 And vast decay ; 
 Under the leaves that dome  
 Profundity, 
 Yellow lianas roam  
 From tree to tree ; 
 Ever the endless green, 
 The endless shade ; 
 Riot of plants that screen 
 The forest glade ; 
 Brilliant with flowers that surge  
 From tangled strife, 
 Breathing creative urge  
 Of tropic life ; 
Potence of earth elate 
 And savage grown, 
 Under the suns that sate 
 Its belting zone. 
ZOMOQUE! 
 Ecstatic bird, 
 Sing on, thy heart to ease ; 
 While the glad trees 
 Toss a white cloud of blossoms to the breeze ! 
 Zomoque! 
 I have not heard 
 The nightingale, but these 
 Mad melodies 
 Are more to me than songs of other seas ! 
THE shield a god 
 Might bear who trod 
 Along the world ; 
 Or disk of fire 
 Immortal ire 
 From heaven hurled ; 
 The sea-line's rim 
 Is purple dim 
 Beneath its glow ; 
 It leaves a scar 
 Of cinnabar, 
 And sinks below. 
O CARIBBEAN wind! 
 Freshen afar and bend 
 The trees that are to thee 
 Thy twilight litany ; 
 Stir in their tops and send 
 Through palm and tamarind, 
 Blown from a shadowed sea, 
 Thy vesper prayer to me. 
OVER the hill 
 Of stunted palms 
 Faint rumbles come ;
 Breaking the still
 Night with its calms, 
 The voodoo drum ! 
 Odor of leaves, 
 Flowers of the vine. 
 Odor of flesh ; 
 Riot that weaves. 
 Bodies that shine. 
 Dances that mesh ; 
 Black satyrs steal. 
 Like jaguars, 
 On nymphs as black; 
 And whirl and reel. 
 Beneath the stars. 
 Demoniac ; 
Powdered with dust, 
 Panting they writhe 
 In fierce embrace ; 
 Burning with lust, 
 Humid and lithe 
 Their limbs enlace 
 Over the hill 
 Of stunted palms 
 Faint rumbles come ; 
 Breaking the still 
 Night with its calms, 
 The voodoo drum ! 
NIGHT, would that I, 
 God of the sky, 
 Heaped gems on thy dark 
 Bare breasts that I mark ; 
 Mine for delight, 
 Amorous Night! 
 Night, ere we part, 
 Take from thy heart 
 One jewel to be 
 Cast earthward for me ; 
 Swiftly a star 
 Falls from afar ! 
OF my loves there arc four 
 That my song would endear , 
 Golden Luore I 
 Ebon Zaire I 
 And with lyric caress 
 Laurel each, as a queen ; 
 Bronze-hued Tanesse ! 
 Amber Fafine I 
LUORE 
THE orange flare 
 Is wide on the west, Luore ! 
 And verdured palms in the lucent air 
 Tower by the shore. 
 The jasmine scent 
 Swoons heavy and sweet, Luore ! 
 Where blossom-thick is the vine's ascent 
 Over the door. 
 Your languid eyes 
 Are dim with desire, Luore ! 
 And in your heart is the heat that skies 
 At noon can pour. 
 Your body cleaves 
 In ardor to mine, Luore ! 
 Close as the vine, with its fragrant leaves, 
 The palm upbore. 
 As sweet as fruit 
 And poignant your kiss, Luore ! 
 Our lips, with ravishing fire, embrute 
 At rapture's core. 
Soul of the South, 
 I could, O my queen, Luore ! 
 Yield all my life on your luscious mouth 
 And be no more. 
Two golden doves 
 That fill their scented nest : 
 Haunt of the Loves, 
 Twin treasures of her breast ; 
 Fairer than throat 
 Or shoulder garment-free, 
 My glances gloat 
 Upon their luxury. 
THE sapphire tide, 
 Foam-fringed and inlet-wide, 
 Creeps to the beach ; 
 And the long ripples reach 
 Like silver lips o'erlapping each on each ; 
 And eager o'er 
 The body of Luore,  
 That lies supine. 
 They melt away as wine 
 Poured lavish by some lover on a shrine ; 
 Linger and kiss 
 With lips of liquid bliss 
 Each charm, and trace 
 The way of their embrace, 
 Until they vanish in some secret grace ; 
 And then, at last, 
 Their fluid lure is passed ; 
 And blithely she 
 Comes dripping from the sea. 
 And gives herself, a golden nymph, to me. 
MY passion for golden flesh 
 Seeks a honied mesh 
 (Like a bird that would soar 
 From its nest no more) 
 In thy beautiful bosom, Luore ! 
 My kisses, that flow as fire 
 O'er a fane, expire 
 (Like a flambeau of yore 
 At the bridal door) 
 In thy beautiful bosom, Luore ! 
ZAIRE
OUT of thy large fruit-luscious mouth, Zaire ! 
 As music fell, 
 With velvet iteration on my ear. 
 That syllable ; 
 As soft as flowers that patois of the French  
 From musky lips 
 That slur the guttural, O comely wench, 
 Caressful slips ; 
 Its murmur wooes the sense with fervor of  
 Some drowsy wine ; — 
 O language of the Creole isle of love.  
 Thou, too, art mine ! 
THE grace of the white and brute of the black 
 Were mixed in thee ; 
 A simian face — the slope of thy back, 
 Callipyge ! 
 Dark lustre of lines that are sculpture-sleek,  
 The vapid leer ; 
 A whim for the monstrous did Nature wreak  
 In tall Zaire ! 
STRANGE frenzies fill 
 Thy black and shining bosom's rise and fall 
 Wild passion's primal thrill, 
 Its brutal rapture immolating all ; 
 The gust that sweeps 
 The unrelenting flame along the blood ; 
 The tidal throe that keeps 
 Writhing the crest of its voluptuous flood ; 
 The slime and fire 
 That overboil the crater of thy soul ; 
 The ruin of desire 
 That tears, like the tornado, to its goal. 
A SORCERY 
 Is thine intense ; 
 The odor of thy bosom is to me 
 A potent redolence ; 
 Poignant yet sweet, 
 It breathes thy race; 
 Enters my veins, a fierce and virile heat. 
 Burning for thy embrace. 
TANESSE 
THOU art fair as the palm 
 By the shore, in the calm 
 Of the night, Tanesse ! 
 Thou art regal to me 
 As that loveliest tree 
 Of the south, Tanesse ! 
SLUGGISH as some palm-fringed and placid flood 
 Of current slow, 
 The hidden fervor blended in thy blood 
 Must ever flow ; 
 A tropic fire that slumbers in thy veins, 
 My bronze capresse ; 
 Languor of isles of indolence that reigns 
 In thee, Tanesse ! 
YOUR flesh has the scent 
 Of an exquisite musk, 
 From the amorous dusk 
 Of the orient ; 
 But the ankle-bells, 
 That tinkle and fret 
 Like a silver jet, 
 Are a ring of shells ; 
 And the madras green. 
 As thy crowning gem. 
 Is the diadem 
 On thy tresses seen ; 
 And the girdled whisk 
 Of a garment loose 
 Is the passion-noose  
 Of an odalisque ; 
 And the jasmine gates. 
 With their attar-jar, 
 Is the dim bazaar  
 Where thy lover waits. 
UNDO the scarf that hides 
 Thy breast whose bronze divides 
 In turgent loveliness 
 Of hue, Tanesse ! 
 For charms of fairer tint 
 Bare throat and shoulder hint ;  
 Sleek slopes that my caress  
 Descends, Tanesse ! 
FAFINE 
THY parroquets, Fafine, 
 With plumage green, 
 Doze in the mango tree ; 
 Only the insect-sound 
 Strident around ; 
 Life is a revery. 
 Broad on the sleeping town 
 The sun beats down ; 
 White the deserted street ; 
 Hot is the hillward noon, 
 My octoroon ; 
 Dream in the shadow. Sweet ! 
 Curl on the woven mat 
 Lithe as a cat. 
 Lissome of limb and arm ; 
 Slumber will soon relax, 
 Supple as wax. 
 All of thy body's charm. 
NUDE in the cool 
 Palm-shaded pool ; 
 The ripples gloat 
 Around your throat ; 
 Your amber limbs 
 Seem lotus stems ; 
 Your hair the blue 
 Weed's floating hue ; 
 Your face a far 
 Strange nenuphar. 
 Hot humid dusk 
 Of moon and musk ; 
 Great stars that light 
 The languid night ; 
 A couch of moss 
 To dream across ; 
 And near to me — 
 Oh, ecstasy ! 
 The moon's soft sheen 
 On you, Fafine. 
THOUGH fair, O North, thy nymphs 
 And half divine; 
 Colder to me the glimpse 
 Than snow of thine ; 
 Fair with the statue's grace. 
 Its frozen dream ; 
 Whose faultless curves no trace 
 Of tint redeem ; 
 Thrall to the law within. 
 To Nature true ; 
 Give me the golden skin 
  Or darker hue. 
 Futile, O lure of white,  
 Thy pale appeal ! 
 Mine is an Afric blight  
 That few may feel. 
MY amber dove, 
 My Creole queen,   
 O leave me not, my love ! 
 The Northern skies 
 Are grey, and lean 
 Above a land of sighs ; 
 And none will care 
 Of all, Fafine,  
 For beauty deemed less fair ; 
 Their hearts are cold. 
 Their ways are mean. 
 Their only god is gold ; 
 When you forsake 
 These slopes of green, 
 Your heart, Fafine, will break ; 
 My southland rose. 
 Abide between 
 My arms that fold you close ; 
 Ah, tears ! they tell. 
 My Creole queen, 
 That this is not farewell !

PREFACE. 
 lilS little volume of poems, which 
 we have so earnestly labored .to 
 Jj produce, is but the weak effort ol 
 an humble soul, reaching out be- 
 yond the piercing gloom and pene- 
 trating darkness; which it seems, 
 has filled a large part of our life. Regardless of tKe 
 many difficulties encumbered, however, the inner-man 
 still yearns for a larger usefulness to his race particu- 
 larly and mankind in general. All that 1 am and ever 
 shall be, possibly, is due to the faithful and assidious 
 training of my dead mother (bless her memory) and a 
 devoted lather; besides the encouragement given jme 
 by my loving sister and devoted brothers. 
 The author lays no claim to literary merit in this 
 work; for indeed, there may be numerous defects in 
 the composition, poetical metre and rythm, that none 
 but a critical mind and eye may discern and observe, 
 and as to its intrinsic value it is for you to decide, 
 dear reader. I am willing however, to launch my 
 little **bark" upon the ** Literary sea, to sinker swira, 
 survive or perish," as the case may be. 
 I beg further to thank a few friends for their kind 
 advice and helpfulness in the preparation of this 
 work- Most respectfully yours, 
 Washington, D. C. W. A. 
 February, 1914 
DEDICATED TO 
 MY BELOVED PARENTS. 
Lyrics of An Humble Birth 
 PART I. 
 A LETTAH TO DE PRESADANT. 
 Was'nton, Fust-twintee-thurd, 14. 
 Mistah Wilson, sah, mah Pres'dant, 
 Ah thought'd write yo' a line; 
 To chur yo' up a bit, but whant 
 Distub yah othah time. 
 Ahm glad yo' had a dandie trip, 
 To dat 'Pas' Khris'un' town; 
 An' dat yo' got rid ob de 'grip' 
 Yo' carrud fr'm dese groun's. 
 Ahm glad, sah, yo' didn't ke'p rite on 
 Ez stardid, on dat 'ship' ; 
 Fah feah ob dem dah 'Mexahcons', 
 Mought git yo' on de 'slip'. 
Dem countra folks, sah, sho' lak yo', 
 Doan dey? — 'n' ahm so glad; 
 Ah re'd, how dey kep' on de go 
 To find yo' an' yah 'Cad'. 
 Ah hope de 'Mistriss ob de Ian' — 
 Ah'll add (yo' dautahs) too; 
 *N'jord demselv's ez bes' dey kan, 
 Wile dey wtiz thah wid yo'. 
 Ahm glad to see 'Mah Presadant', 
 Bac' hyeah 'n' dis ol' town ; 
 So biz'ness' kan go on, Gawd grant, 
 An' ke'p dat 'Congrist' down. 
 Gib mah respechts to awl de boys — 
 'Tom'ltee', an' de res'; 
 Whahs wurkin' thah fah yo' an' 'joys 
 De t'ings dat am de bes'. 
 Now, ah mus' clos' dis lettah now, 
 Mah wurks be'n hard today; 
 Ah'll send dis writin' anyhow — 
 'Boiit awl ah got to say. 
 To de Tresadant' 
 W'ite 'ouse. 
 Yoahs trulay, 
 Tap' D. C. 
IR'NIN' HEZ SHURT. 
 ^'Yo' Sally !-er-r--Sal-ly !, 
 Com' hyeah gal, an' hurry be ; 
 Um gwine t' git yo', sho' ez day, 
 Ez yo' doan com' rite away : 
 Go 'n' git yah Daddy's shurt; 
 Doan yo' kno' hez com' fr'm wurk, 
 An' tah chu'ch has gottah go? 
 'Usht up gal — doan sa' no mo' !" 
 The lit'le girl then got the "shurt", 
 With her feelings awf'ly hurt'd ; 
 "Ir'nd" away with all her might. 
 For her "mammy" on that night. 
 "Air yo' ir'nin' dat shurt, gal?" 
 Yell'd the mother wild, to "Sal" ; 
 "Yas'uni!" answer'd her, the while, 
 Trembling like a sinner vile. 
 "Com' ole mawn, yo' suppahs' don';' 
 "Wal," said he, "ahm comin' hon' ;' 
 And the couple soon sat down 
 At the table, they were found. 
 "Lawd," said he, " 'ave mussy now, 
 Bles' dem tatoes, meat 'n' 'chow'; 
 Ar-min !"— and he fiU'd his plate. 
 As of ev'rything he ate. 
Moved his chair, as he made haste — 
 Not a minute did he waste; 
 Dressing hurried — got his tie, 
 As the ''shurt" his wife did spy — 
 "Sal-ly ! brin' dat shurt on hyeah ! 
 Whut yo' sa'? — Bettah keah ! 
 Hawn hit hyeah ! — 'Mah' ! — luks reel w'ite 
 Ole mawn, yo'll sho' luk out o' sight !" 
 *'De ole mawn" took his '*shurt" 'n' smiled, 
 Ez put'in' on, she stood and eyed : 
 "Lawd ! Swsan, dis shurt ahm hot, 
 Bu'ns me 'n' ah dunno whot !" 
 "Gwane," said she, " 'n' be a mawn. 
 Putt hit on. Si, ef yo' khan ; 
 Ef ah had'n' hurrud so, 
 Yo'd had non' fah chu'ch tah go." 
 A CHILD'S PRAYER. 
 Kneeling beside a little bed so white, 
 Clad in garments so simple and light ; 
 Praying to God as the shadows depart, 
 A lit'le child with a sorrowful heart. 
Hands clasp'd together and heart full of love, 
 Eyes lifting up towards heav'n above ; 
 Alone in this world of sorrow and fear; 
 Alone from mother's kindness and cheer. 
 "Oh! God! is my mother up there with you? 
 Let her sweet face shine out thro' skies o' blue ; 
 Pray, let her come back to me for "My Care" I 
 Would you, dear Lord? Oh, please hear my 
 prayer." 
 "I'd like to climb up them bright golden stairs, 
 To see if my mamma's now o'er there ; 
 Grandma, she tells me, each day after day, 
 That I'll see mamma, if I would pray." 
 "I have little dollies, toys — everything!" 
 Cried the poor darling child to her "King"; 
 As wafting upward those sweet words of love, 
 To the "Kingdom of Mercy" above. 
 "I try to be true, so good and so kind. 
 And my gradma, each day, I will mind ; 
 Keep us now, dear Jesus, each day by day ; 
 Amen. Good-night grandma," she would say. 
 II 
WHY WEEPEST THOU, MY LOVE? 
 The breaking waters of the deep 
 As onward rushing, blindly sweep 
 O'er distance madly; seems to speak 
 To me, as though I came to seek 
 Its passion and its fury; streak'd 
 With fierce and roaring tortures steep ! 
 And calming, while the eve'ning creeps, 
 Nor yet the rust'ling waters sleep. 
 I standeth, as enchanted, still 
 Bewilder'd, lo, in mind and will ; 
 To speak? ''Nay ! Nay !" bid'st thou the heart 
 As wounded by Dan Cupid's dart : 
 ("He loves me?— 'Yes;' he loves me?— 'Not!'") 
 Re-echoed 'round that lonely spot ; 
 When, out o' the depths rang out above 
 The mist "Why weepest thou, my love?" 
 DE MEKIN'S OB A MAN. 
 Jake, yo' ax' me whut de mekin's 
 Ob a man 'n' dis hyeah day? 
 Ah'll tell yo' q'ickly whut ah t'inks : 
 Hard wurk 'n' not no play ! 
 12 
Yo' ax' me den why, ef dey wurks, 
 Dey nebber hab no eese; 
 Bekaze, ah t'inks, dey awlus shurks, 
 'N' shurking wurk, doan pleese. 
 Mah bruddah, deirs no ust tah kic', 
 Fah kic'in' is'nt game; 
 De woild am made ob dem who stic's 
 An' wurks on jist de same. 
 Dis am de age ob really men. 
 Who ob dah knol'edge gibs ; 
 De bes' dat 'n' dem is, w'ich sends 
 De woild 'roun' ez hit libs. 
 De man who awlus dreemin' is, 
 An' nebber seems tah t'ink; 
 He soon will drap out ob de *biz', 
 An den fawl o'er de brink. 
 De woild, hit calls fah men ob strin'th, 
 Who acht upon de sq'are; 
 An' men ob currage who won't s'rink 
 Fr'm duty, 'n' who'll dare. 
 Men mus' hab nerb ef dey mus' face 
 Hard tri'ls, an' not swerb 
 One inch fr'm whah dah ac'ions' base; 
 E'vn dough de way am cur'b. 
 13 
Dese t'ings, ahve sed, dey hab som' waight, 
 Ah hope yo' undahstan' ; 
 Awl dat ahve sed is sho'ly, Jake, 
 De mekin's of a man. 
 MOTHER. 
 Tho' human as thou wert, still in thine image 
 I behold 
 Sweet visions of an lov'lier one than earth af- 
 fords ; who, bold, 
 Did fight for right with ev'ry might and with 
 all done, gone home, 
 To God, her Maker, vict'ry won — rest under 
 heaven's dome, 
 Dear Mother. 
 Remember thou her not of days, when suck- 
 ling babe I were? 
 And youthful capers with my mates, in inno- 
 cence did err? 
 "Why not?" I say, when all "my world" was 
 center'd in the hand 
 That held "me" — little fellow — up, who was 
 too weak to stand ! 
 Kind Mother. 
 14 
Her words, I well remember now, as the* 
 'twere yesterday ; 
 They sank so deep into my heart as I began 
 to pray : 
 "My son," as calm she raised my head, "do 
 right, let come what may," 
 And from that day, though tempted still, "I go 
 the righteous way." 
 My Mother. 
 Up thro' the fleeting years to manhood, gently 
 as I grew, 
 Some joys were mine, 'tis true, but oh ! the 
 troubles that I knew ! 
 And, through it all, what better friend in all 
 the world I had 
 Than she whose spirit sweeps the sky, as 
 joined by angels glad? 
 True Mother. 
 "Dust to dust" — as the minister stood with 
 outstretched arm and hand ; 
 "Ashes to ashes" — on he read to that sad- 
 stricken'd band, 
 Who, mourning then, because Grim Death saw 
 fit to enter in 
 And steal away such "precious gem" — 'tis 
 heaven's gain, the end. 
 Sleep, Mother. 
 IS 
Sleep on. Yea, the blessed Saviour soon'll 
 come and gather in 
 All His children, patient, waiting, and their 
 sorrow He shall end. 
 Angel-heralds, swiftly flying, as they sing 
 "Hosannas !" 
 We will join them, shouting, and go up with 
 flying banners. 
 Meet Mother. 
 HI! YOU LITTLE DEVIL, HI! 
 Hi ! you little devil, hi ! 
 You think you are so mighty sly : 
 Seeking to slay 
 Whom you will or may ; 
 Binding your victims night and day ; 
 Hi ! you little devil, hi ! 
 Run! you little devil, run! 
 Away wi' that contemptible "fun"; 
 Sneaking around 
 Like a hungry hound; 
 Trying to fool ev'ry weakling found; 
 Run ! you little devil, run ! 
 i6 
Shoo! you little devil, shoo! 
 No time have I to fool with you ; 
 Folks you advise 
 Tell yarns and *'big" lies, 
 And then you look as if surpris'd ; 
 Shoo! you little devil, shoo! 
 Scat! you little devil, scat! 
 Sly are you as a sneaking cat ; 
 Some think you're grand, 
 Take you by th' hand. 
 Inviting to their whiskey-stand ; 
 Scat! you little devil, scat! 
 Ouch! you little devil, ouch! 
 Please take away that horrid grouch ; 
 It makes me sin, 
 Hate, envy, and — then 
 I cannot conscientiously grin ; 
 Ouch! you little devil, ouch! 
 Run ! you little de\'il, run ! 
 Before the setting of the sun : 
 1 must make haste 
 Now to mend my case. 
 Ere I have ceas'd to run this race ; 
 Run ! vou little de\il, run ! 
 17 
THOU QUEEN O' THE WESTERN SEA. 
 Out of the myst'ries of the past, 
 Out o' the depths of centuries blast, 
 Out of the hidden pages rare, 
 Out of a history so fair, 
 For all the world to see and know, 
 And feel the crafty hand afore: 
 Lift up thy head, and proudly wave 
 Your flag, "Thou Queen o' the Western Sea !" 
 The hundreds, yea, the thousands, more 
 v^'^lied'd they their blood ! Struck to the core 
 I^y discontent and tyranny ; 
 They battled on for Liberty. 
 The "Sons of Might," who fought their way. 
 Prayed they to God that all might stay 
 And see the "night of terror" flee 
 Away, "Thou Queen o' the Western Sea!" 
 Then one 'rose up from 'midst the fray, 
 Who led on from captivity : 
 "George Washington" — and may his name 
 On down the ages shine the same. 
 Tho' lowly as the start was made, 
 'Twas "Lincoln" who his country staid; 
 God grant that all our hearts may be ' 
 As theirs: "Thou Oueen o' the Western Sea!' 
Roll on, O Time! Roll on, roll on! 
 'Till all shall know the burden burned 
 Of them oppres'd by Fate's decree, 
 And join the coming jubilee. 
 Lift up thy head, thou bee and drone, 
 Let thriftiness by us enthrone; 
 The "Stars and Stripes" unfurl'd, we see — 
 Hooray! ''Thou Queen o' the Western Sea!" 
 Arise ! ye gallant men, arise ! 
 Measure up to your country's size ; 
 Your noble women, you should prize; 
 Help lift their burden to the skies. 
 Arise, I say; make good the day, 
 Nor ever thou forget to pray; 
 Let victory be purchased free 
 From stain, ''Thou Queen o' the Western Sea!" 
 Go from th' dread yesterday, O men! 
 Fear leave behind — the morrow'll mend; 
 Your country's strong in th' things that make 
 For "right and freedom." None can take 
 Our banner down and on it frown ; 
 Nor e'en the lustre from our crown. 
 Until our bodies, resting be 
 Neath clay, "Thou Queen o' the Western Sea!"

AFTAH DE BAT'LE. 
 Written from an incident during the Congress at Wash- 
 ington, D. C, January 14, 1914. 
 (W^ith apologies.)

THE PASSING OF "OLD AUNT MARIA.' 
 (Note. — The first line of each stanza is to be sung 
 as the chorus of "Nearer My Home," 6s, in Baptist 
 Hymnal No. 636; published by the American Baptist 
 Pub. Society^ Philadelphia, Pa.) 
 "Ah'm near'er mah horn', near'er mah horn' " — 
 Rang out upon the air, 
 As old Aunt Maria raised her voice, 
 With song, to God in prayer. 
 Her form bent'd o'er by age's firm hand ; 
 Her voice, tho' coarse, was sweet ; 
 While angels seem'd to hover o'er, 
 As though they came to greet. 
 "Ah'm near'er mah hom' taliday,'^ 
 She sang more fervently 
 Than ever, as she leaned upon 
 Her crooked cane that day ; 
 Her voice, it seem'd, grew weaker 
 And softer, as she raised 
 Her eyes toward heaven gently. 
 To God, in song and praise. 
 "Yas, near'er mah hom', 'n' heav'n tahday" — 
 Her eyes were fill'd with tears, 
 As she remembers "Calvary," 
 The Christ, and Cross He bears. 
 22 
With eyes fix'd upward, as she saw 
 Him sitting on His throne, 
 And all the angels flying up 
 The great "white way" that shone. 
 "Yas, near'er mah horn' 'n' heav'n tahday"- 
 As echoed, faintly grew 
 The voice of one whose feeble form 
 Was nearing its adieu. 
 The cane she drop'd upon the floor, 
 And shocked her old white head; 
 Her pulse was beating slowly — 
 Soon be number'd with th' dead. 
 "Then ebbah ahve been befoh," 
 Was whisper'd soft, as death 
 Was stealing her away from there; 
 And left them all bereft: 
 As, one by one, they gather'd 'round 
 And murmured — "She is gone !" 
 Yes, old Aunt Maria's task was done 
 On earth, that Sunday morn.

 WHERE IS GOD? 
 Whej-e is God? — the question ask'd : 
 Ev'rjwhere the sunlight basks ; 
 Ev'rjwhere the darkness goes, 
 As tie day its ending close. 
 Cast he eye towards the sky, 
 Wher\ the stars in silence fly ; 
 And tie Sun and Moon, of old, 
 'Cross me distant heaven roll. 
 'Mong he fishes of the deep, 
 Where, Vi boundless area, sweep; 
 In the sWll upon the shore — 
 God is tlere, forevermore ! 
 Look upt the forest grown 
 And the Ikflet and the corn ; 
 E'en the iot from whence they sprang, 
 On His id^ existing, hang. 
 25 
In the bowels of the earth, 
 Min'ral gems, find ye a dearth ; 
 In the secrets 'neath the plain, 
 Is the answer "God," again. 
 In the blooming- little flow^'r ; 
 In the honeysuckles' bow'r; 
 In the hidden'd tiny cells, 
 "God" alone, our Maker, dwells.

WHY IS WHISKEY SUCH A CURSE? 
 (Inspired by and written during the address of Dr. 
 C. W. Childs, member of the Board of Education, in a 
 temperance meeting at the First Baptist Church, West 
 Washington, D. C, February 1, 1914. Other addresses 
 weri made by Dr. C. H. Marshall, member of the Board 
 of Education; Mrs. Rosetta Lawson, and the pastor. 
 Rev. Dr. Edgar E. Ricks, who presided.) 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it taints the pure; 
 Wh}'- is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it harms you sure. 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it makes a "fool"; 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it does'nt "cool". 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it dulls the heart; 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it consumes the spark. 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because the man, it damns ; 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because the body, it jams. 
 33 
Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it makes you owe; 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it makes you poor. 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it ruins the home ; 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it makes you mourn. 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 ■ Because with brutish force it holds 
 The tot'ring form of young and old; 
 And squeezes on their vitals, bold 
 With vengeance, leaving bare the soul. 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it spoils the girl ; 
 Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because it dims thv. ''pearl". 
 Why is wdiiskey such a curse? 
 It plucks the "roses" from the cheek 
 And dims the lustre of the eye, 
 As tears of sorrow slowly streak 
 D6wn into the "cup" of bitter sighs. 
 34 
Why is whiskey such a curse? 
 Because in it death's lurking 
 Behind the screen of Fate unseen; 
 And of your life's blood sucking. 
 It fills the world with fearful gloom 
 And miseries' attendant woe; 
 While, in its train, the weak entomb 
 Within its dismal chasm low. 
 It makes your troubles mountain high 
 Pile up, as others, passing by. 
 Are happy; while to ''danger" fly 
 You drop — O, wretched soul ! and die.

PART II. 
 SONG-POEMS. 
 Set to Music by the Author. 
 SCRIPTS. 
 I'm longing for you dear, 
 When, too, we will be near, 
 By each other's side. 
 Thro' all eternity; 
 Yes, you, my love, shall be. 
 O'er life's tempestuous sea. 
 And the smilin^- moon and stars 
 Our guide shall be. 
 Good-bye, sweetheart good-bye, 
 Good-bye, sweetheart good-bye, 
 May angels ever guide thee. 
 Until we meet again ; 
 Good-bye, sweetheart good-bye. 
 Good-bye, sweetheart good-bye. 
 Remember in the parting. 
 My heart, it giveth pain, 
Under the green leaf tree, dear, 
 There's where I long to be, 
 Heart light as air. 
 Sky bright and clear, 
 Listen, sweetheart, you care? 
 If your love be as pure, dear, 
 I'll give my heart to you ; 
 Forever one, 
 By the calm setting Sun, 
 Under the green leaf tree. 
 SWEETHEART MINE. 
 Sweetheart mine. 
 Love divine. 
 Well I think on you ; 
 And my heart, 
 Weary worn, 
 Calling now for you; 
 Thro' the live-long day I am still 
 Thinking of the time when we will 
 Be as happyy as birds of the sky; 
 Oh, sweetheart; sweetheart mine! 
 38 
Sweetheart mine, 
 Love divine, 
 Roses then for you; 
 Your bright eyes. 
 Your bright smiles, 
 Draws me nearer you ; 
 Tho' all else I may then forget, 
 Call back, dear, the days when we mei; 
 Ne'er was heart so divine and so pure, 
 Oh, sweetheart : sweetheart mine ! 
 PRETTY MOON. 
 There's a story I would tell of love in June 
 time, 
 When the flowers sweet are blooming in the 
 dell, 
 And the birds are sweetly * singing in the 
 noontime — 
 The story, I remember it so well. 
 All the mem'ries of the past I recollect when 
 Evening shadows fall around, as long ago; 
 In my fancy I can picture all the scenes when 
 The pretty moon's ashining all aglow. 
CHORUS. 
 Pretty moon, shining soon, 
 Pretty Moon, you're a boon, 
 With your smiling face out in the sky; 
 Pretty moon, come and spoon, 
 Oh tell me why you sigh — pretty moon, honey 
 moon ; 
 ril be true, dear, to you 
 As the stars in the blue, 
 And my promise to you I'll obey ; 
 Pretty moon, come and spoon — don't hide your 
 smiling face, 
 Pretty moon, pretty moon. 
 In life's fickle pathway. 
 Lie both thorns and roses. 
 As we journey t'wards the unseen distant goal ; 
 And the rampant and the brave their little life 
 goes 
 Out o'er the steep of time unto the shoal ; 
 Well, may we imagine a picture of the shadow 
 Of a never-ending tide of transient dreams, 
 As when off the stage of action, great and small 
 go— 
 This life is but a picture on the screen. 
 CHORUS. 
IN THE CITY OF JASPER WALLS. 
 (Sacred.) 
 Sitting alone dreaming wearily, 
 After the close of an arduous day ; 
 There, by a candle which burns so low, 
 One by one the angels come and go. 
 Gazing in silence with breathless sigh, 
 Wond'ring shall any more here go by; 
 Leaving this mortal, down here below; 
 Burden'd and footsore — joys come no more, 
 Still in my dreams I can see the shore 
 Where the INIaster doth reign evermore. 
 CHORUS. 
 Heav'n is the home of the blest 
 Where all the saints are at rest; 
 Angels, so bright and so fair. 
 They are calling me o'er there : 
 Th' good book says th' streets are pav'd wi' 
 shining gold, 
 And rivers of crystal brightness flow ; 
 On a great white throne reigns the King 
 over all. 
 In the city of Jasper Walls. (Repeat.) 
 41 
2. 
 When in the glow of yon heav'nly light, 
 Comes then to me lo' a wond'rous sight; 
 Mansions made ready "by God's own hand 
 For His dear children in yonder land. 
 Seraphs and cherubs, hither they fly. 
 Mingling with millions from sky to sky; 
 And loud hosannas ring out above 
 From the redeem'd ones, wash'd in His blood; 
 Still in my dreams I can see the shore 
 Where the Master doth reign evermore. 
 CHORUS. 
 Tempo 1. 
 Hush ! I can hear the mighty happy throng 
 In a great and grand triumphant song; 
 The Master's face is beaming o'er with love, 
 As swiftly they fly thro' realms above; 
 No shadows to cover them there, 
 No tears their joy to mar; 
 One eternal day over there. 
 And th' pearly gates ajar. 
 CHORUS.

 THERE'LL COME A DARK CLOUD 
 SOMETIME. 
 I. 
 Life and its joys, 
 Uncover 'd joys. 
 Is but a shadow sublime; 
 Fleeting away. 
 Just for a day, 
 There'll come a dark cloud sometime. 
 Sorrows and tears. 
 Bitter fears ; 
 Longing to see the sunshine; 
 Onward we go. 
 Fraught with woe — 
 There'll come a dark cloud sometime. 
 44 
2. 
 Weary and worn, 
 Bleeding and torn, 
 Footsteps are slowing with time. 
 Go as we may, 
 Follow the way — 
 There'll come a dark cloud sometime. 
 Still we may hope, 
 As we groupe 
 Onward thro' dismal sunshine; 
 Cling to the task, 
 Tho' encompass'd — 
 There'll come a dark cloud sometime. 
 ******* 
 Life's not all joy — 
 There'll come a dark cloud sometime. 
 LONELY TONIGHT. 
 I. 
 Lonely, tonight, dear, 
 'Mid scenes galore; 
 Lonely, tonight, dear, 
 While the wind blow. 
 45 
2. 
 I cannot see, dear, 
 Your smiling face; 
 Still in my dreams, dear. 
 You're my solace. 
 3. 
 Some day I'll wander 
 Back to your arms ; 
 And then I'll ponder 
 Under your charms. 
 4- 
 Far, far away from 
 Your fond embrace; 
 Lonely tonight, ''hon", 
 Dream of your face.

 AFTER AWHILE. 
 I. 
 Why are the days so long and drear, 
 Why is my heart so pain'd? 
 It is because we parted, dear. 
 When you my love disdain'd. 
 47 
Flowers, they blossom and w'ther and die, 
 Then I recall those days gone by : 
 When you caress'd me, 
 And fondly kiss'd me. 
 And then you said ''good-bye." 
 CHORUS. 
 After awhile — when th' stars are gleaming, 
 After awhile — a broken heart; 
 You'll understand while we are parted, 
 After awhile, after awhile. 
 After awhile — when th' years are flying, 
 After awhile — when your hair's gray ; 
 'Tis then you'll know I loved you only, 
 After awhile. 
 2. 
 Twilight, it softly fades away. 
 So with my life each day : 
 Fill'd with its sorrow, but still I pray 
 For your return some day. 
 Once I was always bright and gay, 
 But now I'm pining fast away ; 
 Don't you remember. 
 In (that) cold December, 
 When you bade me ''good-bye"?

DEDICATION
To Dr. Albert Shaw, Jeanne Robert Foster and Josephine Turck Baker.
FOREWORD.
Mr. Johnson is a young colored poet of America; some of his verse is in formal cultivated English, some in the corrupted language of the American negro. The latter rings true; it expresses with singular intensity the joys an sorrows of a subject race.
— Literary World (London) April 2, 1914.
A slender book of verse, "A Little Dreaming" is the work of Mr. Fenton Johnson, a young Negro poet, born in Chicago in 1888 and educated at the University of Chicago and the Northwestern University. He has written short stories and dramas of Negro life and considerable lyric verse. "A Little Dreaming" gives promise of a true poetic gift, a natural, spontaneous lyricism with the same distinguishing racial qualities that characterise the work of Paul Lawrence Dunbar. Many of the lines are melodious with the primitive, plaintive reediness of the Negro "Spirituals" of slave days. The chant-like form is effectively used, as in his lament for Dunbar.
American Review of Reviews, January 1914.
PRELUDE.
'Tis twilight dim; the musing dreamer sits
Before his hearth, the sunset on his brow,
And thus he ponders ere the birth of dusk.
Some love the land where grew the laurel tree,
The home of Gods and stern faced warriors,
The altar Nature built and Art preserves;
And long to hear heroic note from Pan.
Such deem their love the freeborn English note,
And others love the freeborn English note,
The music of the songs the lusty sang
In Mermaid Tavern and the Old Boar's Head,
The gift of Shakespeare and the heritage
Of Tennyson, the child romance hath nursed.
And yet some say to me, "O Man of Dusk,
Give us thy songs in broken Afric tongue, —
The music of the peasant in the South —
The native strain alone is poetry.
Be thou as Burns or Dunbar was,
Be thou as Lowell in his adobe home;
The humble peasant is the truest bard."
'Tis not in classic mould or English flame,
Or lilting song from crudest peasant tongue
The soul that seeks the beauty of a truth
Can gaze upon the ever gleaming light
That flickers on the summit Poesy.
But 'tis in living and the wonder Life
We find the soul of Beauty is a God;
The vision is the thing, and not the word.
Then come with me where Life and Soul hath met;
And hear the mother-croon of far-away,
The dying note of Georgia lullaby.
A GEORGIA LULLABY.
1.
Sleep, my honey, dreaming time is here,
Fancy in her barge is drifting near,
In the slumb'ring pine the birdie sings
To the weary charge beneath her wings.
Sleep, my honey, sleep to-night, to-night.
2.
Lay your head upon my heaving breast;
From my soul I grant you peace and rest;
Never sandman come to wake my child
With a melody so strangely wild.
Sleep, my honey, sleep to-night, to-night
DE CABIN.

Now have you nevah seed jes' whar we stayed
W'en we war jes' erbout so very high?
'Twas what bluegrass am growin' 'side de do'
An' rabbits go a-la'kin' o' de hill,
'Twas in de cabin whar mah Mammy lived
An' Daddy, too, — de blessed man ob Gawd —
Jes' on de othah side de Cunnel's house
An' bac' de fiel' whar growed de cotton flowah.
Go talk erbout yo' mansions made o' brick,
Go holier 'bout yo' lawn dat's green an' wide,
You kain't mak' me fu'git mah ol', ol' home,
What Mammy wu'ked an' Mammy lived an' died.
'Twas jes' some bo'ds an' plastah, too,
All put tegethah in a so't o' way
Dat mak' you know d'aint no othah house
Jes' lak de cabin dat ol' Daddy built.
But sweat an' sass an' hungah was de price
We paid tuh git dat sheltuh on its feet.
Mah Daddy built it by de bright moonlight
W'en all his wu'k wid-in de fiel' was done,
An' weddah goblins he'ped him Ah kain't say,
But nevah had a da'ky such a home.
Erroun' de stoop mah Mammy trained huh vines,
An' in de ya'd dey growed de violet,
De honeysuckle an' de roses, too,
An' o' them towahed sweet magnolia tree.
De lily ob de valley lingahed neah,
An' nigh dem all pealed fo'th de mockin' bu'd.
(Go 'way! Ah wish mah soul dat Ah was daih.)
W'en ebenin' come, an' all de wu'k was done,
Mah Daddy stacked his hoe, an' et his meal
Wid me an' Sukey, Sam an' Viney, too,
An' Mammy puttin' fo'th huh cookin' good —
De sweetin' 'taters brown ez Dinah's cheeks,
De 'possum grinnin' in his gravy thick,
An' hoecake, hot an' sweet an' greasy, too,
An' Daddy say his blessin', "O, good Lawd,
Gib all de worl' jes' what You gib to us"
An' Mammy add, "A-men!" f'un out huh hea't.
An' w'en ouah stomachs bulged jes' lak de pigs
We sat o' played upon de cabin stoop;
Ol' Daddy picked his banjo: "Hum! — Ti! — Tum!"
An' sing, "Mah Susy, Susy, Susy Gal,
You's sweetuh dan de honey on de vine".
An' Mammy say, "You sho's a funny man,
Go 'long! You ain't a-talkin' 'bout dis chile".
An' fo' we laid upon ouah baids o' straw
Ol' Daddy'd git upon his knees an' pray,
"Good Lawd, keep all mah folks f'um ha'm an' hu't;
Mah wife, mah chillun, an' mah Mestah, too."
Mah Daddy nevah read no book but one,
Mah Mammy nevah knowed no book but one,
An' dat was allus on de cabin she'f.
De book dat Jesus wrote — de Book o' Books.
Mah Daddy sleeps beside de cabin do',
Mah Mammy lies beneaf de violets,
Po' Sukey, Sam an' Viney's gone away,
De banjo's crumblin' quick to ash an' dust,
An Ah is lonely, lonely in de worl'.
O folks dat see me sottin' on de stone,
Please drop me coin an' let me gwi' away
To what my cabin gleams beneaf de sun.
THE LONELY PIPER.
1.
Tell me, lonely piper by the stream,
With your pipe of wond'rous melody,
Why alone sit you and pipe all day
When the gold lies near, and gold is fame?
2.
I am piping for the love of song,
For the sunset and the rise of moon;
I am piping for the summer wind
That hath come afar to hear my strain.
3.
I am piping for a little child,
Sleeping on a couch beneath the earth.
Oh, I hope some day he hears my song,
And comes leaping forth to greet the dawn.
TWO SONGS.
I.
THE SONG OF THE PASSING.
1.
I am weary of this loving and this grieving,
Lay me down beneath the bending willows,
Strew upon me petals of the bleeding roses,
O my mourners.
2.
I am weary of this loving and this sighing,
Bring me sweet Aljulia ere I meet the boatman
By the shining waters of the mystic river,
O my mourners.
3.
Let me hear the breezes singing low of Heaven,
Let me feel the cool of earth upon my body,
Let me hear the laughter of the little children,
O my mourners.
II.
I am the dusk,
The dreamborn soul
Of yesterday;
I am the hope
Of true Love's birth, —
The Man in Chains.
2.
I am the star
Whose light descends
Beneath the sea;
I am the rose
Whose perfume lives
Beyond the years.
3.
I am thy rod,
I am thy staff,
O brothers pale;
For thee I live,
For thee I die,
O brothers mine.
REVERY.
1.
I was the starlight,
I was the moonlight,
I was the sunset,
Before the dawning
Of my life;
I was the river
Forever winding
To purple dreaming,
I was the glowing
Of youthful Springtime,
I was the singing
Of golden songbirds, —
I was love.
2.
I was the sunlight,
I was the twilight,
I was the humming
Of winged creatures
Ere my birth;
I was the blushing
Of lily maiden,
I was the vision
Of youthful striving,
I was the summer,
I was the autumn,
I was the All-time —
I was love.
DE OL' HOME.
1.
Ah's longin' fu' de ol' home far away,
Whar Mammy lies beside de glidin' crick;
Ah's longin' fu' de lan' o' summer day,
What lillies ob-de valley's mighty thick;
Ah's longin'fu' tuh feel de bayou bref
Sof'ly blowin' on dis cheek o' mine;
Ah's longin' fu' de honey dat ah lef',
Awaitin' me whar grows de ol' giant pine.
2.
De earf am weary, an' Ah's sick at hea't,
Ah wish dat ah could be away down home;
Ah's played up hyeah a rovin', lovin' paht,
Been eb'rywhere de face ob man is known,
But only whar in pickanniny day
Ah romped an' to' an' ate de sugahcane
Can Ah be happy all de res' de day —
Down at mah ol', ol' home in Mandy Lane!
THE CREED OF THE SLAVE.
1.
Ah lubs de worl'. — Kain't he'p it, dat's mah way.
Futh'mo' Ah lubs de night, Ah lubs de day,
Ah lubs de suff'rin' crittuhs dat Gawd made,
De li'l 'uns playin' 'near de locus' shade,
Ah lubs de shadduhs by de gret big road,
Ah lubs to tote wid me de hebby load
Thoo'all de live long night an' thoo' de day.
Ah lubs de worl'. — Kain't he'p it, dat's mah way.
2.
Go crack yo' whups, an' break dis flesh o' mine,
Ah ain't a-gwine tuh, leave dis love behin';
Ah wu'k an' bleed fu' dose dat hu't me mos',
But in de mawnin' w'en Ah am a ghos'
Ah pray de Lawd dat you kin come up daih
An' play wid me erpon de golden staih.
Ah lubs you all, po' suff'rin' clay; —
Ah lubs de worl'. — Kain't he'p it, dat's mah way.
KIN YOU TELL ME?
1.
Sukey Jane, you sho' is gittin' wise,
Gwine tuh school, an usin' bofe yo' eyes,
You know mo' dan Brudder Gabrul knows,
You kin tell de whyness ob de rose,
You kin figger out de gleamin' stahs,
An' go talkin' 'bout yo' flamin' Mahs.
But, mah honey, listen! — listen close!
Kin you tell me whaih de ol' moon goes
W'en de daytahm thoo' dee valley glows?
2.
Sukey Jane, you knows mos' evahthing,
Jes' why robin sings his bes' in Spring,
You kin tell de why ob day an' night,
An' jes' why de bu'ds dey mak' daih flight,
You kin read de books ob long ago,
But, mah honey, listen! — listen close!
Kin you tell me whaih dey keeps de rose
W'en de wintuh thoo' de valley blows?
THE LOST SUMMER.
(SONG)
1.
Where is summer, now the rose is dead?
Where is summer, now the birds have fled?
I have wandered at the dusk of day,
But have never found the flowers of May.
2.
Where is summer, now that I am old?
Where is summer, now my love is cold?
Years have dropt their frost upon my brow,
And the warmth of youth is fleeing now.
Dearest, you were summertime to me,
Youth and beauty 'neath a maple tree,
I have mourned for you when Night was young,
I have sighed for you where stars are hung,
But you left my heart in days gone by,
But you let my hope of true love die.
Lovely hour of bloom, I long for thee!
Dear, lost summertime, return to me!
HYMN.
1.
Great God of a million years,
Bulwark of our ancient fears,
Lead us on;
Sorrows come and sorrows go,
But Thy comfort nations know;
Princes, lords, and captains fall,
But the lowly hear thy call;
Lead us on.
2.
'Cross the tide the storms may blow,
Fires of evil brightly glow,
Lead us on;
When around us thrives the night
Burn anew, O Starry Light,
Let the moaning sea-winds die
Ere the angel Love pass by;
Lead us on.
3.
Nations marching to the Cross,
On their hearts the Sign emboss,
Lead us on;
By Thy hand the fallen rise
To the glory of the skies,
By Thy hand a thousand years
Thou shalt dry our earthly tears;
Lead us on.
THE SOUL OF BOSTON.
My cobblestones are red with England's blood,
My parks are monuments of other days,
My battle cry the cry that right is might,
Humanity my God and mother love.
I blush when Justice cowers in the dust,
When once again we lead to Calvary
The Nazarene enwrapt in scarlet cloak.
I am the sister of the man oppressed,
The sword 'that flashed at primal Eden's gate, —
"No man may enter save the pure in heart."
I sit at Plato's feet, and glean the gold
That drifts from such a rich eternal mind;
Good England's culture is my fading past,
Columbia the glory of my dreams.
O sisters mine, go sound your drums of gold,
Go build your monuments to Greed and Pelf,
For I would rather cherish martyrs' blood
Than all the wealth enshrined in Amsterdam,
And I would rather boast the motherhood
Of Attucks and of Shaw than rule the world.
O God of Winthrop, here I spread Thy couch,
For I have kept Thy faith despite the age.
SINGING HALLELUJIA.
(A NEGRO SPIRITUAL)
1.
I went down to Jordan,
Singing, "Hallelujia!",
I went down to Jordan
In the nighttime;
God of mine above me,
God of mine beneath me,
And the white robed angels
Singing, "Hallelujia!"
2.
I looked up to Heaven,
Singing, "Hallelujia",
I looked up to Heaven
In the nighttime;
God poured down His mercy,
Christ poured down His loving,
And the choir of angels
Sang me, "Hallelujia!"
3.
Threescore stood in Heaven,
Singing, "Hallelujia",
Threescore stood in Heaven
In the nighttime;
David with his captains,
Jesus with His fishers,
And the white robed angels
Singing, "Hallelujia!"
4.
Take me swift to Heaven,
Singing, "Hallelujia!"
Take me swift to Heaven
In the nighttime;
Seat me 'mid the lillies,
Crown me with the roses,
And let whiterobed angels
Sing me, "Hallelujia."
THE MAGIC MASTER.
I am the Magic Master,
The mighty twilight weaver;
Before my tent the vision
In youthful splendour dances,
From mountains tinged with jasper
Bring I the sunlight glowing,
From forest tinged with dusk light
Bring I the moonlight lantern.
My magic is my dreaming,
My dreaming is my loving;
I know the warm Sahara,
I know the cool Alaska,
I know the rose hued peri
Before my couch in Heaven;
I climb the golden stairways
Within my ears the singing
Of angels crowned with haloes,
Before my eyes the laurel
Ye give the wizard dying.
At Camelot with Merlin,
With Israfel in Heaven,
Among the dusky minstrels
In fields of waving cotton
Learned I the gift of magic;
And now that day is dying
I watch my star descending
-Into the deathless river,
For now I know that magic
Will live beyond the starlight.
TO MY FATHER.
1.
Good Father o' the Dusk, my love for thee
Is boundless as the soul's eternal sea;
Thou wrought for me when I was weak and young,
And guarded me from life's tempestuous wrong.
2.
Thou art the lamp that safely pilots me
Beyond the crags and shoals of life's rough sea;
I cannot falter when thou bidst me go
Where moonlit waters to the ocean flow.
3.
Let others boast of gold and mansions grand,
No father lives throughout this Western land
So good, so true, so brave of heart as thee,
My mariner across the starlit sea.
HOWDY DO.
1.
Oh, de runnin' crick he say to me,
"Howdy do' mah honey, howdy do;
An' de bu'ds dey sing f'um top de tree,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do."
Oh, de cunnin' rabbit grin an' say,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do,"
But de' possum hidin' 'fraid to say,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do."
2.
Oh, Miss Sally say to me las' night.
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do,"
An, Ah say to huh, mah eyes so bright,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do."
Oh, de win's a croonin' thoo de trees,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do,"
An' f'um hives de buzzin' ob de bees,
"Howdy do, mah-honey, howdy do."
3.
Oh, de owl's a hootin' all night long
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do,"
An' de mockin' bu'd he sings de song
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do."
F'um behin' de clouds de moon she say,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do,"
An' de Night she whispuh to de Day,
"Howdy do, mah honey, howdy do."
LULLABY.
1.
Bye lo, mah li'l lam',

Bye lo, mah li'l lam',

Wants tuh see brown baby
In de locus' tree.

All de worl' am sleepin',

Angels o'er you beamin',
Bringing you sweet dreamin',
In de locus' tree.
THE SOLDIERS OF THE DUSK.
I.
Black men holding up the earth,
Atlas burdened they descend
Deep into the vale of Hell;
And with valor long defend
Fairer brothers from the wounds
That the dogs of war inflict,
And with patriotic souls
Die in Europe's last conflict.
II.
Paris shall not fall so long
As there breathes a man of dusk,
London shall be saved an age
By the fighters of the dusk;
Zulu, robbed of land and home,
For the robber bares his heart,
Kaffir, giving Europe gems,
Europe pierces with a dart.
III.
They are pagan, men of blood,
They have not a golden rule,
Cannibals and fetish men
With their laws intensely cruel;
But the God of Calvary
Will in years unborn be just
To the men who died for men,
Victims of the war god's lust.
'LONG DE COOL O' NIGHT.
1.
'Long de cool o' night w'en day am daid,
An' de wu'k am done, mah pipe Ah smokes
On de cabin stoop wid Mandy nigh,
Laffin' fit tuh kill at all mah jokes;
Pickanninies tumblin' in de san',
Kickin' up daih heels wid ka'less joy,
Totin' back tub me de happy days
W'en lak dem Ah was a ba'hfoot boy.
2.
Let de 'skeeters hum 'way an' de owl
Go a-tootin' in de gread, big tree;
Let de moon go dippin' in de sky,
Whituh dan de spray f'um out de sea;
Ah is gwine tuh sit upon de stoop
Wid mah Mandy in de bright moonlight
Holdin' han's an' co'tin' huh ag'in,
Kase its lovin' tahm an' cool o' night.
THE DYING ROSE.
1.
The rose lay dying in the summer heat
And longed to save her life so fair and brief.
A dryad, bathing in the noonday sun,
Spied her and dropped a tear to show her grief.
The panting bloom drank deep the sweetening drop —
And lived an hour to deck a singer's wreath.
A FRAGMENT.
1.
One sunset when the skies were deepest red,
As if they blushed for all the human sins,
I saw her gather daffodils, and sighed,
For she was sweeter far than those poor flowers
And all the flowers that grace this universe,
And in my dream I saw a crown descend
From out the firmament and drop to earth.
It fell beside a brook whose gleaming drops
Shone like the diamonds in the sable night,
And I, the humblest in the realm of men,
Stooped low and placed it on her bonny head.
DE APRUL SONG.
1.
Lets go out a la'kin', jes' to-day,
Livin's tiahsome, 'doubt dey let you play;
Fishin's good, an' plenty bait's erroun',
Now dat springtime's sproutin' f'om de groun';
Possum want a bullet in his hide,
Rabbit say he wish you'd pierce his side;
Dis am jus' de time fu' man to shu'k,
W'en de Aprul sunshine spiles yo' wuk.
2.
Sweet magnoly bloomin' on de trees,
Apple blossom thick wid honey bees,
Lillies ob de valley noddin' way
Whisp'rin', "Dis am sho' a lubby day!"
Crissy green a sproutin' by de do',
Lilacs eb'rywhaih am' boun' to grow;
Dis am jes' de time fu' man to shu'k
W'en de Aprul goodness spiles yo' wu'k.
3.
Mockin' bu'd a-singin' on de hill,
Sunshine drappin' down into de rill,
Cotton sprout a peepin' f'om de earf,
Raccoons runnin' 'roun' chuck full o' mirf,
Co'npone cookin' on de cabin harf,
Pickanninnes playin' on de wharf;
Dis am jes' de time fu' man to shu'k
W'en de Aprul gladness spiles yo' wu'k.
SLAVE DEATH SONG.
1.
Oh, my chariot is swinging,
Jesus, bring it near,
Soft I hear the harp a-ringing,
Jesus, bring it near,
All my troubles are a-dying,
Low within the grave a-lying,
Angels o'er my bones a-bending,
Peace and rest to me descending;
Jesus, bring it near,
2.
Throne of God is shining brightly,
Jesus, bring it near,
Angels stepping round it sprightly,
Jesus, take me home.
Curved coach with jasper cover
Swinging for the dusky lover;
White robed choir is sweetly singing,
Glory music earthward bringing,
Jesus, take me home.
3.
Scythe of Heaven gently reaping,
Jesus, bring it near,
Love eternal o'er me creeping,
Jesus, bring it near;
Day within the West is dying,
O'er me summer breeze is sighing,
To my mother's breast returning,
For me long she has been yearning;
Jesus, take me home.
DE CALL.
1.
Ah's moughty lonely 'thout you' honey chile,
Be'n down to Bubbly's Crick, an' mo'ned awhile,
Walked thoo de fiel' ob co'n, an' drapped a teah;
An' tol' de jaybu'ds dat Ah wished you heah;
De rabbit run no mo', but look fo' you,
De owl he cry all night, "Tu-whoo! Tu-whoo!
Come bac', come bac', we wants you honey chile!"
2.

No mo' you pass de ol' plantation by,

No mo' de dawgs go huntin' o' de hill:
Come bac', come bac', we wants you honey chile!
3.

W'en mammy seed de lovelight in yo' eye;
De day it seem jes' lak a sack ob co'n,
De night's de lonlies' since Ah was bo'n;
Come bac', come bac', we wants you honey chile!
THE PASSING INDIAN.
1.
By the shore of lonely Long Ago,
By the waters of Forgetfulness,
Wrapped in woven blanket stained with blood
Stand I gazing at the dying tribes;
In my hand the ancient tomahawk,
In my eye a fire that never dies,
But soars high to Gitchie Manitou
As the eagle flies at eventide.
O thou race of squaws, be kind to me;
Let me smoke with thee the calumet,
Let me hunt the bison and the deer,
Let me breathe the air of libery
In the land the white man's blossom choked,
Ere the purple sunset calls me home.
2.
I am dying as the wounded deer,
I who once was master of these shores;
Might and brawn I held my majesty,
Infinite I deemed this strength of mine,
Morning star and sunset glow my God;
Passion ruled within this breast of mine,
And before me swept my better self.
Listen, O thou mighty race of squaws,
Ere the purple sunset calls me home;
Thou may pass away as I have passed —
Gitchie Manitou alone is Chief,
Sachem of the mighty Winds is He,
And He lives till dry the stream of Time.
Be not vain, but hear His gentle voice,
O my worthy brothers pale of face,
Ere the purple sunset calls thee home.
FIDDLAH IKE.
1.
Oh' Fiddlah Ike's a-playin' to de moon
Erbout his wife dat died away las' June.
He play de saddes' tune in all de worl'
"Oh, whaih's mah honey? Whaih's mah Pearl?"
An' down his cheek he drap a shiny teah,
Fu' Liza was his honey an' his deah.
2.
De hull plantation gathuh roun' his do',
An' w'en he play daih haids go drappin' low,
De houn' dawg quit his howlin' all de night,
De lonely moon put on huh brightes' light,
Fu' all de worl' would lak to heah de chune

An' come a-pushin' bac' good Mammy's vine,
"Its Fiddlah Ike!" he says, "Go play yo' bes',
Yo' Lizas up above in Glohry's dress,
She's lookin' down, and heahs yo' fiddle song,
A sobbin' way thoo out de ebenin' long."
4.
Dey say de angels come thoo sorrer's gate,
Dat music's sweetes' when you's lost yo' mate,
Dey say de golden th'one was nevah won
By livin' all de time beneaf de sun;
An' dat's de reason Ike kin move de worl'
A playin', "Whaih's mah honey? Whaih's mah Pearl?"
AT THE GRAVE OF MANDY.
1.
Mandy's sleepin' wid de angels now —
Mandy dat was sweetes' ob dem all —
An' we laid huh side de hic'ry tree
'Till de day she heah huh Mastah's call:
Ah kin feel huh ahms erroun' mah nec',

An' de teahs go tumblin' down mah cheeks,

While mah Mandy's in de Beulahlan'

NEGRO SPIRITUALS. *
JUBAL'S FREE.
1.
Sound the trumpet, honey,
Jubal's free,
Sound the ram horn, honey,
Jubal's free;
Devil goes a-quaking,
Mighty Hell is shaking,
All the stars are tumbling,
Heaven's thunder rumbling,
Jubal's free.
2.
Dance the Gospel, honey,
Jubal's free,
Set your feet a-swinging
Jubal's free;
Night has changed to morning,
In her breast the warning
Of the God of sorrow,
"They must go to-morrow",
Jubal's free.
3.
Ring the church bells, honey,
Jubal's free;
Set the chimes a-pealing,
Jubal's free;
God above is shouting,
Devil goes a-pouting,
Earth and sky is meeting,
Freedom is their greeting,
Jubal's free.
4.
Shake the hand, my brother.
Jubal's free,
Sing your loudest, brother,
Jubal's free;
Toss your head to Heaven,
Living's like the leaven,
Earth is rich with sunlight,
Night is rich with moonlight,
Jubal's free.
SONG OF THE WHIRLWIND.
1.
Oh, my God is in the whirlwind,
I am walking in the valley;
Lift me up, O Shining Father,
To the glory of the heavens,
I have seen a thousand troubles
On the journey men call living,
I have drunk a thousand goblets
From misfortune's bitter winepress,
But to Thee I cling forever,
God of Jacob, God of Rachel.
2.
Oh, my soul is in the whirlwind,
I am dying in the valley,
Oh, my soul is in the whirlwind
And my bones are in the valley;
At her spinning wheel is Mary
Spinning raiment of the lillies,
On her knees is Martha honey
Shining bright the golden pavement,
All the ninety nine is waiting
For my coming, for my coming.
MY GOD IN HEAVEN SAID TO ME.
1.
My God in Heaven said to me,
"Your mansion's ready in the sky,
Come home, my weary wanderer,
And eat with Me the bread of life,
For I have slain the fatted calf,
For I have filled the honey bowl
And thou shalt always dwell with me.
Come home, my weary wanderer,"
My God in Heaven said to me.
2.
And now I board the Gospel train,
For I am going home to-night
To meet my God on Jordan's coast.
My burdens to the wind I toss,
To-morrow freedom shall be mine; —
A golden crown with burning stars,
And harp of David in my hand
That I may chant the Gospel tunes.
3.
On God's plantation I shall dwell,
The overseer of happiness,
And dance with Israel the dance
Of holiness and righteousness,
A thousand years with God to dwell
Is like a holiday below;
And Oh, my heart was glad to hear
My God in Heaven say to me,
"Your mansion's ready in the sky."
THE HYPOCRITE DEVIL.
1.
The Devil is a mighty hypocrite,
He steals away your heart, he steals your soul,
He rides you straight to Hell with honey words,
Oh, yes! That Devil's mighty hypocrite.
2.
Last night he said to me, "My daughter, dance!
Go shuffle on the old barn floor your feet,
Nobody looking but the moon and stars.
Go shuffle on the old barn floor your feet."
3.
I looked me straight to East and straight to West,
And from my trunk I took my yellow dress,
That I might dance once more the sinner's dance
Before my bones grew old and cold and stiff.
4.
But ere I reached the barnyard gate I saw
My God of Jacob shining in the sky
"Go back, my daughter, to your pots and pans!
Dance not the sinner's dance lest ye should die."
5.
He dipped my soul in water pure with love,
And led me homeward by the magic star,
"Beware!" He said. "The Devil's conjure man;
A mighty conjure man and hypocrite."
6.
O children of the King, give heed to me
Go not with Beezlebub and all his ways,
Stay home and work your patch before you die,
The Devil's hypocrite and conjure man.
LOVE ME.
1.
Love me, love me evermore,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
Love me till the Judgment Day,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
When the angel sounds the call
Hold my hand and hold it long
I will guide thee o'er the tide
To the Throne of God Himself,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
2.
Love me, love me evermore,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
Love me through the ages long,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
Kiss my brow when life is cold
And a-down the stream I float,
Lift me from the ways of earth
To the warmth of God Himself,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
8.
Love me, love me evermore,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
Love me till the stream runs dry,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my hone!
Thrice a thousand times to die
Would be like a day with God
If that dying would bring thee
To my heart a single hour,
Oh, my honey! Oh, my honey!
THE PRODIGAL SON.
1.
Snow is on the earth,
Sunshine in the heaven,
Snow is on the earth
And my soul a-stumbling,
Night is calling soft,
"Bring me home the weary",
God commands the host,
"Kill the fatted heifer,
For my son is coming home."
2.
Peter holds the key,
David's voice is golden,
Simeon is praying;
In my chariot
I am drawing nigher
To the Mercy Seat
Of the shining Father
In the Land of Golden Hours.
3.
Rachel cooks the Lamb,
Mary weaves me raiment,
Moses writes my name,
Joshua is shouting,
All the host rejoice
For my late returning;
Jesus takes my hand,
Calling me his brother
From the Land of Golden pain.
4.
Dark my home on earth,
Bright the Glory cabin,
Dark my home on earth,
Bright the streets of Heaven,
Never whip nor lash,
Never bread and water,
Parted on the cruel block
Waits the sainted mother
For the coming of her son.
5.
Speed thy lissome oar,
Oh, my valiant boatman,
Speed o'er Jordan's stream,
To the Land of Shining Glory.
THE SONG OF BEULAHLAND.
1.
Oh, I know a river where your troubles flow,
Down by Beulahland;
There the children of the King shall meet their Lord,
Down by Beulahland;
Oh, I know the weapon that those children wield,
'Tis the Cross of Jesus pierced on Calvary,
And my weary soul is clinging to the beams
Down by Beulahland.
2.
Let me not go there by fiddle tune or harp,
Down by Beulahland,
Play no banjo on my journey to the King,
Down by Beulahland,
Let me fight my battles in the way I choose
I alone must win the crown of Righteousness,
Let me be a soldier with my armor on,
Down by Beulahland.

THE PHANTOM RABBIT.
1.
Look, my weary brother, ere you die;
Night is here, and phantom nigh;
Soul of rabbit with the magic breath,
Soul of Life and foe of living Death.
Ere we die, my brother, ere we die.
2.
Look, my weary sister, ere we die;
O'er the hills the phantom shadows lie;
Rabbit ghostly soothes your aching fears,
Rabbit ghostly dries your endless tears,
Ere we die, my sister, ere we die.
TO JEANNE ROBERT FOSTER.
Thy faith in me is comfort, friend unseen;
Tho' I am but a minstrel of the dusk,
Before my path thou strewest cloth of rose
That I may sing awhile my humble song.
S. COLERIDGE TAYLOR.
1.
Mute thy strings, O Israfel:
Quenched thy fire, and shrouded low
Men who marvelled at the spell
And the weird but dream borne glow
Of thy master song.
2.
Israfel, no singers rise
Who can lift thy laurel crown,
Thou alone to glory rise —
Star of England's fair renown
And the dusk man's hope.
3.
When the Master came thou heard
Music woven of the night,
And, as soars a fleet winged bird,
Thou in melody made flight
To the Throne of God.
4.
Will the meadows bloom again?
Will the lark in passion song
Lead us to his leafy den?
Will the day remain as long?
Israfel has gone.
5.
Live to sing as he has sung,
Live to know the heart of God,
Live to speak an angel tongue
And to kiss the moistened sod
O'er our Israfel.
ETHIOPIA.
O minstrel lyre of ancient Ethiop,
Whose flaming song awoke the Orient,
O long forgotten harp, whose mouldering strings
Hath once enthralled the hearts of warriors,
I pray thee let my burning fingers press
Thee once again that I may sing my song
Ere from my veins the warmth of life hath flown.
O minstrel lyre, no longer do the kings
On couch of leopard skins await thy hour;
The Gods are dead, our ancient glory dust,
Our altars broken, and our people gone, —
Gone whence men quaff the wine of melting pot.
O, Libya, for thee the Prophet longs,
O Egypt, born of Sphinx and shadow forms,
O Ethiop, the flame of desert sands,
Thy hour! Thy hour! Oh, when shall come thy hour?
I touch the ancient lyre, and burning sing
The song of Ethiopia the Queen,
The song of her who sits among the gates,
Her eye upon the dawn of liberty and hope.
I.
The groves of Libya with perfume droop,
The dancing maidens, born of dusk and dew,
Before the flame their wierdest chants have raised,
The moon that lives for love and love alone
From the vale within the sky beholds the earth;
On throne of cedar, ophyr, and of gold
The jewelled monarch sits, a man of dusk,
Too opulent of war and cruelty,
Too drunk with power, too weak for noble deeds,
His star the strength that lives in mighty arms,
That sweeps before it all the tribes of earth
He is the morning of the human race,
The first sweet cup of wine existence drinks,
And on the altar luxury he falls,
A broken goblet in the hands of Time.
(Of such has been the human chronicle,
The Caesars, Ptolemies, Alexanders fall,
Great Pompey is the dust of long ago,
And star swept Bonaparte hath met his doom.)
Behind a Northern Chariot the king
With chains of gold around his ebon neck
Must grace the triumph of his enemy,
His people must in slavery bend low, —
The moon of love hath died within the East.
A stranger walks within the grove enow;
But in the years to come that stranger falls
Before another. — So the will of God
Removes the nations, races, and the tribes,
Lest man should be the peer of God Himself.
II.
I hear the martial beat of long ago,
The clash of steel, the tread of Persian hordes.
O Ethiop, how desolate thy shores!
How deep into oblivion thy star!
Thy children's children shall forget thy name,
Forget thy altars, and thy sacred fires,
For from the parching sands of Araby,
Mohammed rides with death or Allah's law.
The wandering tribes of Abyssinia, —
From whence the Sheban queen her journey made, —
Alone survive the glory of the past,
But not the mandates of our ancient gods.
The haughty race that built the pyramids,
That chained the lion and the leopard cub,
With bleeding wounds are prostrate to the West;
In bondage to the priest of Christ and love
Exiled the men of dusk must dwell a day.
The pale and yellow haired from distant shores
Rob Ghana of her bronze and Congo land
Yields tortured slaves to grace a Christian age.
O, World Anew, from splendours barbaric,
From fields of cocoa and of drooping date,
From houses built of sunkist bamboo straw
Thou bringest fathers of a newer race,
Their wrists engyved, their souls in bitterness.
O Mighty Universal Diety,
Upon these exiles pour thy wond'rous love,
For sorrow shall be theirs and loneliness
Among a people who forget the name
Of star-crowned Ethiop and Nubia
III.
The chains that man hath forged the heavens break,
Divine is liberty the slaves achieve;
And Hayti smoulders with the flames of dusk,
Her saviour loving Toussaint, prince of men.
The years may glide beyond the tide of time,
The stars may dim with age, and life grow faint,
But all the sons of men shall not forget
The Western Nazarene who died with love
For those whose treachery caused his death.
O Toussaint, may thy grave be ever green
With wreaths from all oppressed throughout the world,
May fifty thousand drums reveille roll,
A tribute to thy precious memory.
With thee the renaissance of Ethiop
Achieved, like other fires, was quenched awhile;
The cruel splendour Christophe embraced,
The anarchy that followed Citadels
Was not of thee, or thine, great Star of Dusk.
Thy message came to old Virginia's woods,
"Ah! Freemen shall we be", gaunt Turner cries
And with the courage of the patriot
He fought a day to give our land the glow
Of liberty, fraternity, and love.
He fought a day, and died a traitor's death,
But bright his halo, green his laurel crown.
Each blow for freedom struck is freedom's gain,
And Ethiop shall yet stretch forth her hand.
IV.
When Night surrounds the slave, and hope lies cold,
The daytime breaks and Frederic is borne
On Fortune's tide to plead the cause of right.
Men marvel that a lowly son of dusk
Could move to tears the hardened soul of greed,
And crown his massive brow with laurel wreath.
His heart rejoiced when war destroyed the chains
That kept to earth his brothers of the dusk,
And when the sun of Freedom shone awhile
He marched abreast with Toil to save his race
Ah! hear the bells a-ringing through the world,
"The slave is free! Grim bondage dies to-night!"
O blessed war, that saved humanity,
That gave the men of dusk the freemen's right,
How many sons of Ethiop were thine!
How many fell with Shaw ere peace returned!
Their graves unknown, who strews for them sweet flowers?
Who keeps their memory with incense fresh?
How many when young Cuba, lashed by Spain,
A greater country saved, were lost at war!
No truer soldiers live than men of dusk,
No better lovers of the starry flag.
No hope is theirs but welfare of the world,
No honours for the fighters of the dusk,
Are these rewards, O great America?
Obscurity, oppression, bitter scorn,
The right to serve, but never right to share.
Give us our liberty or give us death!
V.
And now that Freedom's orb so brightly burns
From crimson clay in old Virginia soil
Sweet Nature moulds another Washington;
Upon his brow she sets a flaming star,
Upon his lips the fire that never dies,
And smiles when men before his gospel bow, —
"The hand of toil alone will rule the world."
O Washington, may day upon us break!
May great America at last be free,
And true democracy where work is law
A common gift to all humanity.
Tuskegee's glory through the ages lives
The light that makes Columbia a queen
Among the toiling nations of the earth,
Tuskegee stands a stone in Jaeob's dream,
A ladder leading to the Gates of Pearl, —
Washington alone hath laid the stone.
VI.
There sits aloft among the jaspar gates
Far famed the brooding spirit of his race,
A gentle soul by grim injustice wracked
He looks in vain for hope, though he is hope.
O Ethiopia, in him thy King,
Thy weaver of the vision glorious,
Thy lover begging for thy liberty.
When Nature moulded him she chose a clay
So fine it could not bear a cruel storm;
But shaped his ponderous brow for laurel wreath.
In ages yet unborn the child of dusk
In reverence shall bow to Burghardt's name,
And all the world shall love a patriot.
VII.
O sons of Libya, thy name will live
The bearers of the Cross on Calvary;
Around thee wrapt the mantle of the dusk,
In thee the world will find another dawn,
Around thee shall the hour of twilight glow,
When day upon thee breaks a golden throne
Awaits thee in the land of rising sun,
Thy faith, thy deeds, thy love for fellow men
Shall be thy sceptre and thy coronet,
Before thee shall the vaunting nations bow
In reverence to crowned humility.
And thus I sing the song of Ethiop
Though I am dwelling in a stranger's land,
A lonely minstrel, born to serve and love
Throughout the world his fellows of the dusk.
DE CHU'CH.
'Way down de lane, behin' a row o' trees,
Whaih all de summah croons de softes' breeze

LYRICS OF LOVE.
LYRIC ONE.
I.
When in Slumberland the dreams go forth
To my heart a darling maiden comes,
Stardust are her eyes, her lips love flame,
And an angel tune she softly hums.
II.
Never 'neath the dwelling place of God,
Never by the lake or by the sea,
Was a man so blest as I am blest
With the love that Clara gives to me.
III.
Oh, my heart will burn for ages long
From a fever that will never die,
For in Slumber land an elfin rogue
Poured his magic lotion on my eye.
LYRIC TWO.
I.
This is the hour, my love, the hour of tryst;
The earth is sleeping in the cool of dusk,
The lily-of-the valley nods and sways,
The air is drooping with the perfumed musk.
II.
Ah! open wide, my love, thy garden' gate;
Eftsoons the ancient moon will ply her barge,
For thee I bring sweet Cupid's rosary,
To thee a book of kisses do I charge.
III.
When Eden's glory thrived, fair Eve was won
At such an hour as this, our trysting hour,
And burning Romeo, when Night was Queen,
Enthralled young Juliet within her bower.
IV.
Then blest be every hour that Love holds sway,
And sweet the roses of the eventide.
Then blest the crucial moment of this life,
When down the stream of passion sweethearts glide.
LYRIC THREE.
I.
Sweet pigeon carrier upon my roof,
Oh, tell me, tell me how my lover fares!
Last night to war he marched, his breast aglow,
Within his heart his troubled country's cares.
II.
"O lovely maiden, many tears shall fall
Ere to thy bosom shall thy lover fly;
Beneath the Belgian moon, in bloody death,
With thousands does your ardent lover lie."
III.
Oh, woe is me! The moon and stars have died,
No more for me the dance on village green;
My couch is spread upon the meadowland,
Six feet of darkness 'neath the churchyard green.
LYRIC FOUR.
I.
Returned am I, my trusted sweetheart dead;
Upon her lonely grave Golgotha's Cross,
Upon the stone the dreaded legend "Gone!"
Upon the mound a spray of hawthorn moss.
II.
She went when Springtime kissed the sleeping earth,
Too soon to fall the prey of brooding grief.
For one who shall be lonely through the years,
She gave the God of Death a life too brief.
III.
I care not now what woes may fall on me,
The sorrow infinite is ever mine.
Beside the river Lethe I shall muse,
But never taste the sweetness of the wine.
WHEN APRIL COMES.
1.
When April comes as April will
No more in eagerness my soul
Shall cringe and ask that thou shalt hear
My humble songs, my melody;
No more shall I go panting forth,
Close 'pon me wild hounds hot o' breath.
For in the April time my hour
Shall dawn, the hour of tranquil dusk;
And when the earth is all anew,
Revived by hope the springtime grants,
I know that I shall drift away,
Where poets have their holiday.
2.
Oh, heavy is this life of mine,
And I, a broken reed 'mongst men.
I lived a plaintive melody,
Unsung, unloved, unknown, unwept.
I loved as every youth will love,
But she on whom I poured my love
Was not for me, — I know not why,
I dreamed as every youth should dream,
But all my dreams to air have changed,
And now that I am going forth
To break my wand I breathe a prayer
That those, my brothers of the dusk,
Shall not forget that I have lived
But in the tide of love shall drop
Upon my lonely grave a rose,
For one who lived his life for them.
THE CLINGING KISS.
I.
The earth awhirl,
Sweetheart, I wander far
Adown the crowded street,
Upon my burning lips
The clinging kiss.
II.
A thousand years
May sear this life of mine,
But in my memory
I hold one treasure dear,
The clinging kiss.
III.
A thousand caravans
May bear a wealth untold,
The stones of India
Will pale beside my gem,
The clinging kiss.
IV.
O wondrous love,
That burns to ash my heart,
Give back to me that hour
She placed upon my lips
The clinging kiss.
EULOGY ON THE FAIRIES.
Oh, where are the fairies now?
Poverty, poverty,
Hast thou robbed the merry elves
Of their right to live and breathe?
Barren is the Southland now,
There the dusk men writhe in pain;
Barren is old Amsterdam,
There each year we offer babes
On the shrine of Gold and Greed;
Barren is Killarney's green,
Erin's fairies pine away
For the light of liberty;
From his cave hoar Merlin cries,
"Self! Self! Self! hath killed the elves,
Self, the basest of the God;
Nevermore, nevermore,
Shall the airy creatures rove
With their magic caps and bells,
Spreading wonder everywhere;
Fairy night hath turned to day
Moonlight fades, the stars are dead,
Naught can bring the fairies back,
Naught save Love, the long lost Love,
Bring him from his secret lodge,
Crown his brows, and let him reign,
Seat him on the Throne of Years
To the strain of minstrel lyre.
For the fairies must return
Ere the twilight of the earth."
Where are the fairies now?
Titania and Oberon,
And Puck, who changed the night to day
And slept beneath the rose hued sun?
MEMORIES.
1.
When at evening in the vale I walk,
Wrapt in memories of dear Lucille;
When among the violets I lie,
All my hours of love before me steal.
2.
Earth and heaven was this maid to me,
And her voice the song of lark and wren;
Now that she hath left my heart I know
Through the love of women God makes men.
3.
If in distant countries I should dwell
With a people strange and proudly cold,
I would always see my long lost love
In the heart of dying marigold.
WHEN MY BONNIE DANCES.
1.
When my Bonnie dances earth is mine,
And a thousand kingdoms I can see;
I am thrilled with joy and love and hope,
And my sweetheart's goodness comes to me.
In her eye the vision Hellas knew,
In her step the dream o' wanton Rome;
And in garb o' white she mocks a queen,
As she finds within my heart a home.
2.
When my Bonnie dances fields are green,
Blood stained roses bloom, and asphodel;
And Beloved walks awhile with me,
Where I wooed her in a lonely dell.
Rivers feel the warmth o' sunlit gaze,
Sweet canary sings within the grove,
And I nod as music sways my nymph
Where the sprites of Nature lightly rove.
3.
When my Bonnie dances, music's stream,
Silv'ry white as glows the old moon's breast,
Flows into the liquid veins of Youth,
Warmer than a maiden's fond caress;
And the spheres of Heaven, all attuned,
To the rhytlimic measure sets the world,
While the flowers that sleep on eve of snow
From their beds their petals gay unfurl.
4.
Oh, my Bonnie, thou hast won a crown,
Love and worship from tile world of youth,
And through dancing graceful thou hast carved
On our hearts the magic legend TRUTH;
Long may Bonnie live and drink the sweets
Men call living, God above call life,
Long may Bonnie live and never know
Woe and sorrow, bitterness and strife.
MARY ON AUGUST THE FIRST.
1.
I heard the voice of Mary in the cool of evening:
"Oh why the devastation of the golden wheatlands?
Oh why the burning of the villages and homelands?
My shrines are broken, and my statue changed to bullets,
My lowly Son is once again a God rejected,
And all my children walk the way of life in darkness."
2.
I bowed to earth my head, and thus I answered Mary:
"That we might gather in the vineyard empty glory,
That we might wear a ribbon and a wreath of laurel,
We hurl to Hell a million souls and go our way,
The laughing demons of an age whose God is sleeping,
Forgetful of the women and the little children,
And thrice forgetful of the chariot of progress."
DOUGLASS.
He came when tyranny was ripe, a torch
That lit the darkened avenue of hope,
He came from cabin, ragged, poor, and starved,
And walked among the honoured of the earth.
His cry the cry of Moses to the King,
"Oh, let my people go, thou freeborn host,
For God hath heard their cry; they must be free."
He walked not shrouded, but with manhood stride,
The morning of a people long oppressed,
He stood within the palace of the King
And cried, "Give them their rights; they must be free.
These lowly folks, — my brothers, ay, thine, too
Let not a democratic people cringe
To selfish idols, childish prejudice
Let not the future ages note this land
That broke the chains Hanover's puppet forged
Enslaves and keeps enslaved a helpless race,
Whose hand has never struck the stars and stripes."
Ah! there was Phillips; there was Sumner, too,
With Lowell, Garrison, and Whittier,
And Brown, whose noble life Virginia took,
And Stowe, whose pen awoke the slumbering North;
But none of Afric line as bold as he,
As fiery and inveterate of speech,
As monumental of the intellect
A man of dusk may have, tho' born in chains —
A worthy peer for such a company.
When chaos ruled, and freedmen knew not where
The star of fortune would abide with them
This Douglas, dauntless as the wind of March,
As shepherd guides his sheep o'er stony crags
He guided long his race, all bruised and torn,
And faltering because the night was dark;
Until he heard the still small voice of Death
And drifted down the endless stream of Time.
O Douglas, thou hast left a heritage
To those whose brows are pierced by thorned crowns
And from thy couch in green Elysium
Where thou and Sumner and the laurelled Grant,
And Ingersoll and Lincoln watch the tide,
Thy voice comes down to us, thy bleeding sheep.
And these thy words, O Prophet of the Dusk!
"Go on, my Race, the sun will rise again,
The Night will fade as darkness ever fades.
No race can always bend beneath the yoke,
For 'tis a truth the wrath of those oppressed
Will break the reins, and drink of liberty.
Be valiant, true, and know not cowardice
And live so that both friend and foe may say,
"Oh they were great in adversity
But greater in the hour of jubilee!"
Thus speaks our Douglas from his grave, and we
Should heed his mighty voice, lest we should fail.
OL' AGE.
1.
Mandy, we is growin' ol' an' gray,
F'om us life is ebbin' eb'ry day;
We is nigh de time when angels call

THE WRAITHIE'S MESSAGE.
1.
Last night before my window came
A wraithie bathed in living flame,
"I am a herald of the night,
I am a lonely, lonely wight.
2.
"Beside the sea a maiden dwells,
Her voice the sound of lighthouse bells,
Her eyes the green of starlit sea,
Her soul a dwelling place for thee.
3.
"Good dreamer, I have touched her heart,
With burning song I touched her heart
And now her dreams are all of thee —
This maiden by the deathless sea."
4.
Oh, lead me hence, good elf of night,
Oh, lead to her signal light;
For I am weary of my dreams,
Long weary of my feverish dreams.
WASHIN' DAY.
1.
Weddah beats de dickens,
Heat wid sweat am mixin';
Pappy wants some bac'n,
But he's sh' mistaken
On dis washin' day.
2.
Baby in de grasses,
Mouf all smeared wid 'lasses.
Ain't he mostes' cunnin'?
Look-a-daih he's runnin'!
Knows no washin' day.
3.
Who am dat a-hidin'?
Boy, you quit yo' slidin'.
Heah, you lazy sinnah,
Come an' tuhn dat wringah,
Dis am washin' day.
4.
Lawd! dese suds am splashin',
Makin' noise dat's crashin';
Put dose clo's tuh soakin',
Asmy's got me chokin'
On dis washin' day.
5.
No, Ah ain't a shu'kin',
Jes' tuh keep f'um wu'kin';
It's de robin's singin',
Sweetes' freedom bringin'
F'um dis washin' day.
AT THE SHRINE OF MARY.
1.
"Mary Mother, we are twining flowers,
Flowers gleaned from the meadows, pure with love,
That thy golden head may wear a crown
Whiter than the bosom of a dove",
Children mine, entwine no flowers for me;
In the Kingdom gleams a thousand flowers,
Richer than the fairest blooms of earth,
Purer than a maiden's sacred hours.
2.
Give instead the treasures of thy heart,
Give instead a garland of thy deeds,
Shower thy mercies on the lowly folk,
Who must ever dwell among the weeds;
London beggars cry, and Ireland starves,
Naked Hindustan is pinched for food,
Give them, my children, give to them;
God conceived them, they are Mary's brood.
3.
Give the poor oppressed the burning lamp
Liberty hath held for ages long,
Give my sisters weapon for their wrongs
That the latter days may glow with song;
Let the bleeding sons of Ethiop,
Let my kinsmen, seed of Israel,
Hear no more the word of hate and scorn,
Feel no more the fire of living Hell.
4.
"Mary Mother, we are twining flowers,
Flowers gleaned from the meadows pure with love,
That thy golden head may wear a crown
Whiter than the bosom of a dove;
Love the petal, Love the calyx too,
Love of man and love of womankind,
Betterment for all who walk in pain —
Those are flowers our hearts have long enshrined."
A PILGRIM OF THE DUSK.
1.
Out of the dusk came I,
A strong man I, song sheafed,
My star humanity,
My brow with sorrow leafed;
I saw the Giant of Love
Upon the Northern Pole,
"I know thee not", he cried,
"I know no flame bound soul."
2.
Oh, lonely is my road,
No merry pilgrim here.
The darkness is my shroud,
My drink a bitter tear;
Tho' Love hath passed me by
I see the After-Glow,
And when my day is done
The Angels I shall know.
DEATH.
When from Eden's land we stray
In the morningtime of life
God in pity kisses us
And around us sheds His love — — —
Men have named this wonder Death.
WARNING.
Keep yo' eyes ez tight ez tight kin be,

DECLARATION.
1.
I love the world and all therein:
The painting, darkened souls who seek
A brighter light, a sweeter hope,
Page  69
From those who drink the bubbling wine
And eat the flesh of tender fowl;
I love the pampered son af wealth,
And pour on him my pity's oil,
This world our God hath made for all, —
The East, the West, the black, the white,
The rich, the poor, the wise, the dumb, —
And even beasts may share the fruit;
No prison wall, but sunlight's glow,
No rods of steel, but arms of love,
For all that creep and walk and strive
And wear upon their countenance
Creation's mark, the kiss of God.
TURN DOWN THE LAMP.
Turn down the lamp; my life is done.
The fitful moments drift to ease —
Rosemary for the dreams that died,
And mignonette for cherished hopes.
Turn down the lamp; my soul gains life;
I rise above the narrow pale
Of cities bought with gold and slime,
I spread my sorrow strengthened wings
Above the armies of the world,
In quest of kingdoms built in youth.
The hour of death that men call life
Is closing as a troubled dream,
The flame within my lamp is low,
I seek eternal liberty,
The freedom of the endless sky.
Good nurse, enfold my arms,
And cool the fever of my brow,
My hour has come, turn down the lamp.
COMIN' HOME.
1.
Oh, Ah hyeahs de ol' tahm bells a-ringin',
Comin' home! Comin' home!
Sweetuh dan de angel hahp de singin',
Comin' home! Comin' home!
Bu'dens dat Ah's toted fifty yeahs
Ah has laid away wid foolish teahs,
To de skies Ah raise mah weary eyes
An' to Dinah honey long AIi cries
Comin' home! Comin' home!
2.
Oh, Ah hyeahs de ol' tahm folk a-callin'
Comin' home! Comin' home!
Cross de Jawdon shadders gently fallin'
Comin' home! Comin' home!
Down de stream dey float de ol' flat boat,
Songs ob sorrer eomin' f'om daih th'oat,
Dey is gwine to tote mah soul away
Whaih de moonlight tu'ns de night to day,
Comin' home! Comin' home!
L'ENVOI.
The dreamer nods, and honeyed sleep
His eyelids woo; his day is done.
No more the vision burns his soul,
But lives within his memory.
Her shadow mantle Evening drops;
The bee is drowsy on the vine;
From heart of rose the pollen drips,
And dripping blinds the fairy's eye.
Across the surging tide of Night
Comes reasonant the voice of God
"Oh Love! — True love is best of all;
It lives... it lives beyond the years."

Poems
By
ADOLPHUS JOHNSON
PRICE, ONE DOLLAR
PHILADELPHIA, PA.
[1915]
With the hope of doing something toward elevating myself this little book has been written, and is now given to the public.
As the Goddess of Music takes down her lute, touches its silver chords, and sets the summer melodies of nature to words, so an inspiration comes to me in my profoundest slumbers and gently awakens my highest faculties to the finest thought and serenest contemplation herein expressed. Always remember that a book is your best friend when it compels you to think, disenthralls your reason, enkindles your hopes, vivifies your imagination, and makes easier allthe burdens of your daily life. 
Should this publication be instrumental in drawing the attention of the masses, hitherto uninterested, I will then think I have accomplished my purpose.
From carved Emolian wood and silver strings,
The Goddess played her lute to titled Kings;
The hidden grass peeped up from the ground,
And the buds opened as the sweet sound
Arose from barren hills and wooded dells,
And then enveloped flowers of sweetest perfume.

POEMS
GRANNY COOKIN' POSSUM
What dat steamin' in de kitchin?
Ebery 'ting dun up so brown,
Granny's fixin' fer camp-meetin',
Oh! Pa'son Johnson comin' 'roun'.
Co'n braid dat's so nice and yaller,
Sweet pertaters good and brown,
An' dat possum, it am cookin',
Fragrance flyin' all a-roun'.
Molasses braid, Injun red,
Mek yer scratch yer kinky haid,
Possum's greasy, an' so good,
Ain't dat fine camp-meetin' food?
Makes me mad to tink ob Granny,
'Vitin' Pa'son Johnson roun',
To sing and pray, an' fill his stomach,
Den goes straight on back ter town.
Lawdy! It's sho mighty vexin',
How sum ob dese ole folks do,
Gibs de comp❜ny all de good tings,
An' dey lebes you mighty few.
Granny, whar's all dem good tings?
Pa'son gone an' eat 'em all!
Clothes a fittin' kinder tight,
Bet he's a feelin' out a sight.
Granny's feelin' mighty vexious,
'Vitin' all dem big folks 'roun',
Mose, go hitch up ole mule Betsy,
An' take de Pa'son in ter town.
THE SEVENTH HOUR
Now I lay me down to sleep,
So kind friends, pray, do not weep,
Free from all perplexity and pain,
I shall not awake in this world again.
My dreams shall evermore be sweet
Until that time when we shall meet.
As I lay me down to sleep,
My loved ones no more to greet,
My form lay silent midst the throng,
Before its flight they waft a song,
Angels have caught the gladsome chorus,
And singing sweet "Hosanna" o'er us.
Although my soul with sin was stained,
Back in the fold I was retained;
And now lay me down to sleep
God's love, I am prepared to reap.
My life has been just like a race,
A course! A finish! To see His face.
Now I have won; Life's work is done,
The end is at the setting sun.
As I pass through Jordan's stream
I see but one Eternal dream.
The Life I seek is always sweet
As now I lay me down to sleep.
God always brightens the darkest way,
From earth to glory, day by day.
He had said, "have thou no fear,
I'll preserve you, am always near.
Though at times my steps would falter,
I find peace at my Father's altar.
Now life has closed it's earthly door,
To earth, I shall return no more;
While Heaven's gates are open wide,
God bids me enter, and there abide.
To tread those streets rich paved with gold,
Forever in my Shepherd's fold.
UPON SUCH A DAY
Upon such a day how things have changed,
Such dreadful fear that fall on Kings,
And how this old world brought him pearls,
Upon such a day.
At idle times I drink my wine,
Engaged in thinking who shall bind
The devils with greed like swine,
Upon such a day.
During numerous wars nations are slain,
Innocent men killed and also chained,
These signs shall not pass around again
Upon such a day.
You buy my body for old trash,
I am then your slave, my flesh you lash,
And then you sell me for little pay
Upon such a day.
Many war ships are launched at sea,
While soldiers are fighting in fire and mud,
It all seems like hell to me
Upon such a day.
Our courts are partial and unjust,
They free rich and guilty men,
But justice must triumph in the end
Upon such a day.
Cursed be the man that's born,
Who tries to do his neighbor wrong,
The flesh from his bones shall be torn
Upon such a day.
But soon all things shall be known,
As the world is almost over-grown,
Secret sins cannot then prevail
Upon such a day.
A DREAM IN THE OLD HAUNTED MANSION
Silently, dreamily, sinks the dusk,
From the arc of the infinite blue;
Soft shadows creep o'er mountain steep,
Sombre like and dark to view.
Then scenes and sights of ages come,
Haunting my dreams as the storm rages on,
I see queer shapes and frightful forms,
Hear cries and moans from souls that are gone.
In the old mansion with its hingeless doors,
The noisy spirits walk the floors,
At night I see them as they pass by
The ancient walls that loom so high;
I have heard the shouts of men who cried
Behind her walls of massive blocks,
Which are crumbling from storms and shocks,
The fallen steps and broken floor
The mansion's haunted, that I'm sure.
At times there's a burning light,
Which illuminates her halls so bright,
Although there is no one in sight,
The spirits are busy all the night.
They rattle windows and squeaky doors,
And why they do so no one knows,
The mansion's haunted that I'm sure.
Silent, remorseless, descends the dark,
O'er a slumbrous, indifferent world;
And black is the sky as the rooks fly by,
With ghostly glossy wings unfurled.
I would like to peep in some night and see
Those ghostly forms and horrid sights,
And watch the rattling windows and squeaky doors,
The mansion's haunted that I'm sure.
WILL YOU BE READY WHEN DE TRUMPET SOUN'S?
Dey's a day dats mighty vexin',
Sorter comin' on de way,
An' it's gwine to catch somebody,
Jes' as sure as judgment day.
Fer dem dats got no 'ligion,
Dem dat nebber will hear 'rite,
'Bout de blowin' ob de trumpet.
Dey is gwine ter have a fright,
Sum' folks dey am always watchin',
An' sum' of dem doan watch at all,
But den when you tell 'em 'bout it,
Dey tries tu makes you look so small.
But ez sho's der es a Hebin.'
Dat ah trumpet is gwine ter soun';
An' de sinners will be runnin',
An' a fallin' on de groun'.
Dose folks dat's a always idlin',
An' fixin' up dat same ole tale
'Bout de whale a swallowin' Jonah,
Or ol' Jonah swallowin' de whale.
Dem tings don't 'fect my 'ligion
W'en de word am brought aroun'.
I'se a gwine ter be ready
Befo' ol' Gabriel trumpet soun's.
You may talk about yer preachin',
An' a prayin' loud an' low,
When ol' Gab'el soun's dat trumpet,
You hab sholy got ter go:
be a sorter vexin', It may
Den de time seems ter be long,
But folks dey must all git ready,
Tho' dey aint dun' eny 'rong,
An' dey join de mighty chorus
Dat's to staht dem Hebin' boun'.
Is yer soul gwine ter be ready
W'en you heah de trumpet soun'?
THE REAPER, WAR AND WOE
Thou hearest the drums beat,
Thou hearest my bugle blow,
Thou hearest my widows weep,
Thou seeth war and woe.
Thou seeth fields filled with dead,
Thou heareth the voice of dread,
Thou seeth woe everywhere we look,
Thou seeth a mighty foe in every nook.
Thou hearest the of beast and man, tramp
Thou seeth the wolf at thy very door,
That causeth thy family to cry for bread,
That starveth the many, many are dead.
In time of peace, for strife prepare
To defend his country in war, beware!!!
Nations discuss and think it wise
To adore the warriors who win the prize.
Anthems are sung, "Long live the King."
Priest and prophets pray: church bells ring:
Yet through it all civilization reigns?
Such destruction; it's a horror and shame.
The house that's sad and lonely,
There sleep the silent only,
There's a visitor at our gate,
A horror of war, death's playmate.
Yet some daring fool will flirt,
And turn away with joy, unhurt,
And yet upon him who is very wise
Death falls, it is hard to realize.
There, unexpected he hangs his fate,
When death calls, it is then too late,
Oh! soldiers that march, Oh! maidens that smile,
Your comrades unseen keep step with the file.
A PILGRIM SOLDIER
Who is he that cometh
From the gloomy wilderness,
A pilgrim soldier burdened
With care and much distress?
He is on a journey
From a foreign land,
Seeking ease and blessing
From the mighty hand.
Once he sat in darkness,
Now the light has come,
He hath heard the echoes
Of peace, and rest, and home.
His burden has been lifted,
His hopes have been renewed,
His soul, it has been gifted,
And man's reward is due.
We want men who will follow
Across desert land, and sea,
To help carry the message
To those who are not free.
THE VEIL
The troubled soul emblematical,
The unlimited storms of life's ocean:
Bibulous wine causes a riotous life,
And creates burdens and a lot of strife,
Gloomy days, and dreary nights.
An unwelcome guest, and hellish sights,
Smitten with blasphemous oaths, and scorned,
My feet in mirrored clay, my soul in bond.
My resting place a bed of coals,
Haunted by 'scaped hellish souls.
The Sun is a burning world beyond,
Burning Creation when man has gone.
The Earth, an undermined piece of clay;
Similar to hailstones, which melt away.
The turbulent seas, and volcanic land,
God holds all in the hollow of his hand.
THE CUP OF WINE.
'Twas I that filled the guests' flagons with wine,
And bade them drink and eat the fatted swine,
They did enjoy the flavored tasting stuff,
And not one knew the danger or when he drank enough.
The table was well prepared, that I did learn,
For them to drink and get drunk from the urn,
'Twas I, they blamed as each sleepy eye did blink,
And filled them once too much, and bade them drink.
Each merry maker full, did hie himself away,
With half-moon eyes, and found a place to lay,
Some upon a cot and others 'cross my lady's bed,
And those who had no place to lay wrapped in a linen spread.
And in silent dreaming, all through the lonely night
Of haunts and things that made an awful fright,
Until morning broke the dark away,
My! They were astonished to find it day.
MA' OLE HOME-MADE BANJO!
Sam, go bring ma' home-made banjo
Dat's hangin' on de wall.
Be careful wid it son,
An' doant let 'er fall.
She may be a little dusty
From hangin' dar so long.
But she's always full ob music
W'en I's bubblin' full of song.
Did you notice w'en I struck her
How sweet an' ca'm she soun'?
Wel' da ain't annoder banjo
Like her in dis ole town,
An' I would play befoh de Angels,
To win my robe an' croun.
So da ain't no use askin' me
To lay my banjo down.
You may talk about sweet music,
'Bout yer circus band dat plays.
An' 'bout yer gran' church organs
Dat plays on de sabb'th day,
Yer piano an' yer fiddle,
An' dem hi' tone fokes dat sing:
But jes here ma' home-made banjo
W'en eber she 'gins to ring.
Den tings is pretty libely
W'en all de folks am roun',
An' dey all seam mighty happy
W'en dey heres de banjo soun'.
I can't say dat she's stylish,
Wid brackets, an' silber strings.
But she soun's de berry finest
W'en I pick dem rosin strings.
De fiddle am a' music
Dat's made fer hi' tone dance.
But I take ma' home-made banjo
'Mong dem all an' took a chance.
W'en folks go to de parties,
An' gets all settled doun,
Dey fergits all 'bout der 'ligion
W'en dey here's ma' banjo soun'.
It's jes like a harp frum Hebin',
It soun's so good an' sweet;
An' den dey all got happy,
Which made 'em moob der feat.
Ole Jackson stole ma' whisky,
An' was totin' it in ter town,
W'en he hear ma' home-made banjo
It made him set it doun.
Granny cut de pig'un wing,
An' den she dance de buck.
I took ma' home-made banjo,
An' begun to tune her up.
De pa'son is a good man
An' he can sho' preach sum'.
But when I strike ma' ole banjo,
He says "Amen" de preachin's dun.'
THE SONG THAT NO MAN COULD LEARN
There's a song so sweetly,
And music completely,
That sounds sweet
To my soul.
The song from Heaven;
My soul did burn,
The song that no man could learn.
O, how it healed my soul,
And made me glad
The joys yet untold.
It brought joys to the sad,
The songs that no man could learn.
The author and finisher is my Lord,
'Tis the sweetest strains on music chord;
It makes my hope ever firm,
Music of Heaven, that no man could learn.
But I hope some day to learn that song,
The choice of the great King,
And with his Holy Angels
Lift up my soul and sing
The song that no man can learn.
Then I will bid earth farewell,
And leave everything here behind,
To sing that song my soul so longs,
The song that earth could not sing.
THE MAN OF THE DARK
He is searching through the nights,
Fleeing from the lights, he is darting
Here and there, and stealing everywhere,
The man of the dark.
He is trying with soul and might
To telescope the dim moon-light;
He is thinking all the time
What he can steal or find,
The man of the dark.
He is a thief, and vagabond,
And his word is not his bond,
He is a robber to perfection,
And can hardly escape detection,
The man of the dark.
He lives in the hollow of a cave,
As silent and lonely as a grave,
Shunned by all, he hates mankind,
Which makes him restless all the time,
The man of the dark.
His hands are stained with human blood,
His feet are pricked with thorns,
His clothes are ragged, dirty and worn,
He wished that he had never been born,
The man of the dark.
He hates the bright daylight,
And roams around at night,
He is a beastly horrid sight,
He is wrong, and never right,
The man of the dark.
He is a wearied worn-out soul,
This purloiner of silver and gold,
Like a ghost that glides around at night,
He climbs the loftiest mountain height,
The man of the dark.
He shall know when that day comes,
By the setting of the sun,
Which will end this sinful one,
Who must atone for crimes he did,
The man of the dark.
There's a beginning, and an end,
There's the criminal's silent dock,
There's the Judge, and then the Jury,
Verdict is "death," he gasps with fury,
The man of the dark.
There he struggled this human wreck,
With a rope around his neck.
The only thing that I can say,
"I hope he had time to pray."
The man of the dark.
I wonder where he has gone.
Had he really a chance to atone?
If not, then it is too late,
He has met an awful fate.
The man of the dark.
He will pay the debt he owes,
For the crimes that he has done,
In the flaming fire of woe,
There to burn for evermore;
The man of the dark.
THE HUMAN TREASURER OF A SOUL
Dear maiden let me ask of thee,
Whether you give to me or not,
A promise to you, this day I make a vow,
Accept my present now.
You ask my love. What shall my love then be?
A hope, an inspiration, a desire?
The soul's eternal charter writ in fire
Upon the earth, the heavens, and the sea.
You ask my love. The carnal mystery
Of a soft hand, of finger tips, that press,
Of eyes that kindle and of lips that kiss,
Of sweet things known to thee and only thee?
You ask my love. What love can be more sweet
Than hope or pleasure? Yet we love in vain,
The soul is more than joy, the life than meat,
The sweetest love of all was love in pain.
From a human soul, mixed with common clay,
What more could I offer you, I pray?
And that I will not give, so let it be,
Nay, give me any love, so it be love of thee.
CONFESSION
I am full of faults,
I am full of sin.
I am full of wrong,
That's my song.
I am full of habits,
That's my name.
I am full of shame,
That's my complaint.
I am full of love,
I am full of hate;
That's my song of fate.
I am full of weakness,
That's my song of meekness.
To God, I confess my fall,
He can forgive them all.
REPENTANCE
Forgive me, thou, O God, I pray,
I beseech Thee, day by day,
Move my numerous faults away.
This is my song and prayer for aye,
O Lord, I pray, remove the stain,
O let my soul not long complain:
Renew my hopeless strength again,
It is the shame that gives me pain.
CONVERSION
I love the songs of glory,
I cannot tell the story.
The worldly things I hate,
That made my songs a fate.
And this, I know,
That weakness has laid me low,
But so my soul shall live,
I repent, God forgive.
BABY 'LIZE.
'Lize you'se cum heah to me,
You're as bad as yu kin' be,
Why doan' yu behave yo❜sef?
Jist got mammy upset to def,
Papa's 'ittle darlin'.

DEATH
O Death, O Death, where art thou bound?
Among all nations thou canst' be found.
You visit the rich as well as the poor,
You biddest the great and small to go;
You leave your mark throughout the land,
And showeth no mercy for any man.
Thou knowest no sleep, slumber nor rest,
But taketh from us those we love best.
No man hath yet escaped thy hand:
Thou ridest thy pale horse through the land,
Thou sparest not Prophets, Priests or Kings,
Thou speedest faster than a bird with wings.
Thou comest to us both night and day,
And doeth thy work whate'er we say,
O Death! O Death! Where art thou bound?
Among all nations thou can'st be found:
They follow thee at thy command,
Thou sweepest the world with a touch of thy hand.
A SPECTRAL VISION
Upon the battle-field I cast my eyes upon the dead,
Nature's horror, the outcome of which I sorely dread;
It is a cursed vision and a terror stricken dream,
Of the slaughter of millions on that plot of green.
Men with gaping wounds groaning, and crying aloud in pain,
Women weeping, children hungry, because of their loved ones slain,
The burden of those days are surely hard to bear,
And each has prayed for peace, but vain has been his prayer.
At such a sight we weep and humbly bow our heads,
As we see the wolf come in stalking o'er the silent dead;
Cruel, cruel nations brought on this desperate war,
Which has brought desolation to many, and many a door.
They are restless still, 'twill soon be o'er,
This ruthless killing of friend and foe,
Life's sun is setting, and they see the shore
Upon whose banks they'll rest evermore.
THE DEATH OF PRIDE
Of all thy pride, and beauty, and neglected duty,
and the shame thou didst hide;
Death has taken it all away, and now in lifeless form abide,
And those whom thou didst scorn,
Looked upon thy nakedness and shame;
And thou didst not blush or hide.
Thy lifeless form has no pride.
Death is the end of the blush thou hast hushed.
And now between Heaven and Earth where the God of Pride
Shall not tell thee of thy beauty:
Nor tell thee of thy neglected duty,
Whisper to thee no more of love,
For thy lifeless form has been laid low and will soon decay,
And lose its shape and form.
But thy soul shall stand without pride or shame,
Naked before the Master,
Who knows the secrets of souls and hearts,
And records every deed,
And supplies its every need.
Naked didst it come into the world without shame and pride,
And naked shall it return unto its God, with sin-stained soul.
Of all thy pride and what thou didst hide,
As it begins, so shall it end.
LAZY SAM
Heah yu cum agin', ha!

THE HOPE OF PRIDE
Once a woman gave birth to a girl child,
Who grew to be pretty and fair,
Whose purity and love brought her fame,
Who was as fair as a lily,
Without sin or shame.
Whose hope of things above her path, was flowers,
Her song was love.
She talked to the gods without fear,
And to men of Heaven's nearness.
She taught her people, and never denied
The truth that came from on high.
She whispered with smile, and voice clear,
Be ready, O people, Heaven is nigh.
She hailed every traveler she chanced to meet,
With dusty garments and swollen feet
Asking questions, and of songs to repeat,
Of city above with golden streets.
So let the hope of salvation be our guide.
Learn the truth when a babe or youth,
Tell the people far and near,
Behold the everlasting Heavens are near.
Tell men the nearest way is love of man
Teach them a sweet song to sing,
Teach them the prayers, that save souls from despair,
A vision of hope, bright, hopeful and fair.
THE POET
I've often said, he is a poet, and a good one too,
One that loves his down-trodden race so faithfully and true,
Unborn generations shall remember him for ages yet to come,
For he shall do as other poets long ago have done.
Although the paths are rough, and the journey is so long,
He still marches onward to his music and his song;
By God's divine help he'll some day reach the goal,
And the Universe will echo with the stories he has told.
There were some that made light of his effort and his rhyme,
He went on, leaving his footprint on the sand of time:
Sometimes the days were dark, and the nights so very long,
But his weary soul was buoyed by the music of his song.
As I say, he was a poet, and I repeat, a good one too,
His verses touched the heartstring, and thrilled you through and through,
He wrote of God and Angels, it was with inspired hand,
Of the fatherhood of God, and the brotherhood of man.
JIST KEEP A MOVIN' ON
Sometimes I sit an' ponder,
An' think o'er life's condition,
Which puzzles dis heah ole man,
'Case its some strange proposition.
Life seems so bright at times,
Den grows dark betwixt de lines,
It's a mystery to de ole man,
But, I jist keeps a movin' on.
Sometimes my friends abuse me,
And my enemies dey accuse me,
Which makes dis road so rough,
But I jist keeps a movin' on.
De way seems kinder doubtin',
As my fren's git er poutin'.
Home gets kinder dark at times,
But I jist keeps a movin' on.
I don't listen at dem folks,
Wen dey kid me wid der jokes,
I jist shun dem black mokes
As I keeps a movin' along.
Sometimes da call me crazy,
An' say I'm jist too lazy,
But dis heah thing called writin',
I'se sholey gwine ter do.
Da kin laff an' call me silly,
Da'kin say jist w'at da please,
But I'se gwine ter keep a movin,'
Dat keeps my heart at ease.
W'en er look at life's condition,
As the world is goin' roun',
Why its jist one hard proposition
'Ter keep frum goin' agroun'.
So it ain't no use ter worry,
An' da ain't no use ter froun,
Yer must carry your own burdin',
'Case yer can't lay it down.
So ise gwine ter keep on doin',
Doe dey call w'at I do wrong',
I ain't gwine ter stop fer nobody,
But Is'e gwine ter keep movin' on.
NIGHT OF THE CHRISTMAS STAR
Oh, how my soul did long to sing
A new song to the new-born King;
My hope renewed, my soul shall sing
Of the night of the Christmas star.
He comes! He comes! The work is done,
He brings Salvation for every one,
Dispelling the darkness for the light,
On the night of the Christmas star.
Shining brighter than all other stars,
Brighter than Jupiter, Neptune or Mars,
It shines for peace, and good will to men,
Away off yonder this Christmas star.
The burden on the soul is now very light,
Reaching for that star, that is so bright,
Shining over there where the melodies shine,
Is the Christmas star that is so sublime.
Oh happy! Oh happy! will be the day,
When my soul shall find its weary way,
To that Heavenly shore forever to stay,
By the light of the Christmas star.
Awake ye saints-Sing and happy be,
For Christ was born to set us free,
Bow down and sing in praise to him,
By the light of the Christmas star.
RETURN OF THE GODS
Give me back my lutes and my forgotten songs,
Give me my fantastic nooks with their ancient charms,
Give me back my incense pot with its pleasant dreams,
Give me back the dear old life fraught with tragic themes.
Give me back the maids that sang and danced around my throne,
Give me back the songs they sang with magic all their own,
Give me back the molten loft and idols carved in stone,
Give me back the absentees and those that helped to moan.
Give me back my golden altar where I killed my Swine,
Give me back my jeweled chariots and everything divine,
Give me back my banquet hall with tables laden with wine,
I'll drink once again with ye gods of the olden time.
DE FIDDLER
Susan, heah dat Sam playin' de fiddle,
Heah dat music goin' tweedle de tweedle,
Jist shuts his eyes an' pats his feet,
Chile! he don't need no music book,
Wen he puts dat fiddle up side his face,
Huh! Lordy! you'se gwine ter lose yer grace.
It makes more notes den any bird,
'Tis de sweetest tunes I eber heerd;
Dat boy can make dat fiddle ring,
Yer feel like doin' de grape vine swing,
Sue, tell Mary Jane ter come to de do',
'Case she ain't heerd sich music befo'.
Look! Deacon Johnson, dun lef' his prayer,
An' stole out heah, dat fiddle to heah,
Heah comes Aunt Jemima, toddlin' down,
Dat music is gwine ter bring all de town,
Go easy dere, you people, don't shuffle so,
De Debbil will get you sho', down below.
A LITTLE VERSE
As a friend read it again,
Read it when sad, read it when glad,
Read it to old, read it to young,
And to tribes and nations of every tongue.
Read that God's salvation,
Is free to all creation,
And through it-soul's strife.
Will find succor through life.
Read that little verse, friend,
I know that you'll commend;
When far from your home,
Read it as an axiom.
THE MASTER IN RAGS
I am clothed in rags,
I am an honest man,
And make an honest living,
By the sweat of my brow;
I toil so very hard,
Look at my horny hands,
I must get a living,
This world owes it to me.
I may be very simple,
Queer things I may do,
But of sense and judgment,
I've got as much as you.
I may look poverty-stricken,
With my old torn clothes,
But instead of growing hungry,
I am getting rich and fat.
Of course I will acknowledge,
I have seen hungry times,
But there's heaps of satisfaction
In the knowing, if you know,
That this world is just an Eden,
If you try to make it so;
For no one can monopolize
The King of night and day,
Even if you are in rags,
You can always scatter sunshi
As you seek for light divine.
CURSED FROM CREATION
What sayest ye inhuman devils
About the souls of men?
What's that in your den
Ye unholy spirits of hell?
What secrets have ye there
Within that burning spot?
Thou art greedy indeed,
Thou stealeth from mortals,
The precious things they need.
Ye showeth them no mercy,
Nor carest for their pleading.
Thou seeketh their souls
To build ye a kingdom
Of sin and abomination,
Which is cursed from Creation.
THE SONG OF AGES
Do you love the song of ages?
Do you love the songs of time?
Do you love to hear old stories
Telling us all about the Tories?
Do you love the songs of nations
Filled with music of creations?
Do you love the rain and sunshine
And the rainbow, Nature's sign?
I love to talk of days gone by,
And the author of this lullaby.
I love to wander without fear
Around this great big mundane sphere.
THE LAWS OF NATURE
Dim are the eyes that see not that, which they see little.
Deaf are the ears that hear not that, which they hear little.
Dumb are the hearts that receive not that, which they perceive little.
Greedy and ungrateful are the mouths that eat, which they do not devour.
Careless are the hands that waste, which do not use the gifts of Life.
Unmindful is he that guides his feet into dangerous paths.
Ungrateful is the soul that does not send up songs of praise
To the high and holy God and Redeemer of all creation.
These laws of nature, as portrayed, are the gift of God.
'DAT NEW PREACHER
Look out, Mr. Preacher, whar 'yer walkin',
Make a mistep, sho's yer bohn;
I tell you what, it's no use talkin',
'Ef 'yer slip up Chile, 'yer's gone:
The road is full 'ob stumps an' stubble,
Ruts an' sinkholes ebery-whar;
I spec dey'll gib 'yer heaps 'ob truble,
'Ef 'yer don't stop 'yer foolin' dar'.
It's dark ez pitch an' mighty cloudy,
Spec de debbil's walkin' roun',
Fust ting 'yer know he'll tell 'yer howdy;
Lif' his hoof an' stomp de groun'.
Preacher-man, dere's a sto'm a brewin'!
Heah de a'ful thunder peal?
Look! Blazin' lightin', threatnin' ruin—
Oh, tell me, how 'yer feel.
Drap on 'yer knees an' go ter prayin','
Ax de Lawd to help 'yer out;
Chile, tell him you'se a lam' 'er strayin'-
Dun got loose and stumblin' 'bout,
An' 'den you'll see de stars 'er gleamin'-
Luminating all de way;
Yea, 'bout ten thousand,' twinklin', gleamin',
Smack untell der break 'ob da',
But if 'yer fail de debbil git 'yer,
Fetch 'yer slap right in de eye.
You'll feel most like 'er grapeshot hit 'yer,
Drapped from ha'f way to der sky.
Well, I hope 'yer can stay, sun,
But 'yer got a hard road 'ter run.
A STRANGE FRIEND
Whence camest thou stranger, seeking for a friend
Whose love dost thou want to flow with pain?
Thou art friend to no man, thou art a foe;
For thy friendship art dangerous where'er thou go.
And is he dead at last? He lingered long,
Despite the fever fits of doubt and pain,
It seemed that faith had wov'n a web so strong
'Twould keep him till his pulse beat true again.
Center of so much youth, and hope, and trust,
How could he crumble into common dust?
Cold blew the winds of circumstance,
Prudence and penury stood side by side,
Barbing the arrow shot by crafty chance,
Snatching the balsam from the wounds of pride.
Slander spiced well the cup false friendship
And so friendship died. Where shall we make his grave.
Scatter no roses on the bare, black earth,
Plant no white lilies: no blue violets bloom,
Weak in his death, as feeble in his birth.
Why should life strive to sanctify his tomb?
Even gentle memory is by truth forbid.
To honor aught that died as thy friend did.
Let the rank grasses flourish fearlessly,
With no fond footstep brushing them away;
While the young life be troubled, strong and free,
Turns to the promise of the world's new day,
Leaving the darkened skies to close above
The unhallowed burial place of shallow Love.
THE SLAVE
Here am I, only a defenseless creature,
Bound in chains, and ready to die;
Why did God give freedom to my birth?
No creature should be a slave on this earth.
These bonds and burdens make me weary,
As a strong, gigantic, flaxen-haired man
Cursed me, and flayed me, whip in hand,
Until so weakened, I could not stand.
He lashed me until my back was sore,
And my spirit humbled could hope no more;
The sun shone brightly on a miserable slave,
Mockery, its only a span to the grave
The stars glitter out in the silent night,
But I, a slave, must endure this plight;
The trees in the forest I must now hew,
God pity me! Oh, what shall I do?
Each day life seems to me so many years
I bear its burden welled up with tears,
But he, I call Master, the cowardly knave,
Is really not fit to own a slave
Bowed with age, and then like the slave,
Must soon make his bed down in the grave;
For every thing must have an end,
Death is conqueror, to him we must bend.
Nay, do not look for perfect peace or rest,
A life of noble conflict is the best;
And chivalry will win a brighter crown
Than we could gain by casting burdens down.
SWEET MEMORIES OF MY SOUL
Return to my soul, oh, sweet memories,
Bring back the tragic scenes of nature;
Lead me into a lonely room or den,
Where no voice can disturb my pen.
I care not for the treasures of gold,
But love best of all an inspired soul:
Let me see nature display her beauty,
And hear always the song of our duty.
The sighing of trees on the lonesome hill,
Where bird twitters echo from valley to rill.
Where genius finds beauty at her gayest,
Enjoying the mystery of unsought pleasure;
Among all these sit ungrateful man,
Longing for an inspiration to plan;
And yet what he sees, he knows it not,
If he be great or little, that's his lot
To see this world with his greedy eyes,
And yet something he must despise.
In secret coves burst music in harmony,
Rhyming with song so pleasant to hear,
Strains of music from the harps of saints
Echo through Paradise, a story to tell
Of the pleasures, and woes as well,
How the old memories are thronging,
As I gaze through the gloom o'er the lea,
And I whisper, with weary longing,
There's no light in the window for me.
Speak! Speak! Thou silent spectre of the night!
Shall memory ever struggle from the pyre,
When hope, when joy, when love hath lost their might,
And, phoenix like, defy life's searing fire,
To fill my day-dreams with its blighting power,
And break my slumbers with its fancies ghast?
Speak! Speak! May not some brighter future hour
Release me, oh, thou Spirit of the Past.
REMEMBERED-EVEN IN DEATH
Is this thy cold form that sleepest
With an evil scorn upon thy brow?
And where are all thy good friends
That brought thee down in shame?
If thou didst wrong, my good friend,
Must we put upon them the blame?
And thou wouldst have taken his life,
And marred his hopes with everlasting strife.
But seeing that thou dealt so unfair,
Thou sought thy secret chamber in prayer.
Thou outlived the curse of mortal man,
And strove to better his forbidden hand,
Having done something which was wrong,
Pity such creatures who die without prayer or song.
The life of man is strange, but death is common,
If I could call thee from thy long, last sleep
I would teach thee to save thy soul from pain.
Feeling death, and knowing thou couldst die but once,
God's work then, is what we must entertain,
Death givest thee no more of that which life demands,
For thou hast been cursed from a blessed land,
Thy tongue cleavest to the roof of thy mouth,
Thou canst not speak, nor seek from truth.
Time has stolen thee away from many good things,
And youth has fled from thee with everlasting wings.
Mercy has passed thee by, and bowed her head in shame,
Thou disobedient, troublesome creature, who is to blame?
If I were Judge, this sentence I always should say,
"Live thou, through ages, until that blessed, eternal day."

DEDICATION. 
 To him of all on earth, most faithful, 
 "My Husband," I affectionately dedicate this little volume. 
PREFACE. 
      Total Blind and Limited Education. 
      I send out my first little book, "Thoughts of Idle Hours," trusting it may find kind, considerate friends. Should I live to finish the second edition, I hope it will be a great improvement over this my first. I was born at Mount Ollie, Ky., a little country place. I lost my eye sight from overwork and eye strain at my occupation, dressmaking, in the year 1911. For three years afterwards, I went through a very severe illness. On March 10th, 1914, at  3 a.m. I awoke out of a sound sleep and wrote my first poem, "Sunshine." In eleven months and seventeen days afterwards, I had written the contents of this book. The question has often been asked, who writes your thoughts for you, since you are blind? I will answer here. Every line and verse in this little volume has been composed and written with my own hand notwithstanding the loss of my eyesight. 
      A copy of each verse I retain in my own handwriting, after this, they are copied in a book by my husband. I beg your kind consideration of the plain, simple verses herein: 
   I do not seek Wealth, Fame or Place, 
   Among the great ones of my race, 
   But, I would pen in letters bold! 
   Some thoughts! perhaps to cheer the soul.

 "SUNSHINE." 
 To C. Garfield Fox, of "The Philadelphia Record.”
 Like the sunshine, in the morning, 
      As it falls upon the field, 
 Let our hearts be bright and happy, 
      And to sorrow never yield. 
 Let all sadness turn to gladness, 
      And our path will brighter be; 
 He who loves us is above us, 
      And our way can plainly see. 
 "A THANKSGIVING PRAYER." 
 Our land has been fruitful, 
      Thou hath given us food, 
 Clothing and shelter, 
      And blessed us with good. 
 We have sown and gathered
      The ripe golden grain; 
 Thou hath sent us the sunshine, 
      The clouds and the rain. 
 We've gathered in store 
      The gifts from Thy hand; 
 There is peace and plenty. 
      Throughout our broad land. 
 From the homes of the brave. 
      In the land  of the free, 
 We bow, Blessed Father, 
      In Thanksgiving to Thee. 
 For mercy, O Lord, 
      We humbly beseech Thee; 
 For the nations at war, 
      In the lands across the sea. 
 Restore to us, Father, 
      Thy love, and thy peace, 
 Oh Thou, King of all kings! 
      Cause this cruel war to cease. 
  
 "THE EARLY MORNING." 
 In the early mist of morning, 
 As the day is slowly dawning, 
 Hear the rustling of the leaves 
 In the gentle summer breeze. 
 See the flowers lift their heads, 
 From their peaceful little beds, 
 Smiling sweetly, bright and gay, 
 Cheering thousands by their stay. 
 See the pansy's big bright eyes, 
 Peep at you in sweet surprise; 
 And the violet dipped in dew, 
 Says she has a kiss for you. 
 The pink rose turned a crimson red, 
 At the words the violet said; 
 The lily stood so pure and white, 
 Blushing sweet, then took her flight. 
 All day long the gentle breeze, 
 Scampered with the flowers and trees, 
 Till the sun which shown s o bright, 
 Left for home and said good night. 
 "DEWDROPS." 
 To I. Underbill. 
 Watch the dewdrops In the morning, 
      Shake their little diamond heads,  
 Sparkling, flashing, ever moving, 
      From their silent little beds. 
 See the grass! Each blade is brightened, 
      Roots are strengthened by their stay; 
 Like the dewdrops, let us scatter 
      Gems of love along the way. 
 MY THOUGHTS. 
 Many thoughts had I! 
 And away they would fly, 
 From the east to the west, 
 Seeking some place to rest. 
 Through the woodland and trees, 
 In the soft summer breeze, 
 By the silvery stream, 
 For awhile they would dream. 
 Like a flash of the eye, 
 Off again they would fly; 
 As a bird seeks a nest, 
 For its young ones to rest. 
 In a garden they flew, 
 Where the sweet violets grew, 
 And sought for a kiss, 
 From her lips sweet with dew. 
 Then onward they went, 
 With love in the heart, 
 And stopped for a rest, 
 In the galleries of art. 
 The artist could see, 
 Love had set them at rest; 
 And he painted for me 
 The one I loved best. 
 May my thoughts never roam, 
 From the place where I met 
 The dearest of all, 
 One sweet violet. 
 To Hon. Edward James Cattell, Statistician of the City of Philadelphia, Pa. 
 A master mind was his, 
      In the art of calculation; 
 So swift, his thoughts were wont to fly 
      Throughout the whole creation. 
 The city had appointed him 
      To note her great progression; 
 And keep a tab on everything 
      She had in her possession. 
 He could tell about the city, 
      From the first day of its birth; 
 Her many parks and buildings, 
      And every cent she's worth. 
 His friends would gladly gather 'round, 
      To hear his late review, 
 About the city and its needs, 
      And what they hoped to do. 
 Beloved by all the friends he knew, 
      And to his duty stood quite true; 
 On him the city could rely 
      To raise her standard bright and high. 
 "LITTLE YELLOW BABY." 
      (This poem was composed and written June 8, 1914 and made its first appearance in the Philadelphia Record July 13th, 1914. Since then a new verse has been added and the top line changed.) 
 Little yellow baby, 
      With dimpled hands and face, 
 Where'd you get that dirt from? 
      You're surely a disgrace. 
 Look at those sticky fingers 
      My suger bowl, I know, 
 Old Shivery Slinkum 
      Will catch you sure.  
 Don't grab me by the apron; 
      I saw him peeping then. 
 And when the door is open, 
      He's going to walk right in. 
 Don't let old "Slinkum" get you. 
      Well then you best be good, 
 Or else I'll let him take you 
      And chop you up for wood. 
 Dinah, bring the basin; 
      Wash his face and hands. 
 Don't you dare to whimper;
      Sit up! Goodness lands! 
 Dinah, bring the basin; 
      Wash his face and hands. 
 Hush! don't dare to whimper, 
      Sit up! Goodness lands! 
 Eyes a little drowsy—
      Looking kind o' weak; 
 Little yellow baby, 
      I'll rock you off to sleep. 
 Whimpering little baby, 
      Hush! Now do not weep! 
 Tender eyes shall guard thee, 
      While you are asleep. 
 Pleasant dreams attend thee! 
      Angels near thee keep, 
 Little yellow baby, 
     Sleep! Sleep! Sleep! 
 "A SONNET." 
 I've tried in vain to write a sonnet, 
 My mind was on a brand new bonnet; 
 I could not write a line. 
 Thoughts would come and then they'd go, 
 I found the task no better so, 
 I stopped it for a time. 
 At last I took my pen again, 
 And tried to make that sonnet plain, 
 And off my thoughts went flying; 
 My mind you see was all upset, 
 About that pretty bonnet. 
 My thoughts would fly, no use to try, 
 I could not write a sonnet. 
 A LULLABY "LITTLE CURLY HEAD." 
 Come, little curly head, 
 Bright eye'd baby boy; 
      Mammy's gwine to rock you to sleep. 
 Close dem eyes now, 
 Mammy's little love and joy, 
      Hush, now! Go to sleep. 
 Mammy's gwine to buy you 
 A brand new rocking horse, 
      And a pretty kite and string, 
 A little jumping jack, 
 And a pretty pussy cat. 
      And a mocking bird that sings. 
 Mammy don't care 
 If your little face is black; 
 It's just the sweetest face I know. 
 Dem pearly teeth so white, 
 And sparkling eyes so bright 
      They follow wherever I go. 
 Off to sleepy land! 
 Is Mammy's little man,
      Dreaming of his games and toys. 
 The pretty kite and string, 
 And other little things, 
      And the many fights he'll have among the boys. 
 "ELSIE" 
 She was fair, 
 With golden brown hair, 
 As the autumn leaves, 
 In an October breeze, 
 From a child of three, 
 She was happy and free, 
 As a lark on the wing, 
 In the young budding spring, 
 As the years rolled by, 
 On her I'd rely. 
 But alas! one day, 
 Carl took her away, 
 To be at his side, 
 His wife and his bride; 
 He a youth of good taste, 
 With manner and grace of a prince; 
 He was grand, 
 Just the right sort of man, 
 For Elsie, my friend, 
 I trust to the end. 
 THE LITTLE GERMAN BAND. 
 I had stopped down at the corner 
      To hear the little German band, 
 Playing "Away Down South in Dixie" 
      And "A March Through Georgia Land." 
 When I spied my mother coming, 
      With a broad strap in her hand, 
 O! I never stopped to look back 
      At that little German band. 
 Home I went a-running, 
      Just as fast as I could go: 
 In a closet hid myself, 
      My heart was full of woe. 
 When mother found me, there at last, 
      There was no use to cry; 
 I climbed up to the transom door, 
      And tried my best to fly. 
 She hauled me down, with might and main, 
      And then I tried to run; 
 I'll never watch a German band, 
      For strapping ain't no fun. 
 "THE BEST FAMILY.”
 The best family I knew, 
 Now honest and true, 
 Was a family of ten, 
 Both women and men. 
 It's seldom you pick 
 A family who stick 
 So closely together, 
 As the family of Kix. 
 The father and mother, 
 Were faithful and true; 
 And their children were reared 
 With the rod that was due. 
 An honor were they, 
 Each boy and girl; 
 And the kindest of friends, 
 That I had in the world. 
 "THE BABE THAT'S DARK AS NIGHT." 
 They've sung about the yellow babe, 
 The brown one and the white, 
 But the little babe I love the best 
 Is the one that's dark as night. 
 You see he has such sparkling eyes, 
 Bright as they can be; 
 He looks so cute and cunning-like, 
 When'er he smiles at me. 
 He's just the funniest little scamp 
 You’d find for miles around; 
 I love to jump him on my knee, 
 And trot him off to town. 
 "Dot Tanny now?" he said to me, 
 His little heart was full of glee; 
 When from my pocket wide and deep, 
 I pulled him out a candy sheep. 
 'Twas fun to see his big bright eyes, 
 Beam out with joy and glad surprise, 
 He laughed and jumped and ran and peeped, 
 Until he almost fell asleep. 
 It filled my heart with great delight, 
 To see that babe as dark as night, 
 A-sleeping sweet in slumber deep, 
 Still holding tight his candy sheep. 
 "NATURE." 
 Nature in the earth has slumbered, 
      Through the chilly winter's blasts; 
 Beasts have sought their caves for shelter, 
      Till the ice and snow have past. 
 Birds have sought a land of sunshine, 
      Through the southern fields they roam; 
 Making merry with their singing, 
      Winter o'er, they come back home. 
 Spring is near, the streams are swelling, 
      Nature, too, is on her way; 
 Birds and beasts are fast returning, 
      All the world seems bright and gay. 
 “SUPERSTITIOUS SAM ON THE WAR." 
 Things are getting mighty tangled, 
      In de world des latter days; 
 And dey sends your thoughts a-flying, 
      In a thousand different ways. 
 Well, de world is just as bright, 
      As it's always been to me; 
 But dar's something wrong, my brud'r, 
      Just as wrong as wrong can be. 
 Dan's de nations of de earth, 
      Dey ain't satisfied to stay; 
 In de worl' so full and fruitful, 
      Where dey haves it all de'r way. 
 Now, dah ain't no use in talkin', 
      Somp'em will hap'en shoe's you born; 
 If de folks don't stop dare fighting, 
      Gable shore will blow de horn. 
 Den dar'l be no use in stop'in', 
      Fur dey won't have time to pray; 
 Fur when Gable blows that mighty horn, 
      Dar'l be de judgment day. 
 "THE HOOP SKIRT." 
 You can talk about the new style gowns, 
      And high-heeled boots they wear, 
 The puffs and curls and other things, 
      That fashion now call hair. 
 But you ought to seen my mother, 
      In her hoop skirts, bless her soul; 
 With her waterfall of cotton, 
      Dyed black as furnace coal. 
 I remember standing by her, 
      In those good old-fashioned days; 
 While her hoop skirt bobbed and noddled, 
      In a dozen different ways. 
 Thinking how she'd ever stop them, 
      When she sat her down to spin, 
 While a-standing there a-thinking, 
      Deacon Jones come walking in. 
 Good morning, Sister Mandy! 
      Said the deacon with a bow; 
 Deacon John at home? I come to see 
      If he'll go and help me plow. 
 I am sorry, said my mother, 
      John has gone in town today, 
 With some chickens, eggs and butter, 
      And a load of new mown hay. 
 Have a chair, my mother offered; 
      Now when John comes back from town 
 I'll remember 'bout the plowing, 
      And will sure to send him round. 
 Thank you, said the deacon, 
      Well, I guess I'll have to go; 
 Mother's hoop skirt bobbed and noddled, 
      As she stood there in the door. 
 Give my love to Sister Sally, 
      Mother called out with a smile; 
 Tell her Sunday is baptizing, 
      Up the road here 'bout a mile. 
 Brother Jasper will preach the sermon. 
      In the morning, and at night 
 We will have another brother 
      By the name of Isaiah White. 
 Then she sat down to her spinning, 
      In her usual pleasant way, 
 Singing sweetly, "Roll on, Jordan, 
      Till that bright and happy day." 
 After all I think that fashion, 
      With its funny styles and ways, 
 Will welcome back the hoop skirt, 
      Of those good old-fashioned days. 
 "A RACOON CHASE." 
 Ike and me, just him and me, 
 Went on a racoon chase. 
 Over hill and dale we found the trail, 
 But lost it in our haste. 
 Said Ike to me, that coon you see, 
 I think went up that 'simmon tree; 
 Said I to Ike, well, I'll be bound, 
 I'll climb that tree and fetch him down. 
 Oh, no! said Ike, just let him be, 
That coon is wise as you and me; 
 We saw his shadow on the ground, 
 That scamp was slowly sneaking down. 
 I called to Ike to bring the dogs, 
 I'd chase that coon behind some logs; 
 He called old Roscow, Nero, too. 
 That coon got out and fairly flew. 
 As far as me and Ike could see, 
 That scamp ran up another tree; 
 The dogs, they ran and jumped and bound, 
 And tried their best to bring him down. 
 I looked at Ike, 
 Ike said to me, 
 That coon can have that 'simmon tree. 
 "BASKET MEETING DAY." 
      (This scene was taken from a little place in the hills of Kentucky called Mount Ollie, not far from my birth place.) 
 Time was drawing mighty near, 
      To basket meeting day, 
 Down at Mt. Ollie where they say 
      The yearly spread is laid. 
 Every buggy in the town, 
      Wagon, cart and dray, 
 Had been engaged for weeks ahead 
      For basket meeting day. 
 Sis Hannah Brown, who always led 
      In everything that's great, 
 Sent word to all her friends around, 
      To start in and not wait. 
 There's cakes to bake and pies to make, 
      Peach preserves and jam, 
 Biscuits brown and hoe cakes too, 
      Perhaps a dozen hams. 
 The chickens, when it comes to them, 
      They took the cue and flew; 
 For miles around no fowl was found, 
      What would the preacher do?
 The chickens when It came to them, 
      They took the cue and flew; 
 For miles around, no fowl was found, 
      What would the preacher do? 
 The great eventful day arrived, 
      They came from miles around, 
 From Johnson's place and Thompson's place, 
      And lots of folks from town. 
 The day had started bright and fair, 
      As anyone could wish; 
 The deacons they were on the grounds, 
      To help on with the rush. 
 By twelve o'clock the yard was full, 
      No room for man or beast; 
 The church was full and wagons full, 
      Where would they spread the feast? 
 The meeting house was quite too small, 
      To hold the surging crowd; 
 And Parson Sparks had had his pulpit 
      Moved out in the yard. 
 He mounted high and took his stand, 
      And then began to speak; 
 My text said he shall be this day 
      "The shepherd and the sheep." 
 I have prepared on my right hand, 
      A pasture for the sheep, 
 And on my left a stopping place, 
      Where sinners come to weep. 
 He mounted high and took his stand, 
      And then began to speak; 
 "My text," said he, "shall he this day, 
 “The Shepherd and the sheep.' " 
 Come right on up and take your place, 
      The parson gave command; 
 And all at once the surging crowd 
      Had marched on his right hand. 
 "Praise the Lamb!" a brother cried; 
      And then the shouting started; 
 High in the air flew hats and hair, 
      For heads and hair had parted. 
 They shouted in and shouted out, 
      Till almost time for dinner; 
 The parson cried, "Now friends, sit down," 
      I cannot find a sinner." 
 Take your seats," he said again; 
      And with his hand he waved. 
 "I find no goats are here today, 
      There is nothing but the saved. 
 "Brother Pierce, please come up front, 
      And take the day's collection; 
 Now, friends, each one must do his best, 
      That it may bear inspection. 
 "Deacon Dodd, please start a hymn, 
      With plenty money in it; 
 Praise the Lamb! a brother cried; 
      And then the shouting started. 
 High in the air flew hats and hair, 
      For heads and hair had parted. 
                               (Hymn.) 
           I been listening all night long, 
                I been listening all day; 
           I been listening all night long, 
                To hear some sinner pray. 
 "Come right on up, don't sit and wait, 
      It's almost time for eating; 
 At any rate it's growing late." 
      Thus ends our basket meeting. 
 "THE ORGAN MASTER." 
 (To Mr. John A. Lively, Philadelphia, Pa., February 9th, 1915) 
 We've got a great big organ 
      At the church down where I go; 
 And you ought to hear the music, 
      Playing softly, sweet and low. 
 They've as fine an organ master 
      As is found in any town; 
 When he starts that organ singing, 
      You got to lay your burden down. 
 I have often sat and listened, 
      As he played along the keys, 
 At the music softly sighing, 
      Like a gentle summer breeze. 
 Made you think about the angels, 
      With their golden harps and wings; 
 And the mighty songs of Zion, 
      That the Christian people sing. 
 There is music in that organ! 
      When Brother Lively plays 
 He sends the keys a-running 
      In a dozen different ways. 
 Then he'd strike the chords so gently, 
      In a kind o' solemn way; 
 And play the sweetest music, 
      As the people bowed to pray. 
 BESSIE. 
 Gentle in nature, modest and shy, 
 With a sparkle of hope in her pretty bright eyes. 
 Hope was the anchor she carried each day, 
 With courage and vigor she made her own way. 
 Her duties were many, to all she was true, 
 A dear, loving mother, with bright daughters two. 
 "A YOKE OF OPPRESSION." 
 We have been free, yes, fifty years! 
 From shackles and chains, 
 But not from tears, 
 The bloodhound has gone from the cabin door, 
 The slave master haunts our steps no more; 
 But a yoke of oppression we sometimes feel, 
 A yoke that oppresses our common weal. 
 We've obeyed our rulers, 
 We've fought for our land; 
 We've planted the vineyards, 
 We've gone at command. 
 But a yoke of oppression we yet still feel, 
 A yoke that oppresses our common weal. 
 Be not discouraged, go on to the end; 
 Be brave men of valor, be women and men, 
 And the yoke of oppression that is weighing us down, 
 Some day, like a boomerang, 
 May turn and rebound. 
 JACK AND I. 
 Jack and I went out for a walk, 
 Along the seashore for a pleasant talk, 
 As we sat on the sand, 
 By the sad, sad sea, 
 There Jack gave his heart 
 And his love all to me. 
 Said he, "Mary, I love you, 
 I give you my all;" 
 Said I, "Jack, don't be foolish, 
 Love rises and falls. 
 "Like the waves of the sea, 
 They are never at rest; 
 It is hard for you, Jack, 
 To tell who you love best." 
 "Now, Mary," said Jack, 
 "If you don't believe me, 
 I'll throw myself out 
 In the wild raging sea." 
 "Oh! Jack," said I, 
 "Don't do that for me, 
 For how on earth 
 Could I live in the sea?" 
 THE LADIES' SEWING BEE. 
 An invitation come for me 
 To join the ladies' sewing bee, 
 Which meets at Kitty Paxtons, 
 On Thursday next, the message said, 
 And Sally Simpson there will read 
 A paper on relaxtion. 
 That sewing bee may be all right 
 But it requires the best of sight 
 To make such little stitches; 
 The only ones that I could make 
 Would be perhaps a patch to take 
 And sew on Dollies breeches. 
 But then you know I had to go 
 No way to get around it, 
 When I got there, well I'll declare 
 I'll tell you how I found it. 
 The room was filled with tables small,
 And chairs pushed back clear to the wall, 
 And ladies sitting 'round it. 
 This sewing bee, well now you see, 
 Was quite a brand new thing to me; 
 When I went in a lady said, 
 "Have you your thimble, needle and thread”
 Not yet, said I, I come you see 
 To join the ladies sewing bee. 
 Your name, please. "Sue T. Homer." 
 Well now, please take that seat in the corner. 
 Well, the way those ladies looked at me 
 I was sorry I joined that sewing bee. 
 At last I was given an apron to make 
 While the ladies were discussing the way to make cake; 
 I tried my best and could not sew, 
 And had fully made up my mind to go 
 When Kitty Paxton rose and said, 
 Now, ladies, we'll have the paper read. 
 Well, Sally Simpson looked too sweet, 
 Gowned in white from head to feet; 
 As she arose she looked at me, 
 'Twas then a quarter after three. 
 Now, ladies, she said, before I start 
 I hope no one here will have to depart. 
 My paper today is on relaxtion, 
 Which requires much thought and action. 
 Now relaxtion is this, don't go to pieces, 
 If Dinnah falls down and breaks all the dishes; 
 Don't wind yourself up to the highest pitch 
 Throw Dinnah and the dishes all down in the ditch, 
 Then sit back and laugh in serene relaxtion. 
 Don't give a thought to the scene or the action. 
 The ladies all voted the paper was good, 
 And said they would try to obey if they could. 
 "Ladies," said Kitty, "we've been greatly honored, 
 We'll have a paper next week by Miss Sue T. Homer." 
 Speaking of me "who sat in the corner." 
 The work was all finished Kitty gave them to make 
 Then the ladies sat down to their tea and cake; 
 It is nice to go to a sewing bee, 
 But I doubt again if they ever see me. 
 THOUGHTS. 
 What kind of thoughts now, do you carry 
      In your travels day by day 
 Are they bright and lofty visions,
      Or neglected, gone astray? 
 Matters not how great in fancy, 
      Or what deeds of skill you've wrought; 
 Man, though high may be his station, 
      Is no better than his thoughts. 
 Catch your thoughts and hold them tightly, 
      Let each one an honor be; 
 Purge them, scourge them, burnish brightly, 
      Then in love set each one free. 
 "WHEN YOU FEEL A LITTLE BLUE.”
 When you feel a little blue, 
 Kinder good for nothing, too, 
 And you try your best to rouse yourself and can't, 
 Think about the busy bee, 
 As he flies from tree to tree, 
 Then stop and take a lesson from the ant. 
 At the very peep of day, 
 They are up and on their way, 
 Toiling on until the setting of the sun. 
 When the harvest days are o'er, 
 And they've gathered in their store, 
 They can rest because their work has been well done. 
 "THE CHORUS." 
 TO ARTHUR E. BIRCHETT. 
 He had gathered in the singers—
      From the East and from the West, 
 The very best of singers, 
      Who could stand, the hardest test. 
 The Leader, skilled in music, 
      Was a man, who knew a tune, 
 From the plain old fashioned Jew harp, 
      To the humming bird, in June. 
 He'd got them, all together, 
      And started them to train 
 Bass, alto and soprano; 
      Then, the high-toned tenors came. 
 "Everybody" joined the chorus 
      When Director Birehett led; 
 Why, the folks just kept on singing— 
      Till they nearly lost their head, 
 Some of them, had long been singing, 
      'Fore the Leader here was born, 
 Some I guess, will keep on singing— 
      Until Gabriel blows the horn. 
 The Leader, mounted high the stand, 
      And calmly stood and looked; 
 Order! said he; the chorus now 
      Please take your singing books! 
 And turn to No. Thirty Three! 
      The "Singers keep their eyes on me. 
 The bass, will start, right over here; 
      Now! Sing your words, with ease, and clear 
 The Lead Bass, he had lost his place 
      Was singing way behind, 
 Alto and Tenor, stopped at once—
      Sopranos kept on trying.
 The Leader, beat and banged! his stick, 
      Sopranos, now were flying! 
 The Lead Bass could not find his place, 
      There was no use in trying, 
 At last the Leader got their ear 
      Their hearts were trembling now, with fear, 
 He looked them squarely in the face, 
      Said he: Such stuff is 'er real disgrace. 
 Then, all at once, that mighty chorus! 
      Sang out, as if the Heavenly Host" 
 Had struck their harps' of gold, 
      The music! Oh! 'twas sweet to hear, 
 It seemed to bring Salvation" near 
      As on and on, it rolled! 
 The Leader stood with smiling face; 
      Pleased it seemed, was plain, 
 For weeks and months, he'd labored hard, 
      His work was not in vain. 
 "EZIKEL'S FIRST DEGREE" 
 Ezikel Jones was on the list, 
      To take the first degree, 
 On Friday next the message ran, 
      A quarter after three. 
 Poor Ziek he could not sleep that night, 
      No! not to save his soul, 
 He dreamed he saw a billy goat 
      And climbed a greasy pole. 
 The appointed day Ziek got there late, 
      A quarter after four, 
 He heard the balls arolling loud, 
      Upon the second floor. 
 Ezikel Jones! was called out loud, 
      He answered, "Here am I," 
 Please come up front the master said, 
      Poor Ziek! made no reply. 
 You see this pole? Now Brother Jones, 
      It's mighty hard to climb, 
 Take off your coat and necktie too, 
      Now start, but take your time. 
 There is twelve degrees, the master said, 
      You'll find them on the pole, 
 Many a man has gone up there, 
      And never had a fall. 
 Ziek looked right shy, 
      And all at once, he heard a brother call, 
 The goat is there, Now! Brother Jones, 
      To catch you if you fall. 
 The goat eyed Ziek and Ziek the goat, 
      And then he eyed the pole, 
 How could he climb a greasy pole, 
      And never have a fall. 
 He started up, his foot slipped back, 
      The goat was drawing near, 
 To turn back now would never do, 
      His heart was full of fear. 
 He took one step and slipped back two, 
      Poor Ziek was almost crying, 
 He could not climb that greasy pole, 
      There was no use in trying. 
 So down! he come right on the goat, 
      They round the room went flying, 
 They caught the goat and found poor Ziek, 
      They really thought him dying. 
 When Ziek revived more dead than live, 
      He was a sight to see, 
 He'd lost his coat and necktie too, 
      But had the first degree. 
 HE DIDN'T STOP TO THINK. 
 Ike Johnson loved a fair young girl, 
      Her name was Lucy Prim, 
 He thought the whole wide world of her, 
      And she the same of him. 
 He took Bill Jones to call one day, 
      Which always breaks the link, 
 He left them there to chat awhile, 
      But he didn't stop to think. 
 Mister Jones he liked the girl, 
      And there he told her so, 
 Just twenty seconds by the watch, 
      Before he had to go. 
 He asked that he might call again, 
      Miss Lucy looked at him, 
 She told him yes and gave a smile, 
      Then Ike come walking in. 
 Jones thanked her and he took his hat, 
      And then he went away, 
 From that time on no thought had Jones, 
      But of his wedding day. 
 Poor Ike his days were numbered, 
      Jones did not care a wink, 
 The trouble about the whole thing was, 
      Ike didn't stop to think. 
 "THE GIRL WHO DOES NOT CARE." 
 The girl who says she does not care a snap about a man, 
      Will do her level best you know, 
 To catch one if she can. 
      Of course she has no time to waste, 
 On Harry, Tom or Ned, 
      Their words were vain, 
 She had no ear for anything they said. 
 Such fun you know to come and go, 
      And do just as you please, 
 No one to boss or make you cross, 
      One lives in greatest ease. 
 How years rolled by, she knew not why, 
      Her life wa s sad and lone, 
 Her friends were few and those untrue, 
      She longed to have a home. 
 Very late in life she became the wife, 
      Of a man who lived on a farm, 
 She had the garden to hoe, and no place to go, 
      But to gather the eggs from the barn. 
 Now girls be wise, "Do you realize, 
      How time is slipping away, 
 When Tom comes round don't turn him down, 
      It may be your last chance for a day.”

 "THE OLD-TIME RELIGION." 
      Give me dis ole time religion, 
      Give me dis ole time religion, 
      Give me dis ole time religion, 
           It's good enough for me. 
 Look heah, Brud'er! don't sing dat way. 
 Dan ain't no ole time religion today; 
 Bar's a new time kind da's got of late, 
 A bran new style right up to date. 
 You go's up now and takes de preacher's han', 
 And steps right over in de promise Ian'; 
 Bar's no use fur to pray, or to speak of a shout, 
 Fur nobody'll know what you'r' talking about. 
 Bar's nothing fur to do but to set right down, 
 Put on your robe and try on your crown; 
 Ben wait fur de chariot to de golden shore; 
 No use fur to moan and pray no more. 
 Bar now! Brud'er, I'm sorry fur to say, 
 Bar ain't no ole time religion today. 
 "DEACON JONES" 
 Deacon Jones was a real good man, 
      As deacons ought to be; 
 He had one wife, as the Scripture says. 
      Instead of having three. 
 He taught a class in Sunday school, 
      With vigor, might and force; 
 He said no drunkard in the church 
      Could join the heavenly host. 
 Across the way sat Deacon Dodd, 
      His face all in a frown; 
 And tried his best to read so loud, 
      The deacon's words he'd drown. 
 "Not a drop," said Deacon Jones, 
      "A Christian ought to take; 
 No matter what your troubles are, 
      Not for his stomach's sake." 
 Deacon Dodd, he saw no harm, 
      In just a sip or two; 
 If water 'round was hard to find,
      To quench the thirst 'twould do. 
 When Deacon Jones went home from church, 
      His heart was clear and clean; 
 He'd told them 'bout King Alcohol, 
      And pictured well the scene. 
 At night he sought his peaceful bed, 
      To rest his weary feet; 
 Outside the snow was falling fast, 
      And turning into sleet. 
 Next day when he awoke, 
      Snow covered all the ground; 
 And from a cupboard, dark and high, 
      He pulled a bottle down. 
 He opened it, in haste he did. 
      And looking quickly 'round, 
 "I see no harm," said he, "to drink 
      When sleet is on the ground." 
 "A FOOLISH MAN." 
 A foolish man came riding by, 
 A wise man said, your horse will die. 
 Said the fool, if he dies, 
 I'll tan his skin, 
 And if he lives, I'll ride him again. 
 "SPRING." 
 Oh! What joy and peace and cheer, 
 Fill our hearts, when spring is near; 
 Gone is winter's chilly blast, 
12flowers return at last 
 Butterflies in dresses gay, 
 They, too, have started on their way; 
 Spring is here! Now let us cheer, 
 The happiest days of all the year. 
 "LOOKING BACK." 
 Looking back I see myself, 
       A child just five years old; 
 I'd climb up in my papa's lap, 
       When mom began to scold. 
 He'd hold me on as best he could, 
      And then he'd let her fuss; 
 He did not mind how much she talked, 
      Just so she didn't cuss. 
 And then he'd jump me up and down, 
      And tell me 'bout Bo Peep, 
 Who wandered all around the town, 
      And could not find her sheep. 
 And then he said that poor Jack Spratt, 
      He had to eat the lean; 
 That old Mrs. Spratt, she ate the fat, 
      Because she was so mean. 
 Bait oh! my mother overheard 
      My father tell me that; 
 From that time on he ate the lean, 
      And mother ate the fat. 
  
 "DOWN IN THE COUNTRY." 
 Down in the country where we lived, 
      The girls and  boys were happy; 
 There was no mamma nor any papa, 
      But just plain mam and pappy. 
 'Twas "Uncle Joe and Aunt Maria, 
      Uncle Ned and Jerry; 
 All day long was one sweet song, 
      The heart was always merry. 
 The boys and girls joined in the sport 
      Of baseball, kites and marbles; 
 And when at church the boys sung bass, 
      The girls they'd always warble. 
 Then after school it was the rule 
      To see-saw, jump and swing; 
 The boys spun tops and played hip-hop, 
      In fact did everything. 
 Such happy days and country ways, 
      Indeed it was a pleasure; 
 The greatest joy without alloy, 
      And lots of time for leisure. 
 "THE WANDERING SHEEP." 
 Sheep without a shepherd, 
      Over the mountains roam, 
 Weak and worn, bruised and torn, 
      Wandering far from home. 
 Helpless! Shelterless! Wandering! 
      "The wolf" can find his prey; 
 No hand to guide, no place to hide, 
      Wandering all the day. 
 Father, who loves the wandering sheep, 
      Bring them into the fold! 
 They know not, Lord, what snares await, 
      Shelter them from the cold. 
 "A MAN OF THE HEART." 
 To My Friend, Edward Barber. 
 Give me a man who has a heart, 
      To feel another's pain; 
 Who'll lift a brother from the earth. 
      Help him his steps to gain. 
 Give me a man, who has a heart, 
      To bravely stand for right; 
 When foes assail on every hand, 
      Out in the thickest fight. 
 Give me a man, who has a heart, 
      To meet a world of frowns; 
 With smiling face and courage bright. 
      To lift up one 'who's down. 
 “AS YOU GO FROM HOME TODAY." 
 As you go from home today, 
 Think it out upon the way; 
 Have you left a kiss for mother, 
 A loving smile for sister, brother? 
 Have you bade a kind goodbye, 
 With your spirit bright and high? 
 If you have the day is bright, 
 And the heaviest burden light. 
 As you go from home today, 
 Think it out upon the way; 
 Have you done your very best, 
 Will your work now stand the test? 
 Have you conscientious been 
 In your dealings with all men? 
 If you have the day is bright, 
 And the heaviest burden light. 
 As you go from home today. 
 Think it out upon the way; 
 Have you rid your soul of sin? 
 Are you pure and clean within? 
 Have you bid the devil go, 
 Gave him not the slightest show? 
 If you have the day is bright, 
 And the heaviest burden light. 
 "HE IS RISEN." 
 Christ our Lord was hung on Calvary, 
      For the sins of you and me; 
 That from sin and condemnation, 
      Jew and Gentile should be free. 
 Jesus Christ our Lord is risen, 
      On the third day as he said; 
 There beside the empty prison, 
      Roman soldiers lay as dead. 
 Early in the dawn of morning, 
      "Mary" sought her Lord with tears; 
 Look! Behold, He is risen! 
      See the tomb! He is not here. 
 He has risen from the prison, 
      Bear the tidings far and wide; 
 Jesus Christ, our Lord, is risen, 
      On this glorious Easter tide! 
 If in Him we die from sin, 
      We shall also rise again; 
 Death no more can have its sway, 
      Jesus took the sting away. 
 TO J. J. PEARCE. 
 I shall not forget your friendship, 
      When the days were dark and drear; 
 When in trouble, pain and s adness, 
      We could find you always near. 
 I am a prisoner in the darkness, 
      Never more may be set free; 
 But your sympathy, kind and tender, 
      Makes the world so bright to me. 
 As I wait here in the shadow, 
      Kindly thoughts shall be of thee; 
 Praying that the darkness vanish, 
      And your pleasant face to see. 
 "NEW STYLE TUNES." 
 To Mr. W. H. Marlow. 
 They've got a lot of new style tunes, 
      For old-time hymns today; 
 Why! you never hear a single hymn 
      Sung in the old-time way. 
 You never hear them singing 
      "Am I a soldier of the cross?" 
 If you did, you'd never know it, 
      For the tune has long been lost. 
 O! I'd love to hear the tunes once more, 
      Like mother used to sing; 
 “And shall I fear to own his cause, 
      Or blush to speak his name?" 
 And then that old familiar hymn, 
      "And, am I born to die?" 
 She'd sing that hymn, so high and sweet, 
      'Twould almost reach the sky. 
 And then she had another song 
      About the Judgment day, 
 "And sinners plunged beneath that flood, 
      Washed all their sins away." 
 These new time tunes may be all right, 
      For high-tone folks to sing; 
 I'd rather hear the old-time tunes, 
      Like mother used to sing. 
 UNCLE JOSHUA'S BIRTHDAY DINNER. 
 News had spread throughout the town,  
      About a birthday dinner 
 Uncle Joshua Crow was going to have, 
      And invite both saints and sinner. 
 He didn't exactly know his age, 
      He thought 'twas ninety-seven; 
 He said he'd have one great big time, 
      Before he went to heaven. 
 Uncle Joshua was a kind old man, 
      Well-known around the village; 
 His trade was picking rags and bones, 
      And other privileges. 
 Everybody in the town 
      Received an invitation; 
 And all began at once to make 
      Elaborate preparations. 
 In fact the little town itself 
      Was decorated grand; 
 Ike Simms was there, 
      And had on hand his pickaninny band. 
 The festal day at last arrived. 
      It surely was a pity; 
 To see the folks crowd in that room 
      From countryside and city. 
 Uncle Joshua! greeted them one and all. 
      Hypocrites, saints and sinners; 
 When all had had their turn at him, 
      He invited them out to dinner. 
 Such shaking hands and bowing down, 
      And great congratulations, 
 Such crowds were never seen before, 
       Not in this generation. 
 Uncle Joshua greeted them, one and all, 
      Hypocrites, saints and sinners; 
 When all had had their turn at him, 
      He invited them out to dinner. 
 The table man! Don't say a word! 
      Was loaded down with chicken; 
 Young spring shote and o'possum, too, 
      And lobster still a-kicking. 
 Cakes and pies, why sakes alive! 
      Peanuts, dates and candy; 
 Blackberry roll and peach preserves, 
      Hush! a jug of apple brandy. 
 Dinner o'er they cleared the floor, 
      That music sure was singing; 
 Miss Dinah Diggs and Uncle Josh 
      Come down the floor a-swinging. 
 He swung Miss Dinah up and down, 
      Uncle Joshua's feet were flying; 
 And then he turned her round and round, 
      Miss Dinah was almost crying. 
 Dinner o'er they cleared the floor, 
      That music sure was singing; 
 Miss Dinnah Diggs and Uncle Josh 
      Come down the floor a-swinging. 
 The music played, the people swayed. 
      Hypocrites, saints and sinners; 
 'Twas almost day when they went away r 
      Prom Uncle Joshua's birthday dinner. 
 "PITY." 
 Do not stand back and pity me, 
 If I have fallen in the sea; 
 If thou hath love, jump in and see. 
 If you can help to rescue me. 
 "AS I PASS BY THE WAY," 
 Keep not your roses, 
 For my dead, cold clay; 
 Scatter them along as I pass by the way. 
 Speak a kind word, 
 While I'm with you today; 
 Give me a smile as I pass by the way. 
 The fairest flower that blooms in the day,
 Will avail me but naught, 
 When I've passed away. 
 Give me the love that I long for today, 
 Scatter the flowers 
 As I pass by the way. 
 "TOILING.'' 
 Year after year, in toil and pain, 
 Striving a bit of gold to gain; 
 Laboring on from day to day, 
 On earth to live, in stores we lay. 
 When at last we've gained the gold, 
 And troubles o'er us no more roll, 
 Then time steps in and bids us go, 
 Our days on earth shall be no more. 
 Others left shall take our place 
 With braver runners in the race; 
 Yet toil shall be the lot of man, 
 It is the Master's great command. 
 Lay not in store great bags of gold, 
 But heap up treasures for the soul; 
 By sweat of brow thy bread shall earn, 
 Long as the lamp holds out to burn. 
“THE WAR IN EUROPE, 1914.”
 See the world in great confusion! 
      Stop and think oh, mortal man! 
 Friend and foe alike are losing, 
      Thousands fall on every hand. 
 Why this needless cause of battle? 
      Who can answer? No, not one; 
 Nations, like dumb driven cattle, 
      Fall as grass before the sun. 
 Oh! the world so vast and fruitful 
      Why not here content abide? 
 He who owns the lands and waters, 
      Will from us no good thing hide. 
“O, MIGHTY SEA!" 
 O, Mighty Sea! Thy mournful sound, 
      Forever I can hear; 
 O, tell me what thy troubles are, 
      What burdens doth thou bear? 
 Forever hath thou mournful been, 
      What sorrows fill thy breast? 
 Thy tossing billows never cease; 
      Hath thou no time for rest? 
 Perhaps a message now you bring,
      Up from the mighty deep; 
 Of loved ones, near and dear to us, 
      In watery graves they sleep. 
 O, restless sea, now pray tell me, 
      What message do I hear? 
 I'll wait beside thy mighty waves, 
      And will thy tidings bear. 
 "THE THOUGHTS OF MAN." 
 The thoughts of man are seed of nature, 
      They grow as wheat, for good or ill; 
 In planting thought take care to scatter 
      Seed of love in deep good-will. 
 Then watch it grow each day and hour, 
      Kissed by the sunshine of the soul; 
 The seed you've sown will grow in power, 
      The fruit it bears will ne'er grow old. 
 "THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD." 
 The beautiful world, the grass, the trees, 
 The sweet smelling rose, 
 The gentle breeze. 
 The fish of the sea, the birds of the air, 
 The little tom-tit and the grizzly bear, 
 Each in its class is a beauty, you see, 
 In this grand old world for you and me. 
 The beautiful world, the ice and snow, 
 The silvery lakes where the rivulets flow; 
 The rocks and caves, the shells of the sea, 
 In this grand old world for you and me. 
 The beautiful world, the mountains and hills, 
 The wide spreading plains, the valleys and rills, 
 The beast of the field, the fowl of the air, 
 In the world there is beauty everywhere. 
 "CLIMBING UP" 
 Do not climb so fast, my brother, 
      Take your time and go it slow; 
 Stop arid meditate a little, 
      Stop and think before you go. 
 Then when starting do not hurry, 
      Take it slowly as you climb; 
 Stop awhile and rest a little, 
      Start again but take your time. 
 When at last you've reached the summit,
      You will have no vain regrets; 
 For you've measured well the journey, 
      And each difficulty met. 
           Take it slow. 
 "STOP AND THINK." 
 Just stop and think a moment. 
      When the way seems rough and steep; 
 When trials, pain and sadness, 
      Fill your soul with sorrows deep. 
 When the mighty waves of trouble, 
      O'er you like the billows roll; 
 Turn your lamp up bright, my brother, 
      Take a look into your soul. 
 "WAITING IN THE SHADOW.'* 
 I am waiting in the shadow, 
      For the coming of the light, 
 Bright and cheerful, I am waiting. 
      Fearing not the darkest night. 
 Oh, what peace and consolation, 
      As I wait here by the way! 
 Thinking of the Joys awaiting, 
      When the mist has rolled away. 
 Oh, the hand that leads and guides me. 
      Sure will help me all the way, 
 Through the daylight and the darkness, 
      While I wait here by the way.

The Path of Dreams 
 Sweet-scented winds move inward from the shore, 
 Blythe is the air of June with silken gleams, 
 My roving fancy treads at will once more, 
 The golden path of dreams. 
 Along the sloping uplands yellow wheat 
 Is bending to the honied breath of June, 
 While all the lowlands slumber at my feet 
 This glorious afternoon. 
 To balmy gusts from blue-girt breezy hills 
 The clover blossoms nod with graceful art, 
 And all the mystery of living thrills 
 The ever pulsing heart. 
 A boon to lovers still, the sweet wild rose 
 Adds perfume to the languor in the air, 
 And whispering Zephyr scatters as she goes 
 Sweet atters everywhere. 
 The wild birds restlessly from tree to tree. 
 Flit ceaselessly beneath the sunlit skies, 
 And give a sumptuous afternoon to me. 
 In song and gladsome cries. 
THE PATH OF DREAMS 
 Blue gauze the empty distances enfold ; 
 The stream-fed glens lie bare in loveliness, 
 And waves of light along the paths of gold 
 The glens and hills caress. 
 In garish light the rustling, shimmering corn, 
 The trembling leaves, the passing winds caress, 
 And in the heart a subtle throb is born 
 Of mighty tenderness. 
 Vague yearnings, tenderness that prompt to tears 
 And fill the heart with mingled pain and bliss, 
 Come down to men through many thousand years, 
 On afternoons like this. 
 What is there in the vistas, song, and flower, 
 That prompt alike to happiness and tears. 
 Unites life's scattered visions in the hour 
 Of past and present years? 
 Is it the throb of life on soft hill slopes, 
 A thousand passions burned to fever heat 
 Spread out in shimmering glows that run to hopes. 
 For some fulfillment sweet? 
 Some half fulfillment yet of vanished gleams, 
 Of vanished promises when love's wild glow 
 Made fervid youth a tenement of dreams 
 Back in the long ago. 
 DAYBREAK 
 Awake! arise! Oh, men of my race, 
 I see our morning star, 
 And feel the dawn-breeze on my face 
 Creep inward, from afar.
 I feel the dawn, with soft-like tread, 
 Steal through our lingering night. 
 Aglow with flame our sky to spread 
 In floods of morning light. 
 Arise ! my men, be wide awake 
 To hear the bugle call, 
 For Negroes everywhere to break 
 The bands that bind us all. 
 Great Lincoln, now with glory graced,  
 All God-like with the pen. 
 Our chattel fetters broke, and placed 
 Us in the ranks of men. 
 But even he could not awake 
 The dead, nor make alive, 
 Nor change stern nature's laws which make 
 The fittest to survive. 
 Let every man his soul inure. 
 In noblest sacrifice, 
 And with a heart of oak endure, 
 Ignoble, arrant prejudice. 
 Endurance, love, will yet prevail 
 Against all laws of hate; 
 Such armaments can never fail 
 Our race its best estate. 
 Let none make common cause with sin, 
 Be that in honor bound, 
 For they who fight with God must win 
 On every battle ground. 
 Though wrongs there are, and wrongs have been, 
 And wrongs we still must face, 
 We have more friends than foes within 
 The Anglo-Saxon race. 
 In spite of all the babel cries, 
 Of those who rage and shout, 
 God's silent forces daily rise 
 To bring His will about. 
 Our portion is, and yet will be, 
 To drink a bitter cup 
 In many things, yet all must see 
 The race is moving up. 
 Oh! men of my race, awake! arise! 
 Our morning's in the air, 
 There's scarlet all along the skies, 
 Our day breaks everywhere. 
 TO HOLLYHOCKS 
 Gay hollyhocks with flaming bells 
 And waving plumes, as gently swells 
 The breeze upon the Summer air; 
 You bind me still with magic spells 
 When to the wind, in grave farewells, 
 You bow in all your graces fair. 
 You bring me back the childhood view, 
 Where arching skies and deepest blue 
 Stretch on in endless lengths above; 
 To see you so awakes anew 
 Long past emotions, from which grew 
 My wild and first heart-throbs of love. 
 There is in all your brilliant dyes. 
 Your gorgeousness and azure skies, 
 A joy like soothing summer rain; 
 Yet in the scene there vaguely lies 
 A something half akin to sighs. 
 Along the borderland of pain. 
 SPRING DAWN 
 There comes to my heart from regions remote 
 A wild desire for the hedge and the brush, 
 Whenever I hear the first wild note 
 Of the meadow lark and the hermit thrush. 
 The broken and upturned earth to the air, 
 By a million thrusting blades of Spring, 
 Sends out from the sod and everywhere 
 Its pungent aromas over everything. 
 Then it's Oh, for the hills, the dawn, and the dew, 
 The breath of the fields and the silent lake. 
 And watching the wings of light burst through 
 The scarlet blush of the new daybreak. 
 It is then, when the earth still nestles in sleep, 
 And the robes of light are scarce unfurled. 
 You can almost feel, in its mighty sweep. 
 The onward rush and roll of the world. 
 THE EPHEMERA 
 Creatures of gauze and velvet wings, 
 With life for one brief day, 
 Dancing and flitting where the breezes fling 
 The sweets of blooming May; 
 Skimming the stream where the wild thyme grows, 
 You dart with keen delight. 
 Only to die when the sweet wild rose 
 Gives perfume to the night. 
 Weary at last, when the day is done, 
 Of the breeze and clover's breath. 
 Folding your delicate wings with the sun, 
 You gently drop to death; 
 Glimmering wings and a few short hours 
 Were yours in sweet delight. 
 Living for a day in the world of flowers. 
 And then — everlasting night. 
 Creatures of gauze and velvet wings, 
 With a day of gleams and flowers, 
 Who knows — in the light of eternal things — 
 Your life is less than ours? 
 Weary at last, it is ours, like you, 
 When our brief day is done. 
 Folding our hands, to say adieu. 
 And pass with the setting sun. 
 THE HILLS OF SEWANEE 
 Sewanee Hills of dear delight, 
 Prompting my dreams that used to be, 
 I know you are waiting me still tonight 
 By the Unika Range of Tennessee. 
 The blinking stars in endless space, 
 The broad moonlight and silvery gleams, 
 Tonight caress your wind-swept face, 
 And fold you in a thousand dreams. 
 Your far outlines, less seen than felt, 
 Which wind with hill propensities. 
 In moonlight dreams I see you melt 
 Away in vague immensities. 
 And, far away, I still can feel 
 Your mystery that ever speaks 
 Of vanished things, as shadows steal 
 Across your breast and rugged peaks. 
 O, dear blue hills, that lie apart, 
 And wait so patiently down there. 
 Your peace takes hold upon my heart 
 And makes its burden less to bear. 
 HYDROMEL AND RUE 
 Lord, let me live to serve and make a loan 
 Of life and soul in love to my heart's own. 
 And what if they should never care or know 
 How dark sometimes and weary are the ways, 
 How piercing cold and pitiless the snow, 
 How desolate and lonely are the days 
 Which life for me holds sometimes in reserve? 
 And what if those I love esteem above 
 Me, others all untried and far less true. 
 And lightly barter off my wealth of love 
 For careless, strange, and passing comrads new? 
 Oh Lord, those, whom I love, I still would serve. 
 To be permitted, once in this short life. 
 To hold a little child close to my heart 
 In fatherhood, as mine, is worth all strife 
 Which circumstance and time to me impart. 
 To know the bliss of chaste and holy love. 
 To have one friend to even half divine 
 My hungry heart, is heaven from above 
 Come to this ever-longing soul of mine. 
 And so, dear Lord, I thank Thee for the cup 
 Of hydromel Thou givest me to sup, 
 Though rue and hyssop pass my lips and fill 
 My life with earthly sorrow, grief, and pam. 
 In faith my soul will rise to thank Thee still 
 For garish day, for guerdon and its gam. 
 And though through time insentient clay, the sward, 
 My erstwhile form may hold; for joy, for life, 
 For everlasting love, sunshine and rain. 
 My ardent heart above all earthly strife, 
 Unbound in space, soars up through joy and pain 
 Triumphantly, in thanks to Thee, dear Lord. 
 DOGWOOD BLOSSOMS 
 To dreamy languors and the violet mist 
 Of early Spring, the deep sequestered vale 
 Gives first her paling-blue Miamimist, 
 Where blithely pours the cuckoo's annual tale 
 Of Summer promises and tender green. 
 Of a new life and beauty yet unseen. 
 The forest trees have yet a sighing mouth, 
 Where dying winds of March their branches swing, 
 While upward from the dreamy sunny South, 
 A hand invisible leads on the Spring. 
 His rounds from bloom to bloom the bee begins 
 With flying song, and cowslip wine he sups. 
 Where to the warm and passing southern winds, 
 Azaleas gently swing their yellow cups. 
 Soon everywhere, with glory through and through, 
 The fields will spread with every brilliant hue. 
 But high o'er all the early floral train, 
 Where softness all the arching sky resumes. 
 The dogwood dancing to the winds' refrain. 
 In stainless glory spreads its snowy blooms. 
 THE APRIL OF ALABAMA 
 Fair Alabama, "Here we rest," thy name — 
 And in this stretch of oak and spotted ash, 
 Well said that long past swarthy tribe who came 
 Here, "Alabama," in these glamour wilds. 
 To-day thy April woods have had for me 
 A thousand charms, elusive loveliness, 
 That melt in shimmering views which flash 
 From leaves and buds in half-grown daintiness. 
 From every tree and living thing there smiles 
 A touch of Summer's glory yet to be. 
 Already overhead the sky resumes 
 Its Summer softness, and a hand of light 
 All through the woods has beckoned with its blooms 
 Of honeysuckle wild and dogwood white 
 As bridal robes. 
 With bashful azure eyes 
 All full of dew-born, laughing, falling tears, 
 Th^ violets more blue than summer skies 
 Are rioting in vagrancy around 
 Beneath old oaks, old pines, and sending out 
 Like prodigals their sweets to spicy airs. 
 And, as to-day, this loveliness for years 
 Unknown has come and gone. To-day it wears 
 Its pageantry of youth with sylvan sound 
 Of many forest tribes which fairly shout 
 Their ecstacies. But soon with Summer smiles 
 Will such a gorgeousness of flaming hues 
 Bedeck these Alabama glamour wilds 
 As ever burst to life by rain and dews. 
 THE BRIDE OF NITTA YUMA. 
 Softly the cool breath of the early morning, 
 Swamp-scented air, fragrant with deep lagoons 
 And water lilies, stole on through the fields 
 Of cotton, whispering a sighing song. 
 'Twas Sunday morning then, and everywhere 
 The May dew rolled away in diadems. 
 Another day was born with floods of light; 
 The grass with newer green ail wet with dew- 
 Gave welcoming. And rose hues spent with yesterday 
 Found blushes still, and sent out night-born sweets 
 To mingle with a thousand other spicy 
 Airs, and perfumes of the jessamine. 
 And wald aromas of the Summer air. 
 And murmured low the sycamore overhead 
 With whisperings of passing Summer winds. 
 The dapple sunshine gleamed and kissed their leaves, 
 And golden gleams were on the fields. Rich were 
 The blackbird's notes, and joyous sounds from all 
 The feathered tribes. In lazy lengths the bayou went 
 With stretches on, and murmuring low songs 
 Like those of love. There floated far and wide 
 The queenly water lilies — white, perfuming 
 All the Sunday air. 
 And, like a dove 
 Of peace, fair Nitta Yuma sat amid 
 Her spreading figs and rich magnolia blooms, 
 In rest; for there was come the hallowed day, 
 The Sabbath of the Lord. The church bell pealed 
 To far plantations for her worshippers. 
 They came in straggling bands through cotton fields 
 And shady lanes. Upon their faces, young 
 And old, was seen a keen expectancy. 
 And eagerness. It was the wedding day 
 Of sweet Alicia Bell, the fairest maid, 
 And most beloved of all the country side. ^ 
 And when the preacher called the happy pair 
 To stand and take their vows, no costly veil 
 Resplendent in transparency enwrapped 
 The dusky bride, nor great Cathedral gleamed 
 In rich mosaics, nor stately pillars carved, 
 To mark the elegance and luxury 
 Where come the great, the lordly, and the rich 
 To take their marriage vows. But love was there 
 And hope, and youth, to guide and lead them forth 
 To their new world. And to his humble home. 
 With whitewashed walls, the bridegroom led his bride. 
 The wedding feast of simple fare was theirs 
 Alone. Through all the golden afternoon 
 They took their bridal tour, still hand in hand. 
 Love ever leading on, through cotton fields. 
 Along the bayou's side, until their feet 
 Led to the forest old, where man first loved, 
 First wooed, first won a bride and made a home. 
 Gently the spirit of the ancient forest 
 Wove her magic spell around them, till, 
 As one, they had no further need of speech. 
 They were no longer twain, and on, as one. 
 Slowly they walked through the fragrant and green woods — 
 Woods sun-stained, and peaceful, where all nature 
 Fused her mellow beauty into one 
 Harmonious whole. Softened and blended colors 
 Gleamed in vistas and in open glades; 
 Delicious murmurs, inarticulate, 
 Soothing all the senses, crept in quiet, 
 Even undertones all through the forest, 
 Whispering primeval memories. 
 Primeval mysteries of ages past. 
 Once more the ancient forest, dim and silent, 
 Throbbed with energy and unseen life. 
 Where sunshine fell among the moist ferns, 
 Gleamed on silent pools and altars lost. 
 Again the musty fragrance of the forest mould 
 Greeted the nostrils of fauns and dryads 
 Unseen, and all the fairy forest lived 
 Once more, commingling with their murmurings 
 The past and present. Here primordial love 
 Walked hand in hand through Paradise anew. 
 A SEPTEMBER NIGHT 
 The full September moon sheds floods of light, 
 And all the bayou's face is gemmed with stars, 
 Save where are dropped fantastic shadows down 
 From sycamore and moss-hung cypress trees. 
 With slumberous sound the waters half asleep 
 Creep on and on their way, 'twixt rankish reeds, 
 Through marsh and lowlands stretching to the Gulf. 
 Begirt with cotton fields, Anguilla sits 
 Half bird-like, dreaming on her Summer nest. 
 Amid her spreading figs and roses, still 
 In bloom with all their Spring and Summer hues, 
 Pomegranates hang with dapple cheeks full ripe. 
 And over all the town a dreamy haze 
 Drops down. The great plantations, stretching far 
 Away, are plains of cotton, downy white. 
 O, glorious is this night of joyous sounds; 
 Too full for sleep. Aromas wild and sweet, 
 From muscadine, late blooming jessamine. 
 And roses, all the heavy air suffuse. 
 Faint bellows from the alligators come 
 From swamps afar, where sluggish lagoons give 
 To them a peaceful home. The katydids 
 Make ceaseless cries. Ten thousand insects' wings 
 Stir in the moonlight haze and joyous shouts 
 Of Negro song and mirth awake hard by 
 The cabin dance. O, glorious is this night! 
 The Summer sweetness fills my heart with songs, 
 I can not sing, with loves I can not speak. 
 THE HARVEST MOON 
 The dark magnolia leaves and spreading fig 
 With green luxuriant beauty all their own, 
 Stirless, hang heavy-coated with the dew, 
 Which swift and iridescent gleams shoot through 
 As if a thousand brilliant diamonds shone. 
 Afloat the lagoon, water-lilies white 
 In sweets with muscadines perfume the night. 
 A song bird restless chants a fleeting lay; 
 Asleep on all the swamp and bayou lies 
 A peaceful, blissful moonlight, mystic haze, 
 A dreaminess o'er all the landscape plays. 
 While lake and lagoon mirror all the skies. 
 There is a glory doomed to pass too soon. 
 That lies subdued beneath the harvest moon. 
 THE SUN WENT DOWN IN BEAUTY 
 The sun went down In beauty 
 Beyond the Mississippi side, 
 As I stood on the banks of the river 
 And watched its waters gHde; 
 Its swelHng currents resembling 
 The longing restless soul, 
 Surging, swelling, and pursuing 
 Its ever receding goal. 
 The sun went down in beauty. 
 But the restless tide flowed on. 
 And the phantom of absent loved ones 
 Danced on the waves and were gone ; 
 Fleeting phantoms of loved ones, 
 Their faces jubilant with glee. 
 In the spray seemed to rise and beckon, 
 And then rush on to the sea. 
 The sun went down in beauty. 
 While I stood musing alone, 
 Stood watching the rushing river 
 And heard its restless moan; 
 Longings, vague, intenable. 
 So far from speech apart. 
 Like the endless rush of the river, 
 Went surging through my heart. 
 The sun went down in beauty, 
 Peacefully sank to rest, 
 Leaving its golden reflection 
 On the great Mississippi's breast; 
 Gleaming on the turbulent river, 
 In the coming gray twilight, 
 Soothing its restless surging, 
 And kissing its waters goodnight. 
 LOVE IS A FLAME 
 Love is a flame that burns with sacred fire, 
 And fills the being up with sweet desire; 
 Yet, once the altar feels love's fiery breath. 
 The heart must be a crucible till death. 
 Say love is life ; and say it not amiss. 
 That love is but a synonym for bliss. 
 Say what you will of love, in what refrain. 
 But knows the heart, 'tis but a word for pain. 
 THE FEET OF JUDAS 
 Christ washed the feet of Judas ! 
 The dark and evil passions of his soul, 
 His secret plot, and sordidness complete, 
 His hate, his purposing, Christ knew the whole, 
 And still in love he stooped and washed his feet. 
 Christ washed the feet of Judas ! 
 Yet ail his lurking sin was bare to him. 
 His bargain with the priest, and more than this, 
 In Olivet, beneath the moonlight dim, 
 Aforehand knew and felt his treacherous kiss. 
 Christ washed the feet of Judas! 
 And so ineffable his love 'twas meet. 
 That pity fill his great forgiving heart. 
 And tenderly to wash the traitor's feet, 
 Who in his Lord had basely sold his part. 
 Christ washed the feet of Judas! 
 And thus a girded servant, self-abased. 
 Taught that no wrong this side the gate of heaven 
 Was ever too great to wholly be effaced. 
 And though unasked, in spirit be forgiven. 
 And so if we have ever felt the wrong 
 Of trampled rights, of caste, it matters not, 
 What e'er the soul has felt or suffered long. 
 Oh, heart! this one thing should not be forgot: 
 Christ washed the feet of Judas. 
 TO LOCHIEL 
 Dear little babe, of all born things alive, 
 Most helpless thou — of life a slender thread. 
 Can such as thee so rough a sea survive, 
 And come at last the way all feet must tread? 
 Yea ! by the God whom I adore above, 
 If I could fix thy destiny by choice 
 Thou wouldst be safe, my little love. 
 'Tis Love ineffable I wrap thee in 
 To pitiless pain, and ache, and storm, and blast, 
 I'd bare my soul to save thy feet from sin. 
 And bring thee safely home, Lochiel, at last. 
 But, in thy chancing boon of birth, thy whole 
 And everlasting destiny of life 
 Lies in thy self-directing souL 
 TO THEODORE 
 Such are the little memories of you; 
 They come and go, return and He apart 
 From all main things of life ; yet more than they, 
 With noiseless feet, they come and grip the heart. 
 Gay laughter leading quick and stormy tears, 
 Then smiles again and pulse of flying feet. 
 In breathless chase of fleeting gossamers, 
 Are memories so dear, so bitter-sweet. 
 No more are echoes of your flying feet. 
 Hard by, where Pike's Peak rears its head in state, 
 The erstwhile rushing feet, with halting steps, 
 For health's return in Denver watch and wait. 
 But love and memories of noiseless tread, 
 Where angels hovered once, all shining fair, 
 To tuck you in your little trundle bed. 
 Kneel nightly now in agony of prayer. 
 Feb. 22, 1916. 
 IN THE HEART OF A ROSE 
 I will hide my soul and its mighty love 
 In the bosom of this rose, 
 And its dispensing breath will take 
 My love wherever it goes. 
 And perhaps she'll pluck this very rosCi 
 And, quick as blushes start, 
 Will breathe my hidden secret in 
 Her unsuspecting heart. 
 And there I will live in her embrace 
 And the realm of sweetness there, 
 Enamored with an ecstasy 
 Of bliss beyond compare. 
 A JANUARY DANDELION 
 All Nashville is a-chill ! And everywhere, 
 As wind-swept sands upon the deserts blow, 
 There is, each moment, sifted through the air 
 A powered blast of January snow. 
 O thoughtless dandelion ! to be misled 
 By a few warm days to leave thy natural bed 
 Was folly growth and blooming over soon. 
 And yet, thou blasted, yellow-coated gem! 
 Full many hearts have but a common boon 
 With thee, now freezing on thy slender stem. 
 When once the heart-blooms by love's fervid breath 
 Is left, and chilling snow is sifted in. 
 It still may beat, but there is blast and death 
 To all that blooming Hfe that might have been. 
 A BELATED ORIOLE 
 Gay little songster of the Spring, 
 This is an evil hour, 
 For one so light of heart and win^ 
 To face the storms that lower. 
 December winds blow on the lea 
 A chill that threatens harm. 
 With not a leaf on bush or tree 
 To shield thee from the storm. 
 Why hast thou lingered here so late 
 To face the storms that rise, 
 When all thy kind, and yellow mate. 
 Have sought for southern skies? 
 Hast thou, like me, some fortune ill 
 To bind thee to this spot? 
 Made to endure, against thy will, 
 A melancholy lot? 
 Chill is the air with windy sighs, 
 A prophecy that blows, 
 Of cold and inhospitable skies. 
 Of bitter frost and snows. 
 But there is One whose power it is 
 To temper blast and storm, 
 And love to give a bird is His, 
 And keep it safe from harm. 
 To Him thy helplessness will plead, 
 To Him I lift a prayer. 
 For we alike have common need 
 Of His great love and care. 
 ETERNITY 
 Rock me to sleep, ye waves, and drift my boat, 
 With undulations soft, far out to sea; 
 Perchance, where sky and wave wear one blue coat, 
 My heart shall find some hidden rest remote. 
 My spirit swoons, and all my senses cry 
 For ocean's breast and covering of the sky. 
 Rock me to sleep, ye waves, and, outward bound, 
 Just let me drift far out from toil and care, 
 Where lapping of the waves shall be the sound 
 Which, mingled with the winds that gently bear 
 Me on between a peaceful sea and sky, 
 To make my soothing, slumberous lullaby. 
 Thus drifting on and on upon thy breast. 
 My heart shall go to sleep and rest, and rest. 
 A PSYCHE OF SPRING 
 Thou gaily painted butterfly, exquisite thing, 
 A child of light and blending rainbow hues, 
 In loveliness a Psyche of the Spring, 
 Companion for the rose and diamond dews ; 
 'Tis thine, in sportive joy, from hour to hour, 
 To ride the breeze from flower to flower. 
 But thou wast once a worm of hueless dye 
 Now, seeing thee, gay thing, afloat in bliss, 
 I take new hope in thoughts of bye and bye, 
 When T, as thou, have shed my chrysalis. 
 I dream now of eternal springs of light 
 In which, as thou, I too may have my flight. 
 MAY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND 
 Embodiment of all the beautiful 
 That crowns the year, O May! is come with thee. 
 For miles and miles along the rugged hills, 
 Where in and out the Cumberland must wind, 
 And Spring her first response of green doth find, 
 A rapt'rous beauty all the valley fills. 
 The yellow sun with Summer at his heels, 
 Betokeneth the time about to be. 
 Siestas, days and nights alive with wings, 
 The stirring of a miUion living things. 
 The month is full of roses, perfumed air. 
 And crooning bees upon the clover's breast, 
 The morning woodlands ring with music sweet; 
 The zephyrs whisper to the corn, 
 And echo back the hills the dinner horn. 
 But all in tune and harmony complete. 
 In blissful self-abandonment awhile, 
 Here on thy lap, sweet May, O! let me rest, 
 And dream, and dream, till, lulled by sight and sound, 
 In unison to all the earth around. 
 THE SECRET 
 Go, whisper to her gentle winds, 
 While you are passing by, 
 The mighty secret of my heart, 
 The burden of my sigh. 
 Take to her from this blushing rose 
 Such sweets of scented air 
 As are befitting for a queen, 
 And one divinely fair. 
 And from this lily of the vale 
 Take her, who is to me, 
 The emblem of all that is good, 
 And sweetest purity. 
 The violets of azure eyes, 
 Which ever sweets impart. 
 Take her their gentle modesty, 
 So like her guileless heart. 
 Take all the sweets which you can find 
 Along your airy way. 
 To her whose face and daily life 
 Are like the month of May. 
 Blow softly on her lovely brow. 
 And give her lips a kiss. 
 The thing were I to do, O winds! 
 Would count a wonderous bliss. 
 She does not know my secret flame, 
 But what is that to you 
 Oh, winds? but take her from my heart 
 Its mighty love and true. 
 A SERENADE 
 Dear heart, I would that thou couldst know 
 How, like the burning glow of Mars, 
 My love here keeps a watch below 
 Thy window and the midnight stars. 
 How sweet the breath of night is now, 
 Of sweets the rose and jessamine keep; 
 Go, winds, with these and kiss her brow, 
 And bear my love to her in sleep. 
 Oh, such a love! that loves her so. 
 With such a little space apart. 
 Should through yon open casement go, 
 And gentl}^ stir her dreaming heart. 
 Dear heart, sleep on without a fear. 
 If all unconsciously to thee. 
 My love must watch, to watch so near, 
 Makes even that a bliss to me. 
 A BUTTERFLY IN CHURCH. 
 What dost thou here, thou shining, sinless thing, 
 With many colored hues and shapely wing? 
 Why quit the open field and Summer air 
 To flutter here? Thou hast no need of prayer. 
 'Tis mete that we, who this great structure built. 
 Should come to be redeemed and washed from guilt, 
 For we this gilded edifice within 
 Are come, with erring hearts and stains of sin. 
 But thou art free from guilt as God on high; 
 Go, seek the blooming waste and open sky. 
 And leave us here our secret woes to bear, 
 Confessionals and agonies of prayer. 
 AS SIFTED WHEAT 
 sift me, Lord, and make me 
 Clean as sifted wheat ; 
 My soul, an empty vessel, bring 
 To my Redeemer's feet. 
 However sinful I have been or be. 
 Thou knowest, Lord, that I love thee. 
 1 am so closely hedged about. 
 Oh, Christ! as thou hast been; 
 My soul, hemmed in with flesh, 
 Is so in love with sin. 
 Sin stained am I, but sift me. Lord, complete, 
 And make me clean as sifted wheat. 
 A NEW YEAR'S GREETING TO A 
 COLLEGE SENIOR 
 Soft winds and a moving tide 
 May bear you on, I pray, 
 With the love of God to guide 
 Through the year to your B. A. 
 On the shores of heavenly grace, 
 Or the crest of the ocean's swell, 
 May the smile of the Father's face 
 Be the sign that all is well. 
 In storms, whenever they rise, 
 Cling close to the pilot of prayer, 
 Keep faith under blackest of skies 
 That the love of God is there. 
 ESTRANGED 
 An Autumn sky, a pleasant weather; 
 The asters blossom by the way; 
 We two between them walk together, 
 And watch the ships pass on the bay. 
 His Summer song yet to the clover, 
 The hovering bee still murmurs there, 
 But there's that tells that Summer's over 
 In this sweet, dreamy. Autumn air. 
 When it w^as May and lovely weather, 
 And ships went sailing to the west. 
 We walked this path, we two together. 
 With happy throbs of heart and breast. 
 The Spring was young and hope was growing, 
 And love went idling on the sand. 
 And there was blissful overflowing 
 Of heart in touch of lip and hand. 
 And yet the bee hums to the clover 
 Soft, all the dreamy hours long. 
 But there's that tells that Summer's over 
 In all his drowsy, flying song. 
 An Autumn sky, a pleasant weather, 
 But all the Summer glow is changed 
 Here, where in love we walked together, 
 Before we two were so estranged. 
 A DECORATION DAY 
 The reign of death was there, 
 Where swept the Winter winds with 
 pipes and moans, 
 And, stretched in silence bare, 
 A colonnade of gray sepulchral stones. 
 But then it was in May, 
 And all the fields were bright and gay 
 with tune 
 That Decoration Day, 
 And blossoms wore their hues and breath 
 of June. 
 A motley crowd that came, 
 But who more fit than they that once 
 were slaves. 
 Despised, unknown to fame. 
 With love should decorate the 
 soldiers' graves? 
 Black feet trod cheerily 
 From out the town in crowds or 
 straggling bands. 
 And flowers waved and flaunted merrily 
 From little Negro hands. 
 And far, far away 
 From home and love, deep in a silent bed, 
 Beneath the sky of May, 
 Was sleeping there, in solitude, the dead. 
 But for the hearts that day 
 Who in the distant North was sore and sighed, 
 Black hands, with sweets of May, 
 Made green the graves of those who for them died. 
 JUNE 
 The June has come with all its brilliant dyes, 
 Its honeyed breath, its balmy gusts and sighs. 
 In fields and stretching uplands, glade and glen, 
 And by the high and lowly haunts of men. 
 With all-surpassing glory bloom the flowers. 
 And come are sun-lit skies and dreamy hours. 
 The morning earth is all begemmed with dew, 
 The toiling bee, the blissful hours through, 
 Hums softly on his self-beguiling tune. 
 While gathers he the sweetest sweets of June. 
 Low murmuring, the crystal brooklet leads 
 Its way through fields and lane and emerald meads. 
 The clover fields are red and sweetly scent 
 The pasture lands, where browse the kine content. 
 The corn is swayed with breezes passing by, 
 And everywhere the bloom is on the rye. 
 Already on the bearded wheat is seen 
 The gold which tempts the farmer's sickle keen, 
 And I can almost see the gleaming blade 
 By which the golden grain is lowly laid. 
 And hear the singing scythe and tramp of feet, 
 And s^e the cone-shaped shocks of gathered wheat. 
 All shimmering the landscapes far and wide 
 Bespeak fair promise for the harvest-tide. 
 The June has come with Summer skies and glow, 
 Reflecting bUss and Junes of long ago- 
 Bare feet, and careless roving bands ot boys 
 That haunted lake and stream in halcyon joys, 
 The bow and arrow, hunting ground and snares, 
 The sudden flight of quails and skulkmg hares, 
 The wild and joyous shouts along the glen 
 Come back in all the month of June agam. 
 Then other days and solitary dreams. 
 Are come again with flash of flaming gleams 
 Where red birds shot across the openmg glades, 
 In quest of deeper thickets, deeper shades 
 The soft sunshine comes down aslant the hiUs, 
 With perfume sweet the honeysuckle fills, 
 The Summer atmosphere for mfles around 
 And all the groves and fields are sweet with sound. 
 Soft tinkling bells of flocks and browsmg herds, 
 The rippling streams and restless twittermg birds. 
 Unite with children's voices in their shout 
 Of mirth and joy on all the sward about. 
 A nameless charm, a bliss, a merry tune 
 Abideth in the country lap of June. 
 While hills, and woods, and vale, and grassy slope, 
 Are teeming everywhere with life and hope 
 The brook's low murmuring the mormng through. 
 Is still a lullaby, and love is true. 
 In earth, and sky, and air, in dale and glen, 
 For all the changing, faithless sons of men. 
 The June has come with all its brflliant dyes, 
 Its honied breath, its balmy gusts and sighs. 
 HEART YEARNINGS 
 Oh ! for the welcome breath of country air, 
 With Summer skies and flowers, 
 To shout and feel once more the halcyon 
 Of gayer boyhood hours. 
 I think the sight of fields and shady lanes 
 Would ease my heart of pains. 
 To cool once more my thirst, where bubbled up 
 The waters of a spring, 
 Where I have seen the golden daffodils 
 And lillies flourishing. 
 My fevered heart would more than half forget 
 Its sighs, and vain regret. 
 Far, far away, from early scenes am I ; 
 And, too, my youth has fled; 
 For me a stranger's land, a stranger's sky. 
 That arches overhead. 
 For scenes and joys that now have passed me by, 
 I can but give a sigh. 
 A FAITHLESS LOVE 
 The lovely May has come at last, 
 With songs and gleaming dews, 
 And apple blossoms bursting out 
 With evanescent hues. 
 A newer life, a newer charm, 
 Is bursting every hour. 
 With pledge and faithful promises, 
 From leaf and bud and flower. 
 And hope is growing on the hill. 
 And blooming in the vale, 
 And comes new vigor and new life 
 On every passing gale. 
 But O, my heart! my heart of hearts! 
 What hope is there for me? 
 For what was hope and what was joy. 
 For me have ceased to be. 
 The woodlark's tender w^arbling lay. 
 Which flows with melting art, 
 Is but a trembling song of love 
 That serves to break my heart. 
 Gay flowers burst on every side, 
 The fairest of the fair, 
 But what are these to any heart 
 That's breaking with despair? 
 O May! my heart had found a rose 
 As lovely as the morn, 
 Which charmed awhile, then faithless went, 
 But left with me its thorn. 
 THE BRIDAL WREATH'S LAMENT 
 O! woe, ah! bitter woe for us, 
 Who did the fooHsh thing. 
 To trust our folded leaves and buds 
 To the first warm sun of Spring. 
 Up from the lagoons of the South, 
 From lake and flowers about, 
 Came soft, deceitful, sighing winds 
 And gently called us out. 
 They whispered strange Floridian tales, 
 Of bayous and the brake. 
 Of Spring's aroma and the rose. 
 And bade us to awake. 
 The sun, so old of many Springs, 
 Looked down on us and smiled. 
 And all our foolish swelling buds 
 To leaf and flower beguiled. 
 We rivaled the Japonicas 
 Which budded half in doubt. 
 But reassured by southern winds, 
 Fast sought to beat us out. 
 And O ! we spread our leaves and buds 
 Up to the open sky, 
 And looked with condescension on 
 Our lagging neighbors by. 
 Bedecked in all our finery, 
 And blind with foolish pride, 
 We laughed unconscious of our doom, 
 And of our woe betide. 
 But swift and stealthily as comes 
 A lurking foe at night, 
 Without a warning note swept down 
 A storm with bitter blight. 
 Now all the highway and the plain 
 Lie covered up with snow. 
 The sun is hid and leaden clouds. 
 Look down on all below. 
 Deceitful zephyrs of the south. 
 Where are your kisses now? 
 The snowflakes make our winding sheet, 
 And death is on our brow. 
 But soon the true warm Spring will come, 
 And violets in their beds 
 Will bloom: And flauntingly will 
 Lift the tulips up their heads. 
 The gladsome Summer-time will come, 
 The Summer winds will sigh, 
 A thousand brilliant flowers will bloom 
 Beneath a Summer sky. 
 But we, O vain and foolish buds ! 
 Who did the foolish thing, 
 To trust our folded leaves and flowers 
 To the first warm sun of Spring, 
 So premature must pass away 
 To nothingness for time and aye. 
 SUSTAINING HOPE 
 Farewell, Dearest and Best! 
 What matters it whether the name be Dove, 
 Dear-heart, and all sweet words at love's behest. 
 Since none can voice my love? 
 To stay is past my power ; 
 Oh, love, my own Dear-heart, farewell, good-bye! 
 For thee I'll breathe through every passing hour 
 A fond and secret sigh. 
 But, Dear, though it be long. 
 This hope 'mid distant scenes and fellow-men 
 Will lead me on, in solitude or throng. 
 That we shall meet again. 
 THE WOODS OF OCTOBER 
 The last sweet blush of Summer in her glory 
 Still lingers in October woods and skies, 
 But changed in forest, hills, and mountains hoary, 
 From green into a thousand brilliant dyes. 
 The cloudless skies a restful peace betoken, 
 The Indian Summer broodeth over all, 
 In earth and everywhere is plainly spoken 
 A placidness which only comes with Fall. 
 In fields, where to the breeze was lately swaying 
 The wheat in all its golden beauty seen, 
 Are flocks and herds of lazy cattle straying. 
 And feeding on a second growth of green. 
 A bee is seen still out in hope of finding 
 A blossom in the second growth of clover. 
 But nature's law, too, on the bee is binding. 
 His harvesting will also soon be over. 
 A few more days of Autumn's hazy gleaming. 
 And all October woods, to-day so fair, 
 The very imagery of death in seeming 
 Will stand, dismantled, naked, bare. 
 O ! who would think that all this beauty, painted 
 Upon these leaves in colors clear 
 In every brilliant hue, with death is tainted, 
 But for the dying lesson year by year? 
 That lesson let me learn to-day in earnest, 
 Which thou dost teach in every hue and dye; 
 Who knows but when thy glory here returnest, 
 Within the silent grave my head shall lie? 
 Farewell, October woods — soon bleak December 
 Will all the forest wrap in spotless snow, 
 But I, forgetting not, shall still remember 
 Thy glory, which to-day delights me so. 
 YOUTHFUL DELUSIONS 
 And where now, restless, wilt thou roam, 
 Thou young, uneaseful heart? 
 'Tis better far to stay at home, 
 So young a stripHng as thou art. 
 And thinkest thou to go 
 Abroad to taste the sweets of Ufe, 
 And miss its lurking woe? 
 Yea, doubtless thou wouldst find a bliss 
 Of honey sweet, awhile. 
 And many a love-born, smothered kiss, 
 Unknown to thee erstwhile. 
 And of a thousand hues 
 Would blossoms give the morning sweets 
 With honey-dabbled dews. 
 And, all-believing heart and young. 
 Thou wouldst unfold thy best 
 To faith, and laugh till thou wert stung 
 With poison in thy breast.^ 
 Then who would be thee nigh. 
 So far from home, to heal thy pain 
 And soothe thy bitter cry? 
 'Tis best, by far, to stay at home, 
 Dear, over- trusting heart; 
 None but a prodigal may roam 
 So far from love apart. 
 Doubt not, abide thy day, 
 And what is best for thee to have 
 In time will come thy way. 
 THE MARCH'S PROMISE 
 When gray clouds break on southern skies 
 And winds of March begin to blow, 
 Our fancies run to Summer sighs, 
 That whisper and delight us so. 
 For in this stormy month of winds 
 The first new pulse of life is felt, 
 When Spring with all her sweets begins 
 Where Winter's ice and snow have dwelt. 
 The bluebird carols out his note, 
 A prelude to the country 'round 
 Of chimes, a few more days remote, 
 To which the forest will resound. 
 The plowman's song, the forest chime. 
 The upturned sod, the country scene, 
 Bespeak a resurrection time 
 In air, sky, and sprouting green. 
 O, blessed hope of life anew! 
 That comes from death when Spring begins ; 
 Life after death, a promise true. 
 Is brought in March's stormy winds. 
 A MEADOW-LAND. 
 Delight of keen delights in Summer hours, 
 Is this long meadowy scene, 
 All rioting in festival of flowers 
 And pageantry of green. 
 With smiling skies above and Summer blue, 
 With ancient fields below, yet ever new. 
 Thou mindest me of other scenes and days, 
 In sunnier climes than thine. 
 Of mocking birds and ever piping lays, 
 Of figs and muscadine. 
 Of dreamy afternoons and dreamy love 
 In silent bliss, with southern skies above. 
 Dear meadow-lands, it makes me sigh to know 
 That this fair scene must die, 
 And sleep long months beneath the frost and snow, 
 And inhospitable sky ; 
 And yet why should I sigh and yield to pain, 
 Since all thy loveliness will bloom again? 
 For long before the red men trod thy soil. 
 Or white men came to till 
 Thy blooming waste, and crown with patient toil 
 Surrounding vale and hill, 
 All rioting with gleeful, vagrant flowers 
 Wert thou in bloom, through long and sunny hours. 
 'Tis mine to lie beneath a changeless snow, 
 How sad to me the truth, 
 But thine to sleep awhile, and wake to know 
 A gay immortal youth. 
 For thou, when I back to the dust have gone, 
 With festive face, will still be smiling on. 
 IN SUMMER 
 The Summer shimmering to-day 
 Puts on the earth a rune, 
 Which blends in magic waves of light. 
 Beneath the sky of June. 
 Along the pavements of the street. 
 And in the crowded mart. 
 There is a joy of Summer-time, 
 A comforting of heart. 
 To-day one hardly can believe. 
 Along these pavements old. 
 That March held such an icy sway 
 Of bitterness and cold. 
 The little gamin of the street. 
 Full keeping with the boy, 
 Forgetting all his Winter woes, 
 Is hallooing for joy. 
 And I go back to youth again, 
 And get myself away, 
 To where the country fields are in 
 The green and blue of May. 
 And on I sweetly glide with them. 
 With changing song and tune. 
 With bursting buds and brilliant dyes, 
 That line the lap of June. 
 The morning trembles with its throbs 
 Of ever-gushing notes. 
 Which pour with shuddering sweetness from 
 A thousand feathered throats. 
 'Tis true the shadows of four walls 
 Are ever on me cast. 
 But they have a transparency 
 To me of a sweet past. 
 IN MEMORY OF KATIE REYNOLDS, DYING. 
 O Death! 
 If thou hath aught of tenderness, 
 Be kindly in thy touch 
 Of her whose fragile slenderness 
 Was overburdened much 
 With life. And let her seem to go to sleep. 
 As often does a tired child, when it has grown 
 Too tired to longer weep. 
 A rose but half in bloom- 
 She is too young and beautiful to die. 
 But yet, if she must go. 
 Let her go out as goes a sigh 
 From tired life and woe. 
 And let her keep, in death's brief space 
 This side the grave, the dusky beauty still 
 Belonging to her face. 
 She must have been 
 Of those upon the trembling lyre 
 Of whom the poets sung; 
 'Whom the gods love" and desire 
 Fade and "die young." 
 Her life so loved on earth was brief. 
 But yet withal so beautiful there is no cause, 
 But in our loss, for grief. 
 LINES TO MOUNT GLEN 
 In this soft air perfumed with blooming May, 
 Stretched at thy feet on the green grass, Old Glen, 
 It is a joy unspeakable to me 
 To see again thy face and friendly crags. 
 My childhood friend, then height of heights to me, 
 I am come home to worship thee once more, 
 And feel that bliss in indolent repose 
 Of those long past delightful afternoons. 
 When first you smiled on me and gave to my 
 Imaginings such imagery, when I 
 Would lie down at thy base as I 
 Do now. My feet have wandered far since then. 
 And over heights with prouder heads than thine. 
 Such as would name thy majesty with hills. 
 But I, Old Glen, my early mountain friend. 
 Am come with loyalty and heart still true 
 As thy bald crags are to their kindred skijs. 
 My own Olympus yet and pride thou art, 
 With thy Thessalian gates of clouds 
 Which hide the great Olympian Hall, 
 Where Hebe still sweet nectar pours 
 Out to the gods. And murmurs sweet and low, 
 Of melting cadences, Apollo from 
 His magic lyre sends gently wandering 
 In soft succeeding measures, yet in air 
 To me. 
 And yet, Old Glen, 
 A stranger at thy base I lie to-day 
 To all but thee, save this soft yielding grass 
 And blooming waste, thy pageantry of flowers. 
 All these, with yon bald eagle circling in 
 The upper air with keen descrying for 
 Some timorous, skulking hare, are but old friends 
 Who laughed and played with me in childhood hours 
 Full many a Summer day, and told me tales 
 Of fairy lore. With such immortal friends 
 To welcome me again, what care I then 
 For yon rude plowman's stare and taking me 
 For some trespassing rake? This broad domain 
 Of circling hills and intervening vales 
 Is thine by ancient rights to shelter me, 
 And take me in thy lap when I have come. 
 With love, to Vv^orship thee. Before Rome was. 
 Or Greece had sprung with poetry and art. 
 Thy majesty with impartiaUty 
 Was here. The first soft tread of moccasin 
 On Indian feet, in ages none can tell. 
 That bent this yielding grass was thine to hear. 
 And all the sons of men who since have brought 
 Their pulsing hearts to thee with loves, with aches, 
 With tragedies, with childhood innocence. 
 Have had thy welcoming. To thee no race 
 May come with arrogance and claim first right 
 To thy magnificence, and mighty heart. 
 And thy ennobling grace that touches every 
 Soul who may commune with thee. 
 And so 
 It was Old Glen we came at first to love 
 In this soft scented air now long ago, 
 When first I brought my youthful heart to thee, 
 All pure with pulsing blood still hot 
 In its descent of years in tropic suns 
 And sands of Africa, to be caressed 
 By thee. And to your lofty heights you bore 
 Me up to see the boundless world beyond, 
 Which nothing then to my young innocence 
 Had aught of evil or deceptive paths. 
 With maddening haste I quit thy friendly side 
 To mix with men. And then as some young bison 
 Of the plain, which breathes the morning air 
 And restless snorts with mad excess of life, 
 And rushes heedless on in hot pursuit 
 Of what it does not know: So I, Old Glen, 
 As heedlessly went out from thee to meet 
 With buffeting, with hates, and selfishness, 
 And scorn. At first I stood abashed, disarmed 
 Of faith. Too soon I learned the ways of men, 
 Forgetting much I wish I had retained 
 Of once a better life. And in the fret 
 And fever of the endless strife for gain 
 I often sigh for thee, my native peaks. 
 And for that early life for me now past 
 Forevermore. 
 But for one day, my early friend, 
 I am come back to thee again, to feel 
 Thy gentle grace so indefinable, 
 So subtle is thy touch, yet to the heart 
 A never-failing gift to all who come 
 To thee. And so it is, Old Glen, that I am come, 
 But not with all-believing innocence 
 As in those unsuspecting days of yore. 
 And O! Mount Glen, sin-stained my burning heart 
 With shame lifts up its face to thine, but with 
 A love as changeless as thy ancient crags 
 Does it still beat for thee. And I rejoice 
 To feel thy mighty heart here solace mine. 
 For when the day leads in the early dawn 
 With blushing rosy light and caroling 
 Of larks; and sleepy flowers half unclosed. 
 All wet with dew, unfold their buds and leaves, 
 There is enchantment in this lovely spot 
 Beyond, by far, all mortal utterances. 
 To come here then and lie down on thy side, 
 As I do now, and see the butterflies 
 Bobbing from flower to flower, and hear 
 The restless songs of birds as they in joy 
 Flit carelessly from bush and tree, is all 
 The bliss my heart could ask. Here I could lie 
 In such repose and let a lifetime pass. 
 And here, Old Glen, could I forget the fret 
 Of life and selfishness of men, and see 
 The face of him who is all beautiful. 
 And here in this perfume of May, and bloom 
 Luxuriant, and friendly rioting 
 Of green in all this blooming Vv^aste, is seen 
 A glimpse of that which He, the Lord of all, 
 Intended there should be with things and men 
 In all this earth, a thing which yet will be, 
 A universal brotherhood. 
 The legend of Tannhauser and Elizabeth lends itself 
 readily to a story more human than any other of the 
 Wagner-opera legends. The restlessness of Tann- 
 hauser which leads him into such ultimate misfortune, 
 and Elizabeth's undying love andxievotion to him, are 
 exhibitions of pathos and tragedy instinct with human 
 life. The dethronement of Venus by the acceptance 
 of Christianity throughout the world, by which she 
 was robbed of her divinity, and relegated to the 
 realms of the lower world to become a sorceress, is 
 not less sorrowful than that of the sorrowful Elizabeth. 
 Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was, accord- 
 ing to the more ancient Greek conception, a daughter 
 of Jupiter and Dione; but Hesiod says that she arose 
 from the sea at the time of the wounding of Uranus 
 and was therefore called by the Greeks, Aphrodite, 
 the foam-born. Wafted by the west wind she was 
 borne to the island of Cytherea, and afterward, like a 
 dream, she passed to Cypress, where the grace of her 
 beauty conquered every heart. She at once became 
 the goddess of love and beauty, the goddess of gardens 
 and flowers, of the rose, the myrtle and the linden. 
 The heaths and slumberous vales, pleasant with Spring 
 and the vernal breezes, were her's. She Vs-as the mis- 
 tress of feminine charm and beauty, and ruled the 
 hearts of men. Driven from her ancient kingdom, 
 from the sunshine and the flowers of the upper 
 world, it is no wonder that her heart grew hard, that 
 we find her the wicked enchantress and sorceress that 
 she is in the Venusburg, situated in the German valley 
 of Thuringia. 
 The version of the legend of Tannhauser here given 
 at the end is a Hberty taken, but it seemed to me in- 
 consistent after his chastening to have him consider a 
 return to the Venusburg. 
 G. M.McClellan. 
 THE LEGEND OF TANNHAUSER AND ELIZABETH. 
 I 
 THE VENUSBURG 
 In Germany the fabled Venusburg 
 A broad and fertile valley overlooked, 
 In fair Thuringia. The winds blew free 
 Along the mountain slopes, where shepherds watched 
 Their sheep, and played upon their pipes in sweet 
 Contentment all the day, beneath the blue 
 And arching sky. And in the valley rang 
 Often the cheery cry of noble knights 
 And jovial hunting parties on their way 
 To visit Wartburg castle, in which dwelt 
 The Landgrave, Herman, and his men-at-arms, 
 And his brave knights of fair Thuringia. 
 And with him dwelt his niece, Elizabeth, 
 The princess of the realm. The minstrel knights 
 And nobles, skilled in voice and on the harp, 
 Were wont to gather in the Landgrave's hall 
 And there contest in song. In this fine art 
 The sweetest singer of Thuringia 
 Was young Tannhauser, who, by his fair face 
 And wondrous melodies in song, had won 
 The heart of proud Elizabeth. And yet 
 This noble knight was dreamy in his mood 
 And restless in his life, dissatisfied, 
 And longed for change and new experiences. 
 And in this dreamy mood, with harp in hand, 
 He passed, one day, the grotto of the Venusburg. 
 The great enchantress of this fateful place 
 Put forth her magic spells and drew him on. 
 And when Tannhauser raised his eyes he saw 
 A country beautiful and strangely new. 
 As through a doorway seen, there flitted through 
 The gleaming, ever-changing, rose-hued mist 
 A countless throng of figures beautiful. 
 And heavy-headed flowers sent to him 
 Their all-compeUing perfume through the air. 
 And far away he saw the misty lakes 
 Of magic blue. The sound of music came to him. 
 So strangely sweet it almost gave him pain 
 To hear. And in the midst of all there stood 
 The great enchantress, smiling, beckoning him 
 To come. So great her spell, he moved as in a dream, 
 Into the grotto passed, and fancied that 
 He heard a heavy door behind him clang. 
 For one long year, with ever changing scenes, 
 Tannhauser stayed within the Venusburg 
 And thought that he was happy there. The change 
 In shifting scenes, the wild bacchantes, and 
 The nymphs in mimic war, in graceful dance, 
 Afforded for his ever restless soul 
 The wild excitement which he craved. And for 
 His softer moods the chording voices of 
 The sirens satisfied. He breathed the scent 
 Of flowers wondrous sweet, and watched at times 
 Dissolving mist-wreaths as they faded out 
 Their rosy hues. With Venus long he sat 
 At other times, and more and more she wove 
 Her spells which bound him fast to her. She taught 
 To him her songs of love, which he before 
 Had never heard, and dazzled by her charms 
 He worshipped her as did the world of old 
 When she was grand and true and gave 
 The gift of noble love to all humanity. 
 Tannhauser, now enthralled by magic spells, 
 Had long forgotten all his former life — 
 His friends, his love for fair Elizabeth, 
 His love for God, for Christ and righteousness, 
 And all the good and true which come to man 
 By sacrifice and overcoming sin 
 Were banished from his mind, so lost was he 
 To all the life within the Venusburg. 
 And yet, the restless nature of his soul 
 That led him into sin was destined to 
 Arouse him to his lost estate. One day 
 Tannhauser felt himself awake once more. 
 He fancied that he heard the clanging peals 
 Of church bells far away, and through his mind 
 There struggled back the long forgotten life ; 
 The sun, the friendly glimmer of the stars. 
 The song of nightingales, the morning light, 
 The freshness of the earth, the skies above. 
 In memory came rushing through his mind. 
 In wild appeal to Venus now he cried: 
 "Are these things lost to me?" And, rising from 
 Her couch, with quick though mild rebuke she bade 
 Him call to mind for her a scene less sad. 
 For she remembered well the world from which 
 She was dethroned and basely relegated to 
 This under-realm. Tannhauser, now aroused. 
 Felt all his restlessness, and would not be 
 Denied. In vain she wove about him now 
 Her magic spells. Tannhauser pleaded for 
 Releasement from her power, to live again 
 His former life, to know the natural joys, 
 The sorrows and the common things of earth. 
 In wrath she charged him with ingratitude 
 To her for all the lavished joys which she 
 Had given him. But when she saw in vain 
 Her wrath affected him, in softer tones 
 She promised him more perfect joys, and things 
 More beautiful. And while she spoke there came 
 From over all the dim blue lakes the soft 
 Caressing voices of the sirens in 
 Their wondrous harmonies. "My knight," she cried, 
 "Why will you fly?" With stormy passion moved, 
 Tannhauser seized his harp and smote the strings, 
 And sang in mighty voice. He pledged to sing 
 When in the upper world, of Venus and 
 Her praise alone, but to that upper world 
 He now must go. The great enchantress saw 
 Her power on him now was gone, and bade him go. 
 Then in a moment flashed away from him 
 The Venusburg and all its wondrous spells; 
 And, stretched full length upon the mountain side, 
 Tannhauser found himself too weak to rise 
 Up from the grassy slope at first. Confused 
 In mind, up to the wide blue sky he gazed. 
 While slowly came to him the memory 
 Of all his former life, the bitter truth 
 Of sin in going to the Venusburg. 
 And from the pasture lands below he heard 
 The sheep bells, where the peaceful shepherd lad 
 Lay playing on his pipes, and pausing now and then 
 To sing a song to Holda, goddess of 
 The Spring. Across the quiet valley came 
 The sounds of hunting horns, the baying of 
 The hunting pack with full excitement for 
 The chase, and stirred the lonely knight upon 
 The mountain side to full activity. 
 And soon the Landgrave and five minstrel knights 
 Drew near and recognized Tannhauser, and 
 With words of welcome and much kindness asked 
 Where he had been. *T wandered in strange lands,' 
 Tannhauser said. "I pray you question not, 
 But let me pass." The Landgrave saw his mood 
 And courteously forbore to further press 
 And question him, but pointed out how sad 
 Had been the princess, fair Elizabeth, 
 In his long absence from the hall, and asked 
 That he should join the coming revels of 
 The minstrelsy of song in Wartburg Hall. 
 With gladness in his heart he promised to 
 Attend. And now the heavens seemed to smile 
 A pardon down on him, and sweet the wind 
 Blew softly on his face. "Elizabeth," he said. 
 The murmur of her name a sense of peace 
 And freedom brought to him. And now once more 
 He humbly prayed to God that he might be 
 Forgiven for his sin, and find a peace 
 Of heart, and full acceptance in His sight. 
 THE CONTEST OF SONG AND LOVE 
 The Landgrave's gilded hall was all bedecked 
 In preparation for the minstrel knights 
 Who would contest in skill upon the harp. 
 Though named were all contestants long before, 
 Tannhauser's name was added to the list 
 In recognition of his marvelous skill 
 And, too, in honor of his coming home. 
 Before the minstrel hour the princess, fair 
 Elizabeth, came in the hall to feast 
 Her eyes upon the place where, long before, 
 Tannhauser's harp and voice awoke her heart 
 To such fond sympathy and ardent love. 
 When now at last he had returned her heart 
 Was beating fast with its tumultous joy. 
 And scarcely could await the hour when she 
 Could see her noble knight and hear his voice again. 
 At last the hour arrived, and to the hall 
 The princess came. Her white, soft draperies, 
 Embroidered in rich colors, fell around 
 Her graceful form in many folds, and on 
 Her brow a crown of fretted gold proclaimed 
 Thuringia's princess, fair Elizabeth. 
 She was of northern birth, in coloring 
 Was fair, and had the clear blue eyes with which 
 The daughters of the cold and far north skies 
 So often are endowed. And for her hand 
 The prince, brave knights and nobles from afar, 
 Came suing ardently. To all of whom 
 She was unfailing kind, but ever proud, 
 And cold and stately in her pride, the pride 
 In generations of her noble blood. 
 One knight alone had touched her heart, and while 
 He was away she turned her back upon 
 The gayeties of the realm. But once again, 
 Now that he had returned, her spirit thrilled 
 With quickened heartbeats of her happiness, 
 And sent its sparkling gleams to her blue eyes. 
 Into the minstrel hall the noble knights 
 Came, bearing each his harp. Elizabeth 
 In queenly beauty stood with welcome smiles, 
 But yet with searching eyes for one above 
 All other knights. He came, by Wolfram led. 
 In through a doorway at the side. "Ah, there 
 She is, — the princess," Wolfram softly said, 
 And turned away, upon a pillar leaned 
 All richly carved, and fixed his gaze upon 
 The quiet beauty of the vale without. 
 "O! princess fair!" he heard Tannhauser cry, 
 And then her voice, with love, which softly said, 
 "You must not kneel to me." He heard no more. 
 Save now and then a word, a phrase which filled 
 His heart with cold despair, for Wolfram, too. 
 The princess loved, but in his noble heart — 
 His heart as noble as his name — he now 
 Relinquished all his hopes for those he loved. 
 And who would find their joy in mutual love. 
 The Landgrave, smiling, came into the hall. 
 And in her joy Elizabeth herself 
 Threw in his arms, so great her happiness. 
 Together mounted they the royal seat 
 To wait the coming of the knights and guests. 
 All bidden to the feast of love and song. 
 Four pages called the guests as they arrived ; 
 The Landgrave, with all stately courtesy, 
 The princess, with the utmost graciousness. 
 Made welcome there the knights and all the guests, 
 Arrayed in rich medieval dress. There stood 
 Behind them all the men-at-arms; also 
 The Landgrave's brave retainers lined the wall. 
 The swinging lamps revealed the columns rich 
 In carving. When the guests had all arrived. 
 The Landgrave stood and said the contest was 
 Of love in song, and he who won should have 
 The hand of fair Elizabeth, he pledged; 
 Not doubting once that he would win in song 
 Who had already won Elizabeth 
 In ardent love. "All hail ! Thuringia's lord !" 
 The minstrels cried in greeting to his speech. 
 Then came deep silence as the pages passed 
 The golden cup in which each minstrel dropped 
 A folded slip of paper with his name. 
 Then from the golden cup Elizabeth 
 Drew out a name and gave it to the page 
 Who raised his voice and cried, 
 "Herr Wolfram Eschenbach in song begin." 
 Upon his feet Von Eschenbach arose 
 And to his harp's soft rippling cadences 
 Began to sing: first of brave knights and to 
 Fair ladies present in the hall. Then to 
 Elizabeth his pent-up soul in song 
 Poured out the mighty passion of his love. 
 He sang in noble fervor to the star 
 Of love embodied in the princess fair. 
 Applause from all the guests and minstrels rang 
 Save from Tannhauser, seeming lost in dreams, 
 From which he did not rouse until the page 
 Announced his name as next upon the slip 
 Drawn by the princess from the golden cup. 
 He took his harp, but hardly knowing what 
 He did, for wild excitement seized his mind. 
 Once more rose-colored mists before his eyes 
 Arose, and voices whispered in his ears. 
 He stood as blind, with throbbing heart, and swayed 
 As sways an oak with storm and tempest tossed. 
 "I, too, have seen the fount of love," he cried, 
 And then his vow, back in the Venusburg: 
 That Venus, when he sang, should be his theme, 
 Enchained his memory. He smote his harp 
 And sang with stormy music till the roof 
 With praise of Venus rang. Still higher rose 
 His voice in eulogy of fairest, then. 
 Of all enchantresses. At last he flung 
 Away his harp and cried, ''I fly, I fly 
 Back to the Venusburg." Entranced, transfixed, 
 He stood, his harp unnoticed at his feet. 
 In horror-stricken tones the nobles cried, 
 "Hear him! Hear him! So to the Venusburg 
 This wandering knight has been. Press forward, all, 
 And in his blood bathe every sword." With cries 
 The ladies hastened from the hall, save fair 
 Elizabeth, who stood there shuddering 
 Betwixt her horror and her mighty love. 
 Increased the clamor and the great tumult 
 From every side as came the cry, "Kill him!" 
 And, pressing on, the nobles drew their swords 
 To do their deadly work. "Brave knights, stop" cried 
 Elizabeth; "Or else kill me. Stand back!" 
 Her tones were full of mingled love and deep 
 Despair, and yet surcharged with dignity 
 And stern command. The nobles all fell back, 
 Amazed to see their princess shield a wretch 
 As was Tannhauser now. Her voice all full 
 Of piteous tragedy continued in 
 Her plea: ''What is the wounds your swords could give 
 To this death-stroke which has been dealt to me?" 
 The nobles cried, "This fallen and false knight 
 You should be first indeed to scorn." She said, 
 "Why do you speak of me? Of this poor knight, 
 Of hi'm and his salvation, you should speak. 
 This knight, by dreadful magic bound, can yet, 
 Through sorrow and repentance, break his chains, 
 And win forgiveness from the pitying Lord. 
 I plead for him, for his dear life I plead." 
 Tannhauser, softened by her pleading words 
 And his own deep remorse, bowed low his head 
 And wept. The knights, now softened by his grief, 
 More gently spoke, but still in deep reproach. 
 At last the Landgrave spoke with kindness and 
 Command, the course Tannhauser must pursue, 
 Because around him clung the magic spells 
 And dark enchantment lingered in his heart. 
 He must go forth and not return again 
 To fair Thuringia till his soul was free 
 From all the spells of Venus. He advised 
 Tannhauser to unite himself with pilgrims, 
 Then setting out for Rome to seek the Pope ^ 
 And pray for pardon for their sins. And while 
 He talked there came from far without the chant 
 Of voices sweet and low, which brought a peace 
 And gentle rest into the minstrel hall, 
 Which short before with strife and tumult rang. 
 Tannhauser heard the chant ; with rising hope 
 And with a sudden impulse rose and said, 
 "I go to Rome." "To Rome!" the nobles cried. 
 The nobles, Landgrave and Elizabeth, 
 All cried with one loud voice to speed him on 
 From the great doorway of the Hall, 'To Rome!' 
 THE PILGRIMAGE AND STAFF 
 Now full of hope and deep repentance too, 
 Tannhauser hastened on his pilgrimage 
 To Rome. The road was long and rough and full 
 Of weariness, with none to aid him save 
 His staff. But his own deep remorse, also 
 His reborn faith in God, his reverent love 
 Now for Elizabeth made easy all the way. 
 When other pilgrims through the meadows went 
 And sought the gentle paths, he turned aside 
 To bruise his feet in thorns and stony ways. 
 The wayside streams he passed and bore his thirst. 
 In silence and contrition pressing on. 
 He filled his mind with hope and noble thoughts 
 Of future deeds and life all free from sin. 
 At last when many days were passed he came 
 To Rome. The bells were pealing forth in joy, 
 And anthems filled the air in promise of 
 The pardons for the weary pilgrim band, 
 As one by one they sought the presence of the Pope 
 And from him found the full assurance of 
 Forgiveness for their sins. Then came at last 
 Tannhauser's turn. In deep repentance now 
 He humbly knelt and told of all his sin : 
 The Venusburg, its dark and evil spells, 
 His wasted year, his fearful seizure in 
 The minstrel hall. For mercy now he begged 
 The Pope, and from enchantment to be freed. 
 But sternly spoke his papal lord, 'Tf you 
 Have been into the Venusburg, and there 
 Enchanted by its magic powers and spells, 
 You will succumb again, and you may hope 
 For God's forgiveness when my staff puts forth 
 Green leaves." Struck dumb with grief and deep 
 despair 
 Tannhauser staggered forth. In hopelessness 
 He fell upon the ground and wished for death. 
 At last when he arose, the pilgrim band 
 Had passed its way toward home, and from afar 
 Its chorus of thanksgiving faintly reached 
 His ears. Tannhauser took his staff, alone 
 To wander on he knew not where, bereft 
 Of consolation, and of hope and love. 
 And far, far away in secret prayed 
 EHzabeth in agonizing love 
 To God that He might save Tannhauser's soul, 
 And bring him back to her from magic powers 
 Redeemed. The year passed on and bringing near 
 The time the pilgrims must return from Rome. 
 EHzabeth more anxious grew ; there spread 
 Upon her face a greater sign of fear 
 And growing sadness, which Von Eschenbach 
 Was quick to see. He sought to comfort her 
 With gentle words, and unobtrusive love. 
 And ever watchful care. Elizabeth 
 Was grateful for his deep solicitude 
 And love, but could not give him love for love. 
 Thus, day by day, down to the Virgin's shrine. 
 Where passed the pilgrims on their road from Rome, 
 She came to pray, until one day there came 
 Upon the wind the echo of a song 
 Which she well knew. ''It is their song," she cried 
 With heart half bursting with its hope and fear. 
 Its pent-up agony and love. She strained 
 Her eyes to see the coming pilgrim band. 
 And of the band the pilgrim whom she loved. 
 Still onward came the pilgrims as they sang 
 Triumphantly of God — His mighty love. 
 And His forgiveness of their sins, x^nd they. 
 Unseeing, passed her by while she saw them, 
 But saw not with them that dear pilgrim face 
 She sought. "No more will he return," she said, 
 And, with the wound of death upon her face. 
 She sought the palace hall to wait and die. 
 For die she must, she knew, without his love. 
 To see his face no more ; to hear his voice 
 No more ; was more than she could bear and live. 
 A few more days were passed so quietly 
 None in the palace thought Elizabeth 
 Was near the end of life, or that her grief 
 And love were yet so great that she must die. 
 They thought her youth would yet assert itself 
 And time would bring a solace to her love, 
 And heal her broken heart. But scarcely was 
 The sun up from the glowing East when she 
 One morning called the Landgrave to her bed, 
 And all the household dear, and bade tham all, 
 A last farewell. And while they wept for her 
 She closed her eyes and died. So gently did 
 She pass she seemed as one who slept. 
 And then Elizabeth was laid to rest 
 With swelling music, and with holy mass, 
 And gorgeous obsequies becoming to 
 Her princely race and noble line of kings. 
 Wolfram von Eschenbach stood on a hill 
 One day above the shrine more sacred now 
 To him because in prayer Elizabeth 
 Had knelt so often there. The twiHght hour 
 Came on and brightly shone the evening star, 
 And as he watched he felt as if it were 
 The shining spirit of Elizabeth. 
 He struck his harp and softly sang a song 
 In which he made the lovely evening star 
 In its soft radiance to symbolize 
 Elizabeth in purity and love. 
 And, while he sang, he saw in ragged garb 
  
 A pilgrim leaning hard upon his staff 
 As he approached, and on his haggard face 
 The marks of deep despair and hopelessness. 
 And when the pilgrim spoke he recognized 
 Tannhauser, whom he kindly welcomed home. 
 "Tell me the story of your pilgrimage," 
 He said. Briefly Tannhauser told him all, 
 And said, "When I have seen Elizabeth 
 Once more, I leave this valley never to 
 Return again." "Alas," Von Wolfram said, 
 "Elizabeth is dead. She died for you. 
 In daily prayer for you and faithful love, 
 She pined her life away, and now a saint 
 In heaven she pleads with everlasting love 
 For you." Tannhauser fell upon the earth 
 With grief too much to bear. And while he lay, 
 Behold, swift messengers came from the Pope 
 And bore aloft the papal staff and sang 
 Of a great marvel wrought by God, for now 
 The staff put forth green leaves in token of 
 Tannhauser's full redemption from his sins. 
 The evening star in gentle radiance 
 Shone down upon the pilgrim's face at last 
 Reposing in the calm and peace of death.

AND THE GREATEST OF THESE IS WAR
    Around the council-board of Hell, with Satan at their head,
    The Three Great Scourges of humanity sat.
    Gaunt Famine, with hollow cheek and voice, arose and spoke,--
    "O, Prince, I have stalked the earth,
    And my victims by ten thousands I have slain,
    I have smitten old and young.
    Mouths of the helpless old moaning for bread, I have filled with dust;
    And I have laughed to see a crying babe tug at the shriveling breast
    Of its mother, dead and cold.
    I have heard the cries and prayers of men go up to a tearless sky,
    And fall back upon an earth of ashes;
    But, heedless, I have gone on with my work.
    'Tis thus, O, Prince, that I have scourged mankind."
    And Satan nodded his head.
    Pale Pestilence, with stenchful breath, then spoke and said,--
    "Great Prince, my brother, Famine, attacks the poor.
    He is most terrible against the helpless and the old.
    But I have made a charnel-house of the mightiest cities of men.
    When I strike, neither their stores of gold or of grain avail.
    With a breath I lay low their strongest, and wither up their fairest.
    I come upon them without warning, lancing invisible death.
    From me they flee with eyes and mouths distended;
    I poison the air for which they gasp, and I strike them down fleeing.
    'Tis thus, great Prince, that I have scourged mankind."
    And Satan nodded his head.
    Then the red monster, War, rose up and spoke,--
    His blood-shot eyes glared 'round him, and his thundering voice
    Echoed through the murky vaults of Hell.--
    "O, mighty Prince, my brothers, Famine and Pestilence,
    Have slain their thousands and ten thousands,--true;
    But the greater their victories have been,
    The more have they wakened in Man's breast
    The God-like attributes of sympathy, of brotherhood and love
    And made of him a searcher after wisdom.
    But I arouse in Man the demon and the brute,
    I plant black hatred in his heart and red revenge.
    From the summit of fifty thousand years of upward climb
    I haul him down to the level of the start, back to the wolf.
    I give him claws.
    I set his teeth into his brother's throat.
    I make him drunk with his brother's blood.
    And I laugh ho! ho! while he destroys himself.
    O, mighty Prince, not only do I slay,
    But I draw Man hellward."
    And Satan smiled, stretched out his hand, and said,--
    "O War, of all the scourges of humanity, I crown you chief."
    And Hell rang with the acclamation of the Fiends.
A MID-DAY DREAMER
    I love to sit alone, and dream,
    And dream, and dream;
    In fancy's boat to softly glide
    Along some stream
    Where fairy palaces of gold
    And crystal bright
    Stand all along the glistening shore:
    A wondrous sight.
    My craft is built of ivory,
    With silver oars,
    The sails are spun of golden threads,
    And priceless stores
    Of precious gems adorn its prow,
    And 'round its mast
    An hundred silken cords are set
    To hold it fast.
    My galley-slaves are sprightly elves
    Who, as they row,
    And as their shining oars they swing
    Them to and fro,
    Keep time to music wafted on
    The scented air,
    Made by the mermaids as they comb
    Their golden hair.
    And I the while lie idly back,
    And dream, and dream,
    And let them row me where they will
    Adown the stream.
THE TEMPTRESS
    Old Devil, when you come with horns and tail,
    With diabolic grin and crafty leer;
    I say, such bogey-man devices wholly fail
    To waken in my heart a single fear.
    But when you wear a form I know so well,
    A form so human, yet so near divine;
    'Tis then I fall beneath the magic of your spell,
    'Tis then I know the vantage is not mine.
    Ah! when you take your horns from off your head,
    And soft and fragrant hair is in their place;
    I must admit I fear the tangled path I tread
    When that dear head is laid against my face.
    And at what time you change your baleful eyes
    For stars that melt into the gloom of night,
    All of my courage, my dear fellow, quickly flies;
    I know my chance is slim to win the fight.
    And when, instead of charging down to wreck
    Me on a red-hot pitchfork in your hand,
    You throw a pair of slender arms about my neck,
    I dare not trust the ground on which I stand.
    Whene'er in place of using patent wile,
    Or trying to frighten me with horrid grin,
    You tempt me with two crimson lips curved in a smile;
    Old Devil, I must really own, you win.
GHOSTS OF THE OLD YEAR
    The snow has ceased its fluttering flight,
    The wind sunk to a whisper light,
    An ominous stillness fills the night,
      A pause--a hush.
    At last, a sound that breaks the spell,
    Loud, clanging mouthings of a bell,
    That through the silence peal and swell,
      And roll, and rush.
    What does this brazen tongue declare,
    That falling on the midnight air
    Brings to my heart a sense of care
      Akin to fright?
    'Tis telling that the year is dead,
    The New Year come, the Old Year fled,
    Another leaf before me spread
      On which to write.
    It tells the deeds that were not done,
    It tells of races never run,
    Of victories that were not won,
      Barriers unleaped.
    It tells of many a squandered day,
    Of slighted gems and treasured clay,
    Of precious stores not laid away,
      Of fields unreaped.
    And so the years go swiftly by,
    Each, coming, brings ambitions high,
    And each, departing, leaves a sigh
      Linked to the past.
    Large resolutions, little deeds;
    Thus, filled with aims unreached, life speeds
    Until the blotted record reads,
      "Failure!" at last.
THE GHOST OF DEACON BROWN
    In a backwoods town
    Lived Deacon Brown,
    And he was a miser old;
    He would trust no bank,
    So he dug, and sank
    In the ground a box of gold,
    Down deep in the ground a box of gold.
    He hid his gold,
    As has been told,
    He remembered that he did it;
    But sad to say,
    On the very next day,
    He forgot just where he hid it:
    To find his gold he tried and tried
    Till he grew faint and sick, and died.
    Then on each dark and gloomy night
    A form in phosphorescent white,
    A genuine hair-raising sight,
    Would wander through the town.
    And as it slowly roamed around,
    With a spade it dug each foot of ground;
    So the folks about
    Said there was no doubt
    'Twas the ghost of Deacon Brown.
    Around the church
    This Ghost would search,
    And whenever it would see
    The passers-by
    Take wings and fly
    It would laugh in ghostly glee,
    Hee, hee!--it would laugh in ghostly glee.
    And so the town
    Went quickly down,
    For they said that it was haunted;
    And doors and gates,
    So the story states,
    Bore a notice, "Tenants wanted."
    And the town is now for let,
    But the ghost is digging yet.
"LAZY"
    Some men enjoy the constant strife
    Of days with work and worry rife,
    But that is not my dream of life:
      I think such men are crazy.
    For me, a life with worries few,
    A job of nothing much to do,
    Just pelf enough to see me through:
      I fear that I am lazy.
    On winter mornings cold and drear,
    When six o'clock alarms I hear,
    'Tis then I love to shift my ear,
      And hug my downy pillows.
    When in the shade it's ninety-three,
    No job in town looks good to me,
    I'd rather loaf down by the sea,
      And watch the foaming billows.
    Some people think the world's a school,
    Where labor is the only rule;
    But I'll not make myself a mule,
      And don't you ever doubt it.
    I know that work may have its use,
    But still I feel that's no excuse
    For turning it into abuse;
      What do _you_ think about it?
    Let others fume and sweat and boil,
    And scratch and dig for golden spoil,
      And live the life of work and toil,
    Their lives to labor giving.
    But what is gold when life is sped,
    And life is short, as has been said,
    And we are such a long time dead,
      I'll spend my life in living.
OMAR
    Old Omar, jolly sceptic, it may be
    That, after all, you found the magic key
    To life and all its mystery, and I
    Must own you have almost persuaded me.
DEEP IN THE QUIET WOOD
    Are you bowed down in heart?
    Do you but hear the clashing discords and the din of life?
    Then come away, come to the peaceful wood,
    Here bathe your soul in silence. Listen! Now,
    From out the palpitating solitude
    Do you not catch, yet faint, elusive strains?
    They are above, around, within you, everywhere.
    Silently listen! Clear, and still more clear, they come.
    They bubble up in rippling notes, and swell in singing tones.
    Now let your soul run the whole gamut of the wondrous scale
    Until, responsive to the tonic chord,
    It touches the diapason of God's grand cathedral organ,
    Filling earth for you with heavenly peace
    And holy harmonies.
VOLUPTAS
    To chase a never-reached mirage
    Across the hot, white sand,
    And choke and die, while gazing on
    Its green and watered strand.
THE WORD OF AN ENGINEER
    "She's built of steel
    From deck to keel,
    And bolted strong and tight;
    In scorn she'll sail
    The fiercest gale,
    And pierce the darkest night.
    "The builder's art
    Has proved each part
    Throughout her breadth and length;
    Deep in the hulk,
    Of her mighty bulk,
    Ten thousand Titans' strength."
    The tempest howls,
    The Ice Wolf prowls,
    The winds they shift and veer,
    But calm I sleep,
    And faith I keep
    In the word of an engineer.
    Along the trail
    Of the slender rail
    The train, like a nightmare, flies
    And dashes on
    Through the black-mouthed yawn
    Where the cavernous tunnel lies.
    Over the ridge,
    Across the bridge,
    Swung twixt the sky and hell,
    On an iron thread
    Spun from the head
    Of the man in a draughtsman's cell.
    And so we ride
    Over land and tide,
    Without a thought of fear--
    _Man never had
    The faith in God
    That he has in an engineer!_
LIFE
    Out of the infinite sea of eternity
    To climb, and for an instant stand
    Upon an island speck of time.
    From the impassible peace of the darkness
    To wake, and blink at the garish light
    Through one short hour of fretfulness.
SLEEP
    O Sleep, thou kindest minister to man,
      Silent distiller of the balm of rest,
    How wonderful thy power, when naught else can,
      To soothe the torn and sorrow-laden breast!
    When bleeding hearts no comforter can find,
      When burdened souls droop under weight of woe,
    When thought is torture to the troubled mind,
      When grief-relieving tears refuse to flow;
    'Tis then thou comest on soft-beating wings,
      And sweet oblivion's peace from them is shed;
    But ah, the old pain that the waking brings!
      That lives again so soon as thou art fled!
    Man, why should thought of death cause thee to weep;
    Since death be but an endless, dreamless sleep?
PRAYER AT SUNRISE
    O mighty, powerful, dark-dispelling sun,
    Now thou art risen, and thy day begun.
    How shrink the shrouding mists before thy face,
    As up thou spring'st to thy diurnal race!
    How darkness chases darkness to the west,
    As shades of light on light rise radiant from thy crest!
    For thee, great source of strength, emblem of might,
    In hours of darkest gloom there is no night.
    Thou shinest on though clouds hide thee from sight,
    And through each break thou sendest down thy light.
    O greater Maker of this Thy great sun,
    Give me the strength this one day's race to run,
    Fill me with light, fill me with sun-like strength,
    Fill me with joy to rob the day its length.
    Light from within, light that will outward shine,
    Strength to make strong some weaker heart than mine,
    Joy to make glad each soul that feels its touch;
    Great Father of the sun, I ask this much.
THE GIFT TO SING
    Sometimes the mist overhangs my path,
    And blackening clouds about me cling;
    But, oh, I have a magic way
    To turn the gloom to cheerful day--
      I softly sing.
    And if the way grows darker still,
    Shadowed by Sorrow's somber wing,
    With glad defiance in my throat,
    I pierce the darkness with a note,
      And sing, and sing.
    I brood not over the broken past,
    Nor dread whatever time may bring;
    No nights are dark, no days are long,
    While in my heart there swells a song,
      And I can sing.
MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT
    When morning shows her first faint flush,
    I think of the tender blush
    That crept so gently to your cheek
    When first my love I dared to speak;
    How, in your glance, a dawning ray
    Gave promise of love's perfect day.
    When, in the ardent breath of noon,
    The roses with passion swoon;
    There steals upon me from the air
    The scent that lurked within your hair;
    I touch your hand, I clasp your form--
    Again your lips are close and warm.
    When comes the night with beauteous skies,
    I think of your tear-dimmed eyes,
    Their mute entreaty that I stay,
    Although your lips sent me away;
    And then falls memory's bitter blight,
    And dark--so dark becomes the night.
HER EYES TWIN POOLS
    Her eyes, twin pools of mystic light,
    The blend of star-sheen and black night;
    O'er which, to sound their glamouring haze,
    A man might bend, and vainly gaze.
    Her eyes, twin pools so dark and deep,
    In which life's ancient mysteries sleep;
    Wherein, to seek the quested goal,
    A man might plunge, and lose his soul.
THE AWAKENING
    I dreamed that I was a rose
    That grew beside a lonely way,
    Close by a path none ever chose,
    And there I lingered day by day.
    Beneath the sunshine and the show'r
    I grew and waited there apart,
    Gathering perfume hour by hour,
    And storing it within my heart,
      Yet, never knew,
    Just why I waited there and grew.
    I dreamed that you were a bee
    That one day gaily flew along,
    You came across the hedge to me,
    And sang a soft, love-burdened song.
    You brushed my petals with a kiss,
    I woke to gladness with a start,
    And yielded up to you in bliss
    The treasured fragrance of my heart;
      And then I knew
    That I had waited there for you.
BEAUTY THAT IS NEVER OLD
    When buffeted and beaten by life's storms,
    When by the bitter cares of life oppressed,
    I want no surer haven than your arms,
    I want no sweeter heaven than your breast.
    When over my life's way there falls the blight
    Of sunless days, and nights of starless skies;
    Enough for me, the calm and steadfast light
    That softly shines within your loving eyes.
    The world, for me, and all the world can hold
    Is circled by your arms; for me there lies,
    Within the lights and shadows of your eyes,
    The only beauty that is never old.
VENUS IN A GARDEN
    'Twas at early morning,
    The dawn was blushing in her purple bed,
    When in a sweet, embowered garden
    She, the fairest of the goddesses,
    The lovely Venus,
    Roamed amongst the roses white and red.
    She sought for flowers
    To make a garland
    For her golden head.
    Snow-white roses, blood-red roses,
    In that sweet garden close,
    Offered incense to the goddess:
    Both the white and the crimson rose.
    White roses, red roses, blossoming:
    But the fair Venus knew
    The crimson roses had gained their hue
    From the hearts that for love had bled;
    And the goddess made a garland
    Gathered from the roses red.
VASHTI
    I sometimes take you in my dreams to a far-off land I used to know,
    Back in the ages long ago; a land of palms and languid streams.
    A land, by night, of jeweled skies, by day, of shores that glistened bright,
    Within whose arms, outstretched and white, a sapphire sea lay crescent-wise.
    Where twilight fell like silver floss, where rose the golden moon half-hid
    Behind a shadowy pyramid; a land beneath the Southern Cross.
    And there the days dreamed in their flight, each one a poem chanted through,
    Which at its close was merged into the muted music of the night.
    And you were a princess in those days. And I--I was your serving lad.
    But who ever served with heart so glad, or lived so for a word of praise?
    And if that word you chanced to speak, how all my senses swayed and reeled,
    Till low beside your feet I kneeled, with happiness o'erwrought and weak.
    If, when your golden cup I bore, you deigned to lower your eyes to mine,
    Eyes cold, yet fervid, like the wine, I knew not how to wish for more.
    I trembled at the thought to dare to gaze upon, to scrutinize
    The deep-sea mystery of your eyes, the sun-lit splendor of your hair.
    To let my timid glances rest upon you long enough to note
    How fair and slender was your throat, how white the promise of your breast.
    But though I did not dare to chance a lingering look, an open gaze
    Upon your beauty's blinding rays, I ventured many a stolen glance.
    I fancy, too, (but could not state what trick of mind the fancy caused)
    At times your eyes upon me paused, and marked my figure lithe and straight.
    Once when my eyes met yours it seemed that in your cheek, despite your pride,
    A flush arose and swiftly died; or was it something that I dreamed?
    Within your radiance like the star of morning, there I stood and served,
    Close by, unheeded, unobserved. You were so near, and, yet, so far.
    Ah! just to stretch my hand and touch the musky sandals on your feet!--
    My breaking heart! of rapture sweet it never could have held so much.
    Oh, beauty-haunted memory! Your face so proud, your eyes so calm,
    Your body like a slim young palm, and sinuous as a willow tree.
    Caught up beneath your slender arms, and girdled 'round your supple waist,
    A robe of curious silk that graced, but only scarce concealed your charms.
    A golden band about your head, a crimson jewel at your throat
    Which, when the sunlight on it smote, turned to a living heart and bled.
    But, oh, that mystic bleeding stone, that work of Nature's magic art,
    Which mimicked so a wounded heart, could never bleed as did my own!
    Now after ages long and sad, in this stern land we meet anew;
    No more a princess proud are you, and I--I am no serving lad.
    And yet, dividing us, I meet a wider gulf than that which stood
    Between a princess of the blood and him who served low at her feet.
THE REWARD
    No greater earthly boon than this I crave,
    That those who some day gather 'round my grave,
    In place of tears, may whisper of me then,
    "He sang a song that reached the hearts of men."

        <collex:text>INTRODUCTION
            Of the hundred millions who make up the population of the United States ten millions come from a stock ethnically alien to the other ninety millions. They are not descended from ancestors who came here voluntarily, in the spirit of adventure to better themselves or in the spirit of devotion to make sure of freedom to worship God in their own way. They are the grandchildren of men and women brought here against their wills to serve as slaves. It is only half-a-century since they received their freedom and since they were at last permitted to own themselves. They are now American citizens, with the rights and the duties of other American citizens; and they know no language, no literature and no law other than those of their fellow citizens of Anglo-Saxon ancestry.
            When we take stock of ourselves these ten millions cannot be left out of account. Yet they are not as we are; they stand apart, more or less; they have their own distinct characteristics. It behooves us to understand them as best we can and to discover what manner of people they are. And we are justified in inquiring how far they have revealed themselves, their racial characteristics, their abiding traits, their longing aspirations,--how far have they disclosed these in one or another of the several arts. They have had their poets, their painters, their composers, and yet most of these have ignored their racial opportunity and have worked in imitation and in emulation of their white predecessors and contemporaries, content to handle again the traditional themes. The most important and the most significant contributions they have made to art are in music,--first in the plaintive beauty of the so-called "Negro spirituals"--and, secondly, in the syncopated melody of so-called "ragtime" which has now taken the whole world captive.
            In poetry, especially in the lyric, wherein the soul is free to find full expression for its innermost emotions, their attempts have been, for the most part, divisible into two classes. In the first of these may be grouped the verses in which the lyrist put forth sentiments common to all mankind and in no wise specifically those of his own race; and from the days of Phyllis Wheatley to the present the most of the poems written by men who were not wholly white are indistinguishable from the poems written by men who were wholly white. Whatever their merits might be, these verses cast little or no light upon the deeper racial sentiments of the people to whom the poets themselves belonged. But in the lyrics to be grouped in the second of these classes there was a racial quality. This contained the dialect verses in which there was an avowed purpose of recapturing the color, the flavor, the movement of life in "the quarters," in the cotton field and in the canebrake. Even in this effort, white authors had led the way; Irvin Russell and Joel Chandler Harris had made the path straight for Paul Laurence Dunbar, with his lilting lyrics, often infused with the pathos of a down-trodden folk.
            In the following pages Mr. James Weldon Johnson conforms to both of these traditions. He gathers together a group of lyrics, delicate in workmanship, fragrant with sentiment, and phrased in pure and unexceptionable English. Then he has another group of dialect verses, racy of the soil, pungent in flavor, swinging in rhythm and adroit in rhyme. But where he shows himself a pioneer is the half-dozen larger and bolder poems, of a loftier strain, in which he has been nobly successful in expressing the higher aspirations of his own people. It is in uttering this cry for recognition, for sympathy, for understanding, and above all, for justice, that Mr. Johnson is most original and most powerful. In the superb and soaring stanzas of "Fifty Years" (published exactly half-a-century after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation) he has given us one of the noblest commemorative poems yet written by any American,--a poem sonorous in its diction, vigorous in its workmanship, elevated in its imagination and sincere in its emotion. In it speaks the voice of his race; and the race is fortunate in its spokesman. In it a fine theme has been finely treated. In it we are made to see something of the soul of the people who are our fellow citizens now and forever,--even if we do not always so regard them. In it we are glad to acclaim a poem which any living poet might be proud to call his own.

        <collex:text>FIFTY YEARS
            O brothers mine, to-day we stand
            Where half a century sweeps our ken,
            Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,
            Struck off our bonds and made us men.
            Just fifty years--a winter's day--
            As runs the history of a race;
            Yet, as we look back o'er the way,
            How distant seems our starting place!
            Look farther back! Three centuries!
            To where a naked, shivering score,
            Snatched from their haunts across the seas,
            Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.
            Far, far the way that we have trod,
            From heathen kraals and jungle dens,
            To freedmen, freemen, sons of God,
            Americans and Citizens.
            A part of His unknown design,
            We've lived within a mighty age;
            And we have helped to write a line
            On history's most wondrous page.
            A few black bondmen strewn along
            The borders of our eastern coast,
            Now grown a race, ten million strong,
            An upward, onward marching host.
            Then let us here erect a stone,
            To mark the place, to mark the time;
            A witness to God's mercies shown,
            A pledge to hold this day sublime.
            And let that stone an altar be,
            Whereon thanksgivings we may lay,
            Where we, in deep humility,
            For faith and strength renewed may pray.
            With open hearts ask from above
            New zeal, new courage and new pow'rs,
            That we may grow more worthy of
            This country and this land of ours.
            For never let the thought arise
            That we are here on sufferance bare;
            Outcasts, asylumed 'neath these skies,
            And aliens without part or share.
            This land is ours by right of birth,
            This land is ours by right of toil;
            We helped to turn its virgin earth,
            Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.
            Where once the tangled forest stood,--
            Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,--
            Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,
            The cotton white, the yellow corn.
            To gain these fruits that have been earned,
            To hold these fields that have been won,
            Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,
            Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.
            That Banner which is now the type
            Of victory on field and flood--
            Remember, its first crimson stripe
            Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.
            And never yet has come the cry--
            When that fair flag has been assailed--
            For men to do, for men to die,
            That have we faltered or have failed.
            We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,
            Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze;
            Held in our hands, it has been borne
            And planted far across the seas.
            And never yet--O haughty Land,
            Let us, at least, for this be praised--
            Has one black, treason-guided hand
            Ever against that flag been raised.
            Then should we speak but servile words,
            Or shall we hang our heads in shame?
            Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,
            And fear our heritage to claim?
            No! stand erect and without fear,
            And for our foes let this suffice--
            We've bought a rightful sonship here,
            And we have more than paid the price.
            And yet, my brothers, well I know
            The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,
            The spirit bowed beneath the blow,
            The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;
            The staggering force of brutish might,
            That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;
            The long, vain waiting through the night
            To hear some voice for justice raised.
            Full well I know the hour when hope
            Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere
            Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope
            With hands uplifted in despair.
            Courage! Look out, beyond, and see
            The far horizon's beckoning span!
            Faith in your God-known destiny!
            We are a part of some great plan.
            Because the tongues of Garrison
            And Phillips now are cold in death,
            Think you their work can be undone?
            Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?
            Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?
            That Lovejoy was but idly slain?
            Or do you think those precious drops
            From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?
            That for which millions prayed and sighed,
            That for which tens of thousands fought,
            For which so many freely died,
            God cannot let it come to naught.

        <collex:text>O BLACK AND UNKNOWN BARDS
            O black and unknown bards of long ago,
            How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
            How, in your darkness, did you come to know
            The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?
            Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
            Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
            Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
            Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
            Heart of what slave poured out such melody
            As "Steal away to Jesus"? On its strains
            His spirit must have nightly floated free,
            Though still about his hands he felt his chains.
            Who heard great "Jordan roll"? Whose starward eye
            Saw chariot "swing low"? And who was he
            That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,
            "Nobody knows de trouble I see"?
            What merely living clod, what captive thing,
            Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,
            And find within its deadened heart to sing
            These songs of sorrow, love, and faith, and hope?
            How did it catch that subtle undertone,
            That note in music heard not with the ears?
            How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,
            Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.
            Not that great German master in his dream
            Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars
            At the creation, ever heard a theme
            Nobler than "Go down, Moses." Mark its bars,
            How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir
            The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung
            Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were
            That helped make history when Time was young.
            There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
            That from degraded rest and servile toil
            The fiery spirit of the seer should call
            These simple children of the sun and soil.
            O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
            You--you alone, of all the long, long line
            Of those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
            Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.
            You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;
            No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean
            Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings
            You touched in chord with music empyrean.
            You sang far better than you knew; the songs
            That for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed
            Still live,--but more than this to you belongs:
            You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.

            Have you not heard the call,
            The trumpet blown, the word made known
            To the nations, one and all?
            The watchword, the hope-word,
            Salvation's present plan?
            A gospel new, for all--for you:
            Man shall be saved by man.
            O Southland! O Southland!
            Do you not hear to-day
            The mighty beat of onward feet,
            And know you not their way?
            'Tis forward, 'tis upward,
            On to the fair white arch
            Of Freedom's dome, and there is room
            For each man who would march.
            O Southland, fair Southland!
            Then why do you still cling
            To an idle age and a musty page,
            To a dead and useless thing?
            'Tis springtime! 'Tis work-time!
            The world is young again!
            And God's above, and God is love,
            And men are only men.
            O Southland! my Southland!
            O birthland! do not shirk
            The toilsome task, nor respite ask,
            But gird you for the work.
            Remember, remember
            That weakness stalks in pride;
            That he is strong who helps along
            The faint one at his side.

            Have you been sore discouraged in the fight,
            And even sometimes weighted by the thought
            That those with whom and those for whom you fought
            Lagged far behind, or dared but faintly smite?
            And that the opposing forces in their might
            Of blind inertia rendered as for naught
            All that throughout the long years had been wrought,
            And powerless each blow for Truth and Right?
            If so, take new and greater courage then,
            And think no more withouten help you stand;
            For sure as God on His eternal throne
            Sits, mindful of the sinful deeds of men,
            --The awful Sword of Justice in His hand,--
            You shall not, no, you shall not, fight alone.

        <collex:text>THE COLOR SERGEANT
            (_On an Incident at the Battle of San Juan Hill_)
            Under a burning tropic sun,
            With comrades around him lying,
            A trooper of the sable Tenth
            Lay wounded, bleeding, dying.
            First in the charge up the fort-crowned hill,
            His company's guidon bearing,
            He had rushed where the leaden hail fell fast,
            Not death nor danger fearing.
            He fell in the front where the fight grew fierce,
            Still faithful in life's last labor;
            Black though his skin, yet his heart as true
            As the steel of his blood-stained saber.
            And while the battle around him rolled,
            Like the roar of a sullen breaker,
            He closed his eyes on the bloody scene,
            And presented arms to his Maker.
            There he lay, without honor or rank,
            But, still, in a grim-like beauty;
            Despised of men for his humble race,
            Yet true, in death, to his duty.

            So often hast thou to thy bosom pressed
            The golden head, the face and brow of snow;
            So often has it 'gainst thy broad, dark breast

            Thou simple soul, as cuddling down that babe
            With thy sweet croon, so plaintive and so wild,

            That it some day might crush thine own black child?

            (On the Anniversary of Lincoln's Birth)
            Father, Father Abraham,
            To-day look on us from above;
            On us, the offspring of thy faith,
            The children of thy Christ-like love.
            For that which we have humbly wrought,
            Give us to-day thy kindly smile;
            Wherein we've failed or fallen short,
            Bear with us, Father, yet awhile.
            Father, Father Abraham,
            To-day we lift our hearts to thee,
            Filled with the thought of what great price
            Was paid, that we might ransomed be.
            To-day we consecrate ourselves
            Anew in hand and heart and brain,
            To send this judgment down the years:
            The ransom was not paid in vain.

        <collex:text>See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
            Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
            Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!
            No light is there; none, save the glint that shines
            In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
            Of some wild animal caught in the hunter's trap.
            How came this beast in human shape and form?
            Speak, man! - We call you man because you wear
            His shape-How are you thus? Are you not from
            That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race
            Which we have known three centuries? Not from
            That more than faithful race which through three wars
            Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes
            Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!
            I am, and am not.
            Then who, why are you?
            I am a thing not new, I am as old
            As human nature. I am that which lurks,
            Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;
            The ancient trait which fights incessantly
            Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;
            The weight forever seeking to obey
            The law of downward pull; and I am more:
            The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;
            The resultant, the inevitable end
            Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
            Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,
            The memories of cruel sights and deeds,
            The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate
            Filtered through fifteen generations have
            Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.
            In me the muttered curse of dying men,
            On me the stain of conquered women, and
            Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,
            Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
            In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers
            Of wretches now long dead,--their dire bequests,--
            In me the echo of the stifled cry
            Of children for their bartered mothers' breasts.
            I claim no race, no race claims me; I am
            No more than human dregs; degenerate;
            The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;
            I am-just what I am . . . . The race that fed
            Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same
            To-day, but I -
            Enough, the brute must die!
            Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist
            The fire much longer than this slender pine.
            Now bring the fuel! Pile it 'round him! Wait!
            Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose
            The agony and terror in his face.
            And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames
            Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!
            And there's another! Wilder than the first.
            Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
            The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!
            Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
            He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,
            Searching around in vain appeal for help!
            Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh
            Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
            Down through the coils of chain that hold erect
            The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.
            Stop! to each man no more than one man's share.
            You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain -
            Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,
            In fair division, to the leader comes.
            And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;
            Let us back to our wives and children. - Say,
            What did he mean by those last muttered words,
            'Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we'?

            Nor all the devils he has feared,
            Not by the prayers that might be prayed
            In all the temples he has reared.
            See! In your very midst there dwell
            Ten thousand thousand blacks, a wedge
            Forged in the furnaces of hell,
            And sharpened to a cruel edge
            By wrong and by injustice fell,
            And driven by hatred as a sledge.
            A wedge so slender at the start--
            Just twenty slaves in shackles bound--
            And yet, which split the land apart
            With shrieks of war and battle sound,
            Which pierced the nation's very heart,
            And still lies cankering in the wound.
            Not all the glory of your pride,
            Preserved in story and in song,
            Can from the judging future hide,
            Through all the coming ages long,
            That though you bravely fought and died,
            You fought and died for what was wrong.
            'Tis fixed--for them that violate
            The eternal laws, naught shall avail
            Till they their error expiate;
            Nor shall their unborn children fail
            To pay the full required weight
            Into God's great, unerring scale.
            Think not repentance can redeem,
            That sin his wages can withdraw;
            No, think as well to change the scheme
            Of worlds that move in reverent awe;
            Forgiveness is an idle dream,
            God is not love, no, God is law.

        <collex:text>O BROTHERS mine, take care! Take care!    
            The great white witch rides out to-night.    
            Trust not your prowess nor your strength,    
            Your only safety lies in flight;    
            For in her glance there is a snare,            
            And in her smile there is a blight.    
            
            The great white witch you have not seen?    
            Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,    
            Like nursery children you have looked    
            For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;            
            But no, not so; the witch appears    
            In all the glowing charms of youth.    
            
            Her lips are like carnations, red,    
            Her face like new-born lilies, fair,    
            Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,            
            She moves with subtle grace and air,    
            And all about her head there floats    
            The golden glory of her hair.    
            
            But though she always thus appears    
            In form of youth and mood of mirth,            
            Unnumbered centuries are hers,    
            The infant planets saw her birth;    
            The child of throbbing Life is she,    
            Twin sister to the greedy earth.    
            
            And back behind those smiling lips,            
            And down within those laughing eyes,    
            And underneath the soft caress    
            Of hand and voice and purring sighs,    
            The shadow of the panther lurks,    
            The spirit of the vampire lies.            
            
            For I have seen the great white witch,    
            And she has led me to her lair,    
            And I have kissed her red, red lips    
            And cruel face so white and fair;    
            Around me she has twined her arms,            
            And bound me with her yellow hair.    
            
            I felt those red lips burn and sear    
            My body like a living coal;    
            Obeyed the power of those eyes    
            As the needle trembles to the pole;            
            And did not care although I felt    
            The strength go ebbing from my soul.    
            
            Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,    
            And heard your laughter loud and gay,    
            And in your voices she has caught            
            The echo of a far-off day,    
            When man was closer to the earth;    
            And she has marked you for her prey.    
            
            She feels the old Antaean strength    
            In you, the great dynamic beat            
            Of primal passions, and she sees    
            In you the last besieged retreat    
            Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,    
            Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.    
            
            O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!            
            The great white witch rides out to-night.    
            O, younger brothers mine, beware!    
            Look not upon her beauty bright;    
            For in her glance there is a snare,    
            And in her smile there is a blight.

  Ray G. Dandridge 
 Cincinnati, Ohio 
 1917 
DEDICATED TO MY MOTHER 
 MRS. E. C. DANDRIDGE 
 THE FAIREST GEMS 
 Men often long for gems so rare, 
 And sometimes for a maiden fair ; 
 Some crave wealth to give them power, 
 So they may be called— "men of the hour" ; 
 But while we strive to reach so high, 
 We find the Gems we cannot buy— 
 The fairest ones on God's green earth, 
 The precious mothers that gave us birth. 
To Whom It May Concern — 
 Having been confined to bed since July 4, 1912, Raymond Garfield Dandridge is not only an invalid, but also a bound-down "shut in," unable 
 to use either limb or right arm. 
 In spite of this great handicap, he penciled these verses, remained optimistic, and says, " 'Tis good to make the best of it." 
 POWELL &amp; WHITE, 
 Cincinnati, December 1, 1917 Printers. 
THE DUMB SOLDIER 
 With flying rein, a frothing steed, 
 Bearing an empty saddle ; 
 Dashed to and fro along the line, 
 Amid the din of battle. 
 The hand that guided him for years, 
 That stroked his flowing mane ; 
 Still clutching to a saber hilt, 
 Lies cold out on the plain. 
  A roaring hell on every side. 
  Like hail, the shot fell round ; 
  A blinding flash, a piercing neigh ; 
  Ned trembled ; then went down. 
  The bugle sounded loud, "The Charge !" 
  He raised his gallant head, 
  Then laid it on the sod again, 
  Another soldier — dead. 
 LIFE'S CIRCUS 
 All earth is a Circus Ground, 
 The sky above a tent. 
 And everyone a part must play 
 While Life is being spent. 
A vast host make the audience, 
  Who laugh at the merry rounds ; 
  While many are Life's Acrobats, 
  Life's Ring masters, and Clowns. 
  Life's Circus has the widest scope 
 Of freaks, at her command ; 
 She has the greatest animals. 
 She has the largest band. 
 All Carnivals and Pageants grand. 
 When they have been arrayed, 
 Must bare' their heads in reverence to 
 Life's Circus, on parade. 
MAH DAWG 
 Why's you tryin' to kick ole Robah, 
 Whut on earf he done to you ? 
 Bettah thank yore stars you mist him 
 Else yo'd had to kick me, too ; 
 He cain't talk to maik etscuses, 
 But, I's heah to taik his part; 
 An' yore pickin' on a po' dawg 
 Sho's de meanness in yore heart. 
 Shet yore mouf ! don' you dar say it ! 
 Yo's ez good a man ez me ; 
 Yo's a ha'f raised, uncouf buzzard, 
 Jes ni' nothin' ez kin be. 
 I know well I stoops to fight you, 
 But, it's hi' ni' stoopin' time. 
 Wen a lo' down, ornree scoundell. 
 Tries to kick dat dawg ob mine. 
 Dat houn' pup jes big an' playful 
 He thought you wor playful, too, 
 But, w'en you com'enst yore kickin' 
 Thin's tuk on a difTern' view. 
 You sho's plain yo's out fo' battle, 
 'Speck it won't be hard to fine, 
 Hebbin knows yo's bidin' fo' it 
 W'en you kick dat dawg ob mine. 
 Whuts you say? Yo's onlee funin'; 
 Ef you wuz, I's mighty glad ; 
 Kaze I lub to lub mah neighbah. 
 An' Stan' 'hole heaps fo' I's mad. 
 Lets shake ban's lak good ole Buddies, 
 Evahthin' done turnt out fine ; 
 We'll all three go home togeddah, 
 You, me, an' dat dawg ob mine. 
Aftah we done ett our suppah, 
 Tipped off wid a tater pie ; 
 Talk, it drifted sorta sad lak, 
 'Bout Heah Aftah, bye an' bye ; 
 Remuss sed, "we'd know each uddah, 
 In dat Meetin' House, sublime" ; 
 An' I growed rail melonkolee, 
 Thinkin' 'bout dat dawg ob mine. 
 Wondah, ef I ast St. Peter 
 VVoulden he let Robah in? 
 Ef I 'splain dat he's bin hones' 
 An' his heart am free frum sin ; 
 Wondah, how he'd look aflyin' 
 Thoo dem Holy Realms, divine ; 
 An, 'ef dar's a Golden Kennel 
 Waitin' fo' dat dawg ob mine? 
 MOTHER 
 When you were but a little child 
 With many faults to cover ; 
 Who hid them all behind her smile? 
 Your mother, your dear mother. 
 When out in this cold world, unkind. 
 You fall, can go no further; 
 Who picks you up, shakes off the grime? 
 Your mother, your dear mother. 
 Proud sister turns her back, 'tis true. 
 So does your dad and brother ; 
 Who never fails to welcome you? 
 Your mother, your dear mother. 
 Your mother's praise forever sing! 
 You'll never have another ; 
 They duplicate most everything, 
 Except your darling mother. 
GOOD EVERYWHERE 
 There's gladness in the sunshine, 
 There's gladness in the rain ; 
 From yonder tree the little bird 
 Chirps out a glad refrain. 
 All things of earth know happiness, 
 There's nothing always sad. 
 And everything contains some good. 
 There's naught that's wholly bad. 
 Try taking good from goodness. 
 Take gladness from the glad, 
 And ere long you will find yourself 
 Taking much good from bad. 
 FO YORESELF 
 Kin dat be Miss Mandy Jenkins 
 Cumin' yondah thoo de gate? 
 Might ni white ez airy white chile. 
 Hair alayin' slick an' straight ; 
 Wen I lef her, she wuz broun skin, 
 An' her haid wuz flufee, too; 
 Mebbe it's mah eyes dat's failin' 
 She nufif Mandy, am dat you? 
 You sho walks jes lak Miss Mandy, 
 An' you jes Miss Mandy's size, 
 An' yore figgah 'zembles Mandy's, 
 Dem eyes dance lak Mandy's eyes; 
 Bust em back an' show dem ivories! 
 You kaint fool me ef you smile ; 
 Neb your mind, dem feets betrays you. 
 Cose you is mah angel chile. 
Mandy, darlm', whut's de mattah? 
 Honey baby, don' you cry ; 
 Did whut I sed hu't yore feelin's? 
 Diden aim to ; hope to die. 
 Bless yore heart, I's onlee kidin' 
 'Bout yore 'plexshun, an' yore hair 
 Be ez striped ez de rain bo'. 
 So it's you, dat's all I care. 
 Say dem words agin. Bill Bundyl 
 Say you lub me, kaze it's me ! 
 Seems lak dey put new life in me, 
 Maik mah heart beat fas' an' free.

 Kaze I spent mah dollah, six bits, 
 Beautifyin', jes' fo' you. 
 But, it's worth all dat I spended. 
 It's worth mo' to heah dem words, 
 Fo' dey's much mo' sweetah music 
 Dan de chune ob hummin' birds ; 
 You lub Mandy, kaze it's Mandy ! 
 Week days, an' a Sunday, too; 
 Well, den listen 'till I tells you 
 How much Mandy thinks ob you. 
 Billie, I jes lubs an' lubs you !

 An' dar's somethin' 'bout you draws me. 
 It's yore winnin' ways, I guess. 
 All de day long yo's befo' me, 
 An' et night you hant mah dreams, 
 Wild erbout you dressed on Sunday, 
 Crazy 'bout you in yore geans ! 
ANTE BELLUM SYMPHONY 
 Stop dat racket! Whar's yore mannahs?

 Watch old Jerry press de cat gut, Goo' Lawd !

 Heah dat 'lodious mouf orgin, ain" it sweetnin?

 An' it sets de 'hole place ringin' 
 frum de callah to de roof ; 
 Rufus Simpson knows his banjo, knows

 Maiks it almos' beg fo' mercy, 
 maiks it pant, an' bio', an' sweat. 
 You kin talk erbout Gran' Opra, 'bout de 
 concerts, an' de birds ; 
 But, w'en Carolina warbles; 'tain't 
 no 'spressin' it in words ; 
 She kin sing de "Swanee Ribbah," till 
 you see it flowin' by. 
 An' she sings "Asleep in Jesus," till 
 de tears stan' in yore eye. 
 Hopes dat you ain' 'fended Sambo, kase I

 Wid yore rattlin' bones, an' tambo, ain'

 Man ! you adds de rip, de tip, tip ! 
 an' you ancer fo' de drums. 
 Why, dey c'u'den do widout you, 
 w'en de Gran' Finale cums. 
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON 
 Alas, the willing hands are stilled 
 In death ; their toil on earth is done. 
 From plow to pen a task they filled, 
 Well earned repose, they won. 
 Long years he struggled uphill amid strife, 
 On, on to the wave crest of fame, 
 And stood at the Zenith of useful life, 
 When the Grim Reaper's summons came. 
 The messenger found him at work in the field 
 Of progress, where long he had lead. 
 With harvest time nigh, and a bountiful yield, 
 They whispered — he is dead. 
 MY PILOT 
 In dead hours of night when my oil burns low, 
 Jesus will pilot me ; 
 When the thunder peals and the wild winds blow, 
 Jesus will pilot me ; 
 All through the night and all through the day, 
 No matter where I may be. 
 He Tightens my footsteps, lest I stray away, 
 Jesus will pilot me. 
 When lost on the deep and the waves run high, 
 Jesus will pilot me; 
 My compass is broken ; my mast goes by ; 
 Jesus will pilot me ; 
 When it seems my bark to the bottom must go 
 And I shall be lost in the sea, 
 I placed my faith in Him, for I know 
 Jesus will pilot me. 
THE DOWN ROAD 
 Down the road going down, a man stumbles on, 
 Lax of spirit and sadly dismayed. 
 No one to console him ; 'ere long he is gone ; 
 In the shadow he lurks half afraid. 
 The future holds naught, the past barren lies, 
 Sobs take his breath, tears dim his eyes ; 
 He stumbles, he falls; can he do otherwise. 
 On the down, down road? 
 If you see a man on the down, down road, 
 Try to brace him with kindness and cheer ; 
 Your smile and your presence will lighten his load, 
 It may aid him to know you are near. 
 It is easy to smile when the outlook is bright. 
 It is easy to run when the impost is light, 
 But we find it hard to do just what is right. 
 On the down, down road. 
 The same circumstance that is keeping him down, 
 Might have put you or me in his place ; 
 Throw out the "Life Line," don't let him drown ! 
 Give him a chance to retrace. 
 The man worth while does not criticize, 
 There is hope for the one underneath, 'till he dies 
 Lend him a hand and perhaps he will rise, 
 From the down, down road. 
 FORWARD 
 Forward, every son and daughter 
 Born of Ethiopia's hue ! 
 Band yourselves in mighty union, 
 To be or not, depends on you. 
 Harken to the call of "Freedom !" 
 Marshal in "Ambition's' tread. 
 Let no crafty foe retard you 
 'Till you're marching at the head ! 
Set your "Goal Post" in the "Zenith," 
 Seek the shining- spots on high, 
 Swear to be no other's bondman, 
 Ere you cringe — resolve to die. 
 Crown each moment with your effort, 
 From the dawn to setting sun, 
 Every one must do his duty 
 Ere the "Victory" is won ! 
 THE BEST OF IT 
 When oppressed on every side. 
 Or caught in the receding tide, 
 Or dashed along, to who knows where ; 
 With naught in sight but blank despair. 
 When sorrow's shadow hovers round, 
 There is no sunshine to be found ; 
 Complaining does not help a bit. 
 Try hard to make the best of it ! 
 When everything piles up on you, 
 Your health is gone, your money too ; 
 The undercurrent drags you down. 
 No help is nigh, seems you must drown. 
 Those who promised to be true. 
 When trouble came, deserted you ; 
 All else has fled, cling to your grit — 
 You have to make the best of it. 
 Lo! at last the dark clouds sever, 
 No good or bad can live forever ; 
 See your horizon clear again. 
 And all the brighter since the rain ; 
 While good fortune smiles on you, 
 Be honest, upright, staunch and true, 
 And to your fellow-men admit 
 'Tis good to make the best of it. 
THE PRODIGAL 
 Lavvd, Howdy boy ! whar hab you bin ? 
 Goo'ness ! but yo's lookin' thin, 
 An' it's bin two yeah or mo'

 Satisfied to wait on you.

 You ain' done no rail disgrace. 
 Don' you know yore maw lub you 
 Maik no difi^ur whut you do. 
 An' dat "Welcome" on de wall, 
 Means you, sonny, fust ob all? 
 LITTLE THINGS 
 If the generous God of Fortune has delt you a sunny sky. 
 And your lot is free from sorrow, pain and strife, 
 Straightway seek your brother, who the world is passing by ; 
 Tell him there is hope while there is life ! 
 Secretly and tenderly go aid the fault'ring one, 
 'Twill do you good to see his spirit mount; 
 The show you make don't demonstrate the good that you have 
 done ; 
 So often it's the "little things" that count. 
CLOSE' MOUF 
 Whar's I bin, who wants to know? 
 No one's bissness whar I go ; 
 I's three sebens, an' den sum, 
 Plenty ole to go an' cum 
 Whar I wants, an' when I please, 
 'Sides you hab a heap ob cheese, 
 Ax me mo' dan mah own kin, 
 None yore bissniss ! whar I bin ! 
 Since you think dat you so smart, 
 I'll jes tell you fo' you start, 
 Ain' no chance to pick frum me, 
 Whar I's bin, or gwine to be; 
 When I leab yo'll know de same 
 Dat you did befo' I came ; 
 Keen on pickin' yo'll git fat 
 Tryin' to figgah whar I's at. 
 Ef you jes sed, look heah Phil, 
 Ain' you bin down hine de mill, 
 Tryin' to coax de little bones 
 To de seben, leben tones? 
 'Stead you used yore strategy, 
 Tried to pick it out ob me. 
 Set yore cunnin' little trap. 
 Thought I'd say, I's shootin' crap. 
 Figgahed you c'u'd git frum me, 
 Dat Sol, an' Gabe, an' Honey Lee, 
 An' me, an' tightwad Henree Lane, 
 Had a little social game ; 
 Thought I'd tell you, Honey Lee 
 Skint de 'hole croud, 'sepin' me, 
 An' dat po' ole Henree Lane, 
 Eben hocked his watch an' chain. 
Wise ole fox, jes keep on pickin'. 
 Whut you git frum dis heah chicken 
 Yo'll be welcome to, I guess ; 
 Bettah go try some de res'. 
 Broach ole Sol or Gabriel Jones, 
 He de man dat own de bones; 
 Else, ast Hen or Honey Lee, 
 Dey'll 'fess, long fo' close' mouf me. 
 HOME 
 Fancy bore me on her wing 
 Far away ; 
 To fond haunts, where mem'ries cling; 
 Far away. 
 Loving tenderness and grace 
 Shown on every smiling face, 
 'Round that dear familiar place, 
 Far away. 
 I could see the shady dell, 
 Far away ; 
 See my little Pardner, Nell, 
 Far away; 
 See my sister and my brother. 
 Yes, God bless her, see another. 
 With her arms outstretched, my Mother; 
 Far away. 
 I could hear the church bell ringing 
 Far away ; 
 Hear the choir sweetly singing, 
 Far away ; 
 See my final place of rest, 
 'Mid the ones that I love best, 
 In the church yard on the crest ; 
 Far away.

 A POUND OF LIFE 
 An ounce of sunshine, one of rain. 
 An ounce of pleasure and of pain, 
 An ounce of faith, an ounce of fears, 
 An ounce of mirth, an ounce of tears. 
 An ounce of love and one of care. 
 An ounce of hope, one of despair. 
 Of laughter, heartache, comfort, strife ; 
 The total sum — "a pound of life." 
AWAKE 
 Awake, my sleeping Ethiopia; 
 Proclaim inheritance thine own ! 
 Fan thy smold'ring embers 
 Into quick'ning flame, to rid the dross 
 And purify thy better self. 
 Ever onward mighty millions 
 Mount, yon elevated plane ! 
 Within thyself, thou hast 
 The power to rise, and risen 
 Stand ! in union firm. 
 Behold! fullfilment of His promise; 
 Thy- "Triumphant Star" ascendeth in the sky. 
 The Ermine, Crown and Sceptre are awaiting 
 Thy "Coronation Day" is drawing nigh. 
 THINKIN' SPOOKS

 Loud to be no mo' a slave. 
 To de daid dat's in de grave.

FIFTY-FIFTY 
 I 'ten'ed a campane speakin' 
 Et de Town Hall uddah night. 
 Heard de canadate fo' office, 
 Frail his 'ponett lef an' right. 
 He called him a lo' down scoundrel, 
 A graftah, fraud an' bum ; 
 Tole us ef he gits elected 
 Sho nuff hard time boun' to cum. 
 He sed, "he'd be po' man's fren', 
 He'l 'up fo' capital, too ; 
 Loud ef he gits elected 
 He would put de issue thoo." 
 Sed, "he would ile de turn pike, 
 Remodel de ole jail. 
 Put mo' dough in de envelope, 
 An' cram de dinnah pail." 
 "He gits mah vote," I sez, sez I, 
 An' lef dar, satisfied ; 
 But on mah way agoin' home, 
 Annuddah crowd I spied ; 
 Dey had a brass ban' an' red fire, 
 Right in de Market Square ; 
 An' dar de uddah canadate 
 Spoke in de open air. 
 Wid bof his feets, he jumped right on 
 De fellah, I jes heard, 
 An' called him ebahthin' dats bad, 
 Omittin' nary word. 
 He sed, "a man dat vote fo' Smif 
 Be sorry ebah mo', 
 An' tole us dat he got his start. 
 By preyin' on de po'." 
He sed, "he knuckled to no man, 
 No special set, or creed ; 
 An' felt lak all dem dats oppressed, 
 An' boun' down, should be freed." 
 He promised us prosperity, 
 De mills run day an' night. 
 An' loud he had no aim in life 
 'Cept treatin' uddahs right. 
 I walked rail slo' agoin' home, 
 Tried hard to dope it out ; 
 Fo' Smif had sho painted Jones black, 
 Jones blacken Smif, no doubt ; 
 I went to bed an' slep' on it, 
 Riz wid de mo'nin' sun. 
 An' figguhed it jes waistin' time. 
 To vote fo' eaddah one. 
 GRAMMAR 
 Trus' you wid mah secret, Eli ; ain' nobody else I'd tell ; 
 I's bin ten'in' Publick Night School, de teachah sez, I does

 I finds Fissack Kulcher easy, I kin write, an' I kin draw. 
 But in Grammah I's de biges' lunatic wid in de Law. 
 Wen we hab a class in Readin', I banks on a rail good mark ; 
 Figgahs ! figgahs calls me Pappy ! an' dey know me in de dark. 
 An' de Spellin's made to order, I's de king ob "Spellin' Bee"; 
 But de pro'nouns an' dem adverbs hab a heap ob fun wid me.

 Ob course, I knows de teachah know, so I inten' to try, 
 Aldough it sho hurts me to say, please han' it heah to I. 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN 
 Stand exalted! martyred Lincoln 
 Example of triumphant march 
 From humble birth, 
 To First Chair of the land. 
 Your deeds, a glowing tribute 
 To success ; honorably achieved. 
 By honest man 
 Despite the overwhelming odds. 
 Your words, like Phoenix, 
 Rise, o'er and o'er again. 
 From embers just their own. 
 And herald wisdom broadcast unto all. 
 A GHOST STORY 
 Ve jes pushed back frum our suppah, sweeten taters baked 
 wid poke, 
 V^'en somebody started beggin', deah Ant Dina, 'tell a joke ; 
 )r, else spin a yarn dat's frightin', or some strange out lan'ish 
 tale, 
 3out de mystic spooks an' goblins, or how Jonah fooled de 
 whale. 
 )en Ant Dina 'tole de chill'en, ef dey gaddah roun' reel clos', 
 he would tell dem de true story, 'bout Lem Lawson an' his 
 ghost ; 
 .n' she started et de 'ginnin', tole how Lem, a se'fish crank, 
 )iden' trus' a soul aliben, woulden' eben trus' de bank. 
 [e libed fo' se'f, all by hisse'f, way down in Jackson's hollah, 
 .n' in a ches' beneaf de fio' he hid 'way many a dollah. 
 rill finelee bad men cumed one day an' foun' his hidden' place ; 
 >ey tuk his money, ches, an' all, an' nevah lef no trace^ 
 •at night w'en po' Lem cum home, he brung a kupple mo', 
 o hide 'way ermong de res', in de ches' beneaf de flo' ; 
 ut, w'en he foun' his money gone, he cussed bof lef an' right ; 
 'is hair turned frum a raven black to snowy white dat night. 
He tuk a chair, sot right down, crossways ob de do', 
 Sleabs rolled up an' on his lap dar lay a fo'tee-fo' ; 
 He sot thar twenty days an' nights, dat's whut de neighbahs 
 sed ; 
 An' nevah ett or drunk a drap ; one day dey foun' him, dead. 
 Aftah while some strangah folks moved on Lawson's place, 
 An' w'en we tole em 'bout Lem's ghost, dey laff right in our 
 face ; 
 Called us fogey, tole us we bes' keep de 'vise we's gibin', 
 Dat dey had no feah fo' de dead ; an' much less fo' de libin. 
 Dem sma't Ellicks went to bed, but jes long 'bout midnight, 
 Ole Lem's ghost cum prowlin' 'roun' — it certnee served 'em 
 right ; 
 An' w'en dat ghost in low tone sed, "you thief, put back mah 
 money 
 I" 
 De joke tuk on a differn look, an' thin's warn't ha'f so funny. 
 Aldough dey wuz so all fired brave an' diden' feah de dead, 
 Dey lef mos' ebahthin' behine, dat mo'nin' w'en dey fled ; 
 An' I knows well an' certain' dat dey tuk de furstes' train. 
 An' swo' dey'd nevah sot a foot in dese heah parts again. 
 Nex' day de Sheriff hanged a sign down in de Market Space, 
 Reward in gold, fo' airy man dat stays on Lawson's place ; 
 Since den a many man hab tried, but nary singel soul 
 Has evah stayed dar all night long, so dey c'u'd get de gold. 
 In kase yo's out reel late et night an' Lem's ghost do appeah, 
 Tain't no use hollahin' he'p ! or drapin' dead ob feah ; 
 But jes' you walk straight backwards 'till you has counted 
 nine. 
 Den maik a cross, turn reel slo' roun' ; dat am de voodoo sign. 
 An' den you go right on yore way, an' don* you feah no harm. 
 No powah on earf kin hurt you w'en po'tected by de charm ; 
 An' now dat I has tole a tale accordin' to yore wishes, 
 Heah, Hezikiah ! talk dis towel an' dry yore auntie's dishes ! 
HOME AND MOTHER 
 I had a rail good, easy job, 
 valet fo' Mr. Lee ; 
 An' trabeled wid him mos' de time, 
 in style an' luxury ; 
 It looks lak I'd be satisfied, but 
 somehow I'd get blue, 
 Athinkin' 'bout mah country home, 
 an' mah dead muddah, too. 
 I's bin to London, seed de Thames, 
 aslippin' to de sea. 
 An' frum de Mediterranean, seen 
 sunny Italy ; 
 Done saw de Alpine's snow-capped 
 peaks, de Cata Combs ob Rome ; 
 But sabe mah soul, I jes' kaint find 
 no place lak mah home. 
 Done bin to China, India, too ; met 
 Japs, an' Senghaleese, 
 In Turkey saw de Sultan pass 
 his subjects on dere knees ; 
 Seen palaces wid golden tho'nes, 
 whar monarchs reign supreme ; 
 Still in de th'one room ob dis heart, 
 mah muddah am de queen. 
 Bin mong de wheat fields ob de norf, 
 down souf seed sugah cain ; 
 Done bin frum California's slopes to 
 chilly sho's ob Maine ; 
 In fact, I's bin mos' ebah whar, 
 furst one place, den anuddah. 
 Still I ain't foun' no place lak home, 
 an' no one lak mah muddah. 
TRUTH 
 Soiled and stained, a page in l.ifc's Book, 
 I tore from its place : 
 Next, I found a chapter smirched ; 
 It, too, I would erase. 
 Those shady spots have spoiled my book, 
 Can I the wrongs undo, 
 If, in rewriting, I omit 
 The ugly parts, I rue? 
 If I go where I am unknown. 
 To some strange distant land. 
 Where no one knows of "wild oats" sown, 
 Where I know not a man : 
 Should I deceive a world of men, 
 And bury deep my sin. 
 Am I not loser in the end? 
 It is not hid from Him. 
 Conscience cried, "Replace that leaf! 
 Before I brand you, liar, thief, 
 Withdraw your cloven hoof and naked tooth ! 
 Lay your false thought on yonder shelf, 
 Be honest with the world and self. 
 Far fairest of all virtue is the Truth." 
 REINCARNATION 
 They tell me I have lived before. 
 Trod this old earth in days of yore. 
 An elephant, or garter snake. 
 Can this be true, for goodness sake? 
 If spirits flit from things to things, 
 From insects into hearts of kings ; 
 Perhaps I may have been a whale, 
 Or just a creeping slimy snail. 
 Once a porupine, then horse, now man. 
 Far more than I can understand. 
 Though my past forms are naugh to me, 
 The rub is what I next will be. 
BLACKS IN BLUE 
 In Revolutionary days 
 A struggling nation, young, 
 Sent out a call for volunteers 
 With powder-horn and gun ; 
 When Betsy Ross unfurled the flag 
 They vowed to die or do, 
 And marched with Green in Jersey, 
 A few brave Blacks in Blue. 
 In the "War of Eighteen-twelve," 
 With Perry they stood well. 
 To save the day at New Orleans 
 They fought, they bled, and fell ; 
 In "Indian Wars" they took a part, 
 Helped make the "Iron clad's" crew, 
 They never took a backward step ; 
 Courageous Blacks in Blue. 
 In the "War of the Rebellion," 
 Ethiopia's son were there ; 
 Readily they served their country. 
 Willingly they did their share. 
 Their battle cry was "Victory !" 
 They knew no Waterloo ; 
 They cheered aloud 'mid bursting shell, 
 Fearless Blacks in Blue. 
 In the cruel "Civil War," 
 Far worse than all others ; 
 Fathers fought against their sons, 
 And brothers fought their brothers. 
 At Gettysburg and Bloody Run, 
 Their bleeding bodies strew 
 The battlefield, to others free ; 
 Unflinching Blacks in Blue. 
In Cuba and the Philippines 
 Their deeds of valor won, 
 Remember how they rescued 
 The Colonel, at San Juan ; 
 Above a block house on the hill 
 They raised their "colors true," 
 Then lent aid to the shattered "Sixth" — 
 Gallant Blacks in Blue. 
 In Nineteen-sixteen with Old Glory 
 They marched into Mexico; 
 And at Carrizal, outnumbered, 
 Bravely faced a deadly foe ; 
 The acid test of time has tried them, 
 Tried and found them solid, through. 
 And there never was a traitor 
 Found among the Blacks in Blue. 
 DR. MASON 
 Broad-minded, far-seeing champion so brave, 
 A nation sheds hot tears for you ; 
 The Pilot, who boarded a doomed ship to save. 
 The soul of an awe-stricken crew. 
 Scholar, guardian, brother to men. 
 His whole life embedded in work; 
 For others he labored to life's very end, 
 No man ever knew him to shirk. 
 Gallant, courageous, unselfish in thought. 
 Foremost in his mind dwelt the cause ; 
 Around us we see many wonders he wrought, 
 Never ceasing 'till death bade him pause. 
 Composed, alert, unafraid on that day. 
 Watched the shadows of earth growing dim ; 
 Heard a voice from afar calling, "Come, don't delay !" 
 Saw a finger above beckon him. 
TURN'T ERROWN' 
 Las' Sunday mo'nin', ha'f pas' eight, 
 Wid fishin' pole an' can ob bait, 
 I met de good ole decon, Jackson Bole ; 
 Sez he to me, "look heah, youn' man, 
 Whut has you hab in dat ar' can. 
 An' whar you gwine wid dat bamboo pole ?" 
 I stood dar feelin' mighty small, 
 Kaze I had nary 'scuse et all ; 
 De decon he done cotched me dead to right ; 
 Inste'd ob'tentin' Sunday School, 
 Aslippin' to de fishin' pool. 
 He tole me dat I stood in mah own light. 
 Den in his slo' offhan'ed way. 
 De right an' wrong befo' me lay, 
 An' tole me whut a man mah pap had bin ; 
 Lowd he knowed well mah pap would rave, 
 Would turn plum obah in his grave, 
 Ef he knowed I comited sech a sin. 
 Den he sed, "Sonny, if you wish, 
 Dar's six 'hole days dat you kin fish. 
 An' onlee one dat breaks de Marstah's rule ; 
 So, why not cum go 'long wid me 
 An' git salvashun while it's free. 
 Or would you raddah be de debbel's tool?" 
 I grabed holt Jackson by de han', 
 Tole him dat I laked his stan', 
 Draped mah fishin' pole an' can ob bait ; 
 Ax him please take me erlong 
 Wid him to jine dat do right throng 
 Dats marchin' onward to de Golden Gate. 
A LEADER 
 Give us a man ! who takes a stand and fights ; 
 Who cringes not, contending for his rights. 
 Who holds his Cause above all personal gain, 
 And boldly bids for place in world's acclaim. 
 Give us a man ! who looks beyond to-day, 
 Who finds the hidden haunts where dangers lay ; 
 Who leaves no stone unturned, 'till he 
 Has lead his forces on, triumphantly ! 
 Give us a man ! who sees be3^ond his nose, 
 Who wails not o'er spilt milk or passing woes ; 
 Whose courage spark no flaunter's threat can dim, 
 And we will gladly follow after him. 
 ASHES OF LOVE 
 Lost far beyond voice of recall, lost is Life's richest prize ; 
 The merry song in discord falls, the sunlight dims and dies. 
 Fond precious treasure, priceless Love ! naught e'er can take 
 your place ; 
 The field of pleasure you were once, to-day is barren waste. 
 Like midnight's pleasant dream you fled, you left me thus, 
 alone ; 
 With my eyes welled in scalding tears and heavy heart of 
 stone ; 
 O cruel Fate ! please tell me why you dealt the wicked blow ; 
 Why did you give me it to lose ; why did you treat me so? 
 Ls there no place for weary souls, who would no longer stay, 
 Where all they ever sought to hold, was rudely torn away? 
 W'hen Love's bright fire is cold and dead, ashes remain, no 
 doubt ; 
 Remain to mock an aching heart ; "Ashes of Love" burned out. 
HEARTBROKEN 
 Sorrow, suffering, 
 Misery, pain ; 
 Soul-racking torture, 
 Again, and again. 
 Near stifling sobs. 
 Deep piercing sighs. 
 Fast falling tears 
 Burning my eyes. 
 Alas — it is broken, 
 I hold the parts ; 
 Is there a tinker 
 Who mends broken hearts? 
 "While enlarging the capital "I" remember, the tops of to- 
 day are often the bottoms of to-morrow." 
 "When you have aimed high, aim higher ; when you have 
 done your duty, do a bit more." 
 THE BRAGGARD 
 I sho' dislak a man dat feels 
 Lak he's aturnin' all de wheels, 
 An' ef his little mill shets down. 
 Den dis 'hole worl' quit goin' roun' ; 
 Dar's plenty good men cumin' on. 
 An' heaps dat's done bin heah, an' gone, 
 So I ain' bragin', undahstan', 
 I's meerlee talkin', man to man. 
 I taiks good care ob whut I git, 
 Does mah bes' to maik en's fit; 
 Patch mah klose, ha'f sole mah shoes, 
 Don' wais' nothin' I kin use ; 
 Ain' no slabe to grub or drink, 
 Ain' no miser, don' you think 
 Dat I is se'fish, kaze I's not; 
 Glad to he'p dem whut ain' got. 
'Ten's mail church nios' all de time, 
 Ob each dollah gibs a dime ; 
 Lubs to len' a he'pin' han' 
 To mos' airy 'zerbin' man. 
 Mah barn lof plum' full ob hay, 
 Got a few cents tucked erway ; 
 Sun ain' gwine to shine always, 
 Boun' to be some rainy days. 
 Jes' a word 'bout Emeline, 
 She dat faifful wife ob mine ; 
 Putty, no sah ! bless yore sole. 
 She's de las'in' kine whut hole ; 
 Good an' hones' gal lak yores, 
 Heart ez big ez all out doors ; 
 "She kin cook, man ! She kin bake 
 Co'nbread, taste lak angel cake. 
 I nevah brag on whut I own, 
 Sellem speak erbout mah home ; 
 Six rooms, toilet, baf complete ; 
 Koncrete cellahs, furnace heat. 
 All mah stock am fit an' fine, 
 Ain' fur frum de tractshun line ; 
 Dar's no finah place erroun'. 
 An' bless you, paid fo' ebah poun'. 
 You notice how dem wid de mos' 
 Has no time to brag or boas', 
 While dem dat jes' do barlee lib. 
 Plenty free etvice kin gib ; 
 Aldough Ps shame to menshun it, 
 Ps 'cumulated quite a bit; 
 Ps room to brag ez sho' yo's born 
 But Ps no han' to blow mah horn. 
 "Don't discord ; if you can't harmonize, don't sing." 
 "Death is but a tunnel between Life uncertain and Life 
 everlasting." 
PRICE HILL 
 Wen I wuz jes a little lad 
 On de Hill; 
 I cut pranks bof good an' bad, 
 On de Hill ; 
 In de "Rabbit Grass,'' or lot, 
 Or some uddah precious spot. 
 Far too deah, to be fo'got ; 
 On de Hill. 
 Aftah while thin's grew rail dry. 
 On de Hill; 
 Same ole cronnies, woods, an' sky, 
 On deHill; 
 Huntin' fo' de busy whirl, 
 I w'en out into de worl', 
 Lef mah muddah, an' mah girl ; 
 On de Hill. 
 I seed thin's I nevah seen, 
 On de Hill ; 
 Lak de grass I sho wor green, 
 On de Hill; 
 W'en dey opened up mah eyes, 
 Made me sho nuff worl'ly wise, 
 I cud miss de tendah ties. 
 On de Hill. 
 A feelin' cum I nevah had 
 On deHill; 
 I nevah thought ob feelin' bad, 
 On de Hill; 
 Feets hanged heavy in dair track, 
 Helf an' strength begun to crack ; 
 Mighty glad to amble back. 
 On de Hill. 
I find honey in de breeze, 
 Onde Hill; 
 Find rail 'holesome rest an' ease, 
 On de Hill; 
 Dar is somethin' I cain't tell, 
 Gibs me hopes ob gettin' well, 
 Mebbe its de home lak smell, 
 On de Hill. 
 ALMIGHTY GOD 
 If God is not, then who is He, 
 Who reigns above, majestically. 
 Who sees us through the night and day. 
 Who leads us safely all the way? 
 Who makes the moon shine from afar. 
 Who controls each twinkling star. 
 Who gives us day, and who the night, 
 Who fills the sun with radiant light? 
 Who placed the coolness in the breeze, 
 Who hung the fruit upon the trees. 
 Who put the fish in yonder brook. 
 Who planted wild flowers in the nook? 
 Who fills the field with golden grain. 
 Who causes draught, who sends the rain, 
 Who towers the lofty mountains high. 
 Who made the earth, the sea, and sky? 
 Who sends the rushing rivers on. 
 Who gave the little bird his song, 
 Who scattered islands in the sea. 
 Who gave this life to you and me ? 
 If God is not, then who is He — 
 E'er at the helm doth pilot thee? 
 Who destines us as on we plod ? 
 'Tis just Thy power, Almighty God ! 
A LETTER 
 Mearch de fiff, nineteen an' two ;

 An' Hon, dem crosses stan' fo' kisses, 
 In de place ob dose I misses. 
EASTER MORN' 
 Merry bells since daybreak pealed, 
 The sun is shining bright ; 
 Fair lillies blooming in the field 
 Bedeck the earth in white. 
 Sweet strains from a distant choir 
 Fall softly on my ear, 
 The Anthem sets my soul afire 
 With Easter's loving cheer. 
 I'm wafted back long years ago 
 To where my Savior died ; 
 To save soul from eternal woe. 
 The Lord was crucified. 
 I seem to see the silent tomb. 
 Where Redeemer lay, 
 'Till angels had dispelled the gloom 
 And rolled the stone away. 
 I venture to the entrance dim, 
 I seek Him in His prison. 
 An angel's voice speaks from within, 
 "Behold, the Lord is risen !" 
 With joy all earth and heaven sing, 
 Bid trumpeters proclaim. 
 All hail ! unto the risen King, 
 The Savior lives again ! 
 FAITH 
 Where I was before here I came, I know not ; 
 Nor does it worry me now that I am ; 
 But where I go when here I leave, puzzles me ; 
 The groping in that vast uncertainty. 
 O ! seething brain, dispel all thoughts of fear ; 
 Borrow not from doubt those dreams so weird ; 
 Go ! buckle on your coat of faith and with a trust renewed, 
 Unflinchingly embrace eternity ! 
MUDDAH WIT 
 Whar I growed up dar wor no school, 
 'twuz je' a lonesome wood ; 
 An' all de learnin' dat I got, 
 I got bes' way I c'u'd ; 
 By watchin' rail close now an' den 
 I'd cotch a little bit, 
 An' den I'd add some commin' senses, 
 erlong wid muddah wit. 
 I nevah had no Gogofee, ain' 
 seed no Rifmatick, 
 To 'splain de layin' ob de Ian', 
 an' how to count up quick ; 
 But, w'en I wuz jes' 'bout so big, 
 mebbe a leetle biggah, 
 Mah muddah wit cum to mah 
 aid, an' learnt me how to figgah. 
 I ain' had no Victroll to show 
 me how to sing, 
 Nor music book wid lines an' 
 dots, an' dat ar' sort a t'ing; 
 Sitin' neaf de pariah windah, I 
 would ketch de words rail soon, 
 Den muddah wit would cvim erlong 
 an' 'sply me wid de tune. 
 Dat eddiecashun sho am fine, 
 I's willin' to etmit ; 
 Still, I conten's you ain' much force, 
 wid out yore muddah wit ; 
 'Sides, dar is 'hole heaps dat you learn. 
 dat's writ in no man's books ; 
 An' some dat don' know, A frum B ; 
 make mighty fus' class cooks. 
THE GARDEN OF LIFE 
 We must work well the soil in the Garden of Life, 
 From the best in our store we must sow ; 
 With love's honest toil 
 We must then till the soil 
 So the fruit of our labor will show. 
 With pure, honest thoughts let us fertilize, 
 From fond loving hearts, irrigate ; 
 With care, let us hoe 
 Every row as we go ; 
 Let us uproot the rank weed of hate. 
 When "harvest time" comes and the golden grain's ripe, 
 For a duty well done. He will bless us ; 
 And sweet flowers we grew 
 Will be waiting, 'tis true, 
 At the end of the road to refresh us. 
 THE TOILER 
 Toil, toil, toil, the days goes by, 
 And what have I ? 
 A dull abode, a single loaf, a solid cot, 
 On which I lie. 
 Toil, toil, toil, 'till night shades fall ; 
 What have I won? 
 A bit of rest, then rise to toil anew 
 'Neath blazing sun. 
 Toil, toil, toil, 'till honest sweat 
 In beads, upon my brow does stand ; 
 And my reward — a tattered coat, 
 A cobbled shoe, a blistered hand. 
 On I will toil, a willing toiler; 
 In usefulness true worth is shown ; 
 Had I not better wear out toiling. 
 Than to rust, an idle drone? 
 "Perseverance is the mother of success." 
COFFEE GROUN' CHLOE 
 Sebenth daughtah ob de sebenth, 
 Born beneaf de mistick vail ; 
 On lebenth day ob month de lebenth, 
 Marked wid signs dat nevah fail. 
 She kin tell yore future histree, 
 'Deed, dar's nothin' she doan know, 
 An' de darkist hidden mistree, 
 Ain' no mistree 'tall to Chloe. 
 FIGHTING TIME 
 I care not for the clash of steel. 
 Nor, for a blood drenched battlefield ; 
 I find no music in the cannon's roar, 
 I do not fancy shrieking shell, 
 That falls, to burst a blinding Hell ; 
 Would I might dwell in peace for evermore. 
 Although peace loving, I admit, 
 I also boast some sand and grit. 
 And hate a coward like a coiling snake. 
 A man is no man who won't fight 
 When Honor, Freedom, Home and Right, 
 And Liberty and Justice are at stake. 
 GINOLIGY 
 I's sebenty-two an' feelin' good, 
 Kin jump plum' ofif de groun' ; 
 Does enythin' I evah could, 
 Speals now an' den up town ; 
 De tem'pence folks maik et appeah 
 Lak it's a powahful sin ; 
 Jes let em rave, I has no feah ! 
 To-night, I talks on Gin. 
I minds mah bissness all de time, 
 Don' bothah nary soul ; 
 Mah disposishun sho am fine, 
 Mah hearts ez pure ez gold. 
 I nevah tries to gib etvice, 
 Jes does de bes' I kin ; 
 An' nevah argues 'bout de price, 
 De gin man ast fo' Gin. 
 I does not borrie, nevah len', 
 Tries hard to do whut's right ; 
 I knows I is mah own bes' fren'; 
 An' keeps dat fack in sight. 
 Wen Small Pox circlin' roun' erbout 
 An' Moanah's in de win', 
 I 'tects mahse'f fo' I goes out 
 By takin' on some Gin. 
 Gin am a tonic, good an' true, 
 Sho brace you up, alright! 
 But, ef it gits de bes' ob you, 
 Yo's in a sad, sad plight ; 
 So, ef you kain't kintrol yorese'f, 
 Stop now ! fo' you begin ; 
 An' leabs dat bottle on de she'f, 
 You dar not fool mid Gin ! 
 I always keeps it ni' et han', 
 De vera bes' dat's sold, 
 Kaze it has he'ped a many man. 
 Breaks up a rail bad cold ; 
 An' ef you talks a sip et night. 
 You nevah will grow thin, 
 Yo'll fine Gin deals wid you alright, 
 Ef you deals right wid Gin. 
DE TES' 
 At a hi' tone berfday party, 
 Giben fo' Miss Winnie Lane, 
 Lonnie Johnson, Winnie s sweetheart, 
 Mist his bran' new watch an' chain. 
 Backed his se'f up in de do'way, 
 Grim determin' on his face ; 
 Sed, "he mus' hab his belongin's 
 'Fo'e a sole c'u'd leab de place." 
 "I ain't got it!" Jeff Blue shouted. 
 "You kin search me, ' Dode Smif sed. 
 Some de uddahs got ixcited, 
 Uddahs stood an' shuck dai'r head. 
 Den up speaks ole Bruddah Homah, 
 "I kin Stan' it! kin de res'? 
 Fetch de roostah an' de ine pot 
 An' we'll all go thoo de tes'. 
 Right erway de hostess, Winnie, 
 Furm de kitchen brung a pot; 
 In de meantime, Winnie's Pappy 
 Ushered in his prize Wine Dot. 
 Den Bur Homah sed, "de Scriptahs 
 Tole how Petah cum to grief. 
 An' dat ebah liben' roostah 
 Knowed a liar an' a thief." 
 Put de roostah 'neaf de ine pot, 
 In de middle ob de flo' ; 
 W'en de thievin' villin tech it 
 Dat ar bird am boun' to cro'. 
 Fall in line an' put de light out, 
 Start to marchin' frum de spot ; 
 An' let ebah body passin' 
 Lay a han' erpon de pot. 
 Aftah dey had all marched by it, 
 Bruddah Homah lit de light; 
 Ast deni hole dair han' pams upward, 
 So de charm c'u'd work out right. 
 Den, he sed, "de roostah tells me 
 Jeff Blue am de guilty man. 
 An' he knows it jes bekazen 
 Dar's no smut erpon his han'." 
LITTLE GIRL 
 Tears are falling, I am sad, 
 Little Girl ; 
 You were everything I had, 
 Little Girl ; 
 To your grave alone, I steal. 
 Bare my head and humbly kneel, 
 While I tell Him how I feel, 
 Little Girl. 
 Every joy on earth in one, 
 Little Girl ; 
 Sweetheart, wife, companion, chum, 
 Little Girl ; 
 Seems I see your dear face still. 
 Seems I feel that same old thrill, 
 I believe I always will. 
 Little Girl. 
 Ere long He will call me, too. 
 Little Girl ; 
 Call me Home, to Him, and you, 
 Little Girl ; 
 Everlasting peace we'll share. 
 Free from sorrow, pain and care ; 
 There will be no parting there. 
 Little Girl. 
 EMANCIPATORS 
 Black America! In Fame's Hall go place 
 This group ; where naught can e'er erase 
 A single noble character, or dim one glorious deed ; 
 For they were sowers of the seed — 
John Brown, at Harper's Ferry, amid his gallant boys : 
 Elijah Lovejoy, who gave all, at Alton, Illinois; 
 And Lincoln, martyred Lincoln ! Felled by a traitor's blow ; 
  Douglass, Phillips, Garrison, 
 and Harriet Beecher Stowe. 
LATE DAY CHILLEN 
 It's purfeck scanluss how de chillen 
 Pleges de oldah folks now days ;

 Dey say: "I is antdelouvin. 
 An' dat dey's fruni modern schools," 
 But, I tells em sometimes learnin' 
 Turns sma't Ellicks into fools. 
Wondah whar mah baby, Linda? 
 Look up yondah et de clock! 
 Ni' two hours since school has lef out 
 An' it's jes erroun' de block; 
 Dat chile spiled kaze she de baby, 
 She thinks she is cute an' smart. 
 Dough I doesen' lak to do it, 
 I mus' stop her, fo' she start. 
 Arabella, jes' turned sixteen, 
 Growed up lady, havin' bows ; 
 Runnin' roun' in dead ob Avintah 
 Mos' time wid out propah kloze ; 
 Dat gal am so' hi' fo'lutin'.

Introduction
The poems in this book are intensely feminine and for me this means more than anything else that they are deeply human. We are yet scarcely aware, in spite of our boasted twentieth-century progress, of what lies deeply hidden, of mystery and passion, of domestic love and joy and sorrow, of romantic  visions and practical ambitions, in the heart  of a woman. The emancipation of woman is  yet to be wholly accomplished; though  woman has stamped her image on every age  of the world's history, and in the heart of  almost every man since time began, it is only  a little over half of a century since she has  either spoke or acted with a sense of freedom.  During this time she has made little more  than a start to catch up with man in the  wonderful things he has to his credit; and yet  all that man has to his credit would scarcely  have been achieved except for the devotion  and love and inspiring comradeship of woman.   Here, then, is lifted the veil, in these poignant songs and lyrics. To look upon  what is revealed is to give one a sense of  infinite sympathy; to make one kneel in spirit to the marvelous patience, the wonderful endurance, the persistent faith, which are  hidden in this nature.
   The heart of a woman falls back with the night.  
   And enters some alien cage in its plight,  
   And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars  
   While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.   
 
sings the poet.
   And the songs of the singer
   Are tones that repeat
   The cry of the heart
   Till it ceases to beat.
 
This verse just quoted is from "The Dreams of the Dreamer," and with the previous quotation tells us that this woman's heart is keyed in the plaintive, knows the sorrowful agents of life and experience which knock and enter at the door of dreams. But women have made the saddest songs of the world, Sappho no less than Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Ruth the Moabite poetess gleaning in the fields of Boaz no less than Amy Levy, the Jewess who broke her heart against the London pavements; and no less does sadness echo its tender and appealing sigh in these songs and lyrics of Georgia Douglas Johnson. But sadness is a kind of felicity with woman,  paradoxical as it may seem; and it is so because through this inexplicable felicity they  touched, intuitionally caress, reality.
 
So here engaging life at its most reserved sources, whether the form or substance through which it articulates be nature, or the seasons, touch of hands or lips, love, desire, or any of the emotional abstractions which sweep like fire or wind or cooling water through the blood, Mrs. Johnson creates just that reality of woman's heart and experience with astonishing raptures. It is a kind of privilege to know so much about the secrets of woman's nature, a privilege all the more to be cherished when given, as in these poems,  with such exquisite utterance, with such a  lyric sensibility.

The Heart of a Woman
The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam
In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.
 
The heart of a woman falls back with the night,
And enters some alien cage in its plight,
And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.
Gossamer
The dreams of the dreamer
Are life-drops that pass
 
The break in the heart
To the soul’s hour-glass.
 
The songs of the singer
Are tones that repeat
 
The cry of the heart
'Till it ceases to beat.
The Dreams of the Dreamer
The dreams of the dreamer
   Are life-drops that pass
 
The break in the heart
   To the soul’s hour-glass.
 
The songs of the singer
   Are tones that repeat
 
The cry of the heart
   'Till it ceases to beat.
   
Sympathy
My joy leaps with your ecstasy,
   In sympathy divine;
The smiles that wreathe upon your lips.
   Find sentinels on mine:
 
Your lightest sigh I'm echoing,
   I tremble with your pain,
And all your tears are falling
   In my heart like bitter rain.
Contemplation
We stand mute!
No words can paint such fragile imagery,
Those prismic gossamers that roll
Beyond the sky-line of the soul;
We stand mute!
Dead Leaves
The breaking dead leaves 'neath my feet
A plaintive melody repeat,
Recalling shattered hopes that lie
As relics of a bygone sky.
 
Again I thread the mazy past,
Back where the mounds are scattered fast -
Oh! foolish tears, why do you start,
To break of dead leaves in the heart?
Dawn
Trailing night's sand-sifted stars,
Rainbows sweep, as day unbars.
Fragrant essences of morn,
Bathe humanity — new-born!
Elevation
There are highways in the soul,
   Heights like pyramids that rise
   Far beyond earth-veiled eyes,
   Sweeping through the barless skies
O'er the line where daylight dies —
There are highways in the soul!
Whither?
Minutes swiftly throb and pass,
   Shadows cross the dial-glass,
Speeding ever to some call,
   Weary world and shadows, all.
 
Down the closing aisles of day,
   Tramping footsteps die away,
But no tidings thread the gloom,
   From the hushed and silent tomb.
   
   
Quest
The phantom happiness I sought
   O'er every crag and moor;
 
I paused at every postern gate,
   And knocked at every door;
 
In vain I searched the land and sea,
   E'en to the inmost core,
 
The curtains of eternal night
   Descend — my search is o'er.
Mate
Our separate winding ways we trod,
Along the highways, unto God,
Unbonded by the clasp of hand,
Without a vow — we understand.
Estranged for aye, the fusing kiss.
Omnipotent, we bide in this —
They need no trammeling of bars
Whose souls were welded with the stars.
Emblems
A wordless kiss, a stifled sigh,
A trembling lip, a downcast eye,
   "Alas," they say,
   "A-day, a-day,"
The cruse has failed, the lamp must die!
Mirrored
When lone and solitaire within your chamber,
   With lamp unlit, as evening shades unroll.
If you reveal the trail your thoughts are taking,
   I then may read the riddle of your soul.
 
For it is then, the tired mind unveiling,
   Drifts stark into the holy after-glow.
Within the hour of quiet meditation.
   The tidal thoughts, like limpid waters, flow.
Pent
The rain is falling steadily
   Upon the thirsty earth,
While dry-eyed, I remain, and calm
   Amid my own heart's dearth.
 
Break! break! ye flood-gates of my tears
   All pent in agony,
Rain, rain! upon my scorching soul
   And flood it as the sea! 
Pages from Life
Not for your tender eyes that shine,
Nor for your red lips pulsing wine,
I love you, dear: your soul divine.
In sweet captivity, holds mine!
. . .
The tender eyes have lost their glow,
The flagons of the lips run low.
The autumn trembles in the air, —
A woman passes solitaire!
Recall
Winter — aback sweeps the inward eye,
Fleet o'er the trail to a rose-wreathed sky,
Girt by a cordon of dreams I dwell
Deep in the heart of the old-time spell.
 
Almost, the tones of your whispered word,
Almost! the thrill that your dear lips stirred,
Almost!! that wild pulsing throb again —
Almost!!! —
      ('Tis winter, the falling rain).
      
      
Foredoom
Her life was dwarfed, and wed to blight,
Her very days were shades of night,
Her every dream was born entombed.
Her soul, a bud, — that never bloomed.
Peace
I rest me deep within the wood,
   Drawn by its silent call,
Far from the throbbing crowd of men
   On nature's breast I fall.
 
My couch is sweet with blossoms fair,
   A bed of fragrant dreams,
And soft upon my ear there falls
   The lullaby of streams.
 
The tumult of my heart is stilled,
   Within this sheltered spot.
Deep in the bosom of the wood.
   Forgetting, and — forgot!
Despair
The curtains of twilight are drawn in the west
   And vespers are sweet on the air,
While I, through my leafless, ungarlanded way
   But pause at the gates of despair.
 
Good-bye to the hopes that were never fulfilled,
   Good-bye to the fond dreams that failed.
Good-bye to my dead that has never been born.
   Good-bye to love's ship that ne'er sailed.
Eventide
The silence of the brooding night,
Enfolds me with its eerie light;
I lie upon its shadowed breast
A pilgrim, wearying for rest
 
Nightfall! thy sable curtains steep
My very soul in solace deep,
God sends thee with thy soothing balms,
That I may falter to thy arms.
Gethsemane
Into the garden of sorrow,
Some day we all must roam,
If not to-day, then to-morrow,
Bow 'neath its purple dome.
Out from the musk-laden banqueting halls,
Doffing our mirth-spangled vestments like thralls,
Softly we wend to Gethsemane,
In the hour that sorrow calls!
Gilead
Walk within thy own heart's temple, child, and rest,
What you seek abides forever in thy breast.
Closer than thy folded arm
Is the soul-renewing-balm,
Walk within thy own heart's temple, child, and rest.
Impelled
Athwart the sky the great sun sails,
Through aeons thus, the daylight trails,
And man, living breath of the sod
Beholding, in his heart knows God.
 
Throughout the night's long brooding deep,
Earth's trustful children die-to-sleep.
But with the whisperings of morn
Awake, unto the day, new-born.
 
The mystery of earth untold,
The great infinite, none behold,
Forge ever new the spiral chain,
Revolving man to God again.
In Quest
With the first blush of morning, my soul is awing,
Away o'er the phantom lands free, wandering,
I seek thee in hamlet, in woodland, and hall.
Till night-shades, enfolding my tired heart, fall.
 
Yet ever and alway, like the thrush in a tree.
My heart lifts its preluding love-song to thee;
I call through the days, through the long weary years.
And slumber at night-fall, refreshed by my tears.
Inevitably
There's nothing in the world that clings
As does a memory that stings;
While happy hours fade and pass,
Like shadows in a looking-glass.
Isolation
Alone! yes, evermore alone — isolate each his way,
Though hand is echoing to hand vain sophistries of clay.
Within that veilèd, mystic place where bides the inmost soul,
No twain shall pass while tides shall wax, nor changing seasons roll.
 
Enisled, apart our pilgrimage, despite the arms that twine.
Despite the fusing kiss that wields the magic charm of wine.
Despite the interplay of sigh, the surge of sympathy.
We tread in solitude remote, the trail of destiny!
Joy
There's a soft rosy glow o’er the whole world to-day,
There's a freshness and fragrance that trembles in May,
There's a lilt in the music that vibrates and thrills
From the uttermost glades to the tops of the hills.
 
Oh! I am so happy, my heart is so light.
The shades and the shadows have vanished from sight,
This wild pulsing gladness throbs like a sweet pain —
O soul of me, drink, ere night falleth again!
Memory
Love's roses I gathered, all dewy, in May,
My heart holds the breath of their attar to-day;
And now, while the blasts of the winter winds ring,
I hear not the tempest, Tm dreaming of Spring.
Modulations
The petals of the faded rose
   Commingle silently,
One with the atoms of the dust,
   One with the chaliced sea. -
 
The essence of my fleeting youth
   Caught in the web of time,
Exhales within the springing flowers
   Or breathes in love sublime.
   
   
Omega
The fragile fabric of our dream
Drifts as a feather down life's stream
The long defile of empty days
Grim silhouetted, mock my gaze.
 
Though oft escapes the stifled sigh,
A desert ever broods my eye —
Since you have utterly forgot,
God grant that I remember not!
Poetry
Behold! the living thrilling lines
That course the blood like madd'ning wines,
And leap with scintillating spray
Across the guards of ecstasy.
The flame that lights the lurid spell
Springs from the soul's artesian well,
Its fairy filament of art
Entwines the fragments of a heart.
Posthumous
Of what avail the tardy showers,
To the famished summer flowers?
All in vain the rain-drops cry,
Dead things never make reply.
 
Life's belated cup of bliss,
Woo the weary lips to kiss,
When the singing is a sigh.
Pulses quivering, to die.
Query
Is she the sage who will not sip
The cup love presses to her lip?
Or she who drinks the mad cup dry,
And turns with smiling face — to die?
Recompense
Roses after rain,
Pleasure after pain,
Happiness will soothe the sigh,
Smiles await the tear-dimmed eye
Bloom will follow blight,
Daylight trails the night,
Life is sweeter
Love is deeper
In the heart's twilight!
Repulse
Nobody cares when I am glad,
      I beat upon their hearts in glee,
   "Drink, drink joy's brimming cup with me,"
   All echoless, my ecstasy —
Nobody cares when I am glad.
 
Nobody cares when I am sad,
      Whene'er I seek compassion's breast,
   I falter wounded from my quest
   Back! back into my heart, sore prest —
Nobody cares when I am sad.
Rhythm
Oh, my fancy teems with a world of dreams, —
   They revolve in a glittering fire,
How they twirl and go with the tunes that flow
   On the breath of my soul-strung lyre.
   
   
Smothered Fires
A woman with a burning flame
   Deep covered through the years
With ashes. Ah! she hid it deep,
   And smothered it with tears.
 
Sometimes a baleful light would rise
   From out the dusky bed,
And then the woman hushed it quick
   To slumber on, as dead.
 
At last the weary war was done
   The tapers were alight,
And with a sigh of victory
   She breathed a soft — good-night!
Supreme
The fairest lips are those we kiss,
With greatest ecstasy and bliss;
The brightest eyes, are those that shine,
Unchangingly through changing time;
The greatest love is that we know.
When life is just an afterglow.
Sympathy
My joy leaps with your ecstasy,
   In sympathy divine;
The smiles that wreathe upon your lips.
   Find sentinels on mine:
 
Your lightest sigh I'm echoing,
   I tremble with your pain,
And all your tears are falling
   In my heart like bitter rain.
   
Tears and Kisses
There are tears sweet, refreshing like dewdrops that rise,
There are tears far too deep for the lakes of the eyes.
 
There are kisses like thistledown, fitfully sped,
There are kisses that live in the hearts of the dead.
The Measure
Fierce is the conflict — the battle of eyes,
Sure and unerring, the wordless replies,
Challenges flash from their ambushing caves
Men, by their glances, are masters or slaves.
Thrall
Fragile, tiny, just a sprite,
Holding me a thrall bedight,
Stronger than a giant's wand
Serves the word of your command.
 
Out from rushing worlds, though low
Should you whisper, I would know,
And would answer, though the breath
Be the gateway unto death.
Tired
I’m tired, days and nights to me
Drag on in slow monotony,
With not a single star in sight
To lend a gleam of cheering light.
 
I'm tired, there are none to care
That I am drifting to despair:
O shadows! take me to your breast
For I am tired — I would rest.
What Need Have I For Memory?
What need have I for memory,
   When not a single flower
Has bloomed within life's desert
   For me, one little hour.
 
What need have I for memory
   Whose burning eyes have met
The corse of unborn happiness
   Winding the trail regret?
   
   
When I Am Dead
When I am dead, withhold, I pray, your blooming legacy;
Beneath the willows did I bide, and they should cover me;
I longed for light and fragrance, and I sought them far and near,
O, it would grieve me utterly, to find them on my bier!
  
Whene'er I Lift My Eyes to Bliss
Whene'er I lift my eyes to bliss,
   I stagger blind with pain,
Afar into the folding night
   The silence, and the rain.
 
Whene'er I feel the urge of Spring,
   A throbbing, unknown woe
Enfolds me; I am desolate
   When love is calling low.
Where?
I called you through the silent night
   Across the brooding deep,
I sought you in the shadowland
   From out the world — asleep;
 
No answer echoed to my call,
   And now my way I thread
About the lowly mounds that rise
   Among the silent dead.
 
Though voiceless, you will hear my call,
   Your soul will heed my cry.
Will rise, and mock the prison where
   Your bones recumbent lie.
Youth
The dew is on the grasses, dear,
The blush is on the rose.
And swift across our dial-youth,
A shifting shadow goes.
 
The primrose moments, lush with bliss,
Exhale and fade away,
Life may renew the Autumn time,
But nevermore the May!

WAVERLEY TURNER CARMICHAEL 
WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY

INTRODUCTION 
When Waverley Carmichael, as a student in 
my summer class at Harvard, brought me one 
day a modest sheaf of his poems, I felt that in 
him a race had become or at least was becoming 
articulate. We have had, it is true, sympa 
thetic portrayals of Negro life and feeling from 
without; we have had also the poems of Dun- 
bar, significant of the high capabilities of the 
Negro as he advances far along the way of 
civilization and culture. The note which is 
sounded in this little volume is of another sort. 
These humble and often imperfect utterances 
have sprung up spontaneously from the soul of a 
primitive and untutored folk. The rich emo 
tion, the individual humor, the simple wisdom, 
the naive faith which are its birthright, have 
here for the first time found voice. It is suffi 
cient to say of Waverley Carmichael that he is 
a full blooded southern negro, that until last 
summer he has never been away from his 
native Alabama, that he has had but the most 
limited advantages of education, and that he 
has shared the portion of his race in hardship, 
poverty, and toil. He does not know why he 
wrote these poems. It is an amazing thing 
that he should have done so a freak, we may 
call it, of the wind of genius, which bloweth 
where it listeth and singles out one in ten thou 
sand to find a fitting speech for the dumb 
thought and feeling of the rest. 
But we need not base the claim of Carmichael 
to the attention of the public merely on con- 
Ivii] 
siderations of this sort. His work speaks for 
itself. It is original and sincere. It follows 
no traditions and suffers no affectation. It is 
artless, yet it reaches the goal of art. The 
rhythms, especially of some of the religious 
pieces, are of a kind which is beyond the reach 
of effort. He has rightly called them melodies. 
Occasionally there is, it seems to me, a touch of 
something higher, as in the haunting refrain of 
the lyric " Winter is Coming." 
De yaller leafs are falling fas 
Fur summer days is been and pas ; 
The air is blowin mighty cold, 
Like it done in days of old. 
But this is rare. Oftenest the characteristic 
note is humor, or tender melancholy relieved 
by a philosophy of cheer and courage, and the 
poetic virtue is that of simple truth. We are 
reminded of no poet so strongly as of Burns. 
What Waverley Carmichael may accomplish 
in the future I do not know. But certainly 
in this volume he has entitled himself to the 
gratitude of his own race and to the sympathetic 
appreciation of all who have its interests and 
those of true poetry at heart.

DE SIGNS O SPRING 
Wen de thrushes in de tree 
Gins to sing a merry song, 
Its a putty good ole sign 
Dat de winter days aint long. 
Wen de trees begin to bud 
In de meadow far an near; 
You kin put yo foot erpoun it 
Dat spring time is comin hyeah. 
All de flowers in de woods 
Gins to look so sweet an dear; 
An de darkies all are singin 
Cause dey kno dat spring is hyeah. 
Wen de days are growin warm, 
You kin hyeah de voices clear 
O er de meadow far an wide, 
Gladly savin " spring is hyeah." 
[8] 
THE OLD MILL 
Near de margin of de stream 
Neath a towerin hill, 
In the field s shadow and gleam, 
Stands de dear ole mill; 
Ye re have come an pass d erway 
Since she took her stand, 
Near de stream dat slowly glides 
O er the gleamin sand. 
Rain has fall n an win has bio 
Gainst her mossy walls; 
An she tosses to an fro 
As the win about her falls; 
Tossin frum de early morn 
Till de eventide 
Near the margin of de stream 
Were de shinin water glide. 
Dear to one an true to all 
As she lifts her ole wo n head, 
Toilin ebery day but one 
Makin daily bread; 
An she toils and murmurs not 
In de wea ther that betides, 
Neath de shadow of de hill 
Were de ole stream glides. 
IT S ALL THROUGH LIFE 
A day of joy, a week of pain, 
A sunny day, a week of rain; 
A day of peace, a year of strife; 
But cling to Him, it s all through life. 
An hour of joy, a day of fears, 
An hour of smiles, a day of tears; 
An hour of gain, a day of strife, 
Press on, press on, it s all through life.

Sleep on ye happy sons 
Beneath the trodden soil;

To live as others live; 
For this we do adore, 
And to ye honor give. 
Sleep on ye happy sons 
Within your silent grave; 
Sleep on in Paradise 
Among the good and brave

To serve in coming years. 
Upon the hearts of earnest youths 
Who march to her bright dawn,

The narrow rugged lane, 
To reach the goal which stands afar 
In everlasting fame.

Her aim is bright and true; 
Through storms our mother will endure 
And make our lives anew. 
A mother dear, a mother true

And do our Sovereign s will. 
And well thou knowest mother mine

Thus there may st suffer many pain 
While bringing in the sheaves.

A WORD TO ETHIOPIA 
No race has had such chilly days 
As thou, O Mother race; 
Nor had the veil of darkness drawn 
Before its lonely face; 
What pains and sorrows thou hast had 
Through these lamenting years; 
What burdens given thee to bear, 
What griefs and bitter tears. 
No race could bear this heavy load 
As thou, and not have died; 
Fate cast thee on a mighty sea, 
Swept by a raging tide. 
Thy sons have known but toil and woe 
O noble Mother race; 
Suffering snares on every side, 
And insults to the face. 
Tis better that thou struggle on, 
O ravished Mother race; 
For neath the skies where others dwell 
Thou lt win a worthy place. 
Though it is dark, go on and on 
O Mother race of mine; 
For ere thy distant goal is won 
Glory will on thee shine. 
[23] 
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON 
Washington, true noble son 
Of Ethiopia s pride; 
Over the land thy deeds have flown 
On fame s rising tide. 
What a shelter your hands built 
In the land of flowers 
That the lowly may enjoy 
Bright and happy hours. 
How faithful was your toil for us, 
O Ethiopia s star; 
What struggles you have had for us 
In life s great war. 
Your life was all of care and toil, 
Each hour, each night and day; 
You cleared the forest of life for us 
And made an open way. 
Sleep on, O hero, and find rest 
In that bright home above; 
Rest from your labors and your toil, 
And know your people s love. 
[24] 
PAUL LAWRENCE DUNBAR 
O Dunbar! the son of everlasting fame, 
Thou served st thy race, thy country-men, but 
not in vain; 
The everlasting lessons thou hast taught 
Are lights by which our fortunes may be 
wrought; 
Thy songs we sing o er rugged hill and plains, 
Dost soothe our daily heartaches and our pains. 
Thou marched into the world among the brave, 
And all the way was forward to thy early grave; 
Toiling each day for those that never knew; 
Inspiring them to live serene and true; 
Thou wast the guide on pathways we must go, 
The mighty teacher who taught us dreams to 
sow. 
Oh, Dunbar, the son of Ethiopian blood, 
Thou soarest above life s raging tides and flood; 
Rest in thy peace beyond the distant sky, 
Thy memory is in our hearts never to die. 
Dunbar, Dunbar! of everlasting fame, 
Thy service we honor and thy genius claim!

THE FLOWER 
A pretty little flower 
Stood smiling on the way; 
And welcomed every traveler, 
On a bright sunny day. 
It seemed to smile and whisper 
To those who passed it by, 
And say, " My little children 
Why do you weep and cry." 
" Come take me as thy comfort, 
For tis my mission here 
To cheer the weak and weary 
And help their burden bear. 
" We all may be a flower 
Along life s path of night, 
And scatter there bright sunshine, 
That men may walk in light."

WHERE HEARTS ARE GAY 
Way doun South where de wild rose grows 
By de stream as de water flows, 
Gently through de ca m bright night 
Neath de twinklin starry light; 
Tripple, tripple, night an day, 
Dats where hearts are gay. 
Way doun South where de robins sing 
Through de fair bright days of spring, 
Mong de growin lilies fair, 
Where de fragrance fills de air, 
W ile de sunbeams dance an play, 
Dats where hearts are gay. 
Way doun South where de ruslin cane 
Makes a joyful, sweet refrain, 
As de coolin breezes bio 
Through de meadow to an fro; 
Way doun horn , in de South I say, 
Dats where hearts are gay. 
Way doun South in de silent grave 
Sleep de noble an de brave; 
From dere labor an dere toil, 
Restin safe in de homeland soil; 
Where de sunbeams dance an play, 
Dats where hearts are gay.

Something like dis, rap, rap, rap!

THE NEW YEAR S RESOLVE 
Another year has passed away, 
The New Year comes, but not to stay; 
I will put my cares on Jesus Christ, 
When the Old with the New Year makes 
tryst. 
Within all evil thoughts shall die, 
And holy ones yearn toward the sky; 
Then all my griefs shall pass away, 
And every day be a holy day. 
I have blundered Lord along the road, 
But now I walk with lightened load; 
Help me to keep that which is right 
Beginning on this New Year s night.

A plate of bread an lasses.

But we kno dat after darkness 
Dere will be a light.

Jesus my King in Thee I trust 
With all my soul and heart; 
Within Thy footsteps I will walk 
And never will depart. 
Jesus the source of all my strength, 
The light by which I see; 
Help me to praise Thy Holy name 
Till I am home with Thee. 
[39] 
A DAILY PRAYER 
Help me O Lord, to face the coming foes, 
Help me I pray to win; 
Teach me the wisdom of the age, 
And keep me free from sin. 
When darkness dwells along my rugged path, 
Help me to fight and pray; 
And sing Thy psalms, though Thee I may not 
see, 
Until the dawn of day. 
Keep me O Lord, within Thy shepherd s fold, 
Keep me beneath Thy wing; 
Guide me until I reach the blissful shore, 
Where I will see my King. 
[40] 
KEEP ME, JESUS KEEP ME 
Keep me neath Thy mighty wing, 
Keep me, Jesus keep me; 
Help me praise Thy Holy name, 
Keep me, Jesus keep me.

Hear me as I cry to Thee; 
Keep me, Jesus keep me; 
May I that bright glory see; 
Keep me, Jesus, keep me. 
O my Lamb, my good Lamb, 
O my good Lamb, 
Keep me, Jesus, keep me.

SING ON TO JESUS 
(Melody) 
Come on children, sing a song of praise; 
Sing on, sing on to Jesus. 
He is risen from the lonely grave; 
Sing on, sing on to Jesus. 
Sing on, pray on, Jesus still lives; 
Sing on, pray on, Jesus still lives; 
Fight on, march on, till the dawn of day; 
Fight on, march on, don t forget to pray. 
Sing on children, he is gone above; 
Sing on, sing on, to Jesus; 
Walk and live in His abiding love; 
Sing on, sing on, to Jesus. 
Come on children, march around the walls; 
Sing on, sing on, to Jesus; 
Yonder walls soon will rock and fall; 
Sing on, sing on, to Jesus. 
Sing on, pray on, Jesus still lives; 
Sing on, pray on, Jesus still lives; 
Fight on, march on, till the dawn of day; 
Fight on, march on, don t forget to pray. 
[43] 
SEEK THE LOST 
Hush! tis a voice I hear afar, 
Hear ye the doleful cries! 
Some one is suffering in the storm, 
Go seek him ere he dies. 
I pity him in his distress; 
He cries under Heaven s dome; 
Let s seek until we find the lost, 
And bring him safely home. 
At last here lies the dying lad, 
Come, now, we ll kneel and pray; 
Oh! see it is our darling son, 
Who long since went astray. 
What pain, what grief I suffer now, 
As I embrace my son; 
Breathing his last and fainting breath 
My life, it seems, is done. 
There are many sons today are lost 
On life s stormy ocean foam; 
Let s seek them while they wander lost, 
And bring them safely home. 
[44] 
YOU LL REAP WHAT YOU SOW 
If you plant a row of corn 
You can t reap no wheat; 
If you plant a row o beans 
Don t expect a beet. 
W en you plant yo sweet pertater 
You don look fur beans; 
If you plant a row of peas, 
You don look fur greens. 
If you steal frum any body 
Some will steal frum you; 
You kin try it if you wan er, 
You will find it true. 
If we sow a seed o kindes 
We will reap de same; 
Let us sow dem every day 
In our Savior s name.

MOVE ON 
Wen yo life is full o trouble, 
Don complain;

An* our pain; 
Take it as it goes an comes, 
Ebery day;

Wen yo load is gettin heavy,

Soon de bitter drugs will go 
Frum yo cup; 
Don keer how de sun is shinin ,

Till you take de load you carry, 
To yo horn . 
Wen de clouds are hangin heavy, 
Hurry on; 
Try yo best to make it over 
To yo horn ;

On de way;

All de day. 
[46] 
THE DEPARTURE 
I am feelin kind o sad 
Bout my mother dear, 
Though she died an left me hyeah, 
Soon will be a year; 
It is putty hard an sad 
Wen yo mother s cross de foam; 
An you cannot hyeah her voice 
Nowhere in de horn . 
Wen I come in from work 
I sit doun an sigh 
O er de words she spoke to me 
Jes befo she die; 
She is gone to heaven s land 
Never to return 
An she caution d me to live 
Ever true an firm. 
Who will take me in dere care 
Wen I am in trouble; 
An will come to cherish me 
Wen de mourns are double? 
Wen yo mother pass erway 
You will have it tough; 
As you walk erlong de roads 
You will find em rough. 
I remember d good an plain 
How she use to toil, 
Rangin t ings erbout de house 
Fur us to enjoy; 
[47] 
Who will speak a word o cheer 
Wen Fs feeling sad, 
Cannot say, mother s gone 
She wus all I had. 
If you stan eroun de bed 
Wen yo mother is dyin , 
You can t help frum feelin sad, 
An can t keep frum cryin ; 
One thing gea me consulation 
We will meet ergin, 
In de land of joy an res , 
Dat is free from sin.

THE DAY OF REPENTANCE 
Doun in de valley I went one day 
Wid head hung low w ile on my way, 
I heard a voice but I could not see, 
An it seem d to say dat " God loves me." 
Doun in de valley I went one day 
Wid a heavy heart w ile on my way, 
I heard a song but I could not see, 
An it seem d to say, dat " God loves me." 
Doun in de valley I knelt an pray, 
Askin fur a brighter day; 
Wen I raise up I could plainly see 
A shinin light, sayin " Come to me." 
[52] 
WHAT HAVE I DONE 
What good deed have I done today 
To cheer a weary soul, 
That he might feel a touch of love 
While struggling toward the goal. 
What seed of cheer have I sown today, 
To lift the fainting head; 
Of a soul that crept along the way 
In need of drink and bread? 
What psalm of praise have I sung today 
To hearts sad of grief and pain, 
As they went troubled down the path 
In life s merciless rain? 
[53] 
WHEN THE WAY SEEMS DARK 
W en through life the way seems dark, 
Look to God an do yo best; 
Work wid willin han an heart; 
He will give you ceaseless rest. 
W en your path is long an rough, 
Pressin let yo zeal be shown, 
Till you see the King above, 
Settin on de golden throne. 
Never murmur or complain, 
But be thankful fur yo share; 
Life is naught without a pain, 
Useless without toil and care. 
[54J 
IN THE HOUR OF DEATH 
In de hour of death when all am still, 
An de night am dark an col 
Wat faintin word can den be heard, 
To save our dyin soul? 
In de hour of death w en de end am near 
An de heart am beatin slo 
Wat psalm of praise can de mourner raise 
As death raps at de do . 
In de hour of death w en de debt am paid 
An we breathe de las goodbye 
In dat sad day w at can we say 
As death un loose de tie. 
[55] 
EVENTIDE 
Softly the shades of evening fall 
O er the cheerful hills and vales, 
Whispering to the weary eyes 
Saying, " lay your burden by; 
You have labored at your best, 
Go now, take your rest." 
Softly the shades of evening fall 
O er the heads of every one, 
Smiling as they dance and play 
O er the merry and the gay; 
Saying as they softly creep, 
" Go now, take your sleep." 
Softly the shades of evening dwell 
Till the dawning of the morn, 
Smiling as they dance away 
From the merry and the gay; 
Saying as they softly creep, 
" Wake now from your sleep." 
[56] 
WINTER IS COMING 
De winter days are drawin nigh 
An by the fire I sets an sigh; 
De nothe n win is blowin cold, 
Like it done in days of old. 
De yaller leafs are fallin fas , 
Fur summer days is been an pas ; 
The air is blowin mighty cold, 
Like it done in days of old. 
De frost is fallin on de gras , 
An seem to say " Dis is yo las 
De air is blowin mighty cold 
Like it done in days of old. 
[57] 
THE COMBAT 
Wile doun de narrow path o life 
I march wid hope to reach de goal 
As I attempts to do de thing dats right 
Evil gits within my weary soul. 
Each day I struggle on through life 
As bes I kin to reach de goal, 
But when I stops de struggle fo to res* 
Evil gits within my weary soul. 
[58] 
RED, WHITE, AND BLUE 
Red, white an blue 
Gleamin in the air; 
Kind, dear an true, 
Is de name dey bear. 
Red, white an blue, 
Flag of mother mine; 
Teach us w at to do, 
Till de end of time. 
Flag of our home 
In a foreign air; 
Fightin gainst de wrong, 
Is yo mission dere. 
Flag wid twinklin stars, 
May you ever wave, 
On yo staff above 
All dats good an brave. 
[59] 
SING OUT FOR PEACE 
Sing out, sing clear, the true and brave, 
That peace may o er the land prevail; 
Sing on in joy with every land, 
That peace may come to man. 
Sing out, sing loud, the old and young, 
Sing all beneath the gleaming sun; 
Sing as thou walk st, sing as thou stand st, 
That peace may come to man. 
Sing out, sing glad, the great and small, 
That peace may flourish over all; 
Let echoes ring o er every land, 
That peace may come to all. 
Sing out, sing true, the high and low, 
Sing as we on to glory go; 
Sing on in joy with every strand, 
That peace may come to man.

INTRODUCTION 
Nearly twenty years ago there came to my door a Negro of fine standing in the community, with the manuscript of a play which he desired me to read. That manuscript, whatever its faults, had the fundamental quality of sincerity — a quality that is not always present in work that often finds its way to a far wider audience. The writer of that play was Joseph S. Cotter, and now in this volume, written by Joseph S. Cotter, Jr., his son, there is displayed the talent for verse-writing that I found in the father; a talent which has, however, in this instance, been hampered by sad ill health. For the verses of this volume were nearly all written on a sick bed, by a boy whose twenty-two years have been far from filled with the ineffable boon of strong health. But to the, public the interest these verses will have, apart from their merit and the gallant spirit in which they are written, lies in this: The Negro race, which has always been able to ease its heart with melody and folk-song, is beginning to look upon words also as a medium of giving expression to its deeper and finer emotions. Paul Lawrence Dunbar and James Weldon Johnson are perhaps the most distinguished of those who have entered the field of poetry, but perhaps if health is restored to Joseph S. Cotter, Jr., he also may later find himself ranking with these two of his pre- decessors. At least all sympathizers with the Negro race will hope this may be so, and will give an interested attention to this small but earnest sheaf of songs.

THE BAND OF GIDEON AND OTHER LYRICS
THE BAND OF GIDEON 
The band of Gideon roam the sky, 
The howling wind is their war-cry, 
The thunder's roll is their trump's peal, 
And the lightning's flash their vengeful steel. 
Each black cloud 
Is a fiery steed. 
And they cry aloud 
With each strong deed,
"The sword of the Lord and Gideon." 
And men below rear temples high 
And mock their God with reasons why, 
And live in arrogance, sin and shame, 
And rape their souls for the world's good name. 
Each black cloud 
Is a fiery steed. 
And they cry aloud 
With each strong deed,
"The sword of the Lord and Gideon." 
The band of Gideon roam the sky 
And view the earth with baleful eye; 
In holy wrath they scourge the land 
With earth-quake, storm and burning brand. 
Each black cloud 
Is a fiery steed.
And they cry aloud 
With each strong deed,
“The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.” 
The lightnings flash and the thunders roll, 
And “Lord have mercy on my soul,” 
Cry men as they fall on the stricken sod, 
In agony searching for their God. 
Each black cloud 
Is a fiery steed. 
And they cry aloud 
With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.” 
And men repent and then forget 
That heavenly wrath they ever met, 
The band of Gideon yet will come 
And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb. 
Each black cloud Is a fiery steed. 
And they cry aloud 
With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
 THE MULATTO TO HIS CRITICS 
 
 Ashamed of my race? 
And of what race am I? 
I am many in one. 
Thru my veins there flows the blood 
Of Red Man, Black Man, Briton, Celt and Scot, 
In warring clash and tumultuous riot. 
I welcome all, But love the blood of the kindly race 
That swarthes my skin, crinkles my hair, 
And puts sweet music into my soul.
 A PRAYER 
 
 As I lie in bed, 
Flat on my back; 
There passes across my ceiling 
An endless panorama of things — 
Quick steps of gay-voiced children, 
Adolescence in its wondering silences, 
Maid and man on moonlit summer's eve, 
Women in the holy glow of Motherhood, 
Old men gazing silently thru the twilight 
Into the beyond. 
O God, give me words to make my dream-children live.
THE DESERTER 
I know not why or whence he came 
Or how he chanced to go; 
I only know he brought me love 
And going, left me woe. 
I do not ask that he turn back, 
Nor seek where he may rove; 
For where woe rules can never be 
The dwelling place of love. 
For love went out the door of hope, 
And on and on has fled; 
Caring no more to dwell within 
The house where faith is dead.
 IS THIS THE PRICE OF LOVE? 
 
 Never again the sight of her? 
Never her winsome smile 
Shall light the path of my journeying 
O'er many a weary mile? 
Never again shall her soft voice come 
To cheer me all the while? 
O Thou, who hearest from above, 
Tell me, is this the price of love? 
Never again the touch of her lips? 
Never her dark, brown eyes 
Shall shine on me with the dancing joy 
Of stars in the summer skies? 
Never again shall my song be aught 
Save minor chords of sighs? 
O Thou, who hearest from above, 
Tell me, is this the price of love?
EGO 
Day passeth day in sunshine or shadow, 
Night unto night each cycle is told; 
Sun, moon and stars in whirling and glamour, 
All unto all the creation unfold. 
What of the strivings, what of the gropings, 
Out from the darkness into the light? 
What of the weepings, what of the grievings 
Now from the day to a passionless night? 
Stars of the stars, heavens of the heavens, 
Rising or falling or pausing a span, 
Each to the great "I am" replying, 
E'en as the crystal, even as man. 
Chant of the worlds from aeon to aeon, 
Song of the soul from dust unto dust, 
Dream of the clods that, upward and starward, 
Rise to the call of the primal "Thou must." 
Space beyond space, eternity's vision, 
Chaos to chaos, calm unto calm, 
World beneath world, heaven above heaven, 
Life but the urge, death but the balm.
 DREAMS 
 
 There is naught in the pathless reach 
Of the pale, blue sky above, 
There is naught that the stars tell, each to each, 
As over the heavens they rove; 
That I have not felt or have not seen 
Clad in dull earth or fancy's sheen. 
There is naught, in the still, mauve twilight 
When the dreams come flitting by, 
From lands afar of eternal night, 
Or lands of the sunswept sky, 
For countless spirits within me dwell 
With heaven's effulgence or dark hell.
 THEN I WOULD LOVE YOU 
 
 Were you to come, 
With your clear gray eyes 
As calmly placid as, in summer's heat, 
At noon-tide lie the sultry skies; 
With your dark brown hair 
As smoothly quiet as the leaves 
When stirs no cooling breath of air; 
And, shorn of smile, your full, red lips 
Prest firmly close as the chaliced bud 
Before the nectar-quaffing bee ere sips, 
I would not know you, I would not love you. 
But, should you come, 
With your love-bright eyes 
Dancing gaily as, on summer's eve, 
The stars adown the western skies; 
With your hair wind-caught 
And circled round your shining face 
In fashion which no hand ere wrought; 
And your full, red lips poised saucily, 
As the slender moon mid a hundred stars, 
And held aloof in daring taunt to me, 
Then I would know you, Then I would love you.
I'M A-WAITING AND A-WATCHING 
I'm a-waiting and a-watching for the day that has no end, 
For the sun that's ever shining, for its rays that ever blend; 
For the light that casts no shadows, for the sky that's ever fair, 
For the rose that's ever blooming as its fragrance fills the air. 
I'm a-waiting and a-watching for the land that knows no night; 
Where the terrors of the darkness are dispelled in morning's light, 
Where the murmurs of the breezes blend them- selves into a song, 
And the silvery carol echoes to the heavens, soft and long. 
I'm a-waiting and a-watching for the song that's never o'er, 
For the joy that's never ending on that light-em- blazoned shore, 
For the peace that shall enfold me with the heavens' holy breath, 
For the glory that shall greet me, for the life that knows no death.
AND WHAT SHALL YOU SAY? 
Brother, come! 
And let us go unto our God. 
And when we stand before Him 
I shall say — “Lord, 
I do not hate, I am hated. 
I scourge no one, I am scourged. 
I covet no lands, 
My lands are coveted. 
I mock no peoples, 
My people are mocked.” 
And, brother, what shall you say?
IS IT BECAUSE I AM BLACK? 
Why do men smile when I speak, 
And call my speech 
The whimperings of a babe 
That cries but knows not what it wants? 
Is it because I am black? 
Why do men sneer when I arise 
And stand in their councils, 
And look them eye to eye, 
And speak their tongue? 
Is it because I am black?
O LITTLE DAVID, PLAY ON YOUR HARP 
O Little David, play on your harp, 
That ivory harp with the golden strings 
And sing as you did in Jewry Land, 
Of the Prince of Peace and the God of Love 
And the Coming Christ Immanuel. 
O Little David, play on your harp. 
A seething world is gone stark mad; 
And is drunk with the blood, 
Gorged with the flesh, 
Blinded with the ashes 
Of her millions of dead. 
From out it all and over all 
There stands, years old and fully grown, 
A monster in the guise of man. 
He is of war and not of war; 
Born in peace, 
Nutured in arrogant pride and greed, 
World-creature is he and native to no land. 
And war itself is merciful 
When measured by his deeds. 
Beneath the 
Crescent Lie a people maimed; 
Their only sin — 
That they worship God. 
On Russia's steppes
Is a race in tears; 
Their one offense — 
That they would be themselves. 
On Flanders plains 
Is a nation raped; A bleeding gift 
Of "Kultur's" conquering creed. 
And in every land 
Are black folk scourged; 
Their only crime — 
That they dare be men. 
O Little David, play on your harp, 
That ivory harp with the golden strings; 
And psalm anew your songs of Peace, 
Of the soothing calm of a Brotherly Love, 
And the saving grace of a Mighty God. 
O Little David, play on your harp.
SONNET TO NEGRO SOLDIERS 
They shall go down unto Life's Borderland, 
Walk unafraid within that Living Hell, 
Nor heed the driving rain of shot and shell 
That 'round them falls; but with uplifted hand, 
Be one with mighty hosts, an armed band 
Against man's wrong to man — for such full well 
They know. And from their trembling lips shall swell 
A song of hope the world can understand. 
All this to them shall be a glorious sign, 
A glimmer of that resurrection morn, 
When age-long Faith, crowned with a grace benign, 
Shall rise and from their brows cast down the thorn 
Of prejudice. E'en though through blood it be, 
There breaks this day their dawn of Liberty.
SONNET 
And Thou art One — One with th' eternal hills, 
And with the flaming stars, and with the moon, 
Translucent, cold. The sentinel of noon 
That clothes the sky in robes of light and fills 
The earth with warmth, the flowering fields, the rills, 
The waving trees, the south wind's elfin rune, 
Are One with Thee. All nature is in tune With Thee, 
O Father, God — and if one wills 
To humbly walk the fragrant, leaf-strewn path 
And kneel in reverence 'neath the vaulted sky, 
Hearing the hymnals of the waving trees 
And prayers of the soughing winds — what hath 
He less of heaven in him, than we, who cry, "
God in our creeds doth dwell and not in these?"
 SONNET 
 
 I would not tarry if I could be gone 
Adown the path where calls my eager mind. 
That fate which knows naught but to grip and bind 
Holds me within its grasp, a helpless pawn, 
And checks my steps when I would travel on. 
Forever shall my body lag behind, 
And in this valley with the moaning wind 
Must I abide with never a glimpse of dawn? 
Though bends my body towards the yawning sod, 
I can endure the pain, the sorrows rife, 
That hold me fast beneath their chastening rod, 
If from this turmoil and this endless strife, 
Comes there a light to lead man nearer God, 
And guide his footsteps toward the Larger Life.
 MEMORIES 
 
 The burnished glow of the old-gold moon 
Shines brightly over me. 
A thousand stars, like a thousand isles 
In a dark and placid sea, 
Bring memories of a golden night, 
Bedecked in Autumn's hue 
And fragrant with the lilac's bloom, 
That brought me joy – and you.
 LOVE 
 
 Love is the soothing voice of gods 
To which men ever list. 
Love is the ease of soul's travail 
And sorrow's alchemist.
 INCONSTANCY 
 
 Blue eyes, gray eyes, 
All the eyes that be, 
Hold within their changing depths 
Wealth of charm to me. 
Dark-eyed maid, of moment's fancy, 
Gay as stars above; 
Is it you that I adore, Or is it Love I love?
 AN APRIL DAY 
 
 On such a day as this I think, 
On such a day as this, 
When earth and sky and nature's whole 
Are clad in April's bliss; 
And balmy zephyrs gently waft 
Upon your cheek a kiss; 
Sufficient is it just to live 
On such a day as this.
 SUPPLICATION 
 
 I am so tired and weary, 
So tired of the endless fight, 
So weary of waiting the dawn 
And finding endless night. 
That I ask but rest and quiet — 
Rest for days that are gone, 
And quiet for the little space 
That I must journey on.
 THE GOAL 
 
 I have found joy, 
Surcease from sorrow, 
From qualms for today 
And fears for tomorrow. 
I have found love, 
Sifted of pain, 
Of life's harsh goading 
And worldly disdain. 
I have found peace, 
Still-borne from grief, 
From soul's bitter mocking 
And heart's unbelief. 
Now may I rest, 
Soul-glad and free, 
For Lord, in the travail, 
I have found Thee.
 REMEMBRANCE 
 
 Forget? Ah, never! 
Your eyes, your voice, your lips. 
Those little ways of love, 
Half-childish yet all-wise 
That held me but a slave to you, 
Will never loose their bonds. 
The power to forget 
Would fate but yield to me. 
Remember? Ah, too well! 
The hurt, the pain, the grief. 
The wrack of nightly dreams, 
The ruth of brooding days, 
Have left a lesion in my soul 
That only Heaven can heal. 
Remembrance is the lot 
That fate does hold for me.
 NOVEMBER 
 
 Old 
November, sere and brown, 
Clothes the country, haunts the town, 
Sheds its cloak of withered leaves, 
Brings its sighing, soughing breeze. 
Prophet of the dying year, 
Builder of its funeral bier, 
Bring your message here to men; 
Sound it forth that they may ken 
What of Life and what of Death 
Linger on your frosty breath. 
Let men know to you are given 
Days of thanks to God in heaven; 
Thanks for things which we deem best, 
Thanks, O God, for all the rest 
That have taught us — (trouble, strife, 
Bring thru Death a larger Life) — 
Death of our base self and fear — (
Even as the dying year, 
Though through cold and frost, shall bring 
Forth a new and glorious spring)— 
Shall shed over us the sway 
Of a new and brighter day, 
With Hope, Faith and Love alway.
TO FLORENCE 
Sister, when at the grassy mound I stand 
Which holds in cold embrace thy mortal frame, 
The tears unbidden rush into my eyes 
And wash away from me all save the sight 
Of thy pure life and patient suffering. 
And ever and anon comes memory 
Of days gone by when health's bright sun did shine 
Upon us both. And tho within the cloud 
I stand, content I am to think of thee 
And live as best I may, till by thy side 
In God's own time, I lay me down to rest.
COMPENSATION 
I plucked a rose from out a bower fair, 
That overhung my garden seat; 
And wondered I if, e'er before, bloomed there 
A rose so sweet. 
Enwrapt in beauty I scarce felt the thorn 
That pricked me as I pulled the bud; 
Till I beheld the rose, that summer morn, 
Stained with my blood. 
I sang a song that thrilled the evening air 
With beauty somewhat kin to love, 
And all men knew that lyric song so rare 
Came from above. 
And men rejoiced to hear the golden strain; 
But no man knew the price I paid, 
Nor cared that out of my soul's deathless pain 
The song was made.

FOREWORD.
The compilation of this little volume has been altogether
a labor of love, and no revision or emendation of the poems
has been attempted. In the midst of the author's useful and
brilliant career, he was ^stricken with illness and being too
modest to present his poems to the world, I have gathered a
few for publication, thereby giving to the Race that which it
could ill afford to lose, and also furnishing him an adequate
means of support.
THE CRISIS (September 1917) printed his poem "Negro
Soldiers," and states that the poem "carries an honor of high¬
est excellence." The Kansas Ciity Sun also has published sev¬
eral of Irs poems. In these poems, we find the peculiar melod¬
iousness of verse, the impassioned earnestness of his nature, his
scorn of injustice, his quick sympathy ior the oppressed and
encouragement for the growing Race. If he had written no
more than these, I feel that he has done his part to rouse
the great heart of the Negro youth to higher aspirations.
I do not profess to be literary, but I am confident that
whoever thoughtfully reads these poems must acknowledge that
the writer is a genius.
Hoping that this excellent little volume may be received
with the genial spirit in which it is offered, I am
Sincerely yours,
WILLIAM F. NEIL,

NEGRO SOLDIERS
THESE truly are the Brave,
These men who cast aside
Old memories, to walk the blood-stained pave
Of Sacrifice, joining the solemn tide
That moves away to suffer, and to die
For Freedom, when their own is yet denied—
O Pride! O Prejudice! When they pass by
Hail them, the Brave, for you now crucified!
These truly are the Free,
These souls that grandly rise
Above base dreams of vengeance for their wrongs,
Who march to War, with visions in their eyes
Of Peace through Brotherhood; lifting glad songs
Aforetime, while they front the firing-line—
Stand, and behold; they take the field today,
Shedding their blood, like Him now held divine,
That those who mock might find a better way!
RACES O' MEN
BLACK-MAN or White-man,
Yellow-man or Jew-
Lord, can races matter
If men's hearts be true?
Can the clay give color
To the spirit's guise?
God, do races differ
In Thy righteous eye?
From one dust Thou mad'st them;
Climates gave them hue.
Far apart their customs
Changed, their language too.
Isolation bound them,
Shut them from the view
Of the selfsame ideals
They together knew.
Yet through all the ages,
Carving wood or stone,
They, whate'er they called Thee,
Sought the Great Unknown.
In jungle, cave or temple,
Palace, grove or church—
All have sought to know Thee
All have blundered much.
Now the Morning cometh,
Walls are breaking down;
Human seas they mingle—
Black and white and brown.
In the world's four corners
Ancient kinships meet;
Ocean trade-ways clamor
Like a city street.
God, Jehovah, Allah,
Thy high purpose prove
Send upon the races
Peace and Joy and Love.
Teach them they are brothers,
Teach them to be true
Black-man and white-man,
Yellowman and Jew!
LAMENT OF A SUMMER TOURIST
I'VE HAD a time, a jolly time,
Throughout this summer season.
The days and weeks have been a rhyme,
Melodious. No reason
Had I to think of anything
That leads to pain or worry.
But, oh, this rude awakening!
Oh! days why did you hurry?
I now arise to grimly face,
Ye gods, the awful warning,
And though I smile my nerve to brace,
I dread each new day's dawning.
What shall I do? What shall I do?
You seem to think it funny;
Summertime is almost through,
And wintertime means money!
A SONG
I LOVED you, Dear. I did not know how much,
i!i Until the silence of the Grave lay cold
Between us, arid your hand I could not touch,
And your sweet face, Oh! never more behold.
I loved you, Dear. I did not know how true.
Until in other eyes I found no light;
I know—Alas! my Spirit without you,
Must drift forever in a starless night!
THE VEILED LADY
SHE wore a veil. I could not see
What tint or hue her skin might be
But, Oh! she was so trim and neat,
Her voice was music, low and sweet,
And while I watched her, to my eyes
She seemed an-Angel from the skies.
Still thus I mused, "She may be one
Of those women dark men should shun;
The kind who at the faintest cry
May bring a mad mob howling nigh."
And so I would have turned away
For fear great danger here might lay.
But ah, just then she turned toward me,
Lifted her veil so daintily, and smiled;
My brain was in a whirl,
Seeing such eyes and teeth o' pearl,
And Cupid laughed, the little clown,
For, oh, thank God, her face was brown!
A WAR DRAMA IN ONE ACT
Time—Last Night. Place—Southern City.
Scene—Public Street.
SPEAKING to me ? What do you say ?
The War brings Freedom? Yes it may.
You came from Europe here to make—
How's that? You want us to forsake
This Country and help you to thrust
Its Flag and Pride into the dust?
Say, Who are you? My Friend? You lie!
You are a sneak-thief, foreign spy.
Take that, You scoundrel! That and That!
I wish I had a baseball bat—
I'll teach you how to talk to me
About money, and more liberty!
Yes, Officer, I struck the man.
Let him explain why, if he can.
I knocked him down, and blacked his eyes—
Why look at me in such surprise?
Because he's White and I am Black?
Give me protection. Hold them back!
Just see them come. The Mob grows bigger.
They shout, "Lynch him, the dirty Nigger!"
Because I dared to knock and beat
A White man in the public street.
It's the same old song. They pay no heed
To right or wrong, but just the deed.
This man I met just while ago,
Called me by name, and whispered low,
Asked me to help him get the ear
Of all my people living near.
Offered me money just to say,
We would desert the Flag today.
Said that my folk might swiftly rise,
If we would help the foreign spies
Wreck buildings, bridges, loot and spoil
The Country where we gave our toil;
Help bring it low with bomb and flame,
Until it lisps the Kaiser's name.
Oh, many things he said to me,
Of turnings, Mobs, and Liberty,
And while he talked my eyes saw red.
I knocked him down, sir! Say he's fled?
Why has all the crowd grown still?
Lead on, Officer, as you will.
I care for neither bond nor bail,
For the first time, I go to jail.
You won't arrest me? Why the shout?
What are the people cheering about ?
I, a Hero? Well, that's good.
I've done no more than thousands would.
We want the World to understand,
Though oftimes scourged with cruel hand.
Always held up to the light for flaws,
And girded round by Jim-crow laws,
The Negro will not seek revenge,
To force bound Justice's prison hinge.
We are standing by the President,
To do his will with full intent.
Where he sends us we will go,
To face undaunted any foe.
We love the Flag that makes men free,
We pledge it whole-soul loyalty.
From Lexington to Carrizal,
Black-men did fight, Black-men did fall.
And ever at the high command,
The Negro proudly takes his stand.
Thank God! He knows no traitor's ban
He's a true, blade-straight American!
THE ROAD OF HUMAN LIFE
ALONG the Road of Human Life,
So very near, on either side,
With winds and storms and billows rife,
There is a sea that's wide;
And woe to him who trips and falls
Into that darkening tide.
Oh! it is all that Hope can do
To keep lifted our eyes
And day by day our strength renew
With visions and dream-lies;
To lead us by that awful flood
From which no soul may rise.
Despair! Despair! That is the sea
Which ever is at our feet,
Seeks to envelop you and me,
In ruin full, complete,
Cause us to deem this life a curse
And make death's name sound sweet.
Work, Laugh and Love! Thus only can
The trembling spirit hold,
Its journey true across the span
Of years that doth unfold,
Amid earth's barren scenery
Until life's tale is told!
THE JOURNEY
I JOURNEYED with her to the gates of Death,
JLL A lonesome road, yet tried to turn away
Her footsteps, marking still her panting breath,
But soon I knew with me she could not stay,
And then methought; perhaps we shall not part.
For surely she shall need me where she goes.
Then did it seem she looked into my heart,
Whispering; On me alone, the doors must close.
O Little Sister! Can you see me still,
On this dim threshold, where you said : Goodbye?
Weird is the night. The moon shines pale and chill-
The Gates are fast, nor ope to such as I.
The hills grow bright with sunlight of the Dawn —
Life calls me back, yet fain would I go on!
HOPELESSNESS
HAD you called from the fire, or from the sea,
From 'mid the roaring flames, or dark'ning wave,
With eagerness I then had come to thee,
To perish with thee if I could not save.
But now helpless I sit and watch you die.
There is no power can save, the doctors say,
I lift my eyes unto the silent sky,
And wonder why it is that mortals pray.
THE EDICT
ALL THESE MUST die before the Morning breaks;
They who at God an angry finger shake,
Declaring that because He made them White,
That they should rule the world by sacred right.
They who deny a common Brotherhood—
They who cry aloud; they think no Blackman good—
The blood-cursed mob always eager to take
The rope in hand or light the flaming stake,
Jeering the wretch while he in death pain quakes—
All these must die before the Morning breaks.
All these must die before the Morning breaks;
The Blackmen, faithless, they whose loud laughter wakes
Harsh echoes in the most unbias places.
They who choose vice, and scorn the gentle graces—
Who by their manners breed contemptuous hate,
Suggesting jim-crow laws from state to state—
They who think on earth they may not find,
An ideal man nor woman of their kind.
But from some other Race that ideal take—
All these must die before the Morning breaks!
We know, O Lord, that there will come a time,
When o'er the World will dawn the Age Sublime,
When Truth shall call to all mankind to stand
Before Thy throne, as Brothers, hand in hand.
Be not displeased with him who this song makes—
All these must die before the Morning breaks!
CASTLES IN THE AIR
I BUILD my castles in the air:
So beautiful they seem to me,
Standing in all their glory there,
Like stars above the sea.
I "watch them with admiring eyes,
For in them dwell life's fondest hope,
If they be swept from out the skies,
In darkness I must grope.
They hold life's joys, life's sweetest dreams;
They make the weary years seem bright.
As one guided by bright starbeams
I struggle through the night.
Sometimes from out the skies they fall,
And my soul shrieks in its pain;
But from the heights I hear Hope's call,
"Arise and build again."
What though life be with sorrow filled
And each day brings its load of care,
I'm happy still while I can build
My castles in the air!
PRAYER TO THE FLAG
FLAG of the Brave, that moves afar.
To curb the wrath of tyrant kings;
To drag "Oppression to the bar
Of Judgment, list to him that sings!
Thou art my Flag. I love thee still,
In spite of them who rend, and smear
Thee with base crimes; who seek to kill
My People's hopes with baleful sneer
I love thee still, and now I lift
My eyes to thee on high, above,
To pray thee for the promised gift
Of Freedom for the Race I love.
E'er thy stars mount dim Europe's skies,
To cheer brave hearts to Victory,
I pray thee hear my People's cries,
Here in the Home-land, set men free.
Thy great fleets cruise in foreign seas.
Thy armies gather for the fray,
To strike Injustice to its knees,
The World doth praise thy might today
And wilt thou boast thy Honor still,
To those who fear thy venging rod,
When Disfranchisement halts the will
Of millions here on Freedom's sod?
Put down the terror of the Mob.
Sit Justice on the throne to reign.
Where thy dark children brood, and sob,
Speak peace unto their souls again.
Open full-wide the Golden Gate
Of Equal Chance, that all may strive—
Or Glory 'neath thy folds we wait,
All broken, bruised, but yet alive.
Far Lands have called thee. They have need
Of thy strong aid, yet, are we least,
Who in thy household now doth plead,
And must we starve while aliens feast?
Great is our faith. Our hearts are thine.
Blackmen will follow where you tell.
Upon whatever battle-line,
Thou know'st, with them, that all is well.
Flag of the Brave ! Our foes are thine,
Against them let thy wrath be hurled,
And then go forth with might divine,
To 'stablish Peace for all the World!

 ILLUSTRATED BY THE AUTHOR 
 
 INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES HASTINGS DODD, D.D..L.L.D. 
 
 This volume contains all the poems included in the first 
 volume — "Mammy's Cracklin* Bread" 
 Copyrighted 1916-1918 
 By Theodore Henry Shackelford 
 
 PRESS OF I. W. KLOPP CO.. PHILADELPHIA 
INTRODUCTION. 
 
 This new volume from the pen of my gifted 
 young friend, Mr. Shackelford, gives very 
 plain evidence of industry and growth. As its 
 title would indicate the mood of all it con- 
 tains is more serious than his former volume, 
 and in that respect it reflects the deepening 
 gravity of the public mind, beset as it now is 
 by the pain and horror of the Great War. And 
 yet quite fortunately Mr. Shackelford does 
 not neglect the vein of folk-song which made 
 his "Mammy's Cracklin' Bread" so popular. 
 
 But his readers will be glad to have such 
 beautiful lyrics as "The Last Days of Au- 
 tumn," "The Old Pear Tree," "Perseverance," 
 "Good Night, Dear Heart," "Farewell" and 
 "Youth's Choice." There is a fine and promis- 
 ing touch in these studies, and "Farewell" is 
 really delightful in the depth of human feeling 
 which it displays. I have been much attract- 
 ed to those pieces in which the author fur- 
 nishes verses with choruses for song use. 
 Among them are "Then Aloud I Cry," "In 
 That Great Day," and "The Big Bell in Zion." 
 They are admirable expressions, all of them. 
 And take their places worthily alongside the 
 older examples of this class. 
 
 In them pathos mingles with that uncon- 
 scious and insuppressible humor by which Mr. 
 Shackelford's people are so well known. 
 
 Then there are the new dialect poems of this 
 volume. I would select "Fin' Yo' Place," as 
 splendidly worked out in a helpful didactic 
 strain. But "Rastus and the Turtle," "Say 
 a Word Faw Fathah," and "Why Pop Snow- 
 den Fell From Grace" are almost as good. 
 There is a quaintness about them which is 
 most pleasing. 
 
Mr. Shackelford's touch is true. His handl- 
 ing of his themes is graceful, and he strikes 
 the deeper chords with certainty and power. 
 
 I feel that our author has enriched the 
 anthologies of dialect verse very greatly by 
 the contributions of this and his former 
 volume. 
 
 Not seldom, but often, are we bound to hear 
 these excellent presentations when they be- 
 come more widely known. 
 
 They are chastely couched, well balanced, 
 and keep steadily to the levels of common ex- 
 perience, and yet they possess the expected 
 elements of phantasy, and border delightfully 
 upon superstition without actually exhibiting 
 it. In a word they deal with the rough ma- 
 terials of imagination with which the Negro 
 people are so richly endowed. 
 
 Some of Mr. Shackelford's war poems in 
 this volume are better than others. The dia- 
 lect verse "The Fifteenth Regiment," shows 
 the author at his best. 
 
 "The Allies," and "Doing Their Bit" are 
 satisfactory, and embody noble sentiments 
 strongly put. 
 
 As a whole our author's second venture is 
 to be commended for its intellectual and poetic 
 merit. Used, as it will be, with the writer's 
 winning personality behind it, there are no 
 limits to the good it will do, and the pleasure 
 and profit it will bring to the wider public. 
 
 And the best of it all is that the author is 
 still young and will be heard again out of his 
 deeper experiences. What we have affords 
 only an example of that of which he is capa- 
 ble.

MY COUNTRY. 
 
 Long has the world in serfdom lain, 
  Beneath Autocracy. 
 And many on its altar slain, 
  Now come democracy. 
 Let freedom's banners be unfurled, 
 Anarchy cannot rule the world, 
 While at its throat thy sword is hurled! 
 
 My Country! My Country! 
 
 "Your brother's blood cries from the ground,' 
  Let not those cries be vain. 
 Too long has bigotry been crowned, 
  Arise, shake off its chain ! 
 And let the whole world know thy worth 
 To cause a bright "New Freedom's" birth. 
 That love may dwell upon the earth, 
 
 My Country! My Country! 
 
 Avenge the plunder, and the spoil, 
 With which the foe made way, 
 That spirit slain on neutral soil 
 Must live again some day. 
 Lift up poor bleeding Belgium's hands, 
 Strike from her wrists the despot's bands, 
 Proclaim her "free" throughout all lands! 
 
 My Country! My Country! 
 
 God will uphold you in the right, 
 
 And give you strength to win, — 
 To overthrow the tyrant's might — 
 
 For God does punish sin. 
 And when love dwells on every shore 
 No more will sound the cannon's roar, 
 But peace shall reign forever more. 
 
 My Country! My Country! 
 
 THE LAST SAILING. 
 
 'Twas the last ship of the season, 
 
 Yes, in fact, the last for aye. 
 All who did not make this sailing 
 
 Must at home forever stay. 
 For the "Isle of Dreams" was finished 
 
 And the streets had all been laid. 
 All the buildings were completed 
 
 And the last arrangements made. 
 
 'Twas a land of joy and sunlight, 
 
 Free from chilling winds and snow, 
 All who loved the pure, and noble, 
 
 To that happy land might go. 
 Multitudes of weary pilgrims 
 
 Had to it already gone, 
 Writing back to those remaining, 
 
 Urging them to hasten on. 
 
 And that land beggared description, 
 Beauty filled it everywhere. 
 
 Beds of rainbow-tinted flowers 
 Lent their perfume to the air. 
 
 Stately rows of verdant shade trees 
 
 Bordered fields of waving grain, 
 While a spotless, terraced city 
 
 Rose above the fertile plain. 
 
 Marble steps to it ascended 
 
 In an easy, restful flight. 
 Those who set their feet upon them 
 
 Found they led to Wisdom's height. 
 Round each dwelling was a garden 
 
 Filled with fruits and herbage rare, 
 All the day the song birds warbled, 
 
 Free from every earthy care. 
 
 Softest zephyrs, music laden, 
 
 Wafted there the season through. 
 There the clouds were white and fleecy, 
 
 There the skies were always blue. 
 And no idleness nor mischief 
 
 To that city brought disgrace. 
 Only those whose hearts were blameless 
 
 Found in it a resting place. 
 
 So the city grew and flourished, 
 
 All who went there went to stay. 
 Never did a soul who reached it 
 
 Ever wish to go away. 
 That was why the folks of Peaceville 
 
 Chartered this gigantic ship, 
 And were making preparations 
 
 For the grand, and final trip. 
 
 That was why the busy foot-steps 
 Could be heard throughout the land, 
 
 As the hour-glass recorded 
 
 Father Time's last grains of sand. 
 
 Like a graceful swan, the vessel 
 
 Rose and fell beside the quay, 
 Ready for that homeward voyage 
 
 To the "Isle across the sea." 
 
 Then the captain of the steamer 
 
 On the siren gave a blast, 
 Warning those who still were lagging 
 
 That the time had nearly past. 
 In his home a wealthy merchant 
 
 To his pretty daughter spake, 
 Telling her that she must hasten 
 
 If that sailing she would make. 
 
 Thus replied the haughty maiden, 
 
 With a sneer upon her lipsi 
 "Nonsense father, What's the hurry? 
 
 I can buy a dozen ships." 
 First must she increase her beauty 
 
 By cosmetics rich and rare, 
 Perfumes that the gods might envy 
 
 Floated from her golden hair. 
 
 Jewelry and costly raiment 
 
 Her attention next did claim, 
 Though her kinsmen, now departing, 
 
 Called on her in Heaven's name. 
 But the maiden only answered 
 
 To each anxious advocate — 
 "Go, and when you reach the vessel 
 
 Tell the captain I said wait!" 
 
 Then returned she to her mirror, 
 Fixed her hair and dress "just so." 
 
 "Now," said she, "I think I'm ready 
 To that 'Dreamy Isle' to go." 
 
 Then reluctant she departed 
 
 For the ship so new and great, 
 But alas! the ship was moving, 
 
 And the captain cried "too late !" 
 
 "Stay," said she; "I'm ready, take me!" 
 
 Tearing wildly at her hair, 
 But the vessel still receded 
 
 And it left her standing there. 
 "Oh!' she wailed, "am I forsaken, 
 
 Is there none to share my fate?" 
 And her loved ones filled with pity 
 
 Shook their heads and cried, "too late !" 
 
 Not a word or parting hand-shake 
 
 Helped the maid her grief to bear, 
 Not one soul was there to cheer her 
 
 In that hour of despair. 
 Tears and prayers alike were useless, 
 
 As she stood before the gate, 
 Stretching out her hands entreating, 
 
 For the voice still called "too late!" 
 
 Small and smaller grew the vessel 
 
 Till at last 'twas lost to view. 
 With remorse she watched it fading, 
 
 Having nothing else to do. 
 And so hard did Conscience prick her 
 
 That her own soul she did hate, 
 As from far across the waters 
 
 Came the still, small voice, "too late!" 
 
 And the place remained forever 
 
 Like a city of the dead. 
 Never more did human beings 
 
 On those hollow pavements tread. 
 But her own words seemed to mock her, 
 
 "Tell the captain I said wait!" 
 Then would come the solemn answer 
 
 Deep and ominous, "too late!" 
 
 E'en the rats and mice departed 
 
 From that God-forsaken place. 
 Never more did earthly creature 
 
 Ever gaze into her face. 
 But a horde of little demons 
 
 On the roof did aggravate, 
 As they peered down at the maiden, 
 
 Clapped their hands and croaked "too late !" 
 
 Till the land reverberated, 
 
 And the maiden quaked with fear, 
 As the sea caught up the echo, 
 
 And resounded in her ear, 
 Like the awful Hall of Judgment, 
 
 Where the doomed must hear their fate 
 Throughout all the ceaseless ages 
 
 Of eternity, "too late !" 
 
 BE POLITE. 
 
 Be polite to those around you 
 At your work, and at your play ; 
 
 Though it costs you not a penny 
 It will help you on your way. 
 
 Though the world is always busy 
 Toiling on from morn till night; 
 
 It has always time to notice 
 Any man who is polite. 
 
 OVER THE TOP. 
 
 Hid are the stars by a fog from the lowlands 
 Which with the darkness is coming apace, 
 Scarce' can a fellow his eyes help from straining 
 Trying to see his own hand near his face. 
 Three weeks and over, we've lain here and 
 waited, 
 Down in the dampness and "cooties" and 
 slop, 
 Now we believe that somewhere around mid- 
 night 
 We may be able to cross o'er the top. 
 
 My joints are stiffer than old rusty hinges, 
 
 They even creak when I get up to walk. 
 That's why I'm itching to get into action, 
 
 Or in their rendezvous "Bochies" to stalk. 
 Soon comes the order, and soon we are ready, 
 
 Through every obstacle ready to chop, — 
 Then what a strange, creepy feeling comes o'er 
 us 
 
 While we are going out, "over the top." 
 
 Out in the dark, and the wire entanglements 
 Bristling with stickers, and loud clanging 
 bells, 
 
 All "no man's land" is a bed of shell craters 
 Yawning, and gapping like "ice water Wells," 
 
 So we get pretty well soaked consequently, 
 Still we press onward not caring to stop 
 
 Till we shall reach our long-sought destination 
 Over the sand bags, and "over the top." 
 
 "Steady lads, steady now! First get your 
 bearings, 
 Don't wake the beggars, by getting too rash. 
 First thing you know, We'll be drawing their 
 fire, 
 Then the next thing, the whole squad'll be 
 hash. 
 Lie down, you dummy, when star shells are 
 gleaming ! 
 Down on your face in the mud puddles drop, 
 What if you do "drink a gallon of water?" 
 Just so you live to get 'over the top/ 
 
 "Hey there you fool, stop that damn from 
 
 ringing 
 
 l 
 
 Well never mind, he has paid with his life. — 
 Charge 'em now boys, since they know we are 
 coming, 
 Give 'em a bayonet, bullet or knife,— 
 Come on men, faster there, why are you loaf- 
 ing? 
 This is no time now to falter, and stop! 
 Brace up, we've got but a few paces further 
 Then we'll be over, be 'over the top.' " 
 
 Oh God ! another's hung up on the wire ! 
 
 Blood streaming down from a hole in his 
 head. 
 Let me go get him. "No," says the Lieutenant, 
 
 "What is the use when he's already dead?" 
 
 That's it, let's jump now and get down to busi- 
 ness, 
 Then blow for blow with the "Bochies" 
 we'll swap, 
 We'll pay them back for the way we were 
 peppered 
 While we were making it "over the top !" 
 
 Then what excitement accompanies our jump- 
 ing 
 
 Loud are the noises, the curses, and cries, 
 Some fight like demons, but others are captured 
 
 Ere they awake from their midnight surprise. 
 Some have been sent from the fighting forever, 
 
 Some in the corner like lunatics hop, 
 Never believing that we've reached their 
 stronghold 
 
 Out through their fire and "over the top." 
 
 What's that you say, There is blood on my coat 
 sleeve ? 
 
 Now I remember, I did feel a sting, 
 Oh well, a wee little wound in the shoulder 
 
 After all isn't the very worse thing. 
 Just see the Bochies we made "kick the bucket," 
 
 Must be two dozen there back of that prop, 
 We've lost but two of our men on the wire, 
 
 That's not so bad, sir, for "crossing the top." 
 
 What have you got on your hip there lieu- 
 tenant ? 
 Come have a heart sir, and give us a drink! 
 Ought to get that much for stopping these 
 bullets 
 Then looking out for supplies, I should think. 
 
 See all these guns, and enough ammunition 
 
 Here in this pocket to open a shop. 
 Now that's not slow counting thirty-six pris- 
 oners, 
 Here's to your health, sir, for "crossing the 
 top." 
 
 MARGARITA. 
 
 In a quaint Italian village 
 
 Where the mountain daisies grow, 
 Lived a maid named Margarita, 
 
 Many centuries ago. 
 And the rocks were oft' set ringing 
 By her sweet and plaintive singing, 
 As she climbed among them, clinging 
 
 To the arm of Alphio. 
 
 And this noble youth, her lover, 
 Was a fearless mountain guide; 
 
 Knew he all the trails and passes 
 Leading o'er the grim Alp's side. 
 
 Kept, he always too, his bearing; 
 
 And most joy knew he when sharing 
 
 In some deed of skill and daring, 
 Did this youth named Alphio. 
 
 Late one spring a band of pilgrims 
 Led he toward a dizzy height, — 
 On whose side the snow was melting 
 
 Though its crest rose cold and white,- 
 And the snow their eyes was blinding 
 As the pathway they were finding 
 Now round crag and crevasse winding 
 In the steps of Alphio. 
 
 Yet not far had they proceeded 
 
 Ere dark clouds hung o'er the way 
 Like some awful premonition, 
 
 Shutting out the light of day. 
 And from out the shadows falling, 
 With a swiftness most appalling 
 Seemed to come a faint voice calling 
 "Turn back, turn back, Alphio!" 
 
 Then the low'ring clouds grew blacker; 
 And the thunder rumbled loud; 
 Forked tongues of blinding lightning 
 Hissing leapt from cloud to cloud. 
 And the thunder's dreadful rumbling 
 Set an avalanche to crumbling 
 And into the chasm tumbling, 
 Bearing with it, Alphio. 
 
 And the rope secured around him 
 On the rocks was cut in twain, 
 
 In the depths below he vanished 
 And was never seen again. 
 
 Terrorized the group, retreating, — 
 
 Then with Margarita meeting, — 
 Heard alone this frantic greeting, 
 "Where, O, where is Alphio!" 
 
 Clasped she then her breast with horror 
 
 When they told her he was dead; 
 And before a hand could stop her 
 Up the treach'rous pass she fled, 
 Often stumbling too and falling 
 Now on narrow ledges crawling, 
 Still she pushes onward, calling 
 "Alphio, my Alphio !" 
 
 Faint grows she from cold and hunger, 
 But she struggles upward still, — 
 
 Urges her frail body forward 
 With a super-human will — 
 
 For no fate her love can sever 
 
 She has vowed to turn back — never 
 
 But to still go on forever 
 Till she finds her Alphio. 
 
 Though her feet were torn and bleeding 
 
 And her progress painful, slow, 
 Though her clothes were wet and clinging 
 
 With the rain and hail and snow, 
 Though the storm had not abated, 
 Strove she onward still, not waited 
 Till she reached that spot ill-fated 
 Where had perished Alphio. 
 
 Frozen in the pass they found her, 
 When had dawned the morning light. 
 
 Lying still in death they found her ; 
 Sad was Margarita's plight; 
 
 And till now the peasants kneeling 
 
 At their prayers oft' have a feeling 
 
 Of an apparition stealing 
 
 Close, and wailing "Alphio f" 
 
 Mothers tuck the covers closer 
 When their babies cry of fright; 
 
 And they whisper "Margarita 
 Must be hov'ring near to-night ; 
 
 Still her ceaseless vigil keeping, 
 
 Over crag and torrent sweeping 
 
 On the misty air and weeping 
 Alphio, my Alphio !" 
 
 Those who cross the dismal mountains 
 
 Where the rushing waters flow, 
 Still may see her lonely spirit 
 
 As she wanders to and fro ; 
 Or upon the winds is driven 
 Where her lover once had striven 
 O'er the rocks all rent, and riven, 
 Ever calling "Alphio!" 
 
 THE LITTLE RESTAURANT. 
 
 When class is out you'll see the boys 
 
 With joy go down the street, 
 Then turn the corner into "J oe ' s " 
 
 And scramble for a seat. 
 "Joe" runs a little restaurant, 
 
 'Tis called the "Student's Friend" 
 Because his prices suit us boys 
 
 With not much dough to spend. 
 
 And seniors, juniors, soph's and preps, 
 
 At noon go flocking there ; 
 Perhaps it would not come amiss 
 
 To read the bill-of-f are ; 
 A nickel buys you "coffee and — " 
 
 Or porridge in the pot, 
 Or else a sandwich made of cheese, 
 
 Or "doggie" good and hot. 
 
 Fish cakes and gravy cost a dime ; 
 
 As does a stew of lamb ; 
 Or "fried eggs over," and besides 
 
 A great, big piece of ham. 
 
 lr 
 
 "Pig-tail and cabbage," "ears and krout," 
 "Turnips and black eyed peas," 
 
 And "pepper hash" that's hot enough 
 To make a Spaniard sneeze. 
 
 For fifteen cents you get "fried fish," 
 
 Potatoes on the side ; 
 Or else two lines of vegetables 
 
 And "spare ribs" boiled or fried : 
 Or "pork chops" fat and greasy too, 
 
 Or roast beef good and prime. 
 But here is what I love the most, 
 
 "A thousand for a dime." *

 THE LAST DAYS OF AUTUMN. 
 
 The autumn days are nearly gone, 
 
 The woods will soon be bare, 
 The birds collecting from the south 
 
 Are flying here and there. 
 
 The sad winds sighing through the trees, 
 
 Make such a mournful sound, 
 The leaves in all their brightest hues 
 
 Are falling to the ground. 
 
 The pool where once we splashed and swam 
 
 Is now so hushed and still, 
 The autumn rains with water soft 
 
 The cistern soon will fill. 
 
 The tumble weeds roll here and there, 
 
 All husked and cut, the corn. 
 The grass and fence rails now are white 
 
 With frost at early morn. 
 
 is 
 
 The cider mill is busy too, 
 
 And sweet the apple juice, 
 Which Deacon Brown is turning out 
 
 Just for his private use. 
 
 The golden-rod stands sentinel 
 
 Along the winding stream ; 
 And rising from the crystal depths 
 
 Are little clouds of steam. 
 
 The frost has kissed the black haw's cheeks 
 
 And made them blacker still. 
 The farmer loads his corn with glee 
 
 And takes it to the mill. 
 
 The chipmunk works both day and night, 
 
 Nor even stops to sleep ; 
 But spends his time in storing nuts 
 
 Down in his burrow deep. 
 
 The crow is cawing in the field, 
 
 To others of his ilk, 
 The thistle seeds fly far and near 
 
 On wings of softest silk. 
 
 The air is hazy in the day, 
 
 And very chill at night. 
 The children gather up the leaves 
 
 And kindle fires bright. 
 
 In brand new suits the chickens strut 
 
 The moulting season o'er. 
 The morning glory seeds have dropped 
 
 Around the kitchen door. 
 
 The vines are loaded down with grapes, 
 
 So sweet and large and blue, 
 The apple trees along the lane 
 
 Are heavy laden too. 
 
 The pop corn has been placed to dry 
 
 Upon the kitchen roof; 
 The shells upon the hickory nuts 
 
 Have curled their lips aloof. 
 
 Then what care we for sighing winds, 
 
 Or frost at early morn? 
 For very soon we'll crack the nuts, 
 
 And pop and eat the corn. 
 
 Hurrah, then for the autumn time, 
 
 There's plenty to be done; 
 And wind and frost will only add 
 
 More zest to our fun. 
 
 CATS. 
 
 On the back fence ob my neighbo' 
 
 On a cleah and frosty night, 
 Two ole tomcats gray an' grizzled 
 
 Met to hab dey usu'l fight. 
 An' dey made de evenin' echo 
 
 Wid daih yellin' an' daih screams, 
 Givin' chillen awful nightmaihs, 
 
 Wakin' grown folks from daih dreams. 
 
 Dis had been de nightly 'currence, 
 
 Ev'ry night about a yeah ; 
 Jis dese fightin', screamin' tomcats 
 
 Dat was all dat you could hyeah. 
 
 One man went an' bought a 'volver 
 
 Tickly dem same cats to shoot; 
 But when he would 'proach a window 
 
 My, oh my ! how dey would scoot ! 
 
 But when he was gone you'd see 'em, 
 
 On dat same old back yahd fence, 
 An' dey'd scratch an' bite each othah, 
 
 'Case dey made no false pretence; 
 On the evenin' which I speaks ob 
 
 To de window I did crawl ; 
 An' I th'owed my big ole bootjack, 
 
 'Fo'e dey knowed I'd th'owed at all. 
 
 And I put some speed behin' it, 
 
 But it missed dem feline gents. 
 And I tell you I was sorry, 
 
 All de same it hit de fence. 
 It jus' struck right close behin' 'em, 
 
 An' it skaihd dem tomcats so, 
 Dey bofe lef de fence to-gethah, 
 
 Landed in de yahd below ! 
 
 In dat yahd dair was a bull-dog, 
 
 Big an' cross, but lean an' thin. 
 When he saw dem two intrudahs 
 
 On daih hides he did begin! 
 He would grab 'em in de necks, suh, 
 
 And would toss 'em in de aiah, 
 Till it looked jis like a cyclone, 
 
 Bulldog, cats an' flyin' haih ! 
 
 Yes, he made it interestin', 
 
 He jis nachly raised a fog. 
 Till at las' de man dat owned him 
 
 Come out daih an' kotched his dog. 
 
 Den' you ought o' seen dem tomcats, 
 
 Makin' time out ob dat yahd, 
 When at las' dey retched de alley 
 
 Man dey sho was runnin' hahd ! 
 
 An' dat dog I'd gib ten dollahs 
 
 Such a one as him to own, 
 Faw he sholy was a mona'ch 
 
 An' dat yahd it was his th'one. 
 Oh! he shook 'em up wid vengeance 
 
 An' a dollah I will bet, 
 If dem old tomcats ain't drapped dead 
 
 Dey's bofe a-running yet! 
 
 THE ALLIES. 
 
 Sank the sun in purple splendour 
 
 On the shell-torn Western front 
 Came a hush along the sector 
 
 Which had borne the battle's brunt. 
 Came a fleeting moment's respite, 
 
 To relax and calmly wait, 
 Till should start anew that shelling 
 
 Which is called the "Prayer of Hate." 
 
 Lay two Allies sorely wounded 
 
 In a crater all alone. 
 One suppressed a sob of anguish, 
 
 One withheld a smothered groan. 
 Spake they each a different language, 
 
 Came they each from different climes. 
 But the "ideal" which they bled for 
 
 Made them brothers through all times. 
 
 "Friend," cries one, "my day is over, 
 
 You have still a chance, so go !" 
 But the other grim, determined, 
 
 Shakes his head and answers, "No, 
 Never shall the heel of foeman 
 
 Tread upon thy helpless head 
 Till my soul has sought its Maker 
 
 And my spark of life has fled." 
 
 "There will be no quarter given — 
 
 We are brave, there'll be none sought — 
 But I vow that those who take us 
 
 Soon will find we're dearly bought. 
 Side by side we've fought together 
 
 Since this conflict first began, 
 Now, with death so near and certain, 
 
 Each must prove himself a man." ; 
 
 Then the centimetres thundered, 
 
 And the mitraileuses roared, 
 And the gas, like fog descended, 
 
 And into the tenches poured. 
 Quick as thought one wounded comrade 
 
 Places on the other's face 
 His own mask, and takes a 'kerchief, 
 
 This protection to replace. 
 
 Hot, and hotter grows the fighting, 
 
 Shells are bursting o'er the ground, 
 While their deadly molten contents 
 
 Spread destruction all around. 
 And the utter devastation 
 
 Which ensues no tongue can tell, 
 In that yellow mist is lurking 
 
 All the foul fiends of hell ! 
 
 Strong men strive to rise, then falter, 
 
 Put forever from the fight. 
 All is terror and confusion, 
 
 All is chaos, black as night! 
 But at last the fog has lifted, 
 
 Still the danger is not past 
 For the Prussians' "Zero Hour" 
 
 Is approaching very fast. 
 
 Now the foe is "crossing over," 
 
 Now the bugle sounds "retreat," 
 But these heroes in the struggle 
 
 Both prepare their end to meet. 
 One, 'tis he less sorely wounded, 
 
 Fixes for them both the guns, 
 And his task is scarce completed 
 
 Ere appear the hated "Huns." 
 
 And they smite each son of "Kultur" 
 
 As he shows his brutish face, 
 Till a hand-to-hand encounter 
 
 In the shell-hole then takes place. 
 Now they rise in desperation 
 
 As their foes surround the spot. 
 Now their bayonets leap like lightning, 
 
 Now their blows fall thick and hot! 
 
 Though out-numbered, still they fought them, 
 
 Neither was their fighting vain, 
 For a dozen foes lay gory 
 
 Ere they too at length were slain! 
 Side by side in death they found them, 
 
 When had ceased the battle's hum, 
 One the "Fleur-de-lis" was wearing, 
 
 One from Africa had come. 
An' stirred it wid huh han'. 
 
 MAMMY'S CRACKLIN' BREAD 
 
 Sometimes when you has done yo' bes', 
 
 But t'ings has all gone wrong, 
 An' troubles almos' weights you down, 
 
 As you goes walkin' 'long. 
 An', p'r'aps, you's got de rheumatiz, 
 
 An' pains across yo' head; 
 Why, all you need to fix you up 
 
 Is jis some cracklin' bread. 
 
 Dat bread it wo'ks like magic, suh ; 
 Yo' pains all vanish 'way ; 
 
 An' when you finish eatin' it 
 You's feelin' mighty gay. 
 
 No mattah if all day you feet 
 Has felt like chunks ob lead, 
 You jis feels like a-prancin' when 
 You eats dat cracklin' bread. 
 
 Now we has lots o' mode'n cooks 
 
 What t'inks dey knows a lot, 
 But as faw makin' cracklin' bread, 
 
 Why dey can't eben staht. 
 My mammy was a "old-time cook," 
 
 So all ouah neighbo's said ; 
 But what made me so proud ob huh 
 
 Was mammy's cracklin' bread. 
 
 as 
 
 Now cracklin's was de t'ings she got 
 
 When she had tried out lahd, 
 An' cooked de fat an' skins an' stuff 
 
 'Till dey was crisp and hahd. 
 And mammy said when she was young 
 
 On cracklin's she was fed, 
 Dat's why she was so good, you see 
 
 At makin' cracklin' bread. 
 
 An' when she took dat salt an' meal 
 
 An' put it in de pan, 
 Thowed in 'bout dat much cracklin's den, 
 
 An' stirred it wid her han', 
 Po'wed in a quaht ob souah milk, 
 
 An' had de oben red ; 
 Why, you could smell a mile away 
 
 Dat good ole cracklin' bread. 
 
 On Satu'days my fathah would 
 
 Dat grist mill go an' seek, 
 An' he would bring home on his back 
 
 Co'n meal to las' a week. 
 'Cause Sundays, when de chu'eh was out, 
 
 An' benediction said, 
 Folks sho' would flock to ouah house 
 
 To git dat cracklin' bread. 
 
 Once I was bad in Sunday school 
 An' stomped an' kicked my feet, 
 
 When teacher come to tell on me, 
 Paw axed him in to eat ; 
 
 He stuffed an' stuffed an' den got up, 
 'Thout op'nin' his head, 
 An' what kep' him from tellin' sho, 
 Was mammy's cracklin' bread. 
 
 Once when my Paw was cuttin' wood, 
 
 He got hit in de eye ; 
 He come home in de amberlance, 
 
 De doctah said he'd die. 
 He wrapped his head all up in gauze, 
 
 An' propped him up in bed ; 
 But when he called nex' mornin', Paw 
 
 Was eatin' cracklin' bread. 
 
 An' den my bruthah taken sick, 
 
 Doc said he couldn't live. 
 
 An' nothin' but raw eggs an' milk 
 
 My maw to him should give. 
 But mammy jis did opposite 
 
 To all de doctah said, 
 Dat kid got strong an' healthy, too, 
 
 On mammy's cracklin' bread. 
 
 Once when a 'oman brought her chile 
 
 To play on ouah lawn, 
 A bulldog run right at de kid 
 
 Befo' dat she was gone. 
 An' he was sho' fierce-lookin', too, 
 
 His eyes was big an' red. 
 He looked so bad dat mammy run 
 
 An' lef huh cracklin' bread. 
 
 "Oh, Lord, please save dat baby, do!" 
 
 My mammy cried wid feah. 
 An' mammy's prayeh was answ'ed den, 
 
 Aldough no help seemed neah. 
 I stopped him in his head-long rush — 
 
 I th'owed an' knocked him dead ! 
 I hit dat bulldog wid a hunk 
 
 Ob mammy's cracklin' bread ! 
 
 GOD WILL MAKE IT RIGHT. 
 
 For fifty and two hundred years 
 
 Did slavery hold its sway; 
 And now, though fifty more have passed 
 
 It still exists to-day. 
 You seem to doubt my falt'ring words 
 
 But look and you will see 
 That when a man is bound and gagged 
 
 He surely is not free. 
 
 And we are bound for men dictate 
 
 Where we must go to eat; 
 And tell us that we must vacate 
 
 Some sections of the street. 
 And prejudice is sweeping on 
 
 With strides both long and fast, 
 And we are gagged, for in some States 
 
 Our vote we may not cast. 
 
 And often in the papers, too, 
 
 Most dreadful things I see, 
 Of lynchings and of other things 
 
 To hinder you and me. 
 Unbidden tears flow down my cheeks 
 
 As I sit there alone; 
 "God pity us !" I cry aloud 
 
 To Him on Heaven's throne. 
 
 St 
 
 Then instant comfort comes to me, 
 
 The sun shines out again, 
 And I a brighter future see, 
 
 I have not prayed in vain. 
 We do not need to fret and grieve 
 
 When billows round us roll, 
 Prayer is the panacea which 
 
 Will comfort every soul. 
 
 For God will help us if our cares 
 
 Upon Him we will cast, 
 And through the storm will guide the ship 
 
 To harbor safe at last. 
 No burdens great, like mountains then 
 
 Shall loom upon our sight. 
 And all the wrongs which we've endured 
 
 The Savior will make right. 
 
 Then on that happy blissful shore 
 
 No sorrow we shall feel ; 
 "There moth and rust shall not corrupt 
 
 Nor thieves break through and steal.'* 
 No prejudice, nor vice, nor crime 
 
 Shall in those walls abide 
 For those who cherish evil hearts 
 
 May enter not, inside. 
 
 There unjust men shall not dictate 
 
 Nor sit upon the throne. 
 God rules supreme on that estate, 
 
 It is His very own. 
 There murm'ring brooks forever flow 
 
 Through gardens fair and wide; 
 There rich and fragrant flowers grow; 
 
 There love and peace abide. 
 
 NOW THEY BELIEVE ME. 
 
 Just why it was, I've often tried, 
 
 But still I cannot see, 
 Whate'er I said when I was young 
 
 Folks always doubted me; 
 "I'm going to leave you, Paw," said I, 
 
 When I became a youth; 
 "Aw, shut up, boy," said paw to me, 
 
 "You never tell the truth !" 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 Out in the country one spring day 
 
 I caught a little squirrel, 
 And on my way returning home 
 
 I met a little girl; 
 She asked me to give him to her, 
 
 I told her he would bite ; 
 She said "I want him just the same, 
 
 I guess he'll act all right." 
 Now she believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 We had a pet canary once, 
 
 We called him "little Pete," 
 And on the floor he used to hop, 
 
 In search of crumbs to eat; 
 And so one day I said to him: 
 
 "Now, Pete, stay off that floor 
 Or else that cat will fix you so 
 
 That you can't sing no more." 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 There was a boy next door to us, 
 
 And he was awful bad ; 
 He used to pick the grapes from off 
 
 The only vine we had. 
 And so one day I said to him, 
 
 "Here's what I'm going to do: 
 Next time I catch you in this yard 
 
 I'll sic my dog on you." 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 We used to have an apple tree 
 
 A-growing in our yard; 
 I saw my brother eating some 
 
 When they were green and hard. 
 I said "Don't eat another one, 
 
 They're green as they can be, 
 For if you do, I'll bet you'll wish 
 
 You'd never seen a tree." 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 Out in a berry patch one day 
 
 We saw a hornet's nest; 
 It was admired very much 
 
 By me and all the rest. 
 "I'm going to poke it with a stick," 
 
 A fellow said to me. 
 "Now, if you touch that tree" said I, 
 
 "You'll wish you'd let it be." 
 Now, he believes mee, but it's too late! 
 
 A neighbor, who lived close to us, 
 
 Once let a credit man 
 Sell him a new pianoforte 
 
 Upon the credit plan. 
 
 "Now, don't you do it," I advised; 
 
 "To pay the cash is best, 
 For if you get in debt to him 
 
 He'll never let you rest." 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 I used to run a chicken ranch. 
 
 An enemy of mine 
 One night came there and stole from me 
 
 A pair of broilers fine ; 
 As he was leaving, I called out, 
 
 "Now, if you start to run 
 I'll have to pull this little thing 
 
 That sticks beneath my gun." 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 A friend of mine once loved a girl, 
 
 'Twas many years ago, 
 And he would seek me for advice, 
 
 As fellows will, you know. 
 "Don't you think we're a dandy pair?" 
 
 He grinned and said to me. 
 "Pal, if you marry her," said I, 
 
 "You'll wish that you were free." 
 Now he believes me, but it's too late! 
 
 PERSEVERANCE. 
 
 Though you "try again" and fail, 
 Never cease from trying; 
 
 But with spirit brave advance 
 Failure's threats defying. 
 
 Disappointments there will be 
 
 Which will sorely trouble; 
 But to those who conquer them 
 
 Strength will then come double. 
 
 Though your cherished hopes may lie 
 
 Trodden in the mire, 
 Though the goal so distant seems 
 
 Which you most desire; 
 Though the lightnings cleave the sky, 
 
 Though the darkness hide you; 
 If your course you still pursue, 
 
 God above will guide you. 
 
 WHEN MY SHIP COMES IN. 
 
 Rough the course and long the voyage, 
 
 Which my "ship of dreams" has sailed. 
 Great the prizes which were offered, 
 
 Great her chances to have failed. 
 In suspense she long has kept me, 
 
 Waiting for her day by day; 
 Praying that she, in strange waters, 
 
 Might not sink nor lose her way. 
 
 But today my heart is lighter 
 
 As I feel the steady breeze, 
 And my glass sweeps o'er the white-caps, 
 
 Out to where, upon the seas 
 Bearing every inch of canvas, 
 
 Standing proudly round the bar, 
 Making for the inner harbor, 
 
 I can see my ship afar. 
 
 THE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY- 
 EIGHTH INFANTRY. 
 
 Go on Three Hundred Sixty-Eighth, 
 
 Go on in Heaven's name! 
 There's work ahead which you must do 
 
 If you would conquer fame. 
 You'll meet with hardships on the way 
 
 To try the bravest soul. 
 But never let them hinder you 
 
 From getting to the goal. 
 
 Go on Three Hundred Sixty-Eighth, 
 
 You're noble soldiers, all. 
 No truer men on all the earth 
 
 Have heard their country's call. 
 Yet there are critics watching you, 
 
 To see how you fall in; 
 So let them see that by God's grace 
 
 You're going out to win. 
 
 Go on Three Hundred Sixty-Eighth, 
 
 Prepare to do your share. 
 We know there'll be a hot old time 
 
 When you get "over there." 
 ''Your country needs you," falter not, 
 
 Though others "slack" and "shirk" ; 
 Roll up your sleeves and show the world 
 
 That you know how to work. 
 
 Go on Three Hundred Sixty-Eighth, 
 
 Go prove your loyalty, 
 And do your bit to "make the world 
 
 Safe for Democracy." 
 
 Go help avenge poor Belgium's wrongs, 
 
 Expose the "fake," the "sham," 
 And get the glory which belongs 
 
 To "Sons of Uncle Sam." 
 
 ELENOR. 
 
 Turn low the lights in the sad, lonely hall, 
 
 Tenderly smooth out her hair, 
 For she has answered the grim reaper's call, 
 
 She who was gentle and fair. 
 Scatter the roses all over her bier, 
 
 Shower the leaves at her feet; 
 Gone is my ideal, my joy and my cheer. 
 
 God, what an awful defeat! 
 
 Draw to the blinds from the world's thought- 
 less gaze, 
 
 Keep her shut in from their sight. 
 My heart is bleeding, my mind is adaze, 
 
 My soul is bereft of its light! 
 
 Close up the harpsichord, 'tis not needed now, 
 
 Her ringers can touch not the keys. 
 No more at her playing shall royalty bow 
 
 Nor poor weary souls feel at ease. 
 Silent the mansion where once music rang, 
 
 Driving all sorrow away, 
 Hushed are those lips which so tenderly sang. 
 
 My love is dreaming today. 
 There 'neath the roses so gently she sleeps, 
 
 There rests the one I adore. 
 My sun went down the passing of you; 
 
 Farewell, my sweet Elenor. 
 
 THE GOOD OLD SHIP SAILED ON. 
 
 Once a builder built himself a boat 
 
 To ride on stormy seas. 
 She was staunch as any ship afloat, 
 
 And she took the waves with ease. 
 As he launched her for her trial trip 
 
 To be a long time gone, 
 The breezes blew, the canvas filled, 
 
 So the good old ship sailed on. 
 
 Then a storm arose, and the lightning flashed, 
 
 And the thunders loudly rolled, 
 And the vessel past a lighthouse dashed, 
 
 Where the bell its warning tolled. 
 But the sailors which the captain chose 
 
 Possessed both brain and brawn 
 So that as the day drew to its close 
 
 Why the good old ship sailed on. 
 
 Though no stars came out and the night grew 
 black, 
 
 And the billows tossed and roared 
 Though no other vessel crossed her track 
 
 And the rain in torrents poured. 
 Still the men kept heart and worked along, 
 
 And at last appeared the dawn; 
 Then they all burst forth in a merry song 
 
 And the good old ship sailed on. 
 
 NONE THERE. 
 
 Once Bridget Murphy used to work 
 
 Down in a small hotel. 
 And why she hated colored folks 
 
 Was hard indeed to tell. 
 But when a rich old uncle died 
 
 And willed to her his all, 
 A dozen servants she employed 
 
 To answer to her call. 
 
 But not a colored man or maid 
 
 Was ever seen around, 
 For Bridget said "upon my place 
 
 No nygers shall be found," 
 And mean and meaner Bridget grew 
 
 Until at last one morn 
 The angel Gabriel came to her 
 
 And loudly blew his horn. 
 
 And Bridget, then upon her knees, 
 
 Said in her last long prayer, 
 "Please take me where no nygers are, 
 
 For them folks I can't bear." 
 "In purgatory," Gabriel said, 
 
 "You'll find there are a few; 
 Some in the first, some in the last, 
 
 Some in the middle pew." 
 
 Then Bridget, who was quick of speech, 
 
 Said "I would not object 
 If into Heaven's pearly gates 
 
 I took my flight direct." 
 
 "But, oh, you'll find large numbers there," 
 
 The angel meekly said. 
 "Well, find a place where they can't come" ! 
 
 Said Bridget, turning red. 
 
 Then Gabriel's wrath was all turned loose, 
 
 No longer was he meek. 
 But like a lion then roared he, 
 
 As Bridget heard him speak, 
 "All right then, madam, you shall go — 
 
 In answer to your prayer — 
 To hell, and to its hottest part, 
 
 You'll find no nygers there." 
 
 SONNET. 
 
 Oh, care-free youth one word I pray, 
 That age just now might speak to thee. 
 For thine own sake give ear to me, 
 And heed the words I speak to-day; 
 For wisdom comes when heads are gray, 
 And eyes are dim and scarce can see. 
 But how much better it would be 
 Before our best has passed away, 
 Would we conserve both mind and health 
 For times when we should be in need. 
 Nor spend-thrifts be to squander wealth 
 And neither be a slave to greed. 
 But strive to live as years unfold 
 A life of service e'en though old. 
 
 THE BIG BELL IN ZION. 
 
 Come, children, hear the joyful sound, 
 
 Ding, Dong, Ding. 
 Go spread the glad news all around, 
 
 Ding, Dong, Ding. 
 
 Chorus. 
 
 Oh, the big bell's tollin' up in Zion, 
 The big bell's tollin' up in Zion, 
 The big bell's tollin' up in Zion, 
 Ding, Dong Ding.

 But glory to the Lamb, I shout !

 THEN ALOUD I CRY. 
 
 Sometimes I feel like Ise got wings 
 
 An' able mos' to fly, 
 Till Satan comes an* clips 'em off 
 
 An' den aloud I cry. 
 
 Chorus. 
 
 Den aloud I cry, 
 
 Den aloud I cry, 
 
 Till Satan comes an' clips 'em off, 
 
 An' den aloud I cry. 
 
 Some folks preten' dey's livin' saints 
 
 An' ready den to die; 
 But when dey t'ink dey's got to go 
 
 Why den aloud dey cry. 
 
 Some folks rise up so high in life 
 
 Dey pass daih friends on by 
 Until dey git a real hahd fall 
 
 An' den aloud dey cry. 
 
 Some folks drink whiskey through de week 
 
 An' steal, an' cheat, an' lie. 
 On Sundays, dough, dey go to church 
 
 An' den aloud dey cry. 
 
 Some folks dey run down othah folks, 
 
 But sneak out on de sly 
 Until you ketch 'em in daih sins 
 
 An' den aloud dey cry. 
In thinkin' 'bout de days gone by. 
 
 DE SWEET CO'N PATCH 
 
 In thinkin' 'bout de days gone by, 
 
 (Dcm sho' was happy days) 
 I sometimes stops an' dwells upon 
 
 My pas', wild, reckless ways. 
 An' den I hab to wondah whaih 
 
 Dat I right now would be, 
 If som'pin hadn't teched my heaht 
 
 An' made a change in me. 
 
 'Cause I would go in comp'ny bad, 
 An' we wid joy would shout, 
 
 When in de wustest debbilment 
 Dat we could tink about, 
 
 But one time — which I 'members well- 
 When I sho' met my match, 
 
 Was when I went one time too much, 
 In Youngses' sweet co'n patch. 
 
 Mos' ebry night we'd go out daih 
 
 Wid sha'pened sticks an' wiah, 
 An' we would steal de bigges' yeahs 
 
 An' roas' 'em in de fiah. 
 An' so one evenin' as de sun 
 
 Was slowly goin' down, 
 You mout ha' seen me on de road 
 
 'Bout half a mile frum town. 
 
 I fust come to a fieT ob beans, 
 
 An' den de sweet co'n patch, 
 I slipped in froo de wiah fence 
 
 An' nebber got a scratch. 
 Now ole man Young dat vaihy day, 
 
 While he was strollin' roun', 
 Had seen de cobs an' shucks we lef 
 
 A layin' on de groun'. 
 
 He stopped an' studied up a way 
 
 Dat he could hab some fun. 
 He sent his wife to town an' got 
 
 Some rock-salt faw his gun. 
 Now when he shot dat gun ob his 
 
 It sho' did make some fuss. 
 It flaihed out kind o' funnel shape — 
 
 'Twas called a blundah-buss. 
 
 Well, as I slid in froo dat fence, 
 
 An' stood upon his place, 
 Why, "Ole Man Young" an' dat ah gun 
 
 Was lookin' in my face ! 
 An' he stood daih faw quite a while, 
 
 But not a wohd he said. 
 An' great big draps ob sweat like dat 
 
 Popped out upon my head. 
 
 An' I was tremblin' in de knees, 
 
 An' knowed not what to do, 
 Until he went to prime dat gun, 
 
 An' den I almos' flew ! 
 You ought to seen me cleah dat fence, 
 
 An' git out ob dat co'n, 
 He yelled at me to halt, you know, 
 
 But I jis kep' right on. 
 
 An' when he seen I didn't stop, 
 
 When he tol' me to halt, 
 He raised dat blundah-buss an' filled 
 
 My breeches full ob salt! 
 An' den I did commence to sprint, 
 
 I made a awful dash, 
 An' passed dat co'n an' beans so fas' 
 
 It looked like succotash 
 
 An' as I dim' de hill faw home 
 
 My eyes was filled with teahs, 
 Which was de las' dat I has shed 
 
 In lo ! dese fohty yeahs. 
 'Cause now if I gits in a place 
 
 Whaih trouble's apt to hatch, 
 My mind goes back wid lightnin* speed 
 
 To dat ah sweet co'n patch. 
 
 SOME DAY 
 
 Some day, my trials here will cease, 
 Some day, my failures will be o'er; 
 Some day, I'll close my eyes in peace, 
 Some day, I'll rest forever more. 
 
 Some day, I'll break these prison bars, 
 Some day, my soul shall mount up, free ! 
 Some day, my crown bedecked with stars 
 Some day, I'll dwell, my Lord with Thee. 
 
 NOAH AN' DE AHK. 
 An Ante-bellum Sermon. 
 
 We will take faw ouah subjec' 
 
 What de scripshurs give to us. 
 Gene-sees, de seventh chaptah — 
 
 Fust to twenty-second vuss. 
 Now, de worl' had got so wicked 
 
 Dat de people wan't no good. 
 An' de Lawd had done tole Noah 
 
 "Make an ahk of gophah wood." 
 
 Faw a hundahd yeahs aw ovah 
 
 Noah's fambly wohked away, 
 While de sinnahs stood aroun' 'em 
 
 Laffin', teasin', all de day. 
 But at las' de ahk was finished 
 
 So de watah it would shed. 
 Den de clouds commenced to gathah, 
 
 An' to blacken ovah-head. 
 
 k 
 
 Den ole Noah he got busy 
 
 Wid de birds dat goes on wings, 
 An' de rats, an' mice, an' bed bugs, 
 
 An' de othah creapin' t'ings. 
 Den he driv 'em in his ahk, suh, 
 
 An' dey scrouged up clost to him, 
 Like a possum when he's hongry 
 
 Scrouges on a simmon limb. 
 
 Den de win' hit stahted blowin' 
 
 An' de rain comminced to poah, 
 While de lightnin' flashed an' crackled, 
 
 An' upon de Ian' did roah. 
 Den de peoples all got frightened, 
 
 An' dey'd run aroun' an' scream. 
 An' de whole creation acted 
 
 Like a night-maih in a dream. 
 
 An' de watahs suh was bilin' 
 
 Like a kittle when its full 
 An' de illiments was loosened 
 
 Like a aggrivated bull. 
 An' de mountings rocked an' trimbled 
 
 While dem rain clouds bust an' fell ; 
 An' de worl' was covahed deepah 
 
 Dan Ise got de tongue to tell. 
 
 Den at las' you know de gushers 
 
 Ob de deep was all cut loose, 
 An' dem springs a spoutin' watah 
 
 In dat ocean raised de doose. 
 An' de wicked kep' a-yellin', 
 
 An' a-swingin' on dat ahk; 
 But ole Noah an' his fambly 
 
 Was as happy as a lahk. 
 
 Yes, suh, sisterin an' breth'en, 
 
 He was mighty happy, too, 
 Knowin' dat he'd done his dooty 
 
 Like de Lawd done tole him to. 
 An' faw fohty days dat watah 
 
 Kep' a-churnin' up an' down 
 T'well it almos' seemed a myst'ry 
 
 Dat de fishes didn't drown. 
 
 But at las' it ceased a-rainin' 
 
 An' dey settled on a rock. 
 Noah den shoved up de winder — 
 
 Poked his noggin out de ahk. 
 Den he sent him out a raven, 
 
 But de watah was so wet 
 Dat de raven didn't tarry, 
 
 Ca'se daih wasn't no place to set. 
 
 Noah sent a dove out nex' den, 
 An' he flew right straight down Souf, 
 
 Till he foun' some olive branches 
 • An' he brought dem in his mouf. 
 
 Den you oughter hyeah de shoutin' 
 Noah whooped an' yelled faw faih. 
 
 Yes, suh, chillen dey was happy, 
 When dat happened ovah daih. 
 
 I kin see ole Noah runnin' 
 
 Wid dem switches in his han', 
 'Ca'se he knowed dat dove had got 'em 
 
 Whaih dey growed upon dry ian'. 
 But he staid a few days longah, 
 
 Den he come on out de ahk, 
 An' I know dat he was tiahd 
 
 Stayin' so long in de dahk. 
 
 I kin see him an' de critters 
 
 Comin' out ob doo's again, 
 Glad dat dey could stretch daih limbs, suh, 
 
 'Thout 'em gettin' soaked wid rain. 
 Den he set him out a vine-yahd, 
 
 An' de grapes jis' growed so fine 
 Dat ole Noah went to wohk, suh, 
 
 Made a hogshead full ob wine. 
 
 An right daih his trouble stahted 
 
 An' he acted like a dunce, 
 Took dat hogshead full of wine, suh, 
 
 An' he drinked it up at once. 
 I'll attemp' no exegesis, 
 
 Naw profoun' philosophy, 
 But I'll use de plaines' langrage 
 
 So as I kin make you see. 
 
 Now de pint I wants to 'lustrate 
 
 Is, de trouble he got in 
 Come from bein' so intemprit. 
 
 Dat was whaih he done de sin. 
 Hyeah he drinked up all dat wine, suh, 
 
 Goin' at dat rapid gait; 
 While 'twould lasted all de wintah 
 
 Had he been mo'e moderate. 
 
 NOW I'VE CHANGED. 
 
 Oft' I've hungered for riches, position and 
 wealth, 
 For a place as it were in the sun, 
 For a monument grand which would stand 
 o'er my grave, 
 When my task upon earth had been done. 
 And I envied the rich man and longed for his 
 ease, 
 And the servants who came to his call, 
 And the silver and gold which he squandered 
 at will, 
 Just as though it were nothing at all. 
 
 Then one night in a dream I grew suddenly 
 
 rich, 
 
 There was gold, yellow gold, all around, 
 
 And the walls of my mansion with precious 
 
 stones gleamed, 
 
 For my treasures e'en covered the ground. 
 
 And refined invitations embellished with gold 
 
 To the rich and the great I did send. 
 There were scores who responded and came to 
 my feast, 
 But I saw not the face of a friend. 
 
 When at last it was over the guests rose to go, 
 
 Amid bowing and scraping to me, 
 And they each one declared me the greatest of 
 hosts, 
 But deceit in their eyes I could see. 
 Then came a grand fellow who bowed to the 
 floor, 
 For a moment I swelled in my pride ; 
 Then he drew out a dagger to plunge in my 
 heart ! 
 I awoke, or from fear I had died. 
 
 Now, I pray for a heart that from envy is free, 
 
 For a soul that is pure as the dew, 
 For a mind in which dwells but the noblest of 
 thoughts, 
 
 For a life that is humble and true. 
 For he profiteth not, though a man may be 
 great 
 
 If his greatness is boughten with strife, 
 Though he gather the riches of Croesus himself 
 
 If to gain it he giveth his life. 
 
 ODE TO FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 
 (One hundred years after his birth.) 
 
 Oh, statesman, orator, and friend, 
 
 Our thanks to thee we bring, 
 This centenary of thy birth 
 
 A song we also sing. 
 But much too weak our voices are 
 
 And far too slight the praise 
 To e'er repay thee for the good 
 
 Accomplished in thy days. 
 
 When slavery's galling yoke oppressed 
 
 Thy weak, submissive race, 
 And human beings bowed their heads 
 
 In misery and disgrace. 
 When oft' the fairest womanhood 
 
 Was placed by driver bold 
 On auction block in scant attire 
 
 To be like chattels sold. 
 
 And then to rice and cotton fields 
 
 Like dumb brutes to be driven, 
 And robbed and cheated of the rights 
 
 Which God to them had given, 
 While stinging lash, and galling chain 
 
 Brought forth heart-rending cries, 
 Then thou denounced that hellish wrong 
 
 In tones which reached the skies. 
 
 And, used no sugar coating, thou, 
 To make thy words more sweet, 
 
 But spoke of slavery as a crime 
 Which Christians should defeat. 
 
 Thou told the Nation of its sin 
 
 Until in sheer alarm 
 The violators of God's laws 
 
 Strove hard to do the harm. 
 
 But still thy efforts never ceased, 
 
 Nor wouldst thou compromise 
 To hold thy peace and close thine ears 
 
 Against thy kinsman's cries. 
 Thy seed took root, sprang up and grew, 
 
 Brought forth an hundred fold 
 The harvest of thy planting then 
 
 Was wond'rous to behold. 
 
 Thy words were hurled from coast to coast 
 
 And burned like living fire, 
 Till other souls were set aflame 
 
 By thy sincere desire. 
 And to thy side came fearless men, 
 
 Who wore no coat of gauze, 
 But armed with truth and righteousness, 
 
 They championed thy cause. 
 
 Then when secession rent the land, 
 
 And war had been declared, 
 At thy request the Negro 
 
 In self defense was bared, 
 And eighty thousand men or more, 
 
 Brave, loyal Negroes all, 
 Who laughed at death for freedom's sake, 
 
 Did answer to the call. 
 
 And by their aid the day was won, 
 
 The Union was maintained, 
 And those, but late in bondage held 
 
 Their liberty had gained. 
 
 Nor didst thou seek for selfish praise, 
 
 Nor hope for further pay 
 Than this that thou might welcome in 
 
 The dawn of Freedom's Day. 
 
 Now though thy form lies mouldering 
 
 Thy fame has spread abroad, 
 Until the mention of thy name 
 
 Doth cause men to applaud. 
 For O, how well thy work was done ! 
 
 Thou left no stone unturned. 
 Thy name in blazing characters 
 
 Upon our hearts is burned. 
 
 Thy children's children tell their sons 
 
 About thy deeds sublime. 
 Thy history shall be preserved 
 
 Until the end of time. 
 And echoes of thy eloquence 
 
 Through this proud land shall ring, 
 Till thou receive thy starry crown 
 
 From Jesus Christ the King. 
 
 IN THAT GREAT DAY. 
 
 When we're crossing over Jordan, 
 
 And the wicked have not any place to stand, 
 I'll be walking with my Saviour, 
 
 J'll be walking with my Saviour on dry land. 
 
 Chorus. 
 In that great day, 
 In that great day, 
 In that great day in the morning, 
 I'll be there. (Repeat) 
 
 When this whole world is in darkness, 
 And the wicked run around and cannot seej 
 
 I'll be walking with my Saviour, 
 And I know He'll be light enough for me. 
 
 When this whole world starts to tremble, 
 And the wicked fear, and cannot stand the 
 shock, 
 
 I'll be standing with my Saviour, 
 And I know He's the everlasting rock. 
 
 When the mountains start to falling, 
 
 And the wicked have not any place to flee, 
 
 I'll be standing with my Saviour 
 And I know I'll be safe eternally. 
 
 When this whole world is on fire 
 
 And the wicked through the flames will have 
 to grope, 
 I'll be standing with my Saviour 
 
 And I know He is life and joy, and hope. 
 
 THOUGH THE EAGLE MAY SOAR. 
 
 I have a strange story to relate tonight, 
 
 You don't hear its kind every day. 
 It tells of a maiden betrothed to a youth; 
 
 It tells how she wandered astray. 
 The fellow was constant, although he was 
 young; 
 
 He loved her more than his own life. 
 He dreamed of the future and what it would 
 bring; 
 
 He planned soon to make her his wife. 
 
 Alas though ! the maid met a wealthier man 
 
 And moved to a far, distant state. 
 The youth, broken hearted, but still trusting 
 on 
 Became reconciled to his fate. 
 He said though the eagle may spread out its 
 wings 
 And soar to a far dizzy height, 
 Yet he, like the sparrow, the swallow, the 
 wren, 
 Must come to his nest at night. 
 
 He governed his temper, and plodded along 
 
 Till fortune rewarded his toil. 
 He then bought a mansion surrounded by 
 lands, 
 
 And lavished his love on the soil. 
 And rich vegetation sprang up at his touch 
 
 And flowers made cheery the way. 
 The poor and the needy he ne'er over-looked, 
 
 But brought joy to some one each day. 
 
 He made others better and this his reward, 
 
 Contentment, and sunshine, and love, 
 And God gave him riches, companions and 
 friends, 
 
 And guided his steps from above, 
 For deeds like an eagle may sail far away, 
 
 And often be lost from our sight, 
 But they, like the sparrow, the swallow, the 
 wren, 
 
 Must come to their nests at night. 
 
 One cold winter's evening a knock at the dooi 
 
 Did call servants thither in fright, 
 And there stood a woman in deepest distress — 
 
 She was a most pitiful sight — 
 Her voice, cracked and shaky, could scarcely 
 be heard, 
 
 Her features were haggard and worn. 
 Her hair was quite thin, and was sprinkled 
 with gray, 
 
 Her clothing was tattered and torn. 
 
 She looked at the servants and tremblingly 
 said: 
 "I beg you don't turn me away. 
 For as you treat others in going through life. 
 
 Like that you'll be treated some day. 
 Although the great eagle may spread out his 
 wings 
 And rise to a wonderful height, 
 Yet he, like the sparrow, the swallow, the 
 wren, 
 Must come to his nest at night." 
 I 
 
 They brought the poor creature without more 
 ado 
 Into the grand mansion, so warm, 
 They fed her and clothed her and nursed her 
 with care, 
 They shielded her head from the storm. 
 Then ere she departed the story she told 
 
 Of how she had come to such shame. 
 She said "although others have helped bring it 
 on 
 Yet I most of all am to blame." 
 
 "Once I was engaged to a noble young man, 
 
 I promised that I'd be his wife. 
 Then along came a man whom I wed for his 
 wealth. 
 
 One false step has ruined my life. 
 But even in childhood I often beheld 
 
 The eagle with all of his might 
 Must act like the sparrow, the swallow, the 
 wren, 
 
 And come to his nest at night." 
 
 "At first I was happy and lived like a queen — 
 
 My wagon was hitched to a star — 
 Then trouble arose and my husband began 
 
 My peace and my pleasure to mar. 
 And ten bitter years have rolled over my head, 
 
 No wonder my hair has turned gray, 
 At last in a rage he attempted my life, 
 
 I saved it by running away. 
 
 "I've fared hard since then, though I've been 
 put in jail, 
 I've slept in the streets many times. 
 The thief and the vagrant my bedmates have 
 been, 
 I've witnessed unmentionable crimes. 
 So what if the eagle can spread out his wings, 
 
 And rise to some far, dizzy height, 
 When he, like the sparrow, the swallow, the 
 wren, 
 Must come to his nest at night?" 
 
 "Oh, would I could stop Father Time in his 
 course, 
 And live those past years, spent in vain ! 
 
 Oh, would I, a maiden all care-free might stand 
 Beside my first sweetheart again! 
 
 I vow I would love him till death did us part, 
 I vow I'd be faithful and true. 
 
 O, Roderick, O, Roderick, wherever you are, 
 I'd die for forgiveness from you!" 
 
 The wronged man bent o'er her and said "I 
 forgive," 
 She gave him a look of surprise, 
 Then gasped and fell forward and spoke not 
 again, 
 And death closed forever her eyes. 
 So, e'en though the eagle can soar when it's 
 day, 
 And rise to a marvelous height, 
 Yet he, like the sparrow, the swallow, the 
 wren, 
 Must come to his nest at night. 
 
 NO CHANCE FOR ME. 
 
 One day while riding in a car 
 
 Along a busy street, 
 An ill dressed man with haggard look 
 
 Beside me took a seat. 
 He said "I beg your pardon, friend, 
 
 If drunk I seem to be, 
 But all the world has turned me down. 
 
 There is no chance for me." 
 
 And then upon his whole past life 
 
 This creature strange did dwell. 
 When he had finished I began 
 
 My grievances to tell. 
 I said "you're white, but I am black, 
 
 I am half slave — you free — 
 So you are wrong, you have a chance. 
 
 There is no chance for me." 
 
 In vain I've struggled all my life, 
 
 No sympathizing hand 
 Has patted me upon the back, 
 
 Defending any stand 
 Which I would take to be the man 
 
 Whom I would love to be. 
 You have the world at your command. 
 
 "There is no chance for me." 
 
 My color is against me, sir, 
 
 No matter where I go — 
 In search of help, or seeking work, 
 
 Some one will tell me "no." 
 While you may work the season through, 
 
 As busy as a bee, 
 In vain I often hunt a job. 
 
 There is no chance for me. 
 
 The car had reached the country then, 
 
 We smelled the balmy air. 
 We saw the fields of waving grain, 
 
 All ripe and standing there. 
 We saw the fruit go to decay 
 
 On vine and bush and tree, 
 With no one who would gather it, 
 
 And yet "no chance for me." 
 
 In silence then we sat a while, 
 
 The skies were clear and blue. 
 The birds sang sweetly in the trees, 
 
 The children they sang too. 
 And as they strolled through daisy fields 
 
 Young lovers laughed with glee. 
 My friend and I had but one thought — 
 
 "No chance for him nor me." 
 
 And as the trolley rumbled on 
 
 New objects came to view. 
 A blind man then got on the car, 
 
 And our attention drew. 
 He said, "I hear the birds' sweet notes, 
 
 But would that I could see." 
 My new-made friend and I rode on; 
 
 "No chance for him nor me." 
 
 A poor old lady then got on, 
 
 And we were moved to tears, 
 That she was deaf we both could tell 
 
 By trumpets in her ears. 
 She could not hear the birds' sweet notes, 
 
 Yet none more blithe than she. 
 My friend and I both looked at her. 
 
 Both said "no chance for me." 
 
 At last a man both deaf and dumb 
 
 Did we espy afar. 
 We knew his plight by signs he made 
 
 Ere he got on the car. 
 He did not murmur nor complain, 
 
 And happy too, seemed he. 
 My friend and I then both forgot 
 
 To cry "no chance for me." 
 
 An object lesson we had seen, 
 
 Amid a world of strife, 
 Of cheerfulness by these folks shown, 
 
 Though burdened down through life. 
 We looked at them and knew that all 
 
 Were much worse off than we. 
 And vowed to never say again 
 
 "There is no chance for me." 
 
 THE CASTLE OF REMEMBRANCE. 
 
 Ofttimes when I am sad and lonely 
 
 And disappointments come my way, 
 And clouds of doubt hang low and threatening 
 
 And turn to night my brightest day, 
 Then to my castle of remembrance 
 
 Come scenes of happy days gone by, 
 When all the world seemed bright and sunny, 
 
 And covered with an azure sky. 
 
 These are the things which still have lingered 
 
 And through the years have followed me. 
 Those days were like a lake of silver, 
 
 And mirrored in their depths I see 
 The scenes which soon dispel my sorrows 
 
 And free my throbbing heart from pain, 
 For in the castle of remembrance 
 
 I live my sweetest days again. 
 
 Once more I feel the joys of childhood 
 As in the babbling brook I wade. 
 
 Or roam with Sue in search of flowers, 
 Deep in the woodland's quiet shade. 
 
 I see the cottage near the orchard. 
 
 I see wistarias in bloom, 
 And there is sister at the window, 
 
 While mother moves about the room. 
 
 I see the corn crib, and the stable, 
 
 The pigeons too, upon the wing, 
 The cattle coming from the pasture, 
 
 The milk house built above the spring. 
 Once more the sun sinks in his splendor. 
 
 The hills fade into shadows deep. 
 Then mother tucks the covers round me, 
 
 And I am lost in blissful sleep. 
 
 YOUTH'S CHOICE. 
 
 A brave youth clad in stern array 
 
 Went forth and met his love one day. 
 
 Love smiled at him and sweetly said, 
 
 " 'Tis time that you and I were wed." 
 
 "I beg," said Youth, and blushed with shame, 
 
 "That I may first converse with Fame." 
 
 They parted then and Love grew cold, 
 While Youth grew haggard, worn and old. 
 Fame saw him struggling on beneath 
 The arch of toil, and placed a wreath 
 Of laurel branches on his head. 
 He then sought love, but love was dead! 
An' de snow was thickly fallin* 
Poem* by Theodore Henry Shackelford 
 
 IF YOU DON'T FAWGIT TO PRAY 
 
 It was drawin' nigh to Crismus, 
 An' de young uns all was glad, 
 An' was 'joicin' 'bout de tu'key 
 To be brought home by daih dad; 
 'Cause daih mammy had done tole 'em 
 "Now when it is Crismus day, 
 You is gwine to hab a tu'key 
 If you don't fawgit to pray." 
 
 But de crops had been a failure 
 An' de stores wouldn't trust, 
 An' it seemed wid out dat tu'key 
 Go dem young uns sholy must. 
 But dey jis kep' on a prayin' 
 An' 'couse 'Cindy jined in too; 
 An' it made me feel so bad, suh, 
 Dat I knowed not what to do. 
 
 It was 'gainst my 'ligious trainin' 
 Faw to steal a single t'ing; 
 (If de fac' dat I was honest 
 What I needed mos' would bring;) 
 Neitah did I want Lucindy 
 Dem po' young uns to deceive, 
 How on ea'th, dough, could I help it 
 Since it now was Crismus Eve? 
 
 But dey only prayed de harder, 
 An' it seemed to urge me on; 
 An' I swore I'd git dat tu'key 
 'Fore dat Crismus Eve was gone. 
 
 Now ole Co'nel Rufus Calhoun, 
 Dat was livin' down de road, 
 Jis had tu'keys by de hundred 
 An' de bigges' kin' dat growed. 
 
 So I got down on my knees suh, 
 
 An' I said "Lawd make it right, 
 
 So as I can git dat tu'key 
 
 Faw dem chillen on dis night!" 
 
 Aftah dat I felt much bettah ; 
 
 I remembahd right away 
 
 How Lucindy said "You'll git him 
 
 If you don't fawgit to pray." 
 
 An' de snow was thickly fallin' 
 As I stole out in de night; 
 An' my footsteps dey was padded 
 By a blanket sof an' white. 
 An' I somehow felt I'd git him 
 'Fo'e de risin' ob de sun, 
 An' I felt so good about it, 
 Dat I jis took out an' run. 
 
 When I wretched ole Co'nel's bahn-yard, 
 
 In de dimness I could see 
 
 Big, dark forms I knowed was tu'keys 
 
 Roostin' in a apple tree. 
 
 I jis clim' right up beside one, 
 
 An' I made a grab at him ; 
 
 But I somehow los' my balance, 
 
 An' I tumbled from dat limb. 
 
 An' I must a 'sturbed dem tu'keys, 
 'Cause dey all flew up in fright; 
 Screamin' like a thousan' debbils, 
 On de stillness ob de night. 
 
 Den I saw a great big mastiff 
 Come a makin' straight faw me 
 An' I picked myself up act'ly 
 An' again I dim' dat tree. 
 
 Den a sudden thought come to me 
 An' I called out loud, you know 
 In a minute den ole Co'nel 
 Come a plowin' thoo de snow; 
 He had brought his big old muskit 
 An' ole Sam had come out too; 
 (Sam, you know had been his servant 
 Since way back in 'fifty-two.) 
 
 Den ole Co'nel took dat muskit 
 P'inted it up in de aiah, 
 An' said "Sambo, bring him hithah, 
 Fin' out what he's doin' daih." 
 But I saved ole Sam de trouble 
 I jis slid on down de tree, 
 'Cause de Co'nel kep dat muskit 
 Alius p'inted right at me. 
 
 I said "Boss I got confusded 
 When de snow blowed in my face ; 
 An' I spose dat's how it happened 
 Dat I strayed into yo' place. 
 When I foun' I was mistaken 
 Yo' big dog got aftah me 
 An' I had no othah choice, suh, 
 But to climb dat apple tree." 
 
 "All right, Mose," den said de Co'nel, 
 "I suppose dat you can leave ; 
 I won't be too hahd upon you, 
 Since it now is Crismus Eve; 
 
 An' I s'pose yo' young uns need him 
 So before you go away, 
 'Sambo bring him dat big tu'key 
 Dat you killed an' picked today." 
 
 Well suh, chillen, I jus, had to 
 Shout right out wid joy, you know, 
 I got on my knees, an' thanked him, 
 In de yahd, in all dat snow. 
 Sambo den had brought de tu'key, 
 So I shouldahd up my load, 
 An' my heart was truly thankful 
 As I went on down de road. 
 
 Cindy an' de young uns met me, 
 As I walked into de doo', 
 An' de all was jis dat happy, 
 Dat dey shouted, too, you know. 
 I had hu't my side an' shouldah, 
 When I tumbled out dat tree, 
 But de shoutin' ob dem young uns 
 Dat was medicine faw me. 
 
 Nex' day at de dinnah table 
 When I come to axe de grace, 
 I said "Lawd bless Co'nel Calhoun, 
 An' all dem what's on his place, 
 We is thankful faw dis tu'key 
 Which you's sent to us today, 
 An' we b'lieves you'll alius help us, 
 If we don't fawgit to pray." 
 
 THE ORPHANS' CHRISTMAS TREE 
 
 I ain't never had no father nor no mother, 
 
 For as Topsy said, "I growed up like a weed. 
 I ain't never had no sisters nor no brothers, 
 
 Nor a cat, nor dog, nor nothin' that I need, 
 Till one day when I was playin' in the gutter 
 Then two real nice ladies came along and 
 spoke to me. 
 An' they said 'at if I'd come an' go 'long with 
 'em 
 'At they'd take me to the Orphans' Christ- 
 mas tree. 
 
 An' they took me to a great big han'some 
 building 
 Where they was jis lots of little girls and 
 boys, 
 All a sittin' round some great, long white- 
 topped tables, 
 An' you couldn't hardly hear your ears for 
 all the noise. 
 An' the plates an' knives an' forks jis kep' on 
 rattlin' 
 An' each lady seemed as busy as a bee, 
 An' they set me down among the other orphans 
 On the night they give the Orphans' Christ- 
 mas tree. 
 
 An' we jis et, an et, an et, an kep' a eatin' 
 Till we couldn't hardly get up from our seats 
 
 'Cause the ladies kep' a comin' round to help 
 us 
 An' a pilin' up our plates with dandy eats. 
 
 An' they give one little boy two great big 
 helpin's 
 An' I guess they must have give me two or 
 three. 
 Oh, an' say, that was the very bestest dinner 
 On the night they give the Orphans' Christ- 
 mas tree. 
 
 We had turkey, mashed potatoes, corn an' yel- 
 low turnips, 
 And cranberries, too, an' pickles, an' green 
 peas. 
 An' milk, an' celery, bread an' shore nough 
 butter, 
 An' mince-meat pie, an' fruit, an' soup, an' 
 cheese, 
 An' me an' t'other little boy jis kep' on eatin' 
 An' our eyes got so they couldn't hardly see. 
 When they pushed some funny doors up from 
 between us, 
 An' the great big, monstrous Orphans' 
 Christmas tree. 
 
 An' oh? it was the mostest pretty tree I ever 
 looked at, 
 It had 'lectric lights an' little balls an' 
 things, 
 An' then some stuff that sparkled jis like dia- 
 monds 
 Was hung all aroun' the tree in great, long 
 strings. 
 An' there was toys for all us little children, 
 
 An' a Santa Claus that chuckled in his glee 
 As he started out to give away the presents 
 On the night they give the Orphans' Christ- 
 mas tree. 
 
 Once Willie Jones's father took some ashes 
 
 An' put 'em in his stockin's in the night, 
 An' Willie he jis cried on Christmas mornin' 
 When he went to get 'em soon as it was 
 light. 
 I'm mighty glad that I ain't got no father 
 
 To play a mean ole trick like that on me, 
 An' besides I wouldn't got this horse an' 
 wagon 
 On the night they give the Orphans' Christ- 
 mas tree. 
 
 THE OLD PEAR TREE. 
 
 That old tree, O*, how I love it; 
 
 For through all the many years 
 It has been my close companion, 
 
 Both through sunshine and through tears. 
 Eighty summers have I witnessed, 
 
 Eighty winters, too, have gone, 
 Since I, as a babe, first rested 
 
 'Neath the pear tree on the lawn. 
 
 Then what pleasure it afforded, 
 
 And what friends for me it made, 
 As I romped with my young playmates 
 
 'Neath its once abundant shade. 
 Pictures now of those sweet moments 
 
 On my memory are drawn ; 
 When I first met little Susan 
 
 'Neath the pear tree on the lawn. 
 
 It was there I wooed and won her 
 
 In the evenings long gone by ; 
 As the moon shone through its branches, 
 
 From a cloudless summer sky. 
 And her cheeks were like the roses, 
 
 And her neck was like the swan, 
 On the day when we were married 
 
 'Neath the pear tree on the lawn. 
 
 Then how quickly sped the moments 
 
 Which were spent beneath that tree ; 
 And it seems that it was planted 
 
 Just for my dear love and me. 
 And the birds would come to wake us 
 
 In the spring at early dawn; 
 Pouring forth their songs of gladness 
 
 From the pear tree on the lawn. 
 
 But alas ! my joy was fleeting, 
 
 For my young bride passed above; 
 And I then was forced to linger 
 
 Here without her gentle love. 
 Now my steps are growing feeble, 
 
 And my arms have lost their brawn; 
 So I spend my time in musing 
 
 'Neath the pear tree on the lawn. 
 
 Sweeter than all other visions 
 
 Are these dreams which come to me 
 Of my love while I am sitting 
 
 'Neath that dear old twisted tree. 
 Though my hair has turned to silver 
 
 And my sight is nearly gone, 
 Still I see her 'neath the pear tree, 
 
 That old pear tree on the lawn. 
 
 THE OLD SAILOR'S STORY. 
 
 "Yes, I've been wrecked a dozen times. 
 
 Upon as many seas, 
 And twice the fire drove me out — 
 
 I'll tell of one of these — 
 A 'ship on fire' makes a sight 
 
 That can't be soon forgot, • 
 But any time it's left to me 
 
 I'll choose a cooler spot. 
 
 'Twas in the good old sailboat days, 
 
 Those happy days of yore, 
 When oft' it took to cross the deep 
 
 Three jolly months or more. 
 And several days and often nights 
 
 The men would sweat and toil 
 To load the good ship Mary Anne 
 
 With merchandise, or oil. 
 
 The 'Mary' was a gallant ship, 
 
 Built long, and rakish too. 
 And all the waves she couldn't climb 
 
 She'd simply plough them through. 
 And swift — I've never seen the ship 
 
 Could beat her in a race — 
 The Mary Anne had rather sink 
 
 Than hold a second place. 
 
 Her skipper was a brave old salt — 
 
 'Cap. Malcolm' was his name — 
 Compared with 'Cap' when he was sore 
 
 A lion sounded tame. 
 And I have often seen him laugh 
 
 Or fairly shout with glee 
 While playing with his life, 
 
 Down on the Carribean Sea. 
 
 Our trade was most all 'coast-wise' then — 
 
 The 'deep sea' trade was slim, 
 And it was such a trip as this 
 
 At last that finished him. 
 'Twas in the Straits of Yucatan 
 
 And heading up the coast, 
 We aimed to reach our journey's end 
 
 In fifteen days at most. 
 
 A good, fresh breeze was blowing up 
 
 And every sail was set, 
 And oh ! the picture that she made, 
 
 I plainly see her yet. 
 The 'Mary's' nose was pointed high, 
 
 And as she raced for home, 
 The canvas popped with pleasant sound, 
 
 And wide she tossed the foam. 
 
 We had a precious cargo then — 
 
 Ten thousand pounds in gold — 
 And some two thousand barrels of rum 
 
 Were stored down in her hold. 
 And 'Cap' was feeling fine that night, 
 
 He walked now 'fore,' now 'aft,' 
 His hands deep in his pockets thrust 
 
 As to himself he laughed. 
 
 The middle watch had just turned out 
 
 So I was free to go, 
 But first I thought I'd look around 
 
 Before I went below. 
 As it was in the month of June 
 
 We had a perfect night, 
 The stars were twinkling far above 
 
 In constellations bright. 
 
 I stood and watched them quite a while 
 
 Then down the ladder went, 
 And in quick time was fast asleep, 
 
 And lost in sweet content. 
 But I had not slept very long 
 
 Before a wild bell's ring 
 Had made me tumble from my bunk 
 
 And up the ladder spring. 
 
 Not while I live shall I forget 
 
 The terrorizing sight 
 Which greeted me when I got up 
 
 Qn that eventful night. 
 For as toward the fo'ard end 
 
 I turned my startled gaze, 
 My heart I think refused to beat, 
 
 The whole ship seemed ablaze ! 
 
 As if some cruel, fiendish hand 
 
 Had made a foolish turn, 
 And dropped a match down in the hold 
 
 To see if rum would burn. 
 The canvas all was licked away, 
 
 Naught stood except the spars, 
 And they were bathed in floods of flame 
 
 That seemed to reach the stars! 
 
 The men were rushing round the deck, 
 
 Confusion reigned supreme! 
 Till 'Cap' came up and took his post 
 
 Amid the fire's gleam. 
 He gave his orders as he would 
 
 On any other trip. 
 'Come on, you lubbers, man those boats, 
 
 We'll have to leave the ship.' 
 
 And every man obeyed him, too — 
 
 We didn't care to stay — 
 But ere we all got in the boats 
 
 The heat drove them away. 
 And 'Cap' was cut off, as the blaze 
 
 Went shooting to the sky. 
 He yelled 'go on,' then waved his hand, 
 
 And tears dimmed every eye. 
 
 It seemed the winds then stronger blew, 
 
 That holocaust to fan, 
 But how it broke our hearts to leave 
 
 'Cap' and the 'Mary Anne.' 
 The hissing flames then higher climbed, 
 
 And hotter grew, until 
 There came a blinding flash of light, ; 
 
 A boom! then all was still. 
 
 For seven days we drifted there, 
 
 Till well nigh craved with thirst, 
 We looked at any time to see 
 
 The worst come to the worst. 
 Just then a steamboat picked us up 
 
 And I went home and stayed 
 A year or two, then once again 
 
 Back to the sea I strayed. 
 
 Just how it was I cannot tell, 
 
 But on my first trip out, 
 We took a cruise which crossed the spot 
 
 That I have told about. 
 I sat up rather late that night, 
 
 But nothing strange occurred 
 Till I began to nod with sleep, 
 
 And then a bell I heard. 
 
 And as the other lads and I 
 
 Walked over to the rail, 
 I swear the Mary Anne hove up 
 
 Amid a fiery trail ! 
 And there stood 'Cap,' still at his post 
 
 His face seemed strange and white, 
 And weird and ghost-like 'Mary' looked 
 
 There in the fire's light! 
 
 The other lads saw her as well, 
 
 So it was not a dream, 
 She raced us then, and beat us, too, 
 
 Although we ran by steam. 
 And then, a fleeting sort of smile 
 
 Crept over 'Cap's' stern face. 
 For as of old it gave him joy 
 
 To win out in a race. 
 
 Although we shoveled in the coal, 
 
 Away from us she drew, 
 Until she left us far behind 
 
 And disappeared from view ! 
 That was the last time that I sailed 
 
 The Straits of Yucatan, 
 And that's the last I've seen or heard 
 
 Of 'Cap' or Mary Anne." 
 
 DOING THEIR BIT. 
 
 Gee! we orphans sure are working- hard this 
 winter. 
 But somehow or other we don't seem to 
 care, 
 'Cause you see we're makin' things to give the 
 Red Cross 
 To help the wounded soldiers "over there." 
 
 Some folks seem to think that just 'cause we 
 are orphans 
 That in life's big doin's we don't have a 
 share. 
 1 just wish that they could see us knittiiv muf- 
 flers 
 To help the wounded soldiers ''over there." 
 
 That's not all we try to do to help 'em. either, 
 For besides the little things that they can 
 wear 
 
 We make bandages and funny things called 
 doughnuts 
 To help the wounded soldiers ''over there." 
 
 'Cause it ain't no fun when you are shot and 
 
 crippled, 
 
 An' besides we wouldn't think that it was 
 
 fair 
 
 If we didn't try to ease their pain an' mis'ry 
 
 An' help the wounded soldiers "over there." 
 
 An' we've got the nicest teacher in creation, 
 She is always gentle, kind an' on the square, 
 
 'Specially when we're makin' things to give 
 the Red Cross 
 To help the wounded soldiers "over there." 
 
 But we're prayin' that the time will soon be 
 comin' 
 When there'll be no cannon's roar nor bugle's 
 blare, 
 When there'll be no need for all these things 
 we're makin', 
 When there'll be no wounded soldiers "over 
 there."

 An' his childish pranks an' questions 
 
 Brings my young days back to me.

 Yo' was 'fraid yo' wouldn't heah, 
 An' you'd ben' way out an' listen 
 
 Wid yo' hand behin' yo' yeah. 
 Den dat song would swell out loudah, 
 
 Thoo de cabin it would ring, 
 Till it soahed way up an' quivahed 
 
 Like a lahk upon, de wing. 
 
 Den she'd soht o' sway an' tuhn it, 
 
 Wid a mannah jis so fine, 
 Dat de little chills and fevahs 
 
 Would run up an' down yo' spine. 
 An' each word, an' line, an' stanzer 
 
 To yo' very soul would cling! 
 When de suppah was a cookin' 
 
 An' you hyeahd my mammy sing. 
 
 When she sung "De Suwanee River" 
 
 It jis seemed to tech yo' heaht, 
 An' to make it sof an' tendah 
 
 When she got to dis hyeah paht : 
 
 "All de worl' am sad an 
 
 Dreary, ev'ry where I roam. 
 Oh, darkies, how my heaht grows weary, 
 
 Fah from de ole folks at home." 
 
 Nex' she sung 'bout "Phar'oh's Army," 
 
 An' it made you mighty glad 
 Dat dem Isr'elites was rescued 
 
 From dat king so strong an' bad. 
 An' it seemed de bells ob heben 
 
 In daih joy begun to ring, 
 When dat suppah was a cookin' 
 
 An' you hyeahd my mammy sing. 
 
 Den 'twas "Weep no mo'e my lady," 
 
 Dat she nex' sung, sweet and cleah, 
 An' it made you feel so rev'rent 
 
 When huh gentle voice you'd hyeah. 
 Mammy nevah used no song books, 
 
 'Cause she couldn't read a note ; 
 But dat music rich and meller, 
 
 Faihly powed out from huh th'oat. 
 
 I has seen great sights an' wonders, 
 
 An' Ise traveled fah an' neah, 
 But dem days spent in dat kitchen 
 
 Is de ones I hoi' mos' deah. 
 You can't fin' no greater pleasure 
 
 In de palace ob a king 
 Dan you can when suppah's cookin' 
 
 An' you hyeah my mammy sing. 
 
 THE BREAK OF DAWN. 
 
 Peace, Peace, ; France, and cease thy heart's 
 wild beating! 
 Neither be fearful of the serpent's sting, 
 Draws near the ending of his reign of terror, 
 Life up thy drooping head once more and 
 sing! 
 Fear not, because of those who would enslave 
 thee; 
 Let not thy slumber be filled with unrest, 
 Fear not the traitor skulking on thy borders, 
 Nor let his poison penetrate thy breast. 
 
 Patiently wait, the time is fast approaching 
 When thou shalt rise with healing in thy 
 wings, 
 Comes now, a herald on his foaming charger, 
 Words of encouragement, to thee he brings, 
 For he proclaims the news that night is 
 ended ; 
 Though its dark shadows long o'er thee 
 were cast, 
 Although the winds of bitter winter smote 
 thee 
 That too is ended, spring has come at last. 
 
 O'er the horizon spreads the blush of morn- 
 ing, 
 Hear thou the bugles and the beat of drums ! 
 See, in the sky "Old Glory" proudly flutters, 
 While, millions strong, a mighty army 
 comes ! 
 
 Heed not false threats, nor tyrants' propa- 
 ganda. 
 Thy noble spirit, and thy dauntless will, 
 Out of the smould'ring ashes of past failures 
 Shall snatch fresh courage, thou shalt 
 triumph still ! 
 
 MY PAL. 
 
 I say, old chap, I'm mighty glad 
 
 That you're a pal of mine, 
 To have a good old chum like you 
 
 Is surely mighty fine. 
 It seems that you appreciate 
 
 The things I try to do 
 And say ! it helps to have some one 
 
 Who always laughs with you. 
 
 A friend to whom you can confide 
 
 A secret now and then, 
 And know that he, your guarded thought, 
 
 Will not repeat again. 
 Who even tries to smooth the scrap 
 
 Between you and your "gal," 
 Here, boy, I'm givin' you my mitt 
 
 I'm glad that you're my pal ! 
 
 GOOD NIGHT, DEAR HEART. 
 
 Good night, dear heart, 
 
 And through the lonely hours, 
 I pray that thou may dwell 
 
 Amid the sweetest flowers. 
 
 Good night, dear heart, 
 And may thy moments be 
 
 In peaceful slumber spent, 
 And filled with dreams of me. 
 
 Good night, dear heart, 
 And may the morning light 
 
 Find thee refreshed and gay, 
 Thy saddened heart made bright. 
 
 Good night, dear heart, 
 Since thou to rest must go, 
 
 No other thought have I 
 Than this, "I love you so." 
 
 COMMENCEMENT. 
 
 Commencement is a day of dreams, 
 Of castles grand, of murm'ring streams, 
 Of cities fair, where roses grow, 
 Of summer clouds, where breezes blow, 
 And this, the wish I bring to you, 
 May all your noble dreams come true? 
Rock-a-bye, Rock-a-bye. 
 
 MY LOUISIANA BABY 
 
 Daddy's comin' home tonight to see his sugar 
 plum, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 An' dis baby's gwine to wait to see de steam- 
 boat come, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 Daddy said he's gwine to bring some sugar 
 
 cane to you, 
 Know you'll be so tickled dat you won't know 
 
 what to do 
 When dat steamer reaches home an' daddy's 
 trip is through, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, 
 My Louisiana Baby. 
 
 Daddy never staid away from home so long 
 
 before, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 But we's gwine to keep him here perhaps a 
 
 week or more, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 Granny says he's her bad boy, an' she can 
 
 make him stay, 
 Lock him in de dinin' room so he can't get 
 
 away, 
 
 Den, o' course, when he's at home with baby 
 he will play, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, 
 •My Louisiana Baby. 
 
 I suppose when you grow up you'll leave yo' 
 mammy, too, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 Go on up de ribber wid yo' daddy den, won't 
 you? 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 Oh, well, mammy she won't min' when you 
 
 is big an' strong, 
 Just as long as you don't stay away from home 
 
 too long, 
 Mammy she would love to hear you sing de 
 boatman's song, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, 
 My Louisiana Baby. 
 
 There, I hear the boat acomin' up the ribber 
 now, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 An' I hear the crowds acheerin' standin' in 
 her bow, 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye ; 
 An' there's daddy, don't you see him comin' 
 
 up de street? 
 Hello, daddy! What is that you's brought 
 
 this chile to eat? 
 Sugar cane an' lasses, too, oh, Law, won't he 
 get sweet? 
 
 Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, 
 My Louisiana Baby. 
 
 WHY POP SNOWDEN FELL FROM 
 GRACE. 
 
 It was put-nigh fohty yeahs now 
 
 Dat "Pop Snowden's" life had been 
 What you'd call a soht ob guide-post, 
 
 'Vidin' righteousness from sin. 
 An' his wife and seben chillen 
 
 All had sheahed his common lot, 
 Till his wife took sick one ebenin' 
 
 And nex' mornin' "she was not." 
 
 But de funeral skaise was ovah 
 
 'Foe "Pop" fell along the way, 
 An' from all his past good habits 
 
 He had wandahed fah astray. 
 Earthly t'ings his min' was claimin' 
 
 He had laid his 'ligion down, 
 Least de gossips had it dat way 
 
 What had spread de news aroun'. 
 
 Cou'se Pop, havin' all dese young 'uns, 
 
 Got de notion in his head 
 For to git anothah mothah 
 
 For dem since de fust was dead. 
 An' it come dat Mandy Bledsoe 
 
 Was de 'oman ob his choice, 
 She was young, and smaht, an' puhty, 
 
 Wid a captivatin' voice. 
 
 But dat gal did love to dance dough, 
 
 An' she said to Pop dat day, 
 When he axed her to be his'n, 
 
 "Well, I'se kindah feahed to say, 
 Pop, you'se oldah dan my fathah 
 
 And wid dem rheumatics too, 
 An' de keerin' faw yo' young 'uns, 
 
 Laws-a-me, what would I do ?" 
 
 So to git in huh good graces, 
 
 Dough he didn't believe 'twas right, 
 Pop agreed to go to "Gilliams" 
 
 To a big, swell dance dat night. 
 Gilliams had a boy name "Sambo," 
 
 An' he sholy wa'nt no Gawk, 
 'Ca'se dat boy could make a banjo 
 
 Do mos' ebry-ting but talk. 
 
 An' a piece of his composin' 
 
 He had promised dat he'd use, 
 'Jis espec'lly faw dat 'casion, 
 
 It was called de "Swamptown Blues." 
 An' de cabin it was crowded 
 
 Wi'd bofe saint an' sinnah too 
 As Pop, — leading Mandy Bledsoe 
 
 By de ahm, — come bustin' thoo. 
 
 Den Sam Gilliam 'chuned his banjo, 
 
 An' he let de music go 
 'Till it ovah-flowed de cabin 
 
 An' was runnin' out de doo.' 
 Yes, dat scandilizin' music 
 
 F'um dat inst'ument did roll 
 Till it took possession ob you 
 
 Bofe yo' body an' yo' soul. 
 
 An' de young folks stahted dancin', 
 
 Faw you couldn't keep your seat, 
 'Less you had a bag of brick-bats 
 
 Faw to tie aroun' yo' feet. 
 Even Pop, he squirmed an' wiggled, 
 
 An' his lips refused to pray, 
 As he saw brazen youngstah 
 
 Lead his lady love away. 
 
 Den "Ole Pop" took off his glasses, 
 
 An' he laid 'em on de shelf, 
 Den he yelled "Look out you sinnahs, 
 
 Each one hustle faw his-self." 
 Made a bee-line faw Miss Mandy, 
 
 An' he grabbed huh 'round de wais'e, 
 An' he almost knocked huh ovah, 
 
 He was jis in dat much has'e. 
 
 "Go on Pop !" de young 'uns shouted, 
 
 An' Pop yielded to daih cries, 
 Took Miss Mandy and he swung huh 
 
 'Till de teahs stood in huh eyes. 
 Still dey wheeled, an' tuhned an' twisted. 
 
 'Till dey tied up in a knot, 
 An' 'twould took a team o' mules, suh, 
 
 Faw to pull 'em bofe apaht. 
 
 Man, Pop laid aside his 'ligion 
 
 Like you would a heavy load, 
 When yoah back is gittin* weary 
 
 An' yo' feet clings to de road. 
 An' as his eyes met wid Mandy's 
 
 He fawgot de chuch's laws 
 While dat banjo weeped an' moaned, suh, 
 
 Like 'twas pleadin' ob his cause. 
 
 Sam jis put mo'e runs and twistes' 
 
 In dem aggravatin' "Blues" 
 'Till ole Pop had danced de bottoms 
 
 Clean f'um off ob bofe his shoes. 
 Still he kep' a swingin' Mandy 
 
 An' he backed huh roun' de floo' 
 'Till she wilted in his ahms, suh, 
 
 An' jis couldn't dance no mo'e. 
 
 Den Pop went an' got his glasses, 
 
 Triumph gleamin' from his eyes, 
 An' sweat streamin' down his fo'ehead, 
 
 As he led away his prize. 
 "What a shame," de gossips whispered, 
 
 "She has got him in huh clutch, 
 Neithah him, now, naw his chillun, 
 
 Will you evah see in chuch." 
 
 But de gossips was mistaken 
 
 Faw when Sunday came, it's true, 
 Daih was Pop, his bride an' young 'uns, 
 
 Sittin' in de mournah's pew. 
 'Stid ob strayin' off an' sinnin', 
 
 Aftah he was growin' ole, 
 Pop had only went an' added 
 
 One mo'e new sheep to de fol\ 
 
 ROASTED SHOAT. 
 
 No son, thankee, I'se had plenty, 
 
 Dis'll do what's on my plate; 
 I ain't had no love for shoat meat 
 Since way back in "fifty eight." 
 
 An' I'll tell you how it happened — 
 
 It was on one Chris'mas Eve, 
 I was kindah young an' devilish 
 
 An' was foolish too I 'lieve. 
 
 Mas' had gone to spen' de Chris'mas, — 
 
 Went to Richmon' on de boat ; 
 So a bunch ob us decided 
 
 Faw to go an' steal a shoat. 
 Him dat done de axul stealin' 
 
 Bravah dan de res' must' be ; 
 An' as usu'l on sich 'casions 
 
 Co'se de honah come to me. 
 
 So dat night as dusk was settin' 
 
 I jis buttoned up my coat, 
 Go my hick'ry club and stahted 
 
 To de pen to git dis shoat. 
 Met de boys down at de paster, 
 
 Tol' 'em I would not be long 
 An' to hab de nah ready, 
 
 Den I hummed a little song. 
 
 An' I saw dat shoat all roasted 
 
 Like dey cooks a shoat down Souf, — 
 Basted like, wid salt an' peppah 
 
 An' a apple in his mouf ; — 
 Skin, you know was thin an' tendah, 
 
 Kinder craunched between your teef, — 
 Wan't no meat on earth could beat it 
 
 Clean from possum down to beef. 
 
 An' it seems dat luck was wid me, 
 
 Faw when I got to de yahd 
 Daih stood one all by his lonesome, 
 
 An' he was as fat as lahd. 
 
 So I jis snuck up behin' him, 
 
 An' I raised my club up so, 
 An' I aimed to let him hab it 
 
 Right between de years, you know. 
 
 But my han' was kin' ob shaky 
 
 An' I only hit his snoot, 
 An' he squealed so loud his mothah 
 
 Right out from huh pen did scoot. 
 She was snortin', too, wid fury, 
 
 An' was headed straight my way; 
 I ain't nevah seed a hog so mad, suh, 
 
 So I moved widout delay. 
 
 'Cause dat wan't no time faw foolin' 
 
 Naw to hoi' no argiment, 
 So wid all my speed an' powah 
 
 Straight towahds de fence I went. 
 But I couldn't see so good dough, 
 
 An' fo'e I had time to stop 
 I had stubbed my toe an' tumbled 
 
 Headlong in a trough ob slop ! 
 
 Filled my mouf wid tater peelin's, 
 
 Got by clothes all soaked to boot, 
 I looked wussah dan de hogs, suh, 
 
 What in dat same trough would root. 
 But I soon got on my feet dough, 
 
 I was 'termined as could be, 
 Not to let dat pleggone hog, suh, 
 
 Stick huh turshes into me. 
 
 Made a bee-line faw de cabin 
 
 An' supprised de fambly so, 
 Dey was nigh driv' into spasms 
 
 As I busted in de doo'. 
 
 Den day axed so many questions 
 
 Dat I lef daih in disgrace, 
 An' it must ha' been two weeks, suh, 
 
 'Fo'e I daihed to show my face. 
 
 Why I missed de celebratin' 
 
 Dat whole Chris'mas season thoo'! 
 All de gals was laughin' 'bout me, 
 
 An' de boys? Why dey laughed too' 
 So you needn't try to make me 
 
 Eat anothah piece ob shoat, 
 'Cause de mem'ry ob dat 'casion 
 
 Makes it stick right in my th'oat. 
 
 THE COUNTRY CIRCUS. 
 
 It was at the country circus, 
 And the crowd was at its best, 
 
 For the air was pleasant, and the day was 
 bright ; 
 And the crowd was eating peanuts, 
 And the band was playing loud, 
 
 And each one was spending money with 
 delight. 
 
 Now they gather round a side show 
 Where the dazzling banners gleam, 
 
 And the spieler rattles off his magic speech ; 
 Then he takes some big red tickets 
 And he passes them around. 
 
 Giving one to every person in his reach. 
 
 "Now," says he, "it costs a quarter, 
 But this ticket and a dime 
 
 Will admit you to the great museum there, 
 Where you'll see the 'wall eyed monkey,' 
 Also 'Zip,' the missing link, 
 
 And 'Czarina,' that large Russian waltzing 
 bear." 
 
 "And the great 'Parisian beauties,' 
 Which, without a bit of doubt, 
 
 It is worth a half a dollar once to see; 
 Then you'll see the great 'What is it?' 
 One strange animal indeed, 
 
 For his head is growing where his tail should 
 be." 
 
 "Now step up and get your tickets, 
 Please don't block the passage way, 
 
 Tickets here for you, and you, and you, and 
 you? 
 Yes, sir, that's the right change, thank you. 
 Oh, here comes another one! 
 Yes, it's something strange, and something 
 grand, and new." 
 
 Though each person did look sheepish, 
 As they came out from the tent, 
 
 Still they vowed 'twas worth the price alone 
 to see: 
 "That 'er wonderful 'what is it?' 
 That was all turned round about, 
 
 For his head was really where his tail should 
 be." 
 
 Then the spieler cried "well people, 
 All the tickets red, are gone, 
 
 But I said they couldn't last before you came, 
 So you'll have to pay a quarter 
 Now to see this great big show, 
 
 Still I know you'll find it's worth it just the 
 same." 
 
 Then the crowd grew wild for tickets, 
 And they swarmed around his box, 
 
 And the seller passed them out with all his 
 might ; 
 Still the crowd kept yelling "tickets !" 
 "Tickets ! one more ticket, please !" 
 And he sweated there from morn' till late 
 at night. 
 
 Then said I, "there must be something 
 That is drawing them in there. 
 
 Every one has been in now it seems but me. 
 Although I don't care about it 
 Just the same I'd like to know 
 
 What it is such a crowd goes in to see." 
 
 Then I took my last, lone quarter; 
 For a ticket plunked it down, 
 And I walked around the tent with beating 
 heart ; 
 Till I found the great "what is it?" 
 That I'd heard so much about. 
 
 "Twas a donkey hitched up backwards to a 
 cart!"

 FIN' YO' PLACE 
 
 Dis ole woiT is full ob misfits 
 
 Dat is alius goin' roun' 
 Findin' fault, aw else complainin* 
 
 Dat conditions keeps 'em down; 
 An' dey says dey's been good footmen, 
 
 But dey's run a losin' race; 
 While de fac' about de mattah 
 
 Is dey's nevah foun' daih place. 
 
 Dey has seen some othah pusson 
 
 Dat was waxin' big an' fat, 
 Cause he picked his nachal callin', 
 
 An' dey goes an' jumps in dat. 
 An' jis as might be expected, 
 
 Cou'se, dey falls down flat wid it; 
 But dey stays daih losin' money, 
 
 Jis because dey's 'shamed to quit. 
 
 Some will try to be puffessahs, 
 
 An' dey totes aroun' a book, 
 While dey b'longs in some one's kitchen 
 
 As a scullion to de cook. 
 Den you'll see anothah strugglin' 
 
 In some job dat's mean an' bad, 
 What would make de greatest teachah 
 
 Dat de worl' has evah had. 
 
 Den daih's some what tinks dey's singahs 
 
 Dat ain't got a bit mo'e voice 
 Dan a ordinary chicken, 
 
 An* dey ain't got much mo'e choice. 
 Dey could peddle fish and oysters, 
 
 An' perhaps could call out trains; 
 I don't know about dat, eithah, 
 
 'Cause at least dat takes some brains. 
 
 Some, whose signs says dey is doctahs r 
 
 Goes to call upon de sick; 
 But dey's less apt to recovah 
 
 Dan dey is to die right quick. 
 An' dey's some what claims dey's lawyahs, 
 
 But dey makes a big disgrace 
 Ob demselves an' all daih clients 
 
 When dey goes to plead a case. 
 
 An' we's got some would-be poets, 
 
 But daih vusses is so po' 
 Dat de only ting dey's fit faw 
 
 Is to th'ow out in de snow. 
 Aldough dey can write a jingle, 
 
 Aw some little childish rhyme, 
 When it comes to writin' poems 
 
 Dey is only wastin' time. 
 
 Den you'll see some great big giant, 
 
 Health is good an' muscles strong, 
 Sittin' at some one's pianner, 
 
 Try'n' to sing some rag-time song; 
 He belongs out on some steamboat, 
 
 Wo'kin way down in de hoi' 
 Eithah totin' up de ashes, 
 
 Aw else passin' down de coal. 
 
 Den you see dese one-hoss eldahs 
 
 Dat can neither preach naw sing; 
 All dey's good at is at shoutin' 
 
 Aw to cut de pigeon wing. 
 Stid ob standin' in de pulpit, 
 
 Try'n' to preach de word ob Chris', 
 Dey belongs down in Ca'lina, 
 
 Wo'kin' in de fiel's ob rice. 
 
 Now, I don't believe de Mastah 
 
 Has a wo'k he'd call us to, 
 Lessen he would fust prepaih us 
 
 Dat some kin' ob work to do. 
 An' dey'll be less discontentment, 
 
 An' not half so much disgrace, 
 When each feller make an effort 
 
 Faw to fin' an' keep his place. 
 
 SAY A WORD FAW FATHAH 
 
 Faw goodness' sake, won't you all stop dat 
 racket? 
 
 I tink it's time to let dat subjec' drop; 
 I tell you, when you wimmen gits to talkin' 
 
 It seems as if you's nevah gwine to stop. 
 Besides, it ain't a t'ing but fogyism, 
 
 Who said "man only wo'ked from sun to 
 sun"? 
 Why, you all keeps so busy wid yo' gabbin' 
 
 Is why dat you all's wo'k is nevah done. 
 
 An' den you jis said ev'ry man was wicked, 
 
 Wid all de young uns listenin' daih to you, 
 An' dey has got sich confidence in "mammy" 
 
 Dat dey bleeves ev'ry word she says is true, 
 O' co'se, some times you'll run across a fellah 
 
 Dat will do lots o' wicked little t'ings ; 
 But in my life I'se seen a heap o' wimmen 
 
 Dat wa'n't a flyin roun' on angel's wings. 
 
 'Co'se, I ain't got no fault to fin' wid wimmen — 
 
 I deahly loves to praise 'em, goodness 
 knows ; 
 But when dey keeps a pickin' on de men folks, 
 
 Why, den dey's kindah trampin' on my toes. 
 An' den dem songs dey sing about de mothahs ! 
 
 'Twould seem to me dese poets ought to 
 know 
 A little praise is sholy due de fathahs, 
 
 De way dey go thoo heat, an' rain, an' snow. 
 
 So nex' time all you wimmen gits togethah 
 Don't say de t'ings you don't know nothin' 
 'bout, 
 But try an' membah fathah, who is workin' 
 So him dat owns de house won't tuhn you 
 out; 
 An' greet him wid a smile instid o' frownin* 
 When faw de night he's comin' home to 
 stay, 
 An' res' ashowed de choice o' words you useg 
 Will eithah help to straight or crook de way. 
 
 A hoss will sholy do some mighty pullin' 
 If you will gib him sugah now an' den ; 
 
 Well, if a little sweetnin's good faw hosses, 
 It Stan's to reason dat 'twould be faw men. 
 
 'Co'se, I don't mean to praise de lazy fellah, 
 What nevah had a min' faw doin' right, 
 
 But him dat's strainin's ev'ry nerve an' sinew 
 An' jis a toilin' on wid all his might. 
 
 So smile an' kindah pat him on de shouldah 
 
 When he is weary an' his back is bent, 
 An' let him know you 'predates his effo'ts 
 
 To buy de coal an' food, an' pay de rent. 
 An' den you'll fin' de men folks gittin' bettah. 
 
 An' home will be a heap mo'e cheerful when 
 He knows he's got a lovin' wife to greet him 
 
 So say a word faw fathah now an' den. 
 
 CHRIST AND THE WOMAN 
 
 'Twas an angry howling rabble 
 
 Which had blocked the narrow street 
 When they saw the Savior coming, 
 
 And some surged around his feet, 
 While a guilty, frightened woman 
 
 Was by others pushed along, 
 Until they had forced a passage 
 
 Through the ever-growing throng. 
 
 "Oh, Good Master, let us stone her !" 
 
 Her tormentors loudly cried ; 
 But the Savior, looking downward, 
 
 With the dust seemed occupied. 
 Then he saw the crying woman — ■ 
 
 In her weakness all alone — 
 And demanded that the guiltless 
 
 Be the first to cast a stone. 
 
 There was silence then among them, 
 
 By that crowd no stones were cast; 
 Each accuser's guilty conscience 
 
 Made its owner stand aghast. 
 Thus the Savior had rebuked them, 
 
 Who had cried for blood before; 
 Turning then, He told the woman: 
 
 "Go in peace, and sin no more." 
 
 WHEN THE GAME IS OVER, JIM 
 Once there was a baseball player 
 
 On the pinnacle of fame; 
 But he gave up his profession 
 
 To defend his country's name. 
 And he left a charming sweetheart, 
 
 For he had not time to wed; 
 So he told her to be faithful, 
 
 And to him she softly said: 
 
 Chorus: 
 Well, Jim, when the game is over 
 
 And the team we love has scored, 
 When has ceased the cannon's roaring 
 
 And real peace has been restored, 
 Do not grieve about your sweetheart, 
 
 Or wonder if I am true, 
 For I swear by dear "Old Glory" 
 
 I will wait right here for you. 
 
 Long in strange and hostile countries 
 
 Were the brave lads forced to roam, 
 But at last they won the vict'ry, 
 
 And they brought the bacon home ; 
 And a crowd was there to meet them, 
 
 And they gave cheer after cheer, 
 Then beside him stepped Jim's sweetheart, 
 
 And she whispered in his ear : 
  
 
 THE FIFTEENTH REGIMENT 
 
 Make has'e, boy, you triflin' scoun'el, 
 
 Put dem strings an' tops away; 
 What you spec' I want to stan' hyeah 
 
 Watchin' you faw all de day? 
 Now I bet I'll wahm yo' jacket 
 
 If you make me miss dis treat, 
 Seein' dat ah Fifteenth Reg'ment 
 
 Comes a marchin' down de street.

 Steppin' wid de music, too; 
 As you watch dem cullahd soljahs 
 
 It jis thrills you thoo an' thoo. 
 Gals come dressed up in daih finest, 
 
 Lookin' fit enough to eat, 
 When dat fightin' Fifteenth Reg'ment 
 
 Comes a marchin' down de street. 
 
 Hush, chile, listen! Ain't dey comin? 
 
 Yes, dat is dem comin' now! 
 I can hyeah de crowds hurrahin', 
 
 I can see de soljahs bow. 
 Son, don't think yo' granny's crazy, 
 
 But dat music 'fects my feet, 
 When dat fightin' Fifteenth Reg'ment 
 
 Comes a marchin' down de street. 
 
 Lawzee, honey, hyeah dat music! 
 
 Ain't dem chillen playin' some? 
 Den jis look daih in de middle,

 His whole body's in dat playin', 
 From his head down to his feet, 
 
 When dat fightin' Fifteenth Reg'ment 
 Comes a marchin' down de street.

 If I wa'n't afraid dese subways 
 
 An' dese "L's" would run me down.

 Dat ah playin' is so sweet, 
 When dat fightin' Fifteenth Reg'ment

 Seein' how dat she's acheerin' 
 
 An' atreatin' dem today. 
 Rich folks sendin' invitations,

 Well, I'se mighty glad I'se able 
 
 Faw to do "my bit" today, 
 Dough it mos' nigh broke my heaht, suh, 
 
 When dem youngstahs ma'ched away. 
 Glory Hallelujah, Honey!

 Right out wid dat Fifteenth Reg'ment

 Ain't dey happy, too, jis see 'em; 
 
 Boys, yo' mothah's watchin' you! 
 An' I know de Lawd in Glory 
 
 Has his eyes upon you, too. 
 
 An' dat repperbate, "de Kaisah," 
 
 Mout as well expect defeat, 
 When you reaches "ovah yondah" 
 
 An' goes marchin' down de street. 
 
 THE CALL OF THE WOODLAND 
 
 The August day draws to its swelt'ring close, 
 
 I seek for rest, alas ! but find it not ; 
 Rings in my ears a once-instinctive call, 
 
 Which makes me long to leave this dusty 
 spot, 
 And roam the virgin forests once again, 
 
 Far from the disappointing scenes of life, 
 Far from the city's smoke and toil and din, 
 
 Far from its ceaseless care and endless strife. 
 
 Where woodland giants, long uprooted, lie, 
 With moss and earth still clinging to their 
 roots, 
 Where in this magic garden mounting high 
 
 A fern or shrub from every hollow shoots; 
 Where feathered songsters, free from care, 
 abound, 
 And flowers rare and beautiful are seen, 
 Where at each turn some fresh surprise is 
 found, 
 While over all is spread a verdant green. 
 
 Down paths in which some ancient antlered 
 king 
 
 Had roamed before his herd in days of yore, 
 While at his call the rocks and trees did ring, 
 
 As proudly, boldly, he led on before ; 
 
 Where red men, too, have halted in their grief 
 To pile them up a little mossy mound, 
 
 To mark the spot where some old warrior 
 chief 
 Doth rest within his happy hunting ground. 
 
 Where in some cave shaped out by nature's 
 hands 
 
 I'll hear the noisy brook go babbling by, 
 Or, plunging deep into the forest's shade, 
 
 Will catch but glimpses of the azure sky ; 
 Then on a bed prepared from pine tree's 
 boughs 
 
 I long at length my weary form to lay, 
 Where I can hear the whippoor-will at eve' 
 
 And view the closing of a perfect day. 
 
 MY AMBITION 
 
 I dare not hope to conquer fame, 
 
 N{ot ever see the time 
 When in this body I shall dwell 
 
 Upon the heights sublime. 
 But I would love to make men glad, 
 
 And be content the while 
 
 To cast mine with the common lot, 
 Could I but make them smile. 
 
 Then would I love to steal away, 
 To greet the coming dawn, 
 
 And leave the whole world smiling still 
 Long after I had gone. 
 
 THE QUESTION. 
 
 The day had disappointment brought, 
 
 And I was sore distressed ; 
 A sob of pain burst from my lips, 
 
 As I lay down to rest. 
 But Morpheus came softly down, 
 
 And lulled me off to sleep ; 
 And then I dreamed that thou didst come 
 
 And bid me not to weep. 
 
 And thou wast robed in spotless white, 
 
 A smile was on thy face ; 
 And then a kiss upon my brow 
 
 I dreamed that thou didst place. 
 Led by thy love I then arose, 
 
 Nor minded man's dark frown; 
 But climbed the dizzy, rugged heights, 
 
 And from them snatched the crown ! 
 
 Oh, could that wondrous dream come true, 
 
 To thee would I hold fast ; 
 And love thee dear with all my heart, 
 
 As long as life should last. 
 But thou art many miles away, 
 
 And in another land; 
 And vales, and mountains, I must cross 
 
 If I would seek thy hand. 
 
 But "faint heart lady fair ne'er won," 
 
 Nor victor's steed did ride ; 
 And so I ask thee, love of mine, 
 
 If thou wilt be my bride? 
 What e'er to thee will joy impart 
 
 That shall I gladly do. 
 Now speak my love and answer me — 
 
 Pray will my dreams come true? 
 An you know I seen dem punkins. 
 
 THANKSGIVIN' DAY 
 
 Well, ole 'oraan, Ise been thinkin' 
 
 Nea'ly all dis whole week froo 
 Dat it's gittin' mighty lonesome, 
 
 No one hyeah but me an' you. 
 Since de young ones all got ma'ied, 
 
 An' ouah heads is tuhnin' gray 
 T'ings won't seem jus' like dey use to 
 
 When it comes Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 Ain't no use to kill a tu'key, 
 
 When it's only faw us two; 
 We's got lots ob ham an' bacon, 
 
 Mout as well to let dat do — 
 Faw 'twill bring sad recollections 
 
 Ob dem times dat once was gay, 
 If you cook a ole-time dinnah 
 
 On dis nex' Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 Hyeah's bofe Anne an' William Henry 
 
 Done an' writ dat dey can't come ; 
 Social 'gagements keeps 'em busy, 
 
 Well I guess dat's goin' some ! 
 Now when I was young an' heahty, 
 
 Like ouah young ones is today, 
 Wa'n't a thing 'cept death its-self, suh, 
 
 Made me miss Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 'Cause I knowed dem juicy 'simmons 
 
 Was a-rip'nin' on de tree, 
 An' I also knowed my mammy 
 
 Was a-waitin' daih fo' me. 
 Hence dey wa'n't no social 'gagement 
 
 Big enough to make me stay 
 From my mammy an' dat table 
 
 Week befo' Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 An' you know I seen dem punkins 
 
 'Fo de fros' had nipped de vines, 
 An' dey den was big an' heavy 
 
 An' was meller to de rines. 
 I seen daddy when he pulled 'em 
 
 Also hid" 'em in de hay, 
 Put 'em daih jis so my mammy 
 
 Could make pies Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 An' I seen dat tu'key gobbler 
 
 Roostin' 'way up in de trees, 
 Jis so big an' fat an' sassy, 
 
 He don't min' de chillin' breeze. 
 An' I's fed him lots o' co'n an' stuff, 
 
 So roun' de yahd he'll play, 
 'Cause I know we sho' will need him 
 
 When it comes Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 Dough de season has been rainy, 
 
 An' we's had a lot o' fog, 
 It has ripened dem cranberries, 
 
 Dat am growin' in de bog. 
 So I goes an' picks a bushel, 
 
 An' I sets 'em all away, 
 To accompany dat ah tu'key 
 
 On his trip Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 Well, at las' de day approaches, 
 
 An' upon de night befo' 
 We takes lots o' fruit an' punkins 
 
 To de church to help de po'. 
 An' we also brings dat tu'key 
 
 From dat apple tree to stay, 
 An' my mammy cleans an' stuffs him, 
 
 Gits him ready fo' nex' day. 
 
 Den upon nex' mo'nin, ea'ly, 
 
 Mammy gits us all awake, 
 Aftah breakfus' she stahts dinnah, 
 
 An' she sholy takes de cake ; 
 Faw she has dat dinnah cookin' 
 
 'Fo' she sends us all to pray 
 In de chu'ch an' hyeah de sermon 
 
 'Bout de fust Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 Well, as soon as it was ovah 
 
 Straight back home we all would go ; 
 We could smell dem victuals cookin' 
 
 Soon as we had hit de do' ; 
 An' we all would set de table 
 
 Wif'out any mo' delay, 
 An' we sho' was glad dem Pilgrims 
 
 T'ought about Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 Den my mammy brought de tu'key, 
 
 Wid de gravy oozin' out, 
 An' de well-browned sweet potatoes 
 
 Was a-rollin' all about. 
 Daih was also soup an' celery 
 
 Punkin pie an' co'n souffle, 
 Lima beans dat swum in buttah, 
 
 Ham an' cabbage, too, dat day. 
 
 Den I felt a soht o' ticklin' 
 
 Twixt my sho't ribs an' my spine. 
 (Which am nature's way ob sayin' 
 
 Dat yo' appetite am fine;) 
 An' it seemed dat sin, an' sorrer, 
 
 From dis ea'th had gone to stay, 
 When at las' de grace was ended 
 
 An' it was Thanksgivin' Day. 
 
 RAINY WEATHAH 
 
 What's dat, Cindy, ten to leben? 
 
 Laws, an' how dis rain do po' ; 
 Guess by noon, if it keeps comin', 
 
 Why you can't git out de doo' — 
 Ditch is put nigh full ob watah — 
 
 Road is full of slush an slop — 
 House is damp, an' walls is sticky ; 
 
 My! I wish dis rain ud stop!

 Beggin' me faw food to eat, 
 But I'll sho git rheumatism 
 
 If I goes an' wets my feet.

 Nevah will see me come in it,

 Now go 'way, an' lemme sleep some ; 
 
 Laws, I wish dis rain ud stop ! 
 
 THE KEEPER OF THE LIGHT 
 
 In a lighthouse, tall and lonely, 
 
 On Superior's storm-swept edge, 
 Lived a man, his wife and daughter, 
 
 There upon a rocky ledge. 
 And he kept the light a burning, 
 
 Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall; 
 Never vessel sought assistance 
 
 But he answered to the call. 
 
 And the lives of many seamen, 
 
 Wrecked upon that rock-bound coast, 
 Oft' were saved, because the keeper 
 
 Ever stood beside his post. 
 Thus one cold November morning, 
 
 Ere the day had scarce begun, 
 Great, dark clouds, like spectres moving, 
 
 Hid from view the rising run. 
 
 And the wind, increasing ever, 
 Churned the waters into foam, 
 
 And it piled them, boiling, seething, 
 At the base of that lone home. 
 
 Then the keeper told of tempests 
 Which had been in days of old, 
 
 And his wife and daughter listened, 
 'Though their very blood ran cold. 
 
 Hark! a sound out on the ocean 
 
 Rises high above the gale, 
 Now it louder grows and clearer! 
 
 Now dies off to but a wail. 
 Wide the door the keeper opens, 
 
 And the spray around him flies, 
 But he stands transfixed with horror 
 
 At the sight before his eyes! 
 
 There he sees a storm-tossed vessel, 
 
 Driven from her course astray, 
 All her sails are torn to pieces, 
 
 All her boats are washed away! 
 Angry seas are dashing o'er her, 
 
 And 'tis plain she cannot last ; 
 Neither can the keeper's life-boat 
 
 Ever weather such a blast! 
 
 But the siren still is blowing, 
 
 Blowing, pleading, calling "come!" 
 To the rigging forms are clinging, 
 
 From exposure almost numb. 
 Though he feels the task is hopeless, 
 
 And his heart fills with despair, 
 Still, he knows that he as keeper 
 
 Must not let them perish there. 
 
 He obeys the call of duty, 
 
 And he starts upon his way ; 
 But the wild waves pitch and toss him, 
 
 And they drench him through with spray ! 
 
 Ill 
 
 Wife and daughter, standing helpless, 
 
 Hardly dare to draw a breath 
 As they watch the noble keeper 
 
 In his battle there with death ! 
 
 He is drawing near the vessel, 
 
 When a cruel, hungry wave 
 Like a demon leaps upon him, 
 
 And himself he cannot save! 
 All the days since early childhood 
 
 Come to him now, fast and clear, 
 And he sees sights long forgotten 
 
 As the end is drawing near. 
 
 He remembers how his mother, 
 
 As her eyes were growing dim, 
 Asked the loved ones gathered round her 
 
 Just to softly sing the hymn : 
 "Shall we meet beyond the river, 
 
 Where the surges cease to roll, 
 Where in all the bright forever 
 
 Sorrows ne'er shall press the soul?" 
 
 And he saw her sweetly smiling 
 
 As she crossed the narrow sea; 
 "Ah, that song was good for mother; 
 
 It will surely do for me. 
 Yes, dear mother, I will meet you 
 
 In that happy land above, 
 Where no sorrow ever cometh, 
 
 There where all is joy and love." 
 
 Then he breathed a prayer to heaven 
 For his weeping wife and child; 
 
 And he knew that he was sinking 
 In those waters deep and wild! 
 
 But the thought of seeing mother 
 
 Seemed to ease his weary soul, 
 As he passed beyond the river, 
 Where the surges cease to roll. 
 
 YESTERDAY . 
 
 How fast the years have fled since you first 
 came; 
 An angel in the form of man you seemed to 
 be; 
 And how your presence lightened up my dark- 
 ened life 
 Then as you spoke those magic words to 
 me. 
 But yesterday, it seems, you called again 
 With outstretched arms, and clasped me to 
 your own strong heart, 
 And on my finger placed this ring which glit- 
 ters so 
 And vowed that Death, us twain, should nev- 
 er part. 
 
 Then on my lips you placed a fervid kiss, 
 No longer did the world seem dark or cold 
 to me. 
 My love for you was kindled like a flaming 
 torch, 
 Than I was then, no queen more gay could 
 be; 
 But ere that kiss had faded from my lips, 
 Another, from my trembling side, stole you 
 away ; 
 
 'Twas thus you left me standing there in grief 
 alone, 
 My heart still bleeds though that were yes- 
 terday. 
 
 MY DREAM GIRL. 
 
 Oh, there's something seems to tell me you're 
 my dream girl 
 Whom I've sought with ever-changing hopes 
 and fears, 
 That at last I've found, and know that you're 
 the one pearl 
 Which will hold its luster, through the 
 changing years. 
 
 Oft, when nights were long and still, and 
 stars were gleaming, 
 Has there come a soul, in harmony with 
 mine; 
 'Twas a soul whose eyes with love and truth 
 were beaming, 
 Yes, a dainty soul, wrapt in form divine. 
 
 Through the night, she, near my couch would 
 tarry 
 Like the purple, blushing clouds at early 
 dawn; 
 How my heart did yearn its message then to 
 carry, 
 But before the sun had risen, she had gone. 
 
 Then my heart did wildly flutter at its heart 
 strings, 
 And did strive to follow where my ideal led, 
 But its strivings, and its pain were only vain 
 things, 
 For I knew not where my little dream girl 
 fled. 
 
 But at last, my heart of hearts, it seems I've 
 
 found you, 
 
 For i know your looks, your smile, your 
 
 form divine, 
 
 And within my arms I long to really hold you, 
 
 And forever more to love and call you mine. 
 
 THE GIRL ON THE BOARDWALK. 
 
 Can it be that I am dreaming 
 As my morning walk I take? 
 
 No ! I pinch myself and answer 
 I am clearly wide awake. 
 
 So I know that you're no dream girl 
 Born of fairy's wand at night, 
 
 From your palace come to charm me 
 In the pearly Autumn light 
 
 Still you cast a spell about me, 
 Fairest maiden ever born, 
 
 As you flitter hither, thither, 
 
 Like one borne on wings of morn. 
 
 And I wonder where you came from, 
 Wonder too, where you will go 
 
 When you leave Atlantic City 
 As the sad winds start to blow. 
 
 And I long to clasp you, hold you, 
 
 Yes, forever and a day! 
 But no look of recognition 
 
 From your eyes has come my way. 
 
 Then I know you are a dream girl, 
 Born of magic wand by night; 
 
 And I see you fading, fading; 
 
 You have vanished from my sight. 
 
 THE FICKLE LOVER. 
 
 So you say you's angry wid me, 
 An' you's leavin' town tonight, 
 
 Gwine away to stay fo'evah, 
 Now Sam I don't t'ink dat's right !

 Aw if I was really true! 
 
 An' you nevah did love Cindy!

 When you went up daih to visit

 THE PRODIGAL SON. 
 
 "Yes, father, I'm about to go. 
 
 The place has lost its charm. 
 The world has more in store for me 
 
 Than dying on a farm." 
 Thus spoke a lad, long years ago, 
 
 As he prapered to leave 
 The only home he ever knew, 
 
 And thus his parents grieve. 
 
 His mother begged him not to go, 
 
 His father pleaded too. 
 But he replied, "my mind's made up 
 
 And that I'm bound to do; 
 And so my portion give me now 
 
 Which falleth unto me, 
 And ere the moon be full again, 
 
 From thee, I, far shall be." 
 
 The father said, "alas my son, 
 Why break your mother's heart !" 
 
 But still his share the son received 
 And with it did depart. 
 
 In foreign lands he traveled far, 
 
 And many sights saw he. 
 He saw the wonders of the land, 
 
 The myst'ries of the sea. 
 
 And on fair women, wine, and song, 
 
 His money he did spend. 
 Nor ever slackened he his pace 
 
 Until his wealth did end. 
 He pawned his rings, his golden chain 
 
 He pawned his raiment fine, 
 Then, as a last resort, was forced 
 
 To live by herding swine. 
 
 His clothes grew filthy, tattered, torn, 
 
 With hunger he did ache. 
 He said, "I was indeed a fool 
 
 A course like this to take, 
 While here I languish, and would fain 
 
 The husks with swine to share, 
 My father's servants there at home 
 
 Have plenty and to spare. 
 
 I will arise, and go to him 
 
 And his forgiveness seek." 
 He went, and as he neared his home 
 
 His look was sad and meek. 
 He said, "I am unworthy now 
 
 To be a son to thee, 
 But if my folly thou'lt forgive, 
 
 Thy servant I will be." 
 
 The father hasted then, and ran, 
 
 And hugged and kissed his boy, 
 And ordered killed the fatted calf 
 
 And held a feast of joy. 
 He bade his friends come to that feast, 
 
 He spread the news around, 
 "He who was dead has come to life, 
 
 He who was lost, is found." 
 
 EVA. 
 
 Oft' I've noticed in the Springtime 
 
 When the winter days are o'er, 
 How the sweet and pretty blossoms 
 
 Cover mountain, vale, and moor; 
 And I always love to pick them 
 
 As I journey on my way. 
 But alas! the fairest, sweetest, 
 
 "Fade and wither in a day." 
 
 Even so was it with Eva, 
 
 Fairer flower never grew; 
 Always kind and tender hearted, 
 
 And as pure as morning dew; 
 Never on that dear old campus 
 
 Has there walked more perfect girl; 
 She from duty never faltered ; 
 
 Eva was indeed a pearl. 
 
 And while others took life easy, 
 She about her tasks would go ; 
 
 Through the scorching rays of summer, 
 Autumn's wind, and winter's snow. 
 
 Although others proved ungrateful 
 
 For the favors she had done; 
 On her course she still continued; 
 
 Tried to comfort every one. 
 
 Thus it used to give me pleasure 
 
 Just to wander o'er the hills, 
 And to pick the fragrant flowers 
 
 Near the brooks and shady rills ; 
 And to give them all to Eva, 
 
 Though t'was little in my sight, 
 She a passion had for flowers 
 
 And would take them with delight. 
 
 With the fast approach of summer, 
 
 Graduation near at hand, 
 Eva went to do her shopping, 
 
 Her commencement dress was planned; 
 But there came a sudden illness, 
 
 She grew weaker day by day; 
 Then it seemed that in a twinkling 
 
 Her young life had passed away. 
 
 And the goods which she had purchased, 
 
 And of which she was so proud ; 
 By her loving friends were taken, 
 
 And were made into a shroud. 
 Calm she lay among the flowers, 
 
 O'er the pillow streamed her hair, 
 In her hand was her diploma; 
 
 (That was her Commencement there!) 
 
 Graduated from earth's college, 
 
 Now to Heaven she has gone; 
 From these shores so dark and dreary 
 
 To a land of perfect dawn. 
 And I trust that some bright morning 
 
 I shall see her face so fair, 
 As she stands among the flowers, 
 
 "In the upper garden there," 
 
 HOW SAM GOT THE BEAR. 
 
 Sam Griffin was a huntin' man, 
 
 Who lived in Tennessee, 
 An' of his skill wid gun an' dogs, 
 
 He loved to boast, did he. 
 He'd caught mo'e possums, killed mo'e baihs 
 
 Dan any man in town — 
 At least he used to say he had, 
 
 When loaferin' aroun'. 
 
 He owned a "ole time flint lock" gun 
 
 Dat couldn't kill a lahk. 
 I know 'twas made a hundahd yeahs 
 
 'Fo'e Noah built de ahk. 
 He also owned a mangy houn', 
 
 An' he was ancient, too. 
 His teef was gone, an' bread an' milk 
 
 Was all dat he could chew. 
 
 But Sam would blow about his dog 
 
 An tell about de day 
 When "Towsah" et a full-growed baih, 
 
 An' chased de cubs away. 
 
 An' den his wife would look at him, 
 
 An' kindah squint huh eyes, 
 An' say, "aw Sam, go cut some wood, 
 
 An' stop yo' telling lies." 
 
 But Sam persisted 'till one day 
 
 A show 'nough baih did come, 
 An 'while he carried off a pig 
 
 De folks stood helpless, dumb. 
 When he had gone, dey thought of Sam 
 
 An' to his cabin run, 
 An' said, "hey Sam, we've seen a baih, 
 
 Go git yo' dog an' gun." 
 
 So Sam took down his rusty gun 
 
 An' called his flea-bit dog. 
 But Towsah was so old an' deef 
 
 He stood daih like a log. 
 Until he saw his mastah leave, 
 
 An' staht across de fiel's, 
 An' den he scratched, and shook hisself, 
 
 An' tagged on at his heels. 
 
 Dey walked about a mile aw mo'e, 
 
 Den Towsah "tucked his tail," 
 An' lookin' straight in front of him 
 
 Sam saw a bloody trail. 
 It led towahds a gully like, 
 
 Sam follered it in daih, 
 But 'fo'e he'd gone a dozen yards 
 
 He run up on dis baih. 
 
 Sam gib one yell, an' tuhned aroun' 
 
 An' thowed away his gun. 
 He kicked his boots from off his feet 
 
 An' den how he did run. 
 He run clean ovah Towsah, suh, 
 
 An lef him daih to die, 
 Den wid de track all cleah in front 
 
 It seemed dat he would fly. 
 
 He busted thoo de brushes like 
 
 A wild deer in its flight. 
 Den as de baih snapped at his heels 
 
 De cabin hove in sight. 
 His wife was at de window too, 
 
 Sam made his final drive, 
 Den said, "Hey open up de doo', 
 
 I'se brought him home alive." 
 
 BEHAVE YO'SELF. 
 
 Well son, I'll tell a story now, 
 
 Espec'ly jis faw you, 
 Since you went out to git de wood 
 
 An' missed de othah two. 
 Co'se dis un ain't so funny dough, 
 
 Don't s'pose you'll like it much ; 
 It's got a lesson dought faw boys 
 
 What carry's on in chu'ch. 
 
 Now p'raps you all will be su'prised, 
 May even crack a smile, 
 
 To t'ink yo' gran'pop was so bad; 
 Co'se I was jis a chile, 
 
 An' went to chu'ch one summah day, 
 
 De sun was shinin' strong, 
 But jis de same my mammy took 
 
 Huh bumbashoote along. 
 
 My daddy said, "Oh, leave it home, 
 
 'Taint gwine to rain a bit." 
 But mammy said "You nevah min' 
 
 I'll fin' some use faw it." 
 So as I say we went to chu'ch 
 
 In all dat br'ilin' sun, 
 It happened we was kindah late, 
 
 De meetin' had begun. 
 
 But we walked in an' took ouah seats, 
 
 An' heard de sermon froo. 
 De preachah he talked loud an' long, 
 
 As he would sometimes do. 
 An' I got tiahed sittin' daih, 
 
 An' kicked upon de seat, 
 But mamy said when chu'ch was out 
 
 "Dat sermon was a treat." 
 
 Dey had a aftah-meetin' den, 
 
 Mos' ev'ry one took paht, 
 An' tole how hahd it was to dodge 
 
 Ole Satan's fiery daht. 
 By dat time I was good an' mad, 
 
 An' noisy as could be. 
 "Behave yo'self," my mammy said, 
 
 An' kindah frowned at me. 
 
 Well faw a while I kep' right still 
 As each his 'sperience told ; 
 
 Den Deacon Johnson raised a hymn, 
 
 My how dat music rolled. 
 Ole Sistah Green got happy den, 
 
 As folks will do down Souf. 
 She went to fling huh han's an' smacked 
 
 De deacon in de mouf! 
 
 It was so sudden, don't you know, 
 
 He bellered like a calf. 
 I tried my bes' to hoi' it in, 
 
 But I jis had to laugh. 
 De folks in front all tu'ned aroun' 
 
 An' rolled daih eyes at me, 
 An' mammy grabbed me in de neck, 
 
 "You come out hyeah," said she. 
 
 "Excuse me mammy, dis one time," 
 
 I whimpahed an' I cried, 
 Because I saw dat she had brought 
 
 Huh bumbashoote outside. 
 But she undid my galluses, 
 
 An' helt me 'cross huh knee, 
 An' den she raised dat bumbashoote 
 
 An' brought it down on me. 
 
 She beat an' beat, an' den she stopped 
 
 And talked to me awhile, 
 She said dat if you spaih de rod 
 
 You's boun' to spile de chile. 
 De fiah dat shined in huh eyes 
 
 Was strong enough to dazzle. 
 An' when she stopped dat bumbashoote 
 
 Was wo'e down to a frazzle. 
 
 Faw full two weeks, suh, aftah dat, 
 
 If I sot down to eat, 
 Why fust I alius had to put 
 
 A pillow in de seat. 
 De lesson which dat lickin' taught 
 
 I tell you it was such 
 Dat nevah from dat day till dis 
 
 Has I cut up in chu'ch. 
 
 THE AFTERMATH. 
 
 It was summer, I walked through a garden, 
 The pathway was pleasant and wide, — 
 
 And the birds in the treetops were singing — 
 The roses grew thick on each side. 
 
 But I trampled them down in my hurry — 
 The fairest the sun shone upon — 
 
 Then I noticed the summer was waning, 
 And that most of the roses were gone. 
 
 Still I searched till at length I had found one 
 Which I grasped as a balm for my grief. 
 
 But alas ! I beheld when I plucked it 
 That my rose had a poor, withered leaf. 
 
 YOU HAVE ENCOURAGED ME. 
 To B. C. B. 
 
 Although I try I cannot tell 
 
 Just how you stand my verse so well. 
 
 Another would just look at it, 
 
 And tell me that I ought to quit. 
 
 But you typewrite it with content, 
 
 And to your thoughts do not give vent, 
 
 But often, when all hope is gone, 
 
 You smile and say "that's right, keep on. 
 
 Those words encourage me so well, 
 They seem to cast a magic spell, 
 Once more I try, and in short time, 
 I've rattled off another rhyme. 
 And when again we have a chat, 
 Then you exclaim "did you write that? 
 Why you're a marvel, I declare, 
 I tell you what, you're getting there!" 
 
 Then I, you know, can scarce believe, 
 That you're not trying to deceive 
 Or make me think I'm doing well, 
 Because you cannot bear to tell 
 The truth, and thus discourage me, 
 And so you speak like that you see. 
 However since it hits the spot 
 I'm apt to make it yet as not. 
 
 12S 
 
 And if some day I do succeed, 
 I shall repay your noble deed. 
 Nor shall I once regret the cost, 
 For deeds like those must not be lost; 
 It will be something worth your while. 
 Yes, that is true, you need not smile. 
 And what a pleasure it will be 
 To pay, for you've encouraged me. 
 
 FAREWELL. 
 
 Alas my love, that this should come ! 
 
 The time when we should part — 
 Though thou art like a bird set free, 
 
 Mine is a broken heart. 
 Though gay and happy once were we, 
 
 Each to the other all, 
 Now e'en the sweetest moments spent 
 
 Seem but as bitter gall. 
 Farewell to hope, to joy, to love, 
 
 To scenes I've known so well : 
 Farewell to friends, farewell to home, 
 
 And thou, my love, farewell! 
 
 This soul of mine which once rejoiced 
 
 Now seems so crushed and dead ; 
 And life for me no pleasure holds 
 
 Since thou from me hast fled; 
 But still my heart is true to thee, 
 
 And let no traitor say 
 That love which once I freely gave 
 
 I now would take away. 
 
 Farewell to hope, to joy, to love, 
 
 To scenes I've known so well. 
 Farewell to friends, farewell to home, 
 
 And thou, my love, farewell ! 
 
 Although thou hast forsaken me, 
 
 And caused my heart to pine, 
 What once I was, I still remain, 
 
 Now and forever thine. 
 And when to dust this body turns, 
 
 Down far beneath the sod, 
 My spirit still shall seek that path 
 
 On which thy feet have trod. 
 Farewell to hope, to joy, to love, 
 
 To scenes I've known so well — 
 Farewell to friends, farewell to home; 
 
 And thou my love, farewell ! 
 
 And still farewell, for I am weak, 
 
 And cannot say thee "no," 
 Nor seek to stay thee from the course 
 
 Which thou dost choose to go. 
 Farewell to fields and babbling brooks. 
 
 To bees and butterflies; 
 Farewell to song bird's sweetest note, 
 
 Farewell to summer skies. 
 Farewell to hope, to joy, to love, 
 
 To scenes I've known so well, 
 Farewell to thee, unfaithful love — 
 
 To life itself, farewell ! 
"And bless my paw somewhere in France." 
 
 SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH. 
 
 Oh, Lord, before we go to sleep, 
 
 Please bless my maw and me, 
 And bless my paw, "somewhere in France"- 
 
 Wherever that may be — 
 And God please bless our cotton crop, 
 
 Don't let the weevils come 
 And ruin it again this year, 
 
 Or we won't have no home. 
 
 Don't let Marse Thompson take our mules 
 
 To pay that grocery bill ; 
 Don't let him take our cow and calf, 
 
 Because we needs them still. 
 Please fix some way so that my maw 
 
 Won't have to work so hard 
 From Monday until Saturday, 
 
 With clothes out in our yard. 
 
 And God please help the officers 
 
 To treat us as they should, 
 And please do send my maw and me 
 
 Some coal or else some wood, 
 Because our fence rails are all gone — 
 
 We've got the last on now — 
 And it is awful cold outdoors, 
 
 So help us Lord somehow. 
 
 Don't let those men that came last week 
 
 And took my Uncle Jake, 
 Come back to-night for maw and me, 
 
 And burn us at the stake, 
 Because we've not done any harm, 
 
 We've not picked any fuss — 
 He hadn't either, he was sick, 
 
 And here at home with us. 
 
 And, oh, please bless Aunt Phoebe, Lord! 
 
 She's guilty of no crime — 
 Except to grieve for Uncle Jake, 
 
 And cry most all the time. 
 Don't let the gas bombs hurt my paw, 
 
 Shield him from shot and shell, 
 Protect him from the aeroplanes 
 
 And Zeppelins as well. 
 
 Bless all our soldiers at the front, 
 
 Both white, please Lord, and black, 
 Watch over them, both night and day, 
 
 And let them all come back. 
 And God please bless the President 
 
 With wisdom from above, 
 Smile down on him for Jesus' sake, 
 
 And fill his heart with love. 
 
 Help him to push "New Freedom's" cause — 
 
 Freedom for every one — 
 Give him a seat at Your right hand 
 
 When life on earth is done. 
 
 And lead my paw throughout this war, 
 
 And bring him home again, 
 And we will serve You all our lives, 
 
 For Jesus' sake, Amen ! 
 
 RIGHT MUST WIN. 
 
 Oh, tell me not that "right" is dead, 
 
 That "justice" is asleep, 
 That "Providence" doth not exist, 
 
 Nor God His vigil keep. 
 
 Too firm indeed is my belief 
 
 In "God's eternal plan" 
 To e'er believe he could forget 
 
 His promises to man. 
 
 Though "justice" seems perverted oft', 
 
 And "evil" conquers "good," 
 And while the rich their substance waste, 
 
 The "righteous" beg for food. 
 
 Though carnal "lust" despoils the "pure," 
 
 And leaves a crimson trail, 
 And "helpless souls" stretch out their hands, 
 
 And cry to no avail. 
 
 Though nations, strong, oppress the weak, 
 
 And wars are won by might, 
 Yet all of this, somewhere, somehow, 
 
 Must be dethroned by right. 
 
 THE LAUNDRY MAN. 
 
 One day a famous friend of mine — 
 
 A noble hearted Turk — 
 Suggested that I write a book 
 
 Of "helps on laundry work." 
 Now, if I ever were induced 
 
 My private views to tell, 
 I'd say, like Sherman said of war, 
 
 That laundry work is — well. 
 
 I think of all the jobs on earth, 
 
 The meanest one of all. 
 It leaves a mental after-taste, 
 
 Still bitterer than gall. 
 Of knocks and kicks and hateful looks 
 
 There never is a lack. 
 There's always some one standing round 
 
 To stab you in the back. 
 
 Some cottage mother says that she 
 
 Has missed a lot of clothes 
 And has a list a full yard long, 
 
 From pillow-slips to hose. 
 The office calls you every day, 
 
 To hunt up this or that, 
 For some one else has lost a dress, 
 
 A shirt, a cap, or hat. 
 
 And if you tell them "what is what" 
 
 They run around and jaw, 
 And tell the most infernal lies 
 
 Of clothes they never saw. 
 
 Ypu leave your work and off you go 
 
 And seek and search about, 
 And while you're gone the engine stops 
 
 Or else a fuse burns out. 
 
 The water you have left turned on 
 
 Has flooded all the floor, 
 Or else a steam pipe's leaky valve 
 
 Sounds like artillery's roar. 
 Perhaps the wringer has blown up, 
 
 The mangle lost a chain. 
 Or else a washer will not work — 
 
 The belt can't stand the strain. 
 
 You tear down to the engine room, 
 
 But get no further cheer 
 Than this, to hear some alien say, 
 
 "Dey hain't no hengineer." 
 The children do not want to work, 
 
 And drag their feet and frown, 
 Unless you grab them in the neck 
 
 And shake their dinner down. 
 
 The coal is bad and full of slate, 
 
 And won't burn like it should; 
 The women chop the wood-box up — 
 
 Nor ask for kindling wood. 
 In summer you are wringing wet, 
 
 From collar to your knees. 
 In winter time you step out doors 
 
 And in a moment freeze. 
 
 I'm going to tell the honest truth, 
 
 Although I am no shirk, 
 I'd rather spend my time in France 
 
 Than doing laundry work. 
 I'd rather join a bombing squad 
 
 Or ride a "British tank," 
 Than be just "everybody's slave" 
 
 And die a hopeless crank. 
 
 But still I know that those who strive 
 
 To live close to the Lord, 
 And do what's right, will soon or late 
 
 Receive their just reward. 
 Of those who enter Heaven's gates 
 
 And lead the caravan, 
 I know that one will surely be 
 
 The poor old laundry man. 
 
 GABRIEL'S MESSENGERS. 
 
 Daih's a whippoo'will a singin' 
 (Jndahneaf my window sill, 
 
 Towsah too, keeps howlin' jis outside de doo'. 
 Now when birds an' beasts acts dat way 
 When de mornin's calm an' still, 
 
 From dat cabin someone sho has gr>t to go. 
 
 Now I don't believe in sperrits, 
 Nor in supahstitious folks, 
 
 An' I'se jis as independent as kin be, 
 But I feel my time's 'bout up now, 
 'Case I'se lived a good long while, 
 
 An' I 'spec' dat Gab'iel soon will come faw

 'Liza Jane's done gone to Heaben 
 Put nigh on ten yeahs ago, 
 
 An' I can't jis see why I is lef hyeah still. 
 An' somehow I'se kindah longin'

 Down beneaf de elum tree, 
 
 Whaih de robins in its branches sadly sing. 
 An' de creepin' vines is growin' 
 An' a climbin' on de stones, 
 
 An' de grass is tall an' wavin' in de spring. 
 
 ON ACCOUNT. 
 
 You said I would reap what I planted, 
 
 You said I would pay for my fun, 
 I laughed as I said in my folly 
 
 "The things I have done, I have done." 
 Your words through the years have gone with 
 me, 
 
 I tried but I could not forget. 
 I have paid — a thousand times over 
 
 And still I am paying that debt. 
 
 THE BUFFALOES' PARADE. 
 
 'Twas a March day, warm and sunny, 
 
 In the year "nineteen-eighteen," 
 That a New York throng was treated 
 
 To this patriotic scene ; 
 When three thousand negro soldiers 
 
 All in battle togs arrayed, 
 Ere they left to help their Allies, 
 
 Were to hold a grand parade. 
 
 Came the cry at length "they're coming," 
 
 And it fell on eager ears, 
 For ten thousand gay spectators 
 
 Gave as many lusty cheers, 
 As they saw the manly fighters 
 
 Marching up Fifth Avenue 
 Past the Union League's great clubhouse 
 
 For the Governor's review. 
 
 Moved they with clock-work precision, 
 
 Steady step and fearless eye, 
 Heads erect, and faces forward, 
 
 Bound to "see it through" or die. 
 And their bayonets were bristling 
 
 And their teeth were clenched the while, 
 All except those fleeting moments 
 
 When some friend caused them to smile. 
 
 And the watchful, waiting thousands 
 
 Who were packed along the way- 
 Cried "Hurrah, Three-Sixty-Seventh," 
 
 And again "Hip, hip hurray." 
 Then the boys received the colors 
 
 From the Governor's own hands 
 And again they started marching 
 
 To the music of their bands. 
 
 Thus they moved on up to Harlem, 
 
 And their steady, martial tread 
 Filled each patriot with courage, 
 
 While each foe was filled with dread. 
 There were mothers who were crying, 
 
 But their tears were tears of joy, 
 Joy that each could help her country 
 
 With a noble-hearted boy. 
 
 No need, there, to search for traitors, 
 
 All who saw those negroes knew 
 That beneath each suit of khaki 
 
 Beat a heart both tried and true. 
 And they knew they would not falter 
 
 To uphold earth's righteous laws 
 And would face hell and the Kaiser, 
 
 To defend their country's cause. 
 
 Then the bands played "Suwanee River" — 
 
 It was syncopated, too — 
 And the crowds all grew light-hearted, 
 
 For you just could not stay blue. 
 Then they next cut loose on "Dixie," 
 
 And you ought have heard them play. 
 All the tears were quickly banished, 
 
 Driven were all cares away. 
 
 And the cheers rose higher, higher, 
 
 For the noble Buffaloes 
 Who had spent their time in gaining 
 
 Strength to overcome their foes, 
 And to keep Old Glory waving, 
 
 And to march on, undismayed, 
 Until they returned triumphant 
 
 From their European parade. 
 
 HOPE 
 
 O Hope! into my darkened life 
 
 Thou hast so oft' descended ; 
 My helpless head from failure's blows, 
 
 Thou also hast defended ; 
 When circumstances hard, and mean, 
 
 Which I could not control, 
 Did make me bow my head with shame, 
 
 Thou comforted my soul. 
 
 When stumbling blocks lay all around, 
 
 And when my steps did falter, 
 Then did thy sacred fires burn 
 
 Upon my soul's high altar. 
 Oft' was my very blackest night 
 
 Scarce darker than my day, 
 But thou dispelled those clouds of doubt, 
 
 And cheered my lonely way. 
 
 E'en when I saw my friends forsake, 
 
 And leave me for another, 
 Then thou, O Hope, didst cling to me 
 
 Still closer than a brother; 
 Thus with thee near I groped my way 
 
 Through that long, gloomy night 
 Till now; yes, as I speak, behold, 
 
 I see the light! the light! 
 
 DE DEACON'S MISTAKE 
 
 Now Hi'am Ephum Johnson was 
 
 A pusson ob renown, 
 A deacon in de Baptist Chu'ch, 
 
 De oldest in de town; 
 Respected by bofe white an' black, 
 
 Because ob kindly ways, 
 Which dough peculiar wah conceived 
 
 In dose dahk slav'ry days, 
 
 An' many tales de deacon tol\ 
 
 Which brought teahs to de eyes, 
 Ob dose who heahd an' filled dey heahts 
 
 Wid sorrow an' surprise. 
 He tole ob slav'ry, sin an' shame, 
 
 An' deed ob dankest hue, 
 He told dem ob One crucified, 
 
 Who died fo' me an' you. 
 
 An' sinnahs trimbled when dey saw 
 
 Him comin' down de street, 
 An' always doffed dey hats to him 
 
 Wheah evah dey might meet. 
 An' always, too, in meetin's daih 
 
 Wah many groans an' sighs, 
 As deacon prayed yo' thoughts arose 
 
 Frum ea'th to vaulted skies. 
 
 But yet, in spite ob all ob dis, 
 
 De deacon he would go 
 An' stay away faw half de night, 
 
 Whaih? no one seemed to know. 
 An' people den begun to talk, 
 
 An' sometimes laugh or smile; 
 But Deacon Johnson went to chu'ch 
 
 An' prayed on all de while. 
 
 De meetin' did not seem complete 
 
 If deacon was not daih ; 
 No one could raise de hymns like he, 
 
 Naw no one lead in praih. 
 But strange t'ings happen in dis life, 
 
 De dumb is made to talk, 
 An' sometimes dose lame fum dey youth 
 
 Take up dey beds an' walk. 
 
 So deacon, now by habit bent, 
 
 Strolled down de road one night, 
 An' some one seen him sneakin' in 
 
 When it was broad daylight. 
 'Twas Sunday, an' dough deacon knowed 
 
 Dat he was in de lu'ch 
 He put on his Prince Albert coat 
 
 An' went on off to chu'ch. 
 
 But dough he tried so very ha'd 
 
 His vigil still to keep, 
 His eyelids kep' a-drappin' 'till 
 
 Dey finely closed in sleep. 
 An' he would sort o' nod his head 
 
 An' slowly move his han's 
 Aroun' in semicircles like 
 
 So many little fans. 
 
 De preachuh finished up his talk 
 
 While he was sleepin' daih, 
 An' said, "If Bruddah Johnson's heah, 
 
 Will he please lead in praih?" 
 "Yes, daih he is !" some sistah said, 
 
 Expectin' him to lead ; 
 Dat fan'like motion still kep' on — 
 
 He was asleep, indeed. 
 
 An' when de preachah looked an' saw, 
 
 He said with thund'rous roah, 
 Dat rattled 'gainst de window-panes, 
 
 An' rolled on out de doah, 
 "Ouah bruddah seems to be asleep. 
 
 Some tonic he must need ! 
 Now, Bruddah Johnson, when you wake, 
 
 Will you please kindly lead?" 
 
 Dat dis was still de night befo', 
 
 Good Deacon Johnson felt. 
 An' he said, "No, suh, lead yo'-self, 
 
 You know dat I jis dealt!" 
 Well, folks, I tell you now dat chu'ch 
 
 Was nigh tu'ned upside-down, 
 An' when 'twas foun' dat he played cards, 
 
 De Deacon lef de town. 
 
 A lesson, too, he lef behin' 
 
 Faw folks who seemed to doubt, 
 Dat it is true, de sins you do, 
 
 Will sometimes fin' you out. 
 An' sayin' high-faultin' praihs 
 
 Don't help a single bit, 
 When in yo' heaht you's nothin' but 
 
 A low-down hyppocrite. 
 
 A RACE FOR LIFE 
 
 Far in the wilds of Canada, 
 
 Deep in the timber belt, 
 Where giant hemlocks skyward rose 
 
 A logger's family dwelt. 
 And in the spring the logs were cut, 
 
 And seasoned for the mill; 
 In summer all his time it took 
 
 His plot of ground to till. 
 
 In autumn there was harvesting, 
 
 And other work to do, 
 Supplies to get, and firewood, 
 
 To last the winter through. 
 And when at length by snow and ice 
 
 The forest kings were crowned 
 And nature slept all clothed in white, 
 
 Still work enough was found. 
 
 For then the logger plied his trade, 
 
 And made a trip each day, 
 And to the siding took his logs 
 
 Some fifteen miles away. 
 Returning thus one afternoon, 
 
 He struck the lonely road 
 Which lay between his home and him 
 When he had sold his load. 
 
 "Get up, my beauties," then said he — 
 
 His horses forward sprang, 
 And clear upon the frosty air 
 
 The many sleigh bells rang. 
 The woods lay dark and still and bare, 
 
 And from the trees around, 
 No echo broke upon his ears 
 
 Except the sleighbells' sound. 
 
 He still drove on his prancing steeds, 
 
 For anxious then was he 
 To reach his home before the night, 
 
 And wife and children see. 
 Then of a sudden came a sound 
 
 That fills strong hearts with fear, 
 The horses, too, that sound have heard, 
 
 With fright they plunge and rear. 
 
 And closer now there comes again 
 
 A long blood curdling wail, 
 It was a wolf, the driver knew, 
 
 His face turned deathly pale. 
 And soon that sound was multiplied 
 
 As others joined the chase ; 
 Then as the driver snapped his whip 
 
 A race for life took place. 
 
 The horses shook their flowing manes, 
 
 Their heads were outward tost, 
 Their hoof beats rained upon the snow, 
 
 Then on the air were lost. 
 Could he but reach the clearing first, 
 
 There in its friendly space, 
 The driver knew a chance he stood 
 
 That howling pack to face. 
 
 And so he drove his frantic steeds 
 
 And called them out by name, 
 Up, Dandy ! Lil' ! Hi Jack, you scamp ! 
 
 And on the pack still came. 
 Then mingled with the howl of wolves, 
 
 The silver sleigh bells rang, 
 Far out in air the driver's whip 
 
 Above the horses sang. 
 
 The wolves, half starving, see their meal 
 
 About to slip away, 
 They snapping, snarling as they come, 
 
 Strive to surround their prey. 
 The driver rises to his feet, 
 
 The reins he clutches tight ; 
 And lifts the horses in their stride 
 
 And drives with all his might. 
 
 Gone is his cap and torn by wolves, 
 
 His hair tost by the wind, 
 The comfort tied about his neck 
 
 Is streaming out behind. 
 His veins stand out like gnarled vines 
 
 Around some rugged tree, 
 And from their sockets stand his eyes; 
 
 Yet ever on drives he. 
 
 And still drives on those foaming steeds, 
 
 And slackens not his pace; 
 But only prays that they may last 
 
 To win that awful race. 
 The horses' breath comes thick and hot; 
 
 They quiver, too, with fright ; 
 Then as their pace begins to fail, 
 
 The clearing comes in sight. 
 
 And now he quickly reins them in, 
 
 And brings them standing there ; 
 Quick to his shoulder flies his gun, 
 
 A shot rings on the air. 
 And quick in answer to that shot 
 
 One hungry wolf was gone, 
 And as he fell by all the pack 
 
 Was he then pounced upon. 
 
 To crimson soon was turned the snow, 
 
 And dead wolves strewed the place 
 Where lately had the driver stood 
 
 With grim death face to face. 
 And ere that gun had ceased to crack. 
 
 The last gaunt brute was gone; 
 The driver gathered up his reins 
 
 And once more he drove on. 
 
 HYMN TO PHILADELPHIA 
 
 Though you may travel many miles, 
 
 And go from coast to coast, 
 Of all the cities you will see, 
 
 There's one you'll love the most; 
 It is in Pennsylvania, 
 
 Upon the Delaware, 
 And all the nations of the earth 
 
 Are represented there. 
 
 'Twas William Penn who laid its plans 
 
 In years long past and gone. 
 Now though he sleeps beneath the sod 
 
 That city still lives on. 
 Her name is Philadelphia, 
 
 Tribute to her we bring, 
 And all who walk upon her streets 
 
 With joy her praises sing. 
 
 And hospitality for all 
 
 Doth in her heart exist, 
 Which is akin to "mother love," 
 
 That you cannot resist. 
 When once you've tasted of her joys, 
 
 No matter where you roam, 
 You always will remember her, 
 
 And think of her as "home." 
 
 O, blessed Philadelphia, 
 
 Thy name we love to hear ; 
 Within thy boundaries it seems 
 
 To heaven we are near ! 
 Thy river's peaceful waters flow 
 
 Out to the deep blue sea, 
 And mighty ships upon it ride 
 
 In perfect safety. 
 
 Thou art a city which can boast 
 
 Of great commercial wealth, 
 While latitude and longitude 
 
 Make thee abound in health. 
 We love thy parks and museums, 
 
 Thy schools and churches grand, 
 Thy literature, and works of art, 
 
 The finest in the land. 
 
 Here liberty was first proclaimed, 
 
 Upon "that July morn," 
 And in good Betsy Rosses house 
 
 Old Glory, too, was born. 
 Then fling thy standard to the sky, 
 
 And let it proudly wave ; 
 And let all nations know thy worth, 
 
 Thou city of the brave !

 MY COUSIN FROM BOSTON 
 
 Now, we live in a "country town," 
 
 As folks are wont to say ; 
 I had a pretty cousin, though, 
 
 Who lived up Boston way. 
 And invitations oft' to her 
 
 By wife and me were sent ; 
 We wanted her to visit us, 
 
 And would not be content, 
 But wrote and wrote to Boston. 
 
 A message we at last received, 
 
 And read it with a smile, 
 My cousin said 'twould please her much 
 
 To visit us a while. 
 So to the station then next day 
 
 We had the chauffeur drive, 
 And meet the train on which she was 
 
 Expected to arrive — 
 "The limited from Boston." 
 
 But he came back and said her wrath 
 
 Upon him she had poured, 
 And said that she had rather walk 
 
 Than ride up in a "Ford." 
 And then my wife to meet her ran, 
 
 And kissed her on the face. 
 'Twas not returned ; my cousin said 
 
 Folks thought it out of place 
 To kiss at all in Boston. 
 
 But still we overlooked her faults — 
 
 That was, my wife and I — 
 We said that all would come out right, 
 
 In some sweet bye and bye. 
 So many days she spent with us, 
 
 But worse and worse she grew ; 
 And she would grumble and complain, 
 
 No matter what we'd do — 
 'Twas different in Boston. 
 
 On Sundays if we went to church 
 
 And heard a sermon grand, 
 Why she would say the preacher was 
 
 The poorest in the land. 
 On weekdays if we saw a game 
 
 At our baseball park, 
 She said the grandstand looked as old 
 
 As Uncle Noah's ark — 
 They had it beat in Boston. 
 
 Or if we went to see a show 
 
 At our playhouse new, 
 She said " 'twas small and second class, 
 
 The show was rotten, too." 
 
 "The Tremont and the Hollis Street 
 
 Have got that skinned a mile." 
 Yes, that's the very way she talked, 
 
 And never cracked a smile — 
 My cousin up from Boston. 
 
 A letter wife one day picked up, 
 
 And womanlike, you know, 
 She had to read it through and through 
 
 Before she'd let it go. 
 My cousin's mother it was from, 
 
 It had arrived that day; 
 She mentioned several other things, 
 
 And then went on to say 
 That things were dull in Boston. 
 
 She also said "I'm mighty glad 
 You struck those country folks, 
 
 I thought that I would nearly die 
 
 A laughing at your jokes." 
 
 Still we resolved to hold our peace 
 And play the game on through 
 
 And not let on that we were wise, 
 And see what she would do — 
 
 This cousin up from Boston. 
 
 We took her out to dinner then, 
 
 At our best cafe, 
 I noticed that she ate right well, 
 
 Nor did she long delay, 
 The dinners cost two dollars each, 
 
 But as we neared the door, 
 She cast a backward glance and said, 
 
 "That service sure was poor, 
 
 We've got it beat in Boston." 
 
 And then she laughed about the friends 
 
 Whom we met on the street, 
 We never passed a single one 
 
 That Boston could not beat. 
 And when at last we reached that place, 
 
 Which wife and I called "home," 
 She said, as round the cosy room 
 
 Her chilly gaze did roam, 
 "I wish I was in Boston." 
 
 That was too much my cup was full 
 
 And slopping o'er the brim, 
 My jaw got set and on my face, 
 
 There came a look most grim, 
 I said, "You'd better go there then, 
 
 My work is all in vain. 
 You are the worst I've ever seen, 
 
 You've got more gall than brain, 
 Yes go on back to Boston!" 
 
 My cousin then broke down and cried, 
 
 To change she made a vow ; 
 She kept it too, then fell in love, 
 
 And she is married now, 
 They have the cutest little flat 
 
 Not many squares away; 
 She and her husband visit us 
 
 Most every other day, 
 Nor does she mention "Boston." 
Fido 'spected somepin mus' be wrong'. 
 
 FIDO 
 
 Yes, dat's Fido what you see daih, 
 
 Co'se he's gittin' ole an' slow; 
 
 An' his bes' days all is ovah now, I feah. 
 
 But I'll tell you why we keeps him, 
 
 Faw I s'pose you'd like to know, 
 
 Hit's a story, too, I'd like faw you to heah. 
 
 He was little when we got him, 
 
 But he had a heap o' sense, 
 
 Dough daih wa'nt no pedigree 'tached to his 
 
 name. 
 He was pahtly houn' an' bull dog 
 An' a little shepe'd, too, 
 But dat dog he made you love him jis de same. 
 
 He was young an' fat an' playful, 
 
 Wid a nice clean coat o' haih, 
 
 An' his limbs was jis as graceful as could be; 
 
 An' his eyes was bright an' sparklin' 
 
 An' his hearin' it was keen, 
 
 Better dog dan him you wouldn't want to see. 
 
 An' de reason why we keeps him 
 
 An' we give him sich good keer 
 
 Is because dat many, many yeahs ago, 
 
 When we chillen all was little 
 
 An' ouah daddy was away, 
 
 Dat a tramp come up to ouah house you know. 
 
 !>->» 
 
 He axed mammy, "Whaih yo' husband'?' 
 
 Mammy said he was away 
 
 Den at once dat tramp he stahted gittin' bad ; 
 
 Said dat he mus' hab some money 
 
 An' he stahted lookin' roun' 
 
 An' I s'pose he'd took de las' cent dat we had. 
 
 j 
 
 But somehow it seems dat Fido 
 
 'Spected somepin mus' be wrong 
 
 An' at once he come a dashin' thoo de doo' 
 
 An' my mammy was so skaid, suh, 
 
 Dat she couldn't say a word — 
 
 She jis stood daih sick an' tremblin' in de floo'. 
 
 Den ole Fido's back got bristled 
 
 An' his eyes tunned almos' green 
 
 An' he also had a look upon his face 
 
 Dat said he was daih faw business 
 
 An' dey'd be somebody bit; 
 
 So de tramp decided den to leave de place. 
 
 And he started out a runnin', 
 
 Wid ole Fido at his heels, 
 
 An' dey looked jis like two racers on a track 
 
 Bruthah Bub was yellin' sick 'im, 
 
 Jis' as loud as he could yell, 
 
 An' ole Fido took him roun' de house an' back. 
 
 Man, dat tramp was runnin' puhty — 
 
 Coat tail stood out on de win' — 
 
 I can't tell you how he looked an' I'm not 
 
 try'n— 
 Den I saw him tuhnin' sideways 
 And I wondah'd what 'twas faw, 
 It was only so as he could keep from fly'n'I 
 
 Fido gib him one good bite, dough, 
 
 As de tramp went troo de gate, 
 
 An dat dog he was excited as could be. 
 
 Den he looked up in ouah faces 
 
 An' his tail was waggin' so 
 
 Jis as if to say, "Now ain't you proud o' me?" 
 
 Bruthah Bub den hugged an' kissed him 
 
 An' my mammy hugged 'em bofe, 
 
 'Cause daih really wasn't nothin' else to do. 
 
 An' when daddy come at night, suh, 
 
 An' foun' out what he had did, 
 
 Why he called ole Fido in an' hugged him too. 
 
 Now aldough he's ole an' feeble 
 An' his teef is falling' out, 
 An' his haih is gittin' straggly like an' thin, 
 An' He can't see like he use' to 
 An' his hearin' ain't so fine, 
 Still we keeps him faw de good dat he has 
 been. 
 
 THE TRIALS OF AN ENTERTAINER 
 
 Well, daih ain't no use in talkin', 
 
 Daih's some folks dat jis won't do; 
 Dey ain't got a bit mo'e mannahs 
 
 Dan a chile ob one, aw two. 
 In de chu'ch, aw hall, aw pahlah, 
 
 Makes no diffe'nce whaih you go, 
 You will meet dat kind ob people 
 
 Dat is boun' to make you so'e. 
 
 Dey won't come till ten o'clock, suh, 
 
 So de concert can begin. 
 Even aftah you git stahted 
 
 Some will come a walkin' in, 
 Soundin' like a pack o' hosses, 
 
 Jist a stompin' on de floo'. 
 An' dey'll walk right straight up front, suh, 
 
 So daih finery dey can show. 
 
 Den dey'll stan' daih jis faw meanness; 
 
 Staht to squabblin' 'bout a seat; 
 Now if dat ain't aggravating 
 
 Well, I hope I may be beat. 
 Den you'll see some gall an' feller 
 
 Sittin' on de fust front row 
 Dat will alius be a tryin' 
 
 Faw to show how much dey know. 
 
 An' dey'll talk all thoo de singin', 
 
 Dey don't want to hyeah daih-self — 
 An' dey'll keep up sich a racket 
 
 Dat daih can't nobody else. 
 If dey know de piece you's speakin' 
 
 Dey recite it long wid you, 
 But daih ain't no use in kickin', 
 
 Cause some people jis won't do.

 And to have you 'round the place. For it does not seem like  
 home, dear, without you. You were always kind and true, You were 
 bright and happy, too, And my aching heart is longing just for you. 
 
 JUST FOR YOU. 
 
 Just before the close of day, 
 As I put my work away, 
 
 And the western sky takes on a rosy hue, 
 Then I long to see your face ; 
 And to have you round the place ; 
 
 For it does not seem like home, dear, with- 
 out you. 
 
 Chorus. 
 
 You were always kind and true, 
 
 You were bright and happy, too, 
 
 And my aching heart is longing just for you. 
 
 Now the weeds grow rank and tall 
 All around the garden wall, 
 
 For no flowers there have bloomed since you 
 have gone. 
 And the place seems dull and drear, 
 Since no longer you are here, 
 
 And the grass is dry and withered on the 
 lawn. 
 
 Now the same friends seldom call, 
 And they do not seem at all 
 
 Like they used to be before you went away. 
 And your chair is vacant still, 
 That's a place which none can fill, 
 
 Since the angels took you from me that sad 
 day. 
 
 THAT QUARTET FROM 
 DOWNINGTOWN 
 
 Hyeah! you fellers stop dat yellin', 
 
 Wakin' people from daih sleep, 
 An' a bangin' dat pianner, 
 
 Singin' "Mary don't you weep." 
 You's as good as lots ob quartets 
 
 Dat you sees a goin' roun'; 
 But you jis can't hoi' a can'le 
 
 Faw dem boys from Downin'town ! 
 
 Dis hyeah aint no place to practice, 
 
 An' to 'speriment on folks; 
 I declaih to goodness gracious 
 
 You is jus' a lot ob jokes. 
 Why daihs no pianner made, suh, 
 
 Dat can make as sweet a soun' 
 As dat rich an' nachul music 
 
 Ob dem boys from Downin'town. 
 
 Go on off down in de cellah 
 
 If you want to learn to sing 
 So you ha'monize togethah 
 
 Till you hyeah de music ring. 
 Man you feel yo' wings a sproutin' 
 
 An' you can't stay on de groun' 
 When you hyeah some raal good singahs 
 
 Like dem boys from Downin'town. 
 
 Johnny daih, his voice is shaky, 
 
 Waltah, his is kindah rough, 
 Henry, his is sharp an' squeaky, 
 
 Matthew his aint low enough. 
 Den when singin' 'bout ole Pharoh 
 
 Be right glad to see him drown, 
 Like you would if you was singin' 
 
 Wid dem boys from Downin'town ! 
 
 If you's singing' 'bout yo' sorrer 
 
 Git dat grin from off yo' face; 
 I declaih sich awful actin' 
 
 Sholy is a big disgrace. 
 Why you bows yo' head wid pity, 
 
 An' de teahs come tricklin down, 
 When you hyeah dat quartet singin' 
 
 Massah's in de col', col' groun'! 
 
 Stop dat tuggin' an' a strainin,' 
 
 Soun' jis like a dyin' calf; 
 Dough I'se tryin* not to do it 
 
 Dat ah singin' makes me laugh. 
 Stop dat talkin' at yo' practice, 
 
 Lay dat pleggone banjo down, 
 Else you'll nevah learn to sing, suh, 
 
 Like dem boys from Downin'town ! 
 
 MEMORIES OF DIXIE 
 
 By my fireside I'm sitting, 
 
 And I ponder all alone ; 
 
 And I watch the flick'ring shadows moving 
 
 round. 
 While the bleak wind howls and whistles 
 Just outside my northern home, 
 And it piles the snow in drifts upon the ground. 
 
 In my mind there are awakened, 
 
 Memories that long have slept, 
 
 But, alas! they only fill my heart with pain, 
 
 For I long once more to linger 
 
 In the place where I was born, 
 
 And to live in dear old Dixieland again. 
 
 And I long to see the river 
 And to stroll along its brink 
 While its depths reflect the moonlight's golden 
 
 glow. 
 And for Dixie's balmy climate 
 All my soul doth long tonight, 
 Where the roses and the orange blossoms 
 
 grow. 
 
 On the old bench with my sweetheart 
 I would love to sit again. 
 
 And to kiss her as I hold her soft warm hand. 
 Then to listen as she asks me, 
 With a smile upon her face, 
 "Dear, now tell me, aren't you proud of Dixie- 
 land?" 
 
 Give me back those happy moments 
 
 That I spent when by her side, 
 
 And to that dear humble cabin let me go. 
 
 By the moonlight let me court her, 
 
 As I did in days gone by, 
 
 As I sang and played upon my old banjo. 
 
 Then no matter what the future 
 
 In her arms for me might hold, 
 
 I would gladly give, and would not count it 
 
 vain, 
 If but only for the ev'ning 
 I could see her lovely face, 
 And could live in dear old Dixieland again. 
 
 But, alas ! fate wills it different, 
 
 And my wishes count for naught, 
 
 Although many earthly joys have come to me, 
 
 She is gone whom once I cherished 
 
 On this earth the very most, 
 
 And her loving smile again I shall not see. 
 
 Nor again when it is ev'ning, 
 
 And the sun is sinking low, 
 
 By her gentle, trusting side shall I e'er stand. 
 
 She has gone to where the flowers 
 
 In their beauty bloom for aye, 
 
 For she sleeps beneath the soil of Dixieland. 
Poemi by Theodore Henry Shackelford 
 
 TO BOOKER T. WASHINGTON 
 
 And thou, O Washington, art dead ! 
 
 Thou who hast done so much 
 To free thy people from the taint 
 
 Of ignorance's touch. 
 A message too of hope thou brought 
 
 To those whose way seemed drear; 
 Thou didst revive their fainting souls, 
 
 And fill their hearts with cheer. 
 
 Though born amidst most trying times, 
 
 Thou upward kept thine eyes ; 
 And strove to help those farthest down, 
 
 And lead them to the prize. 
 Discouraged oft' by word of foe, 
 
 And e'en by word of friend ; 
 Thou still kept on, nor stopped to rest 
 
 Till thou achieved thine end. 
 
 A school thou founded in the south, 
 
 Where worthy youth might come 
 And be prepared both for this life 
 
 And their eternal home. 
 Nor were thy noble efforts lost, 
 
 Nor sacrifices vain, 
 In lifting them thou placed thyself 
 
 Upon a higher plane. 
 
 A source of inspiration thou, 
 
 To many souls hast been; 
 For thee will mourn all those who dwelt 
 
 Tuskeegee's walls within. 
 Nor is Tuskeegee all alone 
 
 In grieving o'er thy loss, 
 For countless multitudes shall grieve 
 
 For whom thou bore the cross. 
 
 And never did they see thee once 
 
 Stop to be-moan thy fate ; 
 But thou dids't strive to right the wrong 
 
 By toiling soon and late. 
 Thou gave thy life for love of man, 
 
 Enduring grief and pain; 
 And now we know that our loss 
 
 Is thy unceasing gain. 
 
 And did I say that thou was't dead ? 
 
 I mean, thou art at rest; 
 Thou dwellest in that happy land 
 
 Prepared just for the blest. 
 As long as Tuskeegee shall stand 
 
 Her noble place to fill, 
 As long as men shall praise her name, 
 
 Shalt thou be living still.

 As I do when I am sittin', 
 
 In dat little room ob mine. 
 
 I don't want no grand pianner, 
 
 I don't want no gramerphone, 
 When Ise got a good ole banjo, 
 
 An' it's all my very own. 
 I can play it in de evenin', 
 
 When de moon begins to shine, 
 An' dey'll be no one to stop me, 
 
 In dat little room ob mine. 
 
 An' I keeps de daily papers 
 
 An' some books upon a shelf; 
 On de wall Ise got some pichters, 
 
 An' I painted 'em myself.

 An' yo' colleges so fine ;

 In dat little room ob mine.

 'Cause when I gits to dat room, suh, 
 
 All my troubles is fawgot.

 You can figgah dat Ise headin',

 An' daih's comfort all aroun'. 
 An' I know de Ian' ob glory 
 
 Sholy mus' be somepin fine. 
 If it's fixed up any bettah 
 
 Dan dat little room ob mine. 
 
 WHY IS IT? 
 
 At times in life such funny things I see, 
 Or rather they are mysteries to me ; 
 And seeking for an answer as I go, 
 I strive, in vain, to learn why this is so. 
 
 When man pours forth his noblest thoughts, 
 
 men list', 
 And grudgingly they grant that he exist; 
 But when buffoonery to them he doth give, 
 Then they applaud, demanding that he live. 
And they flock around her feet. 
 
 WHEN MARIA CALLS THE CHICKENS 
 
 When the busy day is done, 
 And the slowly sinking sun 
 
 Fades from view out in the rosy tinted west, 
 Then a gentle voice I hear, 
 As it calls out sweet and clear, 
 
 Ere the humble village folk have gone to 
 rest: 
 Here chickie, chickie, chickie, chick! 
 When Maria calls the chickens home to roost. 
 
 Then from far across the hill, 
 They come running with a will, 
 
 For they love to hear that pleasant welcome 
 sound. 
 And I love to hear it too, 
 So, dear friend, I know would you, 
 
 Should the honor fall to you to be around. 
 Here chickie, chickie, chickie, chick! 
 When Maria calls the chickens home to roost. 
 
 And they flock around her feet, 
 In their eager haste to eat, 
 
 For Maria has her apron full of grain 
 And she throws it far and near 
 And they seem to have no fear, 
 
 As her young and cheerful voice rings out 
 again, 
 Here chickie, chickie, chickie, chick ! 
 When Maria calls the chickens home to roost. 
 
 And they peck and hunt around, 
 Until ev'ry grain is found, 
 
 One by one they go to roost then for the 
 night, 
 As the darkness settles down, 
 O'er the quiet sleepy town ; 
 
 And I faintly hear her in the fading light ; 
 Here chickie, chickie, chickie, chick! 
 When Maria calls the chickens home to roost. 
 
 START TODAY 
 
 Would that you could see the fortune, 
 
 That is lying at your door; 
 Would that I could make you grasp it, 
 
 But you, heedless, pass it o'er; 
 And that fortune is "the present," 
 
 And how fast it flies away! 
 For 'tis made of golden minutes 
 
 Oh, how priceless is "today!" 
 
 Those who dwell amid vain pleasures, 
 Wasting minutes, days and years ; 
 
 Drifting backward in life's struggle, 
 
 Find tomorrow filled with tears. 
 
 Those who reap the greatest blessings, 
 Those who conquer in the fray; 
 
 And who reach the goal tomorrow, 
 Are the ones who start today. 
 
 Cease to waste these precious minutes 
 
 In frivolities and strife, 
 Lest you multiply your sorrow 
 
 In the autumn of your life ; 
 
 Start today and face the problem, 
 Wait not 'till tomorrow comes, 
 
 Lest you find you've missed the banquet 
 And have nothing left but crumbs. 
 
 He who on the wharf lies sleeping, 
 
 "Waiting 'till his ship comes in," 
 Often finds when he awakens 
 
 That it has already been; 
 Oh, the world would know no paupers, 
 
 Prisons then could not exist, 
 If the crime, of wasting minutes, 
 
 Men and women would resist! 
 
 Could you realize the danger 
 
 Which accompanies the shirk, 
 You would cease procrastinating, 
 
 And would now start in to work 
 At the task which lies before you; 
 
 And no longer would you say, 
 "I'll do thus and so tomorrow," 
 
 You instead would start today.

 SONNET. 
 
 O, God, to Thee I come to-day, 
 
 And with true repentance kneeling. 
 The while I bend my knee to pray, 
 
 The tears from mine eyes are stealing. 
 But for Thy grace lost would I be, 
 
 Or ship-wrecked on life's hidden shoals, 
 Or left to drift upon that sea 
 
 Where dwelleth all earth's derelict souls. 
 But Thou didst free from all alarms 
 
 And shield me from the tempter's power; 
 Thou broke the shackles from my arms 
 
 And Thou didst cheer my darkest hour. 
 Thou hast supplied my every need, 
 
 And made me free, and free indeed. 
 
 ON THE CAFE CAR 
 
 When you're tired of the city, 
 
 And you want to get a job, 
 That will thrill your tired body 
 
 Till your heart will fairly throb ; 
 Where the linen all is spotless, 
 
 And the silver clean and bright, 
 And where flowers deck the table, 
 
 And there's gas to make it light — 
 Get a cafe car. 
 
 Then a fellow feels like working, 
 
 If he gets a decent run; 
 And you meet all kinds of people, 
 
 And it sure is lots of fun. 
 And there's something most poetic, 
 
 When at last the meal is through, 
 And you sit beside the window, 
 
 Having nothing else to do; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 And there's music in the car wheels, 
 
 As they hum along the rails, 
 There is also rhyme and rhythm, 
 
 As their song your ear assails. 
 And you gaze with rapt attention, 
 
 As the rocks and trees rush by, 
 Or you look across the prairies, 
 
 Till they seem to meet the sky; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 Now you crawl out on a trestle, 
 Kinder cautious like and slow; 
 
 There is only air about you, 
 And a tiny stream below. 
Poema by Theodore Henry Shackelford 
 
 Then you plunge into a tunnel, 
 Where it gets as dark as night; 
 
 And it happens all so sudden 
 You forget to make a light; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 Now you wind along a river, 
 
 Or a canyon deep and wide ; 
 Now you see some snow-capped mountain, 
 
 Now into the station glide. 
 Then you go out on a special, 
 
 And you stay a week or two, 
 And you see some "sure nuff cowboys," 
 
 And "some real red Injuns," too; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 Coming back your car will "dead-head," 
 
 For perhaps a quite a space ; 
 And you rear back in the parlor, 
 
 Just as if you owned the place. 
 Then there comes a great big picnic, 
 
 Or perhaps a holiday, 
 And out from the crowded city, 
 
 Lots of folks will go away ; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 Soon the dining room is crowded, 
 
 Just as tight as it can be, 
 And you try to keep your bearings, 
 
 But you soon go up a tree; 
 Some old maid says, "please, some butter,* 
 
 Some old bach. "I want a drink," 
 Five or six call, "Waiter, waiter" ; 
 
 And no longer can you think, 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 Then you see some farmer trav'ling 
 
 For the first time in his life; 
 He will order something fancy, 
 
 And will eat it with his knife. 
 Then the passengers around him 
 
 On the floor will almost roll, 
 As they see him drink the water 
 
 Poured out in the finger bowl; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 Then you get four in a party, 
 
 Just about the last of all ; 
 The mother she is short and fat, 
 
 And the husband lank and tall, 
 The kids are strange and gawky-like, 
 
 And are still more strangely dressed; 
 The mother all the questions asks; 
 
 And she orders for the rest ; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 "Say, is that the Frazer- River? 
 
 And the Frazer Mountain, too? 
 We are nearly starving, waiter; 
 
 Won't you rush our order through? 
 You can bring me in, please, waiter, 
 
 Just one big, brown Sally Lunn. 
 Let me see now, for my daughter. 
 
 Almost any kind of bun"; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 "You can bring my little man, here, 
 Just one good crisp piece of toast; 
 
 And a lamb chop for my husband. 
 Dear, oh, dear, it seems I'll roast" ; 
 
 And the kids they sniggle, giggle, 
 And they squirm and twist around. 
 
 And the old man acts right hen-pecked, 
 And he jumps at every sound; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 "Bring us one small pot of coffee, 
 
 And some water in a pot, 
 And four cups to serve it in, please; 
 
 And be sure the water's hot. 
 I guess that's about all, thank you. 
 
 Now, please, waiter, don't be long, 
 All of us are nearly starving, 
 
 Have the coffee good and strong" ; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 You go out and get the order, 
 
 And you come back on the run; 
 For you know that she will tip you, 
 
 When your duty you have done. 
 But when they have finished eating 
 
 To your feelings you give vent, 
 You have served some twenty people, 
 
 But you haven't made a cent; 
 On the cafe car. 
 
 TO DR. WILLIAM A. CREDITT 
 
 I have no old acquaintance, 
 
 Nor any have I known, 
 Whose trials have been greater, 
 
 My dear friend, than thine own ; 
 Yet no more Christlike spirit 
 
 Would I dare ask to see; 
 A source of inspiration 
 
 Thy life has been to me. 
 
 Though tempted and discouraged, 
 
 Let not all hope be gone. 
 This is the darkest hour, 
 
 Which just precedes the dawn. 
 That school for which thou livest 
 
 Shall yet go marching forth. 
 And men shall love and hail it 
 
 "Tuskeegee of the North." 
 
 No mark of His displeasure 
 
 Doth trials always show, 
 Those whom God blessed most largely 
 
 Did oft' most troubles know. 
 
 For Job lost all his cattle, 
 
 And all his earthly store 
 And then with boils was covered 
 
 Till he grew sick and sore? 
 
 But God, when Job still trusted, 
 
 His every effort blest. 
 He multiplied his riches 
 
 And gave him peace and rest. 
 
 So be thou not discouraged, 
 
 Though burdened down with care ; 
 Thou still hast friends around thee 
 
 Who will thy trials share. 
 
 That heart that feels most anguish 
 
 Most sympathy can show; 
 And he can give most comfort 
 
 Who doth most sorrow know. 
 Good men through all the ages 
 
 For right have bled and died ; 
 The Savior's life was perfect, 
 
 Yet he was crucified ! 
 
 Thou canst not win earth's praises 
 
 Except thou stand its scorns; 
 Nor canst thou gather roses 
 
 And not be pricked by thorns. 
 The master of musicians 
 
 Ne'er plays his sweetest strain 
 Till grief and disappointment 
 
 Have rent his soul in twain. 
 
 The flowers bloom most lovely 
 
 When thunders loudly roll. 
 The poet sings his sweetest 
 
 When sorrows fill his soul. 
 The storm out on the ocean 
 
 Doth make us love the calm; 
 The heart most often wounded 
 
 Doth know the sweetest balm. 
 
 THY CALLING 
 
 If thou shouldst have a mission in this life, 
 A something which thou feelest thou must 
 do, 
 Be not too quick to tell the world thy plan, 
 But first make sure thy cause be just and 
 true. 
 And when by careful study, too, and prayer 
 Thou hast convinced thyself that thou art 
 right, 
 Then never let that vision fade from view, 
 But to attain it strive with all thy might. 
 
 And should a doubting horde deride and frown, 
 Or at thy failure clap their hands with glee, 
 Straight up and to the front hold thou thy 
 head, 
 And close thine ears, nor use thine eyes to 
 see. 
 But ii some loving friend thy praise should 
 sing, 
 Let not thy heart be overfilled with pride ; 
 But bow thy head with meekness and with 
 fear, 
 Lest some faint trace of vanity abide. 
 
 For when the heart of man becometh vain, 
 
 Disaster soon doth follow in his wake ; 
 But meekness is a rock that sinketh deep, 
 
 Which all the hosts of Satan cannot shake. 
 To thine appointed calling then be true, 
 
 And on the star of hope hold fast thine eyes, 
 And know that thou canst conquer if thou wilt, 
 
 Then shalt thou almost surely gain the prize. 
 
 y 
 But shouldst by some sad chance thou fail, 
 
 And fall sore wounded in life's constant fray, 
 Cringe not, as would a cur beneath the lash, 
 
 Nor to the foeman's blackest threat give 
 way! 
 But dare to let him see, though all be o'er, 
 
 That still thy soul doth cling to what is 
 right ! 
 Then may thou close thine eyes and rest in 
 
 peace. 
 I* or truly thou hast won a noble fight. 
 
 DOWN WITH THE DIVER 
 
 Come where the waves on the ocean toss high ; 
 Come where the deep waters silently lie ; 
 Come where the strange looking animals creep, 
 Down with the diver, down in the deep. 
 
 Over the side of the vessel he goes, 
 
 Meeting with dangers which none but he 
 
 knows; 
 Down by some coral reef, jagged and steep, 
 Down with the diver, down in the deep. 
 
 Down where the sea-monsters, slimy and 
 
 fierce, 
 Struggle, his helmet and air-line to pierce ; 
 Where glowing eyes from the dark caverns 
 
 peep, 
 Down with the diver, down in the deep. 
 
 Down where the shark and the devil fish play ; 
 Down where the hulks of the derelict ships 
 
 stay ; 
 Down where the mermaids all gather to weep, 
 Down with the diver, down in the deep. 
 
 Down where the coffers of rich treasures lie, 
 Where pirates sank them in ages gone by; 
 Where weary spirits their long watches keep, 
 Down with the diver, down in the deep. 
 
 Where mystic shadows spread on the sea 
 
 floor, 
 Down in some place which he knew not before ; 
 Down where the sailors of past ages sleep, 
 Down with the diver, down in the deep. 
 
 WON'T YOU PLEASE COME BACK 
 AGAIN? 
 
 When the sun sinks low at the gay seashore, 
 
 And the children quit their play, 
 And they leave the beach, and their forts of 
 sand, 
 
 Then until another day. 
 And the crowds grow thick on the great board- 
 walk, 
 
 And a stream of chairs roll by. 
 And the piers are white in a blaze of light, 
 
 And the ev'ning breezes sigh. 
 
 Though the lovers sit until late at night, 
 
 And they spoon upon the sands; 
 And the breezes waft to their listening ears 
 
 The sweet music of the bands, 
 And the moonbeams dance with their silvery 
 feet, 
 
 There upon the rippling sea. 
 And, though all the world seems so bright and 
 gay, 
 
 There is still no joy for me. 
 
 Then my thoughts to you, like the rolling 
 chairs, 
 
 In a constant stream do flow. 
 And I live once more in those happy days, 
 
 Which now seem so long ago; 
 And my soul cries out for the sight of you, 
 
 And my heart is filled with pain, 
 And I long to hold you within my arms; 
 
 Won't you please come back again? 
 
 A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM 
 
 It was on a Sunday ev'ning 
 
 As he paused before the door 
 Of the church upon the corner, 
 
 Just a drunkard, ragged, poor. 
 Now he hears the call to service, 
 
 As the chimes the sexton rings; 
 And a welcome invitation 
 
 Unto all their music brings. 
 
 Now the crowds go in to worship, 
 
 And they see him standing there. 
 While some pass him by unnoticed, 
 
 Others for him breathe a prayer : 
 Now there comes a solemn youngster, 
 
 With a step so staid and slow. 
 First he pauses near the other, 
 
 Then walks up and whispers low: 
 
 "Mister, please, are you a Christian?" 
 
 And the drunkard's bleary eyes 
 For a moment flash with anger, 
 
 Then the look turns to surprise, 
 Still no word has he yet uttered, 
 
 For his heart is filled with woe ; 
 But the child waits for an answer. 
 
 So he sadly answers, "No." 
 
 Now the sexton ceases pulling, 
 
 And the bells no longer ring; 
 But the choir has arisen, 
 
 And it sweetly starts to sing. 
 "Must I go, and empty-handed, 
 
 Must I meet my Savior so? 
 Not one soul with which to greet him, 
 
 Must I empty-handed go?" 
 
 And the man becomes convicted ; 
 
 In his soul is waged a fight 
 As two spirits strive for power; 
 
 One is wrong, the other right. 
 Said the child, "I'd be so happy 
 
 Could I win one soul today; 
 Mister, please, oh, don't refuse me, 
 
 Won't you come inside and pray?" 
 
 As the drunkard hears him pleading 
 
 Back to childhood runs his mind; 
 When around a loving mother 
 
 His young arms were once entwined. 
 Now he sees her, old and feeble, 
 
 Waiting for him day by day; 
 While he breaks her heart by sinning 
 
 And by wand'ring far away. 
 
 Now the congregation rises, 
 
 Ev'ry person present sings 
 And the youngster joins in with them; 
 
 Sweet and clear his young voice rings, 
 "Not at death I shrink or falter, 
 
 For my Savior saves me now ; 
 But to meet him empty-handed 
 
 Thought of that now clouds my brow." 
 
 And that stony heart is broken, 
 
 And the man cannot refuse, 
 So he lets the youngster lead him, 
 
 And decides the good to choose. 
 And they slowly walk together 
 
 Down the center of the aisle. 
 Through the church there runs a whisper, 
 
 Here and there appears a smile. 
 
 Said the preacher, hand uplifted, 
 
 "I have just a word to say. 
 Would that we had more young Christians, 
 
 Let us bow our heads and pray." 
 And the drunkard came to Jesus, 
 
 And forsook his ways so wild : 
 Rescued from the downward journey 
 
 By the pleading of a child. 
 
 SINCE BUB'S GONE AWAY 
 
 Ev'ry one is sad an' weary, 
 
 Days don't seem so wahm an' bright, 
 Pains my heart to look at mammy 
 
 By de empty crib at night. 
 
 Faw my little bruthah's lef us, 
 Gone up in de skies to dwell, 
 
 Life faw me ain't wuth de livin' 
 Hu'ts me mo'e dan words can tell. 
 
 Neighbo's boys don't come so often, 
 When dey do dey don't stay long, 
 
 Mammy nevah sings no mo'e now, 
 Hasn't got de heaht faw song. 
 
 Since my little bruthah's lef us 
 
 Fido, he don't romp an' play, 
 Lays beside Bub's little wagon, 
 
 Head between his paws all day. 
 
 Wasn't dat a awful pity? 
 
 Only bruthah dat I had, 
 An' since he has gone to heaven 
 
 Pap an' mammy bofe is sad. 
 
 Chickens, too, is dull an' sleepy, 
 
 Got so dey don't even lay. 
 Bub ain't hyeah you know to feed 'em 
 
 Half a dozen times a day. 
 
 An' since he has gone an' lef us

 'Cause I has to do my own work 
 
 An' besides do his'n too. 
 
 But I spose 'twill soon be ovah, 
 Mammy says dat life ain't long, 
 
 Some day we will go to meet him, 
 See him wid de angel th'ong. 
 
 'Wish dat it would be tomorrow,

 Ev'ry t'ing dat's good why Bub gits, 
 
 Nuthin' evah comes to me. 
 
 Hyeah Ise got to worsh de dishes

 While Bub sits up daih in Heaven 
 
 Eatin' honey all day long. 
An' you see dat tu'key gobblah. 
 
 WHEN DADDY HOL'S YO' HAN'

 Dat is almos' 'fraid to talk; 
 An' so small an' weak an' timid 
 
 Dat you jis can baihly walk, 
 Daih is boun' to come a time, when you 
 
 Will feel you is a man, 
 An' it's when you's wid yo' daddy 
 
 An' he hoi's you by de han'.

 An' it seems so strange an' culiah, 
 
 Dat you jis can't undahstan'

 When yo' daddy hoi's yo' han' ! 
 
 You can go down in de cellah

 Fin' yo' way in all de conahs 
 
 An' come out wid out a hitch. 
 Bring de taters up faw suppah

 When de days am wahm an' sunny;

 But as soon as you has passed him 
 
 Den you slows down to a walk 
 An' you looks back at de tu'key, 
 
 An' like dis you stahts to talk. 
 "I could chase a thousan' gobblahs 
 
 An' could run 'em off de Ian' 
 If my daddy jis was wid me

 MY MOTHER 
 
 What friend on earth do I love best, 
 Whose light shines far above the rest, 
 And who my whole long life has blest? 
 My mother. 
 
 Who, when I was a little lad 
 And played some prank or acted bad 
 Would whip me though it made her sad? 
 My mother. 
 
 Who told me of the golden rule, 
 And then to see I should not fool 
 Would lead me off to Sunday school? 
 My mother. 
 
 While at her knee I bowed my head 
 Who listened while my prayers I said, 
 And then would tuck me safe in bed? 
 My mother. 
 
 Who when she thought I was asleep 
 Back to my cot would gently creep, 
 And pray the Lord her boy to keep? 
 My mother. 
 
 Who in those grim, dark days of yore, 
 Oft' toiled 'till heart and hands grew sore, 
 The wolf to keep back from the door? 
 My mother. 
 
 And often in some troubled place 
 
 Who, — while the tears streamed down her 
 
 face, — 
 With prayers besieged a throne of grace? 
 My mother. 
 
 ♦ 
 
 Who shields me now from every woe, 
 And still seems near where e'er I go, 
 And makes me try and walk just so? 
 My mother. 
 
 PO' GRAN'PAP 
 
 De possums got so bad one fall 
 
 Dey 'stroyed mos' all de co'n ; 
 
 An' possum hunts was reglar den, 
 
 From sunset until dawn. 
 
 An' gran'pap used to axe my paw 
 
 To let him go along; 
 
 But paw, an' Uncle John, an' Pete 
 
 All said he wasn't strong. 
 
 Dey said he better stay at home 
 
 An' talk to Bub an' me; 
 
 Now Bub was Gran'pap's favorite, 
 
 So he sot on his knee. 
 
 An' one night Bub he begged my paw 
 
 To please let gran'pap go 
 
 An' cried so hahd dat paw and 'em 
 
 Jus' couldn't tell him no. 
 
 An' so dey tuhned de houn's all loose, 
 
 An' shouldered up daih load, 
 
 Dey took a gun, a axe, an' saw, 
 
 An' went on down de road. 
 
 'Bout five miles out de dogs commenced 
 
 A bayin' in de brush, 
 
 An' to a great big holler log 
 
 Dey come up wid a rush. 
 
 An' paw, an' Uncle John, an' Pete 
 
 Said "Dats a possum sho ; 
 
 I guess we'll hab to smoke him out, 
 
 Dats all de way I know." 
 
 Dey gathered leaves, an' sticks, an' stuff 
 
 An' filled dat log wid smoke, 
 
 Den held a bag across de hole 
 
 An' all laughed at de joke. 
 
 When dey had waited quite a while 
 But still no possum come 
 Gran'pap said " 'Less he hurries up 
 I'll be a goin' home." 
 Jus' den dat tree got full ob noise, 
 Ob growls, an' screeches loud, 
 A wil' cat busted thoo dat bag 
 An' out into de crowd ! 
 
 Well paw, an' Uncle John, an' Pete 
 
 Fawgot about de gun ; 
 
 Dey saw de houn's was leavin' too, 
 
 So dey commenced to run. 
 
 De way dey run dat night, paw said, 
 
 It sholy was a sin ; 
 
 Dat wil' cat stood no show wid dem 
 
 Dey nachly split de win'. 
 
 Dey come a tearin' down de road 
 
 An' thoo de cabin do'; 
 
 An' Uncle Pete was almos' gone 
 
 He fell out on de flo'. 
 
 An' ev'ry one was skaihd to death 
 
 An' wondered what to do, 
 
 Till mammy brought huh camphor oil, 
 
 An' dat soon brought him to. 
 
 Jus' den my paw he looked aroun' 
 
 His eyes was wide wid fright, 
 
 He said "I wish we'd staid at home 
 
 An' not went out tonight. 
 
 Because po' gran'pap, Oh, my Lawd, 
 
 We lef him daih alone ! 
 
 Suppose dat wil' cat eats him up?" 
 
 Den all commenced to groan. 
 
 An' Uncle John said "Le's go back 
 
 An' hunt him right away," 
 
 But Uncle Pete sot up an' said, 
 
 "We better wait till day." 
 
 An' den my bruthah Bub stepped out, 
 
 His face was filled wid frowns, 
 
 He said "Why gran'pap's fas' asleep, 
 
 He come in wid de houn's."

 DAT OLE-TIME RELIGION 
 
 My! ev'ry t'ing seems new and strange 
 
 In dis heah mode'n day, 
 An' all de ole-time lan'ma'ks, too, 
 
 Has done and passed away ; 
 De meetin' house upon de hill, 
 
 Whaih mammy use' to go, 
 Has been to'e down an' in its place 
 
 A new one built, you know. 
 
 But us old folks what's livin' now, 
 
 To res' will all be laid ; 
 An' some one else ouah places fill 
 
 Befo'e de debt is paid. 
 Dey's got a big pipe-o'gan daih, 
 
 An' ca'pets on de floo' ; 
 An' cushions is on ev'ry seat 
 
 From pulpit to de doo'. 
 
 Yes, I must say, it was a shame 
 
 Dat ole chu'ch to destroy; 
 My mammy took me daih wid huh 
 
 When I was jis a boy. 
 Aldough, besides de leaky roof, 
 
 De floo' was kind o' rough ; 
 As long as it was free from debt 
 
 I t'ink 'twas good enaugh. 
 
 An' we had such good meetin's daih ; 
 
 Dey was jis plain an' straight, 
 But, seein' all de good dey done, 
 
 I t'ink dat dey was great ; 
 De preachah he would often say 
 
 A kindly word faw some, 
 An' othahs wa'n, wid haste to flee 
 
 From dat fierce wrath to come. 
 
 An' how I loved to hcah him pray, 
 
 Faw nothin' he would miss; 
 When he had ev'ry blessin' sought 
 
 He'd end up 'bout like dis: 
 "Oh, Lawd, do please stan' by us as 
 
 We draw dis fleeting breath, 
 An' 'ceive ouah blood-bought spirits when 
 
 Ouah eyes have closed in death." 
 
 De congregation den would staht 
 
 To sing dis good old hymn, 
 Dat seemed to reach de th'one ob God, 
 
 As all would sing wid vim: 
 "Mus' Jesus beah de cross alone, 
 
 An' all the worl' go free? 
 No, daih's a cross faw ev'ry one, 
 
 An' daihs a cross faw me!" 
 
 An' as dey sung, dat melody 
 
 Into my heaht would sink; 
 An' O de sweetness which my 
 
 From dis las' verse would drink: 
 "O glorious cross, O precious Crown, 
 
 O ressurecshun day, 
 De angels from de stars come down 
 
 An' beah my soul away." 
 
 Daih wa'nt no big pipe-o'gans den, 
 
 Daih wa'nt no fashions new, 
 Daih wa'nt no ca'pets on de floo', 
 
 Naw cushions in de pew. 
 But what was mo'e de grace ob God 
 
 Was in de heahts ob men, 
 An' people went to chu'ch an' prayed 
 
 An' got religion den. 
 
 But t'ings has changed in dat new chu'ch ; 
 
 It seems so strange an' col'. 
 An' no one seems to worry when 
 
 A lamb strays from de fol\ 
 I likes dese mode'n chu'ches dough, 
 
 Faw styles I loves to see; 
 But dat ole-time religion still 
 
 Is good enough faw me. 
 
 WHEN GRANNY'S PEELIN* APPLES 
 
 Gee, I'm glad that it is winter, 
 
 'Cause I know I'll have some fun 
 Coastin' on the hill with brother, 
 
 When our home work all is done. 
 We can also visit granny 
 
 Almost every Saturday, 
 And if we are good she'll let us 
 
 In the garret go, and play. 
 
 An' I love to visit granny, 
 
 'Cause she always acts so nice, 
 
 An' when you are eatin' dinner 
 She will always help you twice ; 
 
 Always makes you eat a-plenty, 
 
 Says, "You must or you won't grow." 
 
 Now I wonder why that grannies, 
 
 More than mothers seem to know. 
 
 Granny's got a great big cat, too, 
 
 And I guess he stands that high ; 
 But there's something strange about him, 
 
 'Cause he won't eat apple pie. 
 Then she's got the cutest pie pans — 
 
 Ain't no bigger 'round than this ; 
 An' she always fills them "special," 
 
 Ev'ry day that we don't miss. 
 
 When the cellar door she opens, 
 
 Granny down the steps will go, 
 And they kinder creak beneath her, 
 
 As she treads them sure and slow. 
 Though she tells us that we needn't, 
 
 Right behind her we will run; 
 For we know she's after apples, 
 
 And there soon will be some fun. 
 
 'Cause when granny's peelin' apples 
 
 She can use such funny terms; 
 Says, "you mustn't eat the peelin's 
 
 Or you'll be contractin' germs." 
 But I like to get a peelin' 
 
 That is striped with red an' brown, 
 An' its fun to hold it up, so 
 
 Then just kinder eat it down. 
 
 An' when granny's peelin' apples, 
 
 If we act right good an' nice, 
 She will take a nice, big ripe one 
 
 An' will cut us off a slice. 
 An' when granny's peelin' apples 
 
 There's a twinkle in her eyes 
 As she says, "Go play, you youngsters, 
 
 Or you'll get no apple pies." 
 
 IN SLAVERY DAYS 
 
 'Cindy deah, I jes was settin' hyeah a thinkin' 
 
 Dat Ise had a many blessin' in my life, 
 But de greatest is dat I is still a livin' 
 
 Faw to be hyeah at de side of my deah wife. 
 If you look back at de dangers we has come 
 thoo, 
 It's a myst'ry dat we's bofe alive tonight; 
 We has come thoo thick an' thin, you know, 
 togethah, 
 An' at times de way was ev'ryting but 
 bright. 
 
 Co'se we had de bes' ole mastah in de South 
 Ian', 
 
 An' ole mistis she was nice as she could be, 
 An' daih wa'n't a t'ing upon dat whole planta- 
 tion 
 
 Dat dey'd hesitate to trust wid you an' me. 
 But de mastahs wasn't all as kind as ouah's, 
 
 An' wid pity ouah hearts did often bleed 
 At de cruel way de othah slaves was treated : 
 
 Yes, it was a awful, awful shame indeed. 
 
 If one happened not to pick enough ob cotton 
 Dey would beat him 'till de blood run down 
 his back. 
 
 If he tried to run away ferocious bloodhoun's, 
 Also men wid guns was put upon his track! 
 
 An' sometimes he would be caught an' to'e to 
 pieces, 
 Aftah he had run 'till he was out o' breath! 
 Aw else in de dismal swamp would loose his 
 bearin's, 
 An' would wandah roun' 'till he had stahved 
 to death. 
 
 Often husban's from daih wives was separated ; 
 An' young chillen taken from daih mothah's 
 ahms, 
 To be sol' way off in some fah distant county, 
 Whaih dey couldn't no mo'e see each othah's 
 cha'ms ! 
 Den you know the Southe'n States become re- 
 bellious, 
 T'ings seemed jis as hopeless den as dey 
 could be, 
 Faw de slaves was often fo'ced to help daih 
 mastahs 
 Fight against de side dat aimed to set 'em 
 free. 
 
 Yes, dem days was mighty dahk an' mighty 
 bittah, 
 An' de briny teahs ouah cheeks did often 
 burn; 
 But bofe night an' day we sought de Lawd's 
 assistance 
 An' at las' dat "Lane ob Misery" retched its 
 turn. 
 Faw Mas' Lincoln wouldn't tolerate no foolin' 
 An' he tole dem se'eded States like dis, said 
 he— 
 "Now if you all don't come back into dis Union, 
 I is jist a gwine to set de slaves all free." 
 
 But dey said dey didn't 'tend to jine de Union, 
 So de Union stahted draftin' slaves you 
 know, 
 Co'se I didn't like to leave ouah good ole 
 massa ; 
 But Mas' Lincoln called an' I jis had to go. 
 An' dey gimme dat same flag daih in de conah, 
 An' we started out an' ma'ched de whole 
 night long, 
 Den ouah comp'ny jined wid Ginral Sherman's 
 ahmy, 
 An' we plunged into de battle wid a song. 
 
 Well, faw weeks an' mont's we fought dem 
 Rebel soljahs 
 'Till along 'tween sixty-five an' sixty-three, 
 It was at de cou't house daih at Appomattox, 
 
 Ouah ahmy met wid dat ob Gin'ral Lee. 
 Well, we marched 'till we was jis dat close up 
 to 'em 
 So dat we could almos' look 'em in de eye, 
 Den ob cou'se ouah Gin'ral yelled faw us to 
 fiah, 
 An' we raised ouah guns an' let de bullets 
 fly. 
 
 An' de shells was jis a bustin' all about us, 
 Wid de dead an' dying layin' all aroun', 
 An' de colahs dey was almos' shot to pieces! 
 But dat flag o' mine aint nevah teched de 
 groun' ! 
 Aftah dat you know ole Gin'ral Lee sur- 
 rendered, 
 Faw daih wa'nt no use to fight no longah 
 den; 
 
 'Cause his soljahs dey was killed off by de 
 thousan' 
 An' he knowed dat he would soon run out ob 
 men. 
 
 So he took his hat off to de Union ahmy, 
 
 An' tole Gin'ral Grant his was de victory, 
 Den Mas' Lincoln he done jis as he had prom- 
 ised; 
 He jis broke de ban's an' set de slaves all 
 free. 
 I remember, den, at las' as we was leavin', 
 Aftah we had knowed no othah home faw 
 yeahs, 
 How ole Massa let us hab de mule an' wagon, 
 An' ole mistis eyes, you know, was full of 
 teahs. 
 
 An' she said, "now, Sam, you take good keer of 
 'Cindy, 
 An' remembah she's de bes' frien' you has 
 got, 
 May de Lawd bless bofe ob you an' all de 
 younguns," 
 An' dem words dey sho has helped a mighty 
 lot. 
 Den we reached an' settled hyeah in Pennsyl- 
 vania, 
 An' ouah younguns kep' on growin' big an' 
 strong, 
 We was lonesome dough for Liza, Jim, an' 
 Susan, 
 An' we use' to send 'em lettahs right along. 
 
 An' de nex' yeah Massa Lincoln called bofe 
 ahmies 
 
 Into Washin'ton an' held de great review, 
 Cose I ma'ched an' you went daih to see me, 
 
 An' I tink we took de younguns wid us, too. 
 Aftah dat you know daih come to us a lettah, 
 
 An' de contents of de missive Viny read, 
 Den she said, "Why, pop an' mammy, I is 
 sorry, 
 
 But ole massa an' ole mistis bofe is dead." 
 
 Den you know we bofe sot daih an' cried to- 
 gethah, 
 An' we pitied all ob dem lef on de place, 
 'Cause we knowed 'twould be so very sad an' 
 lonesome, 
 Thout ole massa's an' ole mistis' kindly face. 
 An' we nevah got no lettahs aftah dat one, 
 So I s'pose de res' has also passed away, 
 An yo' day an mine will soon be comin' Cindy, 
 We aint got much longah hyeah on ea'th to 
 stay. 
 
 An' den when at las' life's battle's fought an 
 ended 
 An' de vict'ry has been won on IsreTs side, 
 An' de soljahs ob de Lawd shall ma'ch up 
 yondah, 
 Whaih no wah, naw sin, naw death can den 
 betide. 
 An' de Gin'ral ob de ea'th reviews his ahmy, 
 
 What a hallelujah time it den will be! 
 An' we'll see ole mas' an' mis', an' Massa 
 Lincoln, 
 Yes, indeed, I know we'll hab a jubilee. 
 
 DADDY'S FAT BABY. 
 
 Who's dat you's peekin' at,

 Who said dat you could play 
 
 Dat concertina?

 THE UNFAITHFUL. 
 
 The dream that I cherished is shattered. 
 
 The sunshine has fled from the sky 
 The ideals I once held are scattered, 
 
 I think of my fate with a sigh. 
 
 For you, whom I love, have deceived me : 
 To each spoken vow proved untrue; 
 
 But I am not sighing for vengeance, 
 I'll heap no ill wishes on you. 
 
 I leave you the way that I found you, 
 No better, but thank God, no wors* v 
 
 Go back to the one who denied you, 
 That his, and not mine be the curse. 
 
 MIGRATION SONG. 
 
 Goodness Liza, stop dat whinin', 
 Like as if dat you was pinin' 
 Case dat comp'ny I is jinin'

 Jis because I'll soon be leavin' 
 I don't want to see you grievin', 
 Folks 'ill t'ink dat I'm deceivin' 
 You my love. 
 
 Yes I know yo' heaht am achin'

 But I promise to remembah 
 Same in June as in Decembah, 
 An' we'll mahy in Septembah. 
 Good-bye "Lize."

 RASTUS AND THE TURTLE. 
 
 Daih was a man who lived down souf, 
 
 His name was Rastus Snow; 
 An' on long jou'neys by his-self 
 
 Dis Rastus he would go. 
 As to de rivah one hot day 
 
 He went to take a swim 
 A tu'tle on a log he saw 
 
 A-smilin' right at him. 
 
 He swum out daih to whaih it was, 
 
 Den grabbed it by de tail, 
 An' faw his cabin back in town 
 
 Den Rastus hit de trail. 
 To ev'ry one dat he would meet 
 
 He eithah smiled aw bowed; 
 An' tol' 'em whaih he got it at ; 
 
 I tell you he was proud! 
 
 Now 'Zekel Smif, who as you'll see, 
 
 Was nachly bad from choice, 
 Had took a co'espondence cou'se, 
 
 An' learned to th'ow his voice. 
 An' he was death on tu'tle soup ; 
 
 Mos' anyt'ing he'd do 
 To git a big one faw his pot, 
 
 He sho could cook 'em, too. 
 
 When he saw Rastus wid de one 
 He had jis caught dat day, 
 
 A scheme he hatched out in his min' 
 To git it right away. 
 
 He said, "Say, boys, le's hab some fun 
 
 When Rastus comes along, 
 I'll th'ow my voice an' make him t'ink 
 
 Dat turtle's done gone wrong." 
 
 "An' if he puts it on de groun' 
 
 An' leaves it daih you see 
 He mus' not want it very bad, 
 
 Den it belongs to me." 
 Well, Rastus come a'steppin' up, 
 
 Quite biggety you know. 
 Den dat ole tu'tle up an' said 
 
 "Please, mistah, let me go?" 
 
 Well, Rastus stopped an' looked at him, 
 
 De pictur ob su'prise; 
 An' sho as fate why daih was teahs 
 
 In bofe de tu'tle's eyes. 
 "Oh, Mistah Rastus," den it said, 
 
 "Why can't you hyeah my plea, 
 Oh, don't cook me an' eat me up! 
 
 Please, mistah, set me free." 
 
 But Rastus still hel' on to him, 
 
 De crowd commenced to yell ; 
 An' ev'ry time dat he would move, 
 
 Why 'Zeke would move as well. 
 An' den it said, "Why dats a sin 
 
 To live on tu'tle meat; 
 I know you'll git de stummick ache 
 
 'Cause I aint fit to eat!" 
 
 Den Rastus said, "I guess you aint, 
 
 I 'gree wid you on dat, 
 An' all Ise gwine to do wid you 
 
 Is drap you whaih you's at!" 
 
 An' Rastus let him go "ker-plunk," 
 
 An' hurried on his way, 
 An' 'Zekel Smif, so I am told, 
 
 Had tu'tle soup nex' day. 
 
 RING OUT YE BELLS. 
 
 Ring out ye bells with joyful sound, 
 And spread the tidings all around 
 That men may know a King is crowned 
 For Jesus reigns to-day. 
 
 No more the tomb His form doth hold; 
 He doth not lie there still and cold. 
 By angels, back the stone was relied, 
 And He came forth to-day. 
 
 Ring out, with loud triumphant ring. 
 Ring out, and let all nations sing 
 Hosannas to the Risen King 
 Who rules the earth to-day. 
 
 His precious life for man He gave; 
 He died, the world from sin to save. 
 Now He has conquered death and grave, 
 Let all rejoice to-day. 
 
 Ring out yet bells with merry chime ; 
 Ring out ye bells with joy sublime! 
 Ring out, for this is Easter time, 
 Ring out, Ring out to-day.

 DE REASON WHY I SMILE 
 
 You ax me why I alius smile, 
 
 An' look so gay an' bright; 
 While othah folks gits blue an' glum 
 
 When t'ings don't go jis right; 
 An' how I keeps my tempah sweet 
 
 An' even all de while; 
 So I is gwine to try my bes' 
 
 To tell you why I smile. 
 
 Why even when Ise burdened down 
 
 Until Ise 'bout to drop, 
 An' when life's wheels gits clogged wid rust, 
 
 An' tries daih bes' to stop; 
 An' troubles jis comes thick an' fas' 
 
 An' heaps up in a pile; 
 If you say "watah-millon" den, 
 
 Why I can't help but smile. 
 
 Some times I gits home tiahed out, 
 
 An' hongry as can be; 
 But not a single t'ing to eat 
 
 Is waitin' daih f aw me ; 
 An' den my tempah gits so hot 
 
 It seems about to bile, 
 Den 'Liza brings a millon out 
 
 An' I can't help but smile. 
 
 Some times a nickel I ain't got, 
 
 Can't even buy a match. 
 I longs to drown my sorrows den 
 
 In some one's millon patch. 
 An' so I walks on down de road, 
 
 An' in a little while, 
 Daih's millons all aroun' my feet, 
 
 Den I can't help but smile. 
 
 I thumps an' hefts 'em, too, you know, 
 
 Dem millions sho is fine; 
 I takes de bigges' one aroun' 
 
 An' stahts back down de line. 
 A bulldog den gits aftah me 
 
 An' chases me a mile ; 
 But I has kep' dat millon still, 
 
 So I can't help but smile. 
 
 I reaches home direc'ly den, 
 
 An' bustes it in two, 
 An' it is juicy, ripe, an' red, 
 
 An' sweet as sugah, too ; 
 Den I jis nachly shows my teef, 
 
 An' smile, an' smile, an' smile, 
 When I eats watah-millon, man, 
 
 I jis can't help but smile.

INTRODUCTION.
This book was written by an ex-soldier who served several months in the camp, after our country was forced into the great world's war. The  rmy poems, a soldier can readily see were, written from actual observation, gleaned from time to time in the every day walks of military life. Many of us will ever remember the days spent in the army, while others of us will let the many little things said and done there pass as only a dream. The object of this camp-life poetry is to make the days spent in the camps for this great government of ours an everlasting relic of memory. You will find also in this little publication other poems aimed at the high patriotism of the colored people which they have shown in other wars of the country, especially so though in this its last conflict, where the Negro's patriotism was shown clearer than ever before in the entire history of his existence in America.
They were compelled along with others to lay aside the luxuries and necessities of life to help win the war from the imposing nations on the other side. This they did unhesitatingly and willingly. In the Liberty Loan drives there were found no slackers among us. They rallied to the Red Cross work tirelessly, and in the War Savings Stamp campaign they readily helped to put it over successfully. While those in civilian life rallied to the many auxiliaries of the war, their many sons, brothers, husbands and kindreds rallied joyously to the colors and followed the deadly paths of war to a decided victory.
The object of making a showing for the black man in poetry is because poetry and music go hand in hand. Music is always welcome to come into our weary hearts and bring us cheer. The army poetry changes the frown of yesterday to a smile of today, and also instills in the soldier the fact that the army was a place of many laughable events.
Boys keep the same old army count as you walk again thru the streets of civilian life and wind your way to a point prominent so that the people who suffered and did so much for you can see and rejoice over the effects of your good works. Boys keep in touch with the old regulations, don't lose that sanitary training as you leave the service. All these little things are inclined to make you better men both mentally and physically. Be a soldier just the same, although you have your honorable discharges from the service. Deport yourselves manly and stand firm for the right and freedom.
This war has given the black man a chance, it has opened the door to American privileges and rights that have so long been barred—but  without manly deportment and legal contentions this great war in which we sacrificed tịme, money and lives will mean nothing. I say boys, step off, pick np the step, step off from those things that have in the past stood on every progressive corner to retard our progress and márch valiantly on to 'those good places in life, that now awaït you.
We have now made an impression on every nation that inbabits the globe as fighters. The Spaniard's found that we were not the trifle that they, no doubt, heard we were, but the kind of soldier instead that would gladly give their lives for their country. The Germans had us estimated as inferior specimens of American soldiers, but before that bloody conflict was over they offered attractive shrines for capture of just one of us. They often asked, “Who are those fellows and where are, their land of nativity?” I want to cheer you who, thru the power of God, came thru unharmed and mourn over the unfortunate who fell fighting for our rights as American citizens. Allow me to insist upon you to glide along the road of success. Let us make as progressive a run as we have in the past fifty years.
Truly yours,
WALTER E. SEWARD,
Author.

SOLDIERS CAMP POEMS
A Soldier's Dream
Last night I was a sleeping
   On my little army bunk,
And I went right off to dreaming
   Of that old civilian junk.
I dreamed that I was leaving here
   And going to my home,
Again across the meadows
   And the cotton fields to roam.
I went into a dancing hall,
   And there was spread a feast;
I thought I wore a swell dress suit
   That had a dandy crease.
And all the girls were lively,
   And were pulling over me,
Just like I was a major
   There invited out to tea.
Give me just a little time
   To sit down here and rest,
And with my line of army stuff
   I'll entertain the guest.
Then they started with the music,
And 'twas sounding sweet, you see;
I'woke, and 'twas the bugler,
Just a blowing “revillee”.
My Orders Are
Take charge of this post
   Is what I am to do,
And all the government property
   That lies within my view.
To walk this post in a military manner,
   And soldierly appearing,
Observing everything that takes place
   Within my sight or hearing.
Report all violations of orders
   I'm instructed to enforce,
Regardless who 'tis violates
   While I'm walking on my post.
To repeat all calls more distant
   From the guard house than my own;
If I am 7 and 6 calls out,
   I leave that call alone.
If you are kinder sick and worried,
   No matter how you're grieved,
You quit your post only
   When you're properly relieved.
Receive, obey and pass on,
   To the sentinel who relieves me,
All orders from my official guard;
   This I'll do, believe me.
For fear someone will get too close,
   And rob me of my booty;
That's why I talk to no one,
   Except in line of duty.
In case of fire or disorder,
   Or anything that's harm,
The 8" gen'l order tells you,
   Be sure and give alarm.
Allow no one to commit a nuisance---
   A hostess or a host;
Especially if this nuisance
   Is on or near my post.
In any case not covered by instructions,
   It may seem kinder hard;
But this thing you have got to do,
   Call the Corporal of the Guard.
Salute all officers and colors
   That you meet face to face;
Also salute the standards,
   And these three are not cased.
Be specially watchful at night
   And let nobody by;
And during the time of challenge,
   Challenge all that do come nigh,
And not to let any one go by
   Without authority to pass;
And this I guess is all the twelve,
   And also is the last.
When You were a Sargeant
Say Joe, do you remember,
In that dear old soldiers' camp,
When everything was damp,
You yelled, double time, you scamp!?
You were the sargeant, and you knew
I had to then get out;
But my time is coming, don't you doubt.
You wore the three stripes on your coat,
And that put hell in you;
You always tried to get my goat;
You surely put me thru.
When you were a sergeant--
A big burley sergeant,
And then the rear rank was mine,
And I never will forget it,
I walked off the pivot
And you made "double time”.
But you went to town, Joe,
When you ought not have had to;
And you see they knocked you down.
Now I am the sergeant-
The big burley sergeant,
So you stand in the ranks and frown. .
Bound to Give Them Hell
Save the food and stop the wastage
   While our country is like it is,
And we'll show you just how quickly
   We will jam the Germans' biz.
This is our determination,
   “Lick 'em all and lick 'em well."
In other words, in plain old english,
   We intend “to give them hell.”
We will take our gun and bayonet,
   And we'll do the stunt, you bet,
When we've sailed across the ocean
   To the land of Lafayette.
Aint no stopping 'till we've finished,
   When the job is done we'll yell;
And the Germans must acknowledge
   The Americans are hell.
Are we glad to go? Why, yes sir!
   All the millions say, I AM;
For to keep Old Glory waving,
   And to fight for Uncle Sam.
Now the conflict all is over,
   No more thunder from the shell;
You can bet your boots the Sammies
   Surely gave the Germans hell.
Beans
There are beans to eat for supper,
   There are beans to eat at noon;
There are beans for you to eat for breakfast,
   As the bugle pipes away so soon.
There are beans without the soupy soup,
   There are beans with soupy soup too.
There are beans for you to eat for luncheon.
   That's the menu prepared for you.
S. O. L.
When you just can't find your blanket,
  And you raise a lot of sand, --
Talking 'bout some one has stole 'em,
   And you cannot find the man!
You had better find it brother,
   If you don't I'm here to tell
You, yourself, is sho' done bought it;
   In other words, you are S. O. L.
When you want to see your lady,
   And she is living out of town,
And the officer gets stubborn,
   Just wont pass to passes around.
If you go without permission,
   In the M. P.'s arms you have fell;
And when they all do get thru with you,
   You'll admit you're S. O. L.
S.O.L. is just the meaning
   Of a “soldier out of luck;"
And whenever you hit it brother,
   Aint no use then for to buck.
Bucking is the thing that allus
   Gets you into a lot of h--l;
And whenever you do recover,
   You will say I. S. O. L.

Blanket Time
Weather's looking kinder funny,
   Aint exactly suiting me;
Things begin to favor autumn,
   Then the winter comes you see.
I honest the question,
   Mornings now just make me sore;
And I need another blanket,
   One, at least, or maybe more.
Soon you'll see Jack Frost a shining
   In his coat of brilliant white;
You can see him in the morning
   Where he stayed and spent the night.
Then you hear the wind a blowing,
   Moaning aroun' the house you know;
Then I've got to get some blankets,
   Three, at least, or probably more.
When you wake up in the morning,
   And the place is white with snow,
I just ease back under
   And wont look out anymore.
And I'm going to ask the captain
   What he means for me to do;
If he's got a few spare blankets,
   Will he let me have a few. 
Am I a Soldier
Am I a soldier in this war,
   A follower of the band?
And shall I fail to "double time"
   Or blush at a command?
Must I be carried o'er to France,
   On ships that sail the seas;
While other soldiers stay.right here
  And get these army peas?
Are there no Huns for me to face?
   Must I not do my best?
Is this great war a soldier's friend,
   Are we the Germans guest?
Sure I must fight if I would reign,
   Increase my courage, Lord;
Increase the 'mount of army beans,
   And I will wield the sword.
Gwine A. W. O. L.
Daihs sumpt'n kinder funny,
   Er it's jess hard luck, I 'spose;
How eber I'se gwine to tell you
   Jess zackly how it goes.
Ebry time I hab er date
   Ter see my gal in town,
Daihs allus sumpt'n happens
   Dat da gotta turn me down.
I had er date fer Chuesday,
   An' I went an' shined my shoes
An' pressed my suit up decent,
   Den de Sargun broke de news.
Dat man jess simply shoked me,
   'Twus jess es slick es lard;
De gal I lub, he lubs her too,
   He put me on the guard.
I nebber kin git off ter town,
   l'se allus gotta wait
Until the nex' time, den you see
   I'se busted up my date.
Now, I'se dun decided,
   But ob cose you needn't tell;
I'se gwine ter town nex' Saddy,
   Er l'se gwine A. W.O. L.
Sleeping out of Doors
Now what next is coming?
   I sure would like to know;
There're more things now to happen
   That've never been before.
That Spanish Influenza
   Has got us by the nose,
Its got the camp all quarantined,
   And we've got to sleep out doors.
And too, the nights are chilly,
   In fact, they're really cold;
And its bound to get some harder
   As the fall-time grows more old.
So we've simply got to stand it,
   How long, nobody knows,
But they've got the camp all quarantined,
   And we've got to sleep out doors.
So get your bunk and blankets,
   And on your bed of hay,
You do your best for comfort
   And try to snooze 'till day.
And you get up in the morning
   With the frost upon your nose,
Since they've got the camp all quarantined
   And we've got to sleep out doors.
Write a Letter Home
When you've wandered far away,
And you've seen a many a day,
Your heart was simply broken, yes, gone.
But you must then be cheery,
And you make your sad heart merry, 
If you'll stop a bit and write a letter home.
You may never wear the khaki pants,
In the furrowed fields of France,
O'er the trenches, o'er No Man's Land to roam.
You would be a happier man,
Take your pencil in your hand,
And sit down a bit and write a letter home.
The ones at home, of course,
They would enjoy the most,
To find out what had really been your doom.
Write them how you are getting on,
That you are well and strong.
Yes, sit down a bit and write a letter home!
You Sure Done Drop Your Candy
You pressed the other countries
   With your mean and dirty tricks;
And you just kept on meddling
   Till you got into a fix. 
You thought your little submarines
   Were simply something dandy,
But when you stirred up Uncle Sam,
   Right then you dropped your candy.
You sunk our ships and lost some lives,
   I hate to tell the story;
You knew they sailed with our flag,
   You didn't regard Old Glory.
And we are going to make you wish
  That you had never wronged us,
Although the miles are three thousand,
   And the ocean rolls between us.
We are going to make you wish, Bill,
   That you had let us be;
But then you couldn't have imagined
   How we could cross the sea.
Depending on your submarines,
   For they you thought were dandy;
But when you stirred up Uncle Sam,
   You simply dropped your candy.
Menu
Raisin pie, raisin pie,
   And sweet potatoes too;
O'er the weary drilling field
   I'll hike it back to you.
Army beans, cabbage greens,
   I know you're waiting there;
I'll sho go to France
   And make Germans dance,
Of this beautiful bill of fare.
Walking Post
When the days are wet and rainy,
   And the nights are dark and cold,
And you're wishing that for drafting
   You had been a year too old.
Then the wind gets cold and colder
   Than an iceberg off the coast,
And you've got to go on duty
   And get busy walking posts.
That's a jolter then I tell you,
   But, of course, you've got to go;
Get your mess-kit and your blankets,
   Get the count, one-two-three-four,
And beat it to your place of duty
   Feeling mighty blue, of course,
'Cause the night is dark and dreary;
   But you've got to walk your post.
About Face and Go
When you are feeling kinder jolly,
  And you want a pass to town,
And you go on to the captain,
   And he looks us with a frown.
Do you know general orders,
   And you stand and stutter so;
Aint time to stand and stutter,
   Do an “about face", then go.
When you learn the general orders,
   And you try him then again,
Just so sure you're going to get it
   Till you can't help but grin;
Then he hollers, “show your mess-kit”,
   And its dirty, that you know;
Aint no need to try to argue,
   “Salute, about face" and then you go.
Take the mess-kit then and scrub it,
   Till it shines just like the moon;
Clean your knife and cup up decent,
   Also scrub your folk and spoon;
Then again you go and try him.
   Rifle dirty!, yes, for sure;
Get some oil and rod and beat it,
   Just salute, "about face and go".
Standin' Tenshun
Stop dat wigglin' in de line,
   De sargun yelled ter day;
Hed an' eyes strait to de frunt,
   An' stan' strait up, I say.
An' er hole lot mo dat srgun sed,
   Dat here l' se not gwi mentun.
Put yer hands down ter yer sides,
   Dis company's “standin' tenshun".
Raise yer chess jess slitely up,
   Pull in yer chin er little;
Don't you see yer stummuck, man,
   Sticks out daih lack er kittle?
Git yer heels tergether, too,
   In er angle lack persishun;
Yer toes et forty-five digrees,
   And den you “standin' tenshun”.
Army Shoes
Lives of great men all remind us,
   We make life what we choose;
And departing leave behind us,
   Foot prints made by army shoes.
Foot prints that perhaps some other
   Made this war to gain;
A hike-worn or a dreary soldier
   Seeing, may brace up again.
Let us then be up and doing,
   With our never tiring might;
Always hiking, never piking,
   Learn to labor and to fight.
Army Beans
Army beans, my loving army beans,
Every day I'll hike, you see,
If my army beans are waiting for me.
Yes, you have won your fame
In the mess-kit game.
You may take 'way all macaroni and tea,
But army beans are sufficient for me.
Just like the bright moon beams,
So shines my loving army beans.
Double Time
When you wont do “squads right” snappy,
And you're just a dragging around,
You just wont stay on the pivot,
And you wear a sulky frown.
I'm going to tell you what's a coming,
Right here in this little rhyme;
The captain sure is going to call you,
And make you "double time”.
When "right front in line" is given,
And the back squads right oblique,
Then you move across as lazy
As if you'd been off on a hike.
Brace up now and make it snappy,
As I tell you in this little rhyme,
If you don't they sure will get you,
And they'll make you “double time".
When You are Marked "Quarters"
When you get a cinch and know it,
On the fellows in the line,
And you sit around and blow it,
While the others double time.
Why don't you come out?, they ask you,
Then you look up with a frown,
And you say, they've marked me quarters,
And I'm just a “hanging 'round".
You feel so bad you can't do drilling,
While the company is on the spot;
But when they all get out and busy,
Then you are bound to leave your cot.
And if some one does'nt get to you,
You will beat it off to town.
Yet you claim they've marked you quarters,
And you're just a “hanging 'round".
The Army Blues
When those army blues come get you,
When you are feeling on the bum;
All the Non-coms in behind you,
And they have you going some.
Then's the time to spur up, comrade,
Excuses then aint worth a dime;
Simply grin and you endure it,
Some day there'll come a time.
When you were a kid, remember
How the old folks used to say,
Every man must have his sorrows,
Every dog must have his day.
So if today is the other fellow's
Listen to this little rhyme,
Tomorrow he may then be busted,
Yes, some day there'll come a time.
My Mess-kit 'Tis of Thee
My mess-kit 'tis of thee,
Little pan how I love thee;
   For thee I pine.
I hunt thee night and noon,
After reveille's solemn tune;
   It's thee I find.
I take thee like a man,
And scrub thee in the sand,
   To keep thee bright.
My knife and folk and spoon
Shine like the silvery moon;
The whole outfit alone,
   My dreams at night.
My mess-kit seems to know
Whenever the whistle blows;
   I'll fill it full
With scrambled eggs and ham,
Ice tea, pork and jam;
All treats from Uncle Sam,
   And that's no sham.
Done Met Pay Day
l'se jess es happy es kin be,
And yer don't know what about;
Jess lisun, I'll tell yer,
Er watch en you'll find out.
So open ranks en tenshun,
And quit yer hanging 'round,
Case I done met a pay day
And Ise gwine ter go ter town.
I knose my gal's er waiting,
And town is jess twelve miles;

En Ise gwine ter go ter town.
Standing Reveille
When you are feeling kinder worried
When you wake up in the morn,
And you rub your eyes and gap, sir,
And you just aint worth a darn;
Then you turn and spread your blankets
In a careless way you see;
And you beat it to the company
For to stand the Reveille.
And you stand there and you listen
While the sergeant calls the roll,
And you stretch and say, Oh, Lordy,
Please have mercy on' my soul!
'Cause there's one thing in the army
That seems to get the best of me;
That's to leave my bunk so early
For to stand the Reveille.
After that you then get brighter,
Then you seem to just get 'woke,
When the whistle blows for breakfast
For to get your jam and pork.
Then you see a shine a strutting,
Man, you ought to look at me;
Wide awake to get my breakfast,
Nearly slept at Reveille.
The Soldier's Song
This song is always ringing,
You can hear it everywhere;
Every moment of the day
It's a ringing in the air.
Its left, right, three, four,
And dress your squad a mite;
Its close up, keep step,
Because the guide is right.
When you wake up in the morning,
And we jump right into our clothes,
And just time we eat our breakfast,
Then away that music goes.
Its left, right, three, four,
And dress your squad a mite;
Its close up, keep step,
Because the guide is right.
Quiet the Orient
Coarse the shots were fast falling
In the the region Over There;
The Germans' efforts was not worth a cent,
For the Stars and Stripes were calling;
And the soldiers they declare,
They sure would quiet down the Orient.
All the airships that were sailing,
And their sneaking submarines,
Soon could no more make the Germans feel content,
When our shots commenced to hailing,
Like the Germans had never seen;
When they went to quiet down the Orient.
When they got them driven
Cross the waters of the Rhine,
For their many haughty deeds they did repent,
And to us the honors given;
And the armistice they did sign,
When the Sammies quieted down the Orient.
A Letter to His Girl
My dearest little Mary,
I write you just to say,
That I am here and doing well,
And how are you today?
The only thing that worries me,
My darling Mary Jane,
I think that when I'm gone you see,
You stroll down lover's lane.
With some other sparkling chap you see,
While I am here in camp
Where bugles sound all thru the day,
And soldiers always tramp.
You asked me how I like it
Up here, and I must tell;
I fell out hiking yesterday,
But now I am doing well.
Oh! its nice here in the army,
And the country you can roam;
But don't forget, the song says,
There is no place like home.
I dreamed about you last night,
And I'm going to see you soon;
And if the dream is coming true,
We'll take a honey moon.
I guess now I will close, dear,
With nothing more to say;
Keep this letter 'cause its from
Your own kid, Johnny Day.
I said I was a coming soon
To see you, don't you know;
That's if the captain doesn't get mean
And just wont let me go.
It was a warm day in August when the boys “fell out” after a tiresome day's work which consisted of Double Timing and Hiking. While they were resting quietly someone in the bunch suggested that they have a little game, commonly known in the army as "skin". The arrangements were made by putting two cots together, purchasing a deck of Hoyl's Special and appointing a watchman to keep off all comers, in fact to speedily notify the bunch when he sees any trouble near.
Everything being ready the watchman was put on his post of duty, after being paid in advance for his work. The sun was declining fastly, and the balın of a summer breeze put him in a little while fast asleep. While he was sleeping calmly, no doubt, dreaming of a pass to town or the mess call, the sergeant passed right by him and rushed in on the bunch and caught them, skinning: “Caught? yes caught, but jist lemme git mer hans on dat watchiun”, said one of the bunch. The writer was lying on a cot near the scene and had watched the whole thing from the beginning, therefore he writes this little poem for the boys as he sees that there's trouble in the camp.
There's Trouble in the Camp
I heard a mighty. racket,
And the guards, they hollowed, halt!
And I heard the watchman pleading,
Boys, it sho was not my fault.
So I investigated,
Midst the sound of frightened tramp;
The sergeant caught them skinning
And there's trouble in the camp.
I heard them say the watchman
Needed plugging on the nob,
'Cause they paid him cuts for watching
And he slept right on the job.
As the watchman was explaining,
His eyes shined like a lamp,
For the sergeant then had caught them
And there's trouble in the camp.
You had better halt, I tell you,
There is no need for to run,
For the guards are waiting outside
With a bayonet on their guns,
And they sure are bound to stop you;
You are as guilty as a tramp;
And they is done caught you
And there's trouble in the camp.
Dodging 'Round
Some are soldierly a drilling
When the weather is mighty hot,
Some are off and doing detail,
Some are guarding around the lot.
And you see some in the kitchen,
Some on passes over town;
Yet there are some but you can't find them,
They are somewhere dodging 'round.
You may look into the barracks, ,
Not a soul there to be seen;
And you think that you can find them
Somewhere down in the latrine.
You may go and look and listen,
You neither see nor hear a sound;
As I tell you, you can't find them,
They are somewhere dodging 'round.
When the work is all completed,
And the boys “fall out" to rest,
Tired from working all the morning,
And they wait their call to mess.
Then these fellows all are present,
Dinners quickly swallowed down;
But when the sergeant blows the whistle
They get busy dodging 'round.
Pushing in the Mess Formation
Today when mess-call was sounded,
A burly man pushed in the door;
The Mess Sergeant yelled at him loudly,
“I have told you 'bout pushing before."
You know when you came to the army
You looked awful thin, slim and tough;
But now you are fat and you are saucy,
But you sure have got to cut out that stuff.
If you don't like your new Mess Sergeant,
Just because he put you way behind;
While the other soldiers passed,
He made you be the last
All because you pushed in the line.
If you don't like your cheese and macaroni,
If you kick on your peas and taters too,
You mustn't act like a young Texas pony,
Don't kick the man that's feeding you.
PART II.
The Negro's Fighting Spirit
You can talk about the Negroes,
And about how they will fight;
How they left this shore a singing
There will be a hot time there tonight.
I must say that was a trifle
To this grand and noble chance,
For they didn't fight in Cuba
Like they fought in far off France.
Course they helped to beat the Spaniards,
And they did their duty well;
They made them think as Sherman said,
That war was simply hell.
They broke in at the block house,
And they simply made them dance;
Yet they didn't fight in Cuba
Like they fought in far off France.
A many a life lost, of course,
There at San Juan Hill;
And was that fighting spirit lost,
No, they have that spirit still.
And so they are glad to tell you
That they are glad they had the chance;
For they didn't fight in Cuba
Like they fought in far off France.
Bringing Home the Bacon
When war stretched its cruel hand
And grasped every nation,
And gnashed its teeth so angrily
In four long years' duration.
How long this cruel war would last
Before peace would overtake them;
If they had not brought this country in,
Who went and brought the bacon.
The call for men did loudly sound,
To the colors they did hurry;
And did the black man hear the call,
Ah! yes, and don't you worry.
They went with hearts of hope to win,
Regardless what it cost them;
Rallied along with hearts that were strong,
And helped bring home the bacon.
Many a one was taken there
As captive or as slave;
Those little mounds do indicate
That these are heroes' graves.
None were braver at the front
In this great war's duration,
For they rallied along with hearts that were strong,
And helped bring home the bacon.
The Loved Ones Over There
The tears will come and settle
In your ever longing eyes;
The mocking bird's sweet notes are in the air,
And the Spring says don't you worry.
But you just can't help but sigh,
When you're thinking of your loved ones Over There. 
Course its nice to have a soldier
In that conflict there to fight,
And to represent this country everywhere.
But there are times there comes a yearning
That abandons all delight,
When you're thinking of your loved ones Over There.
Now continue watch and wait 
As you have in days that are gone;
When you will be rid of your care.
'Cause they have beaten the Hun,
And they are homeward bound;
And your loved ones coming home from Over There.
The Negro No Slacker
The French and German people,
And other nations too,
They had some mighty battles
That four years did endure.
And all the time of fighting,
'Tis all without a doubt,
The Germans were a winning,
And the others losing out.
Men and women suffered
For assistance, and they cried;
And then this country spoke aloud.
And many little babies,
Although helpless, there have died.
America's ships were sailing there
As they always did, with ease,
Because American people knew
They would go wherever they please.
But there came a large torpedo,
And struck this vessel's shell,
And after all that could be done,
It to the bottom fell.
Its awful sad to think about it,
How they their pleasures gave;
So innocently at the Germans hand,
They filled a watery, grave.
We are full now to the brim;
And the people also said,
We are with you Uncle Sam.
And so they went across the sea
To do their very best;
The Black and White were anxious
For to give the Huns a test.
And this test they could not stand,
It was too great a force;
They often thought the Negro was
A natural fighting ghost.
They said whenever they gassed them
They would just get black and blacker;
So you can judge here for yourself
The Negro was no slacker.
Who's Who?
The Germans had a high ambition
Once, to rule the universe;
And for four years were progressing
In their mean and haughty course.
And they sailed the air to conquer
Anything that they could find;
And they sneaked into the water,
There they planted deadly mines.
And they thought that soon the world would
Bow to them at their command;
They would reign supreme on water,
In the air, also on land.
But this idea was diminished
When our boys came marching thru,
For they abolished their intentions,
And showed them Who was Who.
The Negro hearing the call
Rushed to help in the fight;
And he had his weary days there,
Also many a sleepless night.
And that heart of theirs so gallant,
Gave them courage to endure.
Gave them grit to cross the water,
And helped to show them Who was Who.
Bravely on the ships they landed,
And across they bravely went;
Bravely to the front they hurried,
In that blazing Orient.
And they proved to be good soldiers,
Just, loyal, brave and true;
They were right with the colors,
Helping to show them Who was Who.
Real Democracy
In France the shell-shocked country,
Across the rolling waters,
Three thousand miles away,
Our boys sailed with Old Glory
To fight for the U. S. A.
And to give Old Glory honor
On land and on the sea.
Fought for a land where a man's a man,
And real democracy.
To us they gave the praises,
The allied force gave thanks;
And Ah! the colored soldiers,
They fought there for the Yanks.
In France the shell-shocked country,
There death bugs always blundered;
And fumes of poison gas did float,
And large artillery thundered.
But all the efforts that were made
To beat us in the fight,
And take from us our equal share
Of freedom and of right,
Were not enough to stop our boys.
The Negro, there was he,
He fought for a land where a man's man,
And real democracy.
Right There On The Job
The Negro from the very first,
Was there among the rest;
When signs were nailed up, Liberty Loans,
They, as usual, did their best.
They went and bought as others did,
They dug down in their fob;
Whenever they called the Negro,
He was right there on the job.
All the while their boys were going,
Right steady to the camps;
And this did not complete the job,
They bought war savings stamps.
And so I write them on a page
Like this forget-me-not;
For whenever they called the Negro,
He was right there on the spot.
And every draft that left the place,
The Red Cross they would knit,
Some sweaters and some little bags,
They called them comfort kits.
They never have been left behind,
On their record there is no blot;
For whenever they called the Negro,
He was right there on the spot.
Since Ephun Went Away
My heart is full uv sarrer,
En um feelin on der bum,
Case I'se seen dat life wuz trubble,
An mer rainy day is cum.
I didn't think I'd worry,
Befo dat partin day,
But things aroun here look gloomy
Since my Ephun went er way.
I tell yer now I miss dat boy,
Yet he jes had ter leave,
Ter help ter win dis cruel war,
En make dem Huns behave.
I say now dat um awful glad
Ter have er son so brave,
Ter sail ercross der water dere,
Democracy to save.
I miss him en er thousan ways,
Dat boy uv mine, I say;
Whut used ter slip off frum der fiel,
En hustle off to play.
I used ter take him dere ter work,
We wuz er happy pair;
But Uncle Sam he sent for him,
En took him Over Dere.
Now I'm left ter only pray
Der Lord ter gide his feet;
En ef he dies 'fore he returns,
I pray his soul to keep
I hope ter meet him ergin
Sum whar en sum ol day;
For things aroun here look gloomy
Since my Ephun went erway.
Who Went Over The Top?
Course our color is some darker
Than some other races' are,
And our hair is also lacking,
But our hearts were in this war.
Its not the color that did winning
'Fore this war was forced to stop,
And it was not curly hair
That only went over the top.
Bullets have no special people,
No one specially they hate;
And the Germans large artillery
Sure did not discriminate.
When they sent the bullets whizzing
At the Khaki everywhere,
Colored boys they wore khaki,
And they stopped bullets Over There.
When the stiffling gas was raging,
And things were hot in the land,
It didn't inspect any hair or color,
It did not have any special man.
When the air birds were a Aying,
Here and there a death bug dropped,
In face of all these deadly dangers
Black with white went over the top.
Lead, Oh, Kindly Lead!
I can hike it over Gordon
With that military grace,
That will make a lazy soldier
Get ashamed and turn his face.
If you lead, Oh, kindly lead me!
When my hike is to an end,
To another little formation
Where with mess-kits they fall in.
I will do "squads left” to order,
Know exactly how to go;
One, two and three, go across obliquely,
Pivots held by number four.
If you lead, Oh, kindly lead me!
To that room delicious rare,
Where the mess-kits are a ringing,
Ise allus longing to be there.
You Have Proved to be a Man
Colored man, you should be happy
O'er the many things you have done;
How you proved yourself up loyal,
And for traitors, there are none.
Uncle Sam relies upon you,
He knows you will, he knows you can;
And he knows in every case you have
Proved yourself to be a man.
Not these battles here in Cuba,
That's not all that you have done;
That's not first where you proved heroes,
That's not your first victory won.
You have rallied to your country
'Cause you seem to think 'twas grand;
In every case they've ever tried you,
You have proved to be a man.
Even in the days of slavery,
When the times were blazing hot;
They are gone, but Lord have mercy,
They never will be forgot.
Yet you bore your burdens freely,
You and trouble, hand in hand;
Yet through all your tribulations
You have proved to be a man.
You would beat it to the corn field,
And right there you'd work all day;
And you cleaned the wooded acres,
Never thinking of your pay.
But you've passed that day's oppression,
There's none better in the land;
And when the Huns woke up the Negroes,
That's the time they woke up a man.
No Man's Hand
The good Lord made the sun and stars
That illuminates the earth;
And he made a million other things
For comfort and for mirth.
He made the rolling waters,
And he also made the land;
And all this was completed
Without a human hand.
Well, why then do some people say
That Africa is our home?
God de this country same as that;
And he made man to roam
To any part that he may choose.
And he never set any time
For him to seek a better place
Or more congenial clime.
Of course Africa is the old home
Of all our fore-fathers,
But whether we live here or there,
I'm sure we have our rathers.
And we had rather stay right here,
As we have been here quite a spell;
And here's where our boys have fought,
And for this country fell.
This country is the white man's
We have always been taught;
But he just owns the portion
Of this country that he bought.
God made this whirling sphere you know,
And left it up to man
To get his share of what is here;
'Twas made by no Man's Hand.
Your Daddy was a Slave
Colored man just stop and wait
And listen here to me,
Because I must congratulate
You since you have been free.
You've reached a high point in this life,
Your way you had to pave;
You came up through a lot of strife,
For your daddy was a slave.
But all those days have vanished,
I now am proud to say;
And your life you sure have garnished,
Through struggles made your way.
Whenever your country calls you
To help out in a fight,
Regardless what befalls you,
It seems its your delight.
To go out brave and eager,
And do your very best;
I frankly say the Negro
Has surely stood the test.
And you have made a noble mark,
You have been brave and bold;
And you have passed the days so dark,
Now you have reached the goal.
You here like a little child,
Three hundred years ago;
And scattered like the oats that are wild,
And left here for to grow.
And so you grew up rapidly
On every side of life;
So now you sing so happily,
You have defeated strife.
You went across the ocean,
And there your all you gave; 
Yet from some a frown will come,
Because your daddy was a slave.
John McGinty
I've just received a letter, ma,
That makes me feel quite funny;
Its from a young man out of town,
Whose name he says is Johnnie.
He wants me to become his bride,
He says he loves me truly;
And happy will we ever be,
When we are married surely.
And so I tell you, mother dear,
I know you will be happy,
To see me marry and do well,
To a man who is young and snappy.
A young man who lives far away
Off in the busy city;
His house is number eighty-four,
His name is John McGinty,
Why daughter you are surprising me,
I thought you were more witty,
Than to think of marrying a man
Who lives off in the city.
This fellow too, I think he is
A most disgraceful loafer,
Who lives in city slums also,
His job I think is chauffeur.
But mamma dear I'll tell you more
About this little chappie;
His mother died three years ago,
Last month he lost his pappy.
His father owned a lot of land,
He has sister neither brother;
And so the wealth all fell to him
As there wasn't any other.
My darling daughter, let me say
I think that you are witty;
As there is no one left but him,
He then deserves your pity.
And so you go and marry him,
And try to make him happy;
And try to soothe him all you can,
For he has just lost his pappy.
Yes, I agree for you to wed
The young man in the city,
Whose house is number eighty-four,
Whose name is John McGinty.
Welcome!
Our doors are widely open,
And our tables they are set;
Our hearts extend a welcome,
For we feel we are in your debt.
So walk right in now soldier
Who across the pond did roam;
And rest from all your labors,
And make yourself at home.
We are daily waiting for you
To land here on your shore,
And walk America's streets again,
And meet your friends once more.
Some are crippled, some are blind,
Yet you have done your task;
Some affected in the lungs,
From Germans poison gas.
But come right on now into our homes,
We are glad to have you here;
And hear you tell some thrilling tales
That happened Over There.
We are proud of you, remember,
Our doors are alway open;
And this just simply means to you,
A hearty sincere welcome.
Finger In The Pie
The battles are fought across the sea,
And the world's great victory is won;
There's many a brother lost there,
And many a loving son.
And many a heart was left to grieve
For those who had to die;
And those who suffered there to keep
The Huns from breaking by.
We are proud of all those fighting men
Who fought for world-wide peace,
Who answered to their country's call,
And set sail for the East.
And Over There they freely went,
All fitted and clad for war;
They knew the noble cause that they
Were manly fighting for.
And the Negro he went bravely doing,
And the Germans had to hurry;
They helped to put them on the run
At famous Chateau Thierry.
But it is all finished now;
And as the years roll by,
We will not forget the Negro
Had a finger in the pie.
Freedom Everywhere
Freedom everywhere.
We have rallied to our country,
In the wars of long ago;
And we have always done our duty
When the orders came to go.
And we always went a winning,
For this mighty country here;
And for equal rights as Lincoln said,
And freedom everywhere.
When we had to fight the Germans,
Our boys were quickly sent;
For to whip that bunch of mad men,
In the far off Orient.
This the greatest of all conflicts
That the world has ever known;
You can't conceive an idea
Of the hardships that were borne.
You simply can't imagine
All the things we underwent,
For to make the German people
For their haughty deeds repent.
But all the hardships that we had
In that conflict over there,
Was for equal rights as Lincoln said,
And freedom everywhere.
They Are Soldiers
The Germans once decided
That they would rule the world;
Also control the waters,
And no other flag unfurl.
They were winning sure and certain
From the country thereabout;
But when they pulled us into the fight,
We made them cut it out.
Oh yes, the colored soldiers
As they always did before,
Rallied to their country,
And their hardships freely bore.
They helped to win the battles,
Patriotism said they should;
They are soldiers, not drawers of water
And hewers of the wood.
They left their homes, they left their friends,
As other soldiers did,
To help in those great battles,
And to share their manly aid.
They went to stop the sinking
Of our ships, because they could;
They are soldiers, noi drawers of water
And hewers of the wood.
They sailed across the ocean,
When they landed don't you doubt,
Then they got up to business,
And soon they cut it out.
The Germans couldn't beat them,
But they did the best they could;
For they are soldiers, not drawers of water
And hewers of the wood.
They Called Him to the Colors
Three hundred years ago, I think,
The Negro just had landed
Here on America's sun-lit shore,
Where slavery then was branded.
They were a few in number then,
Those poor and helpless fellows;
They brought them here to till the land,
And not go to the colors.
The twenty Negroes then it was,
By great men's own direction,
Were sold as horses or as mules
I'm told, at public auction.
The highest bidder got them then
To plow the corn and cotton;
No doubt they sold them by the pound
As butchers sell their mutton.
And all their hardships they endured,
Their hearts were filled with sorrow;
They seemed to know, though dark today,
The sun would shine tomorrow.
Tomorrow's sun didn't ever rise,
'Twas always dark and dreary;
'Till Abram Lincoln came and said,
I will relieve the weary.
And so he broke the mighty tie
That for years had tightly bound them;
Tore away the shadow and the shame,
Unlocked the chains from around them.
Then this impartial Lincoln, though,
In fact an ex-rail splitter,
He told the slaves that they could go,
And make their records glitter.
The Negro took him at his word,
Through life he went a winding,
Until the dark clouds turned about
And showed to him their lining.
And lighted his path with brilliant light,
That he might never error;
And their way to a blissful height,
They soon were drawing nearer.
On and on they traveled,
'Twas like climbing up a mountain;
But Ah! he reached the summit,
And is drinking from the fountain.
Seeing now the record made
By these never tiring fellows,
The country seemed to need the help,
And called him to the colors.
And when the country called they heard,
And they never hesitated,
But bravely went on to the front
Where death and suffering waited.
And there they found the enemy
In battles were engaging;
And Forward was the Negro's word,
And forward they were marching.
The Negro proved he was a man
In work and burden bearing,
And fighting on the firing line
His deeds were brave and daring.
And now we write him on the book
With heroes and with others;
They found that he was brave and true,
And called him to the colors.
Aint No Hard Times Here!
Some folks allus talking,
'Bout de hard times dat dey hab;
I could take my fist and smack 'em
Squarely in dere fetched glab.
Aint no hard times folks I tell you,
If you'll come here where I am;
I mean come into de army,
Fer ter board wid Uncle Sam.
Taters here and taters plenty,
Peas and plenty cabbage too;
Dis is whut um tryner tell yer,
Dat is here in sto fer you.
Now if you don't wake up and get it,
Um sorry fer yer, yes I am;
Yer better beat it ter der army,
Fer ter board wid Uncle Sam.
There Wasn't Any Color Line There
Those boys who held the banner,
Old Glory, in the air,
While the mauser balls were flying
In that region everywhere.
Yet they stood there brave and valiant
With that bright case-hardened will,
Because there wasn't any color line
At old San Juan Hill.
Yes they staggered toward the Spaniards,
In the hottest of the fight;
There they showed that they were soldiers,
There they showed their country's might;
And they made the Spaniards scatter,
And their blood did freely spill
But there wasn't any color hine
At old San Juan Hill.
War, of course, is no reception
To entertain a guest at night;
Often when I think about it,
I think Sherman sure was right.
But the colored boys did love it,
And I am sure they love it still;
But there wasn't any color line
At old San Juan Hill.
The Home Fires Yet are Burning
The home fires yet are burning
With a bright and brilliant glare,
And they are waiting for to welcome
Home, the boys from Over There.
They are sparkling bright and joyous
In that dear old happy way;
For the boys who waved Old Glory
For the dear old U. S. A.
They have fought the battles bravely,
And they seemed to like their job;
And they seemed to be determined
For to plug the Kaiser's nob.
When they got across the ocean,
Billie no more was content;
Because he knew the fighting fellows
Had landed in the Orient.
Now just lay down the gun and bayonet
Somewhere and take your rest,
For you are too much for the Kaiser,
And this fact he has confessed.
So beat it back to your own country,
Where freedom's sun shines bright and fair;
Come home boys you've done your duty,
For its over Over There.
Trouble On The Way
Hark! They heard the eager trample
Of an army brave and bold,
Coming for to set example
In Berlin, the sought for goal.
When the boys in khaki started
On their trip across the bay,
Germans in their boots did tremble,
They saw trouble on the way.
Leave the large artillery standing
Alone there on the battle field;
And the army be disbanding,
Your determined heart must yield.
Send a message to the Kaiser,
Tell him that you want him to stop;
For the khaki boys are coming
With the best that's in the shop.
You may use the winding trenches
For the graves there for the dead,
For the Sammies have the inches,
And there is nothing then to dread.
Clear the way for youth and talent,
Clear the way for brain and brawn;
Clear the way, the boys are coming
For to put the East in mourn.
Go and stack your army rifles,
Bid the dugouts long good bye;
All of these now is a trifle,
For your fountains are running dry.
Send a message to the Kaiser,
Have the armistice signed today;
For across the pond they're coming,
That means trouble on the way.

I Sho Got the Blues

Ter ease dat broken heart er mine,
En drive erway my blues.

En when it cums ter dancin,

Bless me! I looked en seed her
In old Joe Spivin's arms.
En now I feel jess lack I did
When Nell fust went erway;

Es er bale uv daddy's hay.
I went back ter my daddy,
En I broke ter him der news;
And axed him fer sum more advice,
Ter cure me uv der blues.

An de folks dat useter work here

An dere's only left er few,
Whut frolicked aroun' dese quarters
Back in eighteen fifty-two.
En dere's been er lot ob changes

Probbly you'd stay down ter zero,
In yer he'lth, er year er so,
Dey wood stick right close on ter you,
En du all dat dey cud du
Fer ter sho dat dey wus true.
Dats de way de peopul acted
In de year ob fifty-two.
But now de folks dun got so dicty,
Holes daih haid up in de air;
One wood think dey seed er object
Half er mile erway somewhar.

An de stars dey natchly fell.

But et ain nothin' hardly,
And ets er whole lot too;

Ercross de orchard too;
No danger me er balkin'

When de ole man comes en shakes me
Fo de sun is ebber shone.
Gid up Ned, mer boy, I tell you,
En less us go out in de barn;
Ise gwine grease up all de waggins,
While you shuck er feed ob cone.
Tother nite et wus er rainin
Hard, jess lack er very flood,
En I laid en dreamed that workin
On de nex' day wus no good.
Roads so bad we can't go haulin,
Fiel's's so wet we couldn't plow;
So I jess had done decided,
I wood sleep ter my desiah.
But erly on dat rainy mornin,
Dad, he calls me, "Wake up Ned!"
Fer de hogs dun broke de fence down,
And de chickens mus be fed.
Den I jess gits all ter pieces,
But soon I git up en es gone;
Ketch de hogs en feed de chickens,
Den I shuck er feed ob corn.
Aint No One to Prove It By
Unkle Joe is allus talkin
Bout de young folks ain no good,
Bout when he wus young he useter
Beat dem all er cuttin wood.
How he useter go out pullin
Down de men in log fields too;
En he sed, he wus de master,
En his ekuls were er few.
Probly Unkle Joe was rankin
All aroun de neighborhood,
As de bes man in de quarters
When it cums ter cuttin wood.
But de witnesses hab vanished,
Gone ter God beyond the sky,
An dat leabs us hab ter bleve et,
Aint no one ter prove et by.
Well, I guess when I am ole,
I'll go eroun er talkin too;
Tellin folks dat dey air sorry,
En bout de stunts I useter do.
How I useter run ole Sampson,
Pull his ears en make him cry;
An de younsters hab ter bleve et
Case dey's no one here ter prove et by.
Go er Bathin' in de Creek
Oftun now when memories take me,
Back ter blissful chilehood days,
I kin almost see de brooklet
An de barn fires all erblaze;
But de thing I most enjoy
When us all would pleasure seek,
Wus ter slip erway frum mammy,
En go bathin en de creek.
Wonder whar es all de chillun
Dat wood meet down et de stowe,
At dat one big comisary
Whar I allus useter go;
Fer to meet de udder chillun,
En to hab sum jolly fun;
Havin battles on de road,
En hollin, Johnny git yer gun!
But all dem days I long fer,
En all de chaps I useter kno;
Dey air gone I guess ter heabun,
Case ets been seventy years ergo.
But de days cum back so clearly,
Makes de tears roll down my cheek,
When I useter slip frum mammy,
En go bathin in de creek.
Tote de Water frum de Spring
Ise jess sittin here er thinkin,
An jess feelin awful blue,
Case Ise pinein fer de homestead,
An Ise ready fer to go.
Back ter whar de air es fragrant,
Whar de birds so sweetly sing,
Whar my mammy useter make me
Tote de water frum de spring.
De city is fine fer sights, en also
Busy crowds go hurrin by,
En dere's allus sumpin happnin
Fer ter keep my pockets dry.
Dere's too much stile en stuff ter suit me,
Jess don't lack de movin throng;
Think erbout de street so crowded
Till er man can't walk erlong.
Ise gwine back ter my ole homestead,
Whar de quiet seems to be,
Mo' dan all de hummin city,
En all de sights dat I could see.
Is I gwine? Yes, fer certain,
Whar de souns from fiddles ring,
Whar my mammy useter make me
Tote de water frum de spring.
Everything Is Gloomy
Weather mighty cole and dreary,
Nite air disagreable too;
Kivver aint too much, I tell yer,
Fer ter lass de winter thru.
Wood es gettin scace, en also
Smoke house aint no packin plant;
Ebry thing es lookin gloomy
In dis lan' ob need en want.
Cotton didn't sell fer nuthin
Case de war wus on, dey say,
I don't kno jess how ter take et,
Why dey didn't want ter pay
No mo fer de peas en taters,
En de wheat en cone en stuff;
But when yer go ter buy de dry goods,
You can't hardly bring ernuff.
Ef de war brought down de cotton
En de peas also do cone,
Why et didn't bring down de dry goods,
Dats de pint Ise hangin on.
But I hope some day dat dis will
Git tergether, yes, en stay;
Ef de war brings down de cotton,
Bring de dry goods down dat way.
Home Scenes
I jess been off er takin
Uv er pleasur trip, you see,
Jess er lookin roun de homestead,
Case et allus 'peals to me.
En man you bet I 'joyed hit
Ter de highes, en you kno,
Fer dey all jess made et merry,
En jess took on o'er me so.
Yes dey made de thing quite libely,
Jess ter think, hit made me laff,
Case dey broke right in de smoke-house,
En dey kilt de fatted caff.
En dey dug de taters also
Frum de hill ter make de pie;
Den de chickens was foun gilty
En wus sentenced fur ter die.
En ole Mose, I guess you kno him,
Libs down dere by Jones' stowe,
'Vited me ter er possum dinner,
En I wus right on hand you kno.
So much fun down dere I tell you,
Made me feel lack I was young;
Think erbout, jess gwine aroun eatin
En er dancin all night long.
En ter leab down dere wus harder,
Den you think hit wus, you see,
Case de scenes ob dat ole homestead
Allus do appeal ter me.
Take Your Ease
Brer Sam, now you jess lisen,
En I want you ter explain
Why you air older lots dan me,
But always I complain.
Dere's allus sumpt'n ails me,
Ets one thing or de udder;
Um jess all shot to pieces,
I tell yer brudder.
Mer joints air allus aching,
Mer bones air 'bout to brake;
Der rheumatiz is got me tu,
En chills jess make me shake.
I jess want you ter tell me,
Jess how et cums erbout,
Dat I am younger lots dan you,
En you air twice es stout.
Brer Ben, Ise gwine ter tell yer
Jess how dis bizness is,
En whut got you wrapped up in pain
Wid dat dere rheumatiz.
You allus worked en worried
Ober things here in dis life,
Yer allus had ambition
Fer ter stay above der strife.
But me, I went on gently,
En dun jess like I please;
So you jess jine dat order
Whut name is “Take Yer Ease.”
Dragging Across the Floor
Folks air allus talkin,
En er puttin on dere airs,
About de time dey hab a dancin,
Et de so-called swell erfairs.
I jess 'cided l'ud visit
One fer jess ter stan and look,
Fer ter see um do de tango,
En ter see dem eagle rock.
So I went down ter er party
Et er neighbor's house lass nite,
Case l'uz feelin kinder merry,
Fact, I'uz feelin awful bright.
But dat nite et sho convinced me,
En I wont go back no me,
Case dey jess locked up tergether
En go dragging 'cross de flo.
Pshaw! when I wus like dem youngsters,
In dem days de folks cud dance,
Not lack dem I saw down yonder,
Jess git up en 'gin ter prance.
Den de boys jess grab dair pardners,
En dey dance like fightin fiah;
You cud dance on haids, en also
On der foot ef you desiah.
Den dey ud holler fer der musick,
En 'twood make yer cullers fade
When de gals git wid dair pardners,
When dey holler promanade.
Dens de time we usester hab dat
Good time en er lot uv fun,
Startin early in der ebenin,
Quitin by de risin sun.
Dats whut I call folks enjoyin,
Dat's whut I call soothin cares;
Not jess allus roun er bragging,
En er puttin on der airs.
Needn't ter 'vite me ter ernother,
Fur I jess aint gwine ter go,
Case dey jess lock up tergether,
En go dragging 'cross de flo.
Rev. Brother Green's Sermon on Fashion.
Rev. Brother Green was pastor of Mt. Evergreen, a little country church, and the third Sunday in the month was his regular meeting day. He was one of the old-fashioned preachers that liked things in the old-fashioned way. He always worried about how the sisters and brothers dressed, and he did abhor the new-fashioned dresses the sisters wore, especially. So he decided that on one of his pastoral days he would take a shot at
this evil and try to knock it out of the box. I don't know what success he had, but, of course, we all wished him well in his efforts to whip this extreme evil. His text was Fashion.
Now people, you jess lis'en,
Ter whut um bout ter say,
Ise gwine to spress mer feelin,
On Fashion, here today.
Der way der folks es dressin
Dese days, is all in vain;
Dis es my subject fer terday,
En now Ise gwine to splain.
Dere's too much pride en stile now,
Dere's too much powder too,
Dere's too much hair straightnin,
En Christuns, dey air few.
Now jess look et dat Sally,
She's almost dressed ter deat;
She's girdled down so tightly,
Can't hardly ketch er breaf.
Now long ergo when I was young,
Dere wusn't much uv dat;
Dere dresses wuz made longer,
En der heels uv shoes wuz flat.
Den folks ud cum on out ter church
En ack jess lack dey ought;
Dey wusn't girded down so tight
Dey couldn't git up en shout.
But bless me do, dem days air gone
When folks did hab God's grace;
En cum ter church jess lack dey ought,
Dout powder on der face.
Now, I hab been er preachin
Fer forty years, I guess,
When gals ud wear der short uns,
En der women wore long dress.
You better change, I tell you all,
Jess take de gospel plow,
En leave dat paint en powder off
En serve God anyhow.
Case de debil, he is busy,
En he is boun ter git you too,
Ef you don't leave dis fashion off
En give God whut he is due.
Now wiff dese scatterin 'marks I close,
Ets fer you ter decide;
Ef you don't quit, der debil
Will sure take you ter ride.
You may git to de Ribber, but You
Sho Won't git Ercross
You may think Ise jess a talkin
Jess because Ise gittin ole,
An you think deys gittin neaher
Ob my name daih on de role.
But Ise erness bout dis matter,
Dat Ise allus tellin you,
Bout dis heah fox-fire ligun,
Case I kno et ain gwine to do.
You kin grin now ef you want ter,
You jess don't kno de haff;
Case et takes de pure in heart ter
Stan de great day ob his wraff.
You kin keep yer fox-fire erligun,
But its boun ter git you loss;
It may take you ter de Jurdun,
But et sho wont take you across.
Now erbout dis fox-fire erligun,
Guess I'll hab ter try ter splain;
Take dat Rosco fer er zample,
Now Ise gwine ter make et plain.
Lass yeah when he got his erligun,
He jess walked eroun de place,
Tellin all de other fellers,
Go ter God en git de grace.
Ebry time he go to meetin
De parsun leads er word ob prayer,
He jess ups en 'mence ter shoutin,
Hab ter hole him ober dair.
But de tuther day I seed him,
Es ole Jerri played er chune
On dat banger ob his daddy's,
Had ter gib dat Rosco room.
I jess went right up en tell him,
Dat Ise simply sprised et you;
Call yerseff dun 'fessed erligun,
Den er dancin. lack you do.
He jess low'd now Decun Jo'nsun,
When dat banger 'menced ter ring;
Don't you kno de scriptur tells you
Dars er time ter ebrything?
Dats whut I call fox-fire 'ligun,
Ef et aint I'd lack ter kno;
Jess er foolin ob de people,
Makin ob er outside sho.
Goes ter church on ebry Sundy,
Time de services begin,
Who you hear but dat dar Rosco,
First man holler out, Amen!
But you think dat Ise jess talkin,
Es I sed case I es ole,
An you think dat dey air nearin
Ob my name daih on de role.
But you drop dat fox-fire erligun,
Ef you don't you sho is loss;
It will take you to de ribber,
But et sho wont take you 'cross.
In de Sweet Daih By ain By
I jess feel lack allus shoutin
An er praisin ob de Lord,
Since he put me on de outfit,
Gospul helment, shiel en sword.
When I'gin ter think erbout ei,
Tears jess settle in my eye,
How some day Ise gwine ter 'joy et
In de Sweet Daih By ain By.
Feller, you jess can't ermagine,
Jess how sweet erligun is;
Unkle Tom sed he wouldn't natu'ly
Take er house en lot fer his.
Case et makes er feller happy,
Makes de whole worl' look bran new;
Dats de 'fect dat good erligun
Sho es boun ter hab on you.
Tell you whut et dun, my brudder,
Maid me leab de dancin flo;
Dun quit singin Swanee River
An dat scng bout ole black Jo.
Dun quit playin dat ole banjo,
Gwine ter libe rite 'til I die,
Case Ise sho er gwine to 'joy et
In de Sweet Daih By ain By.
An de same thing dat et dun fer me,
Et sho will do fer you;
Ef you jess go seek erligun,
De Lord is boun ter pull you thru.
Dats de time you will be happy,
An you jess can't help frum cry,
Thinkin bout how you gwine 'joy et
In de Sweet Daih By ain By.
Parsun, parsun, spare dat fowl,
Take not ernuther bite,
Case Ise es hongry es kin be,
An mad ernuff ter fight.
De Pleasuh Sho Is Mine
Ise er hangin aroun de church daih
Lack we fellers allus do,
Atter singin praise to de God frum
Whom all ob de blessin's flo.
An I went an axed de parsun,
Come go home wid me en dine;
He jess grinned an den he anserd,
Yeah, de pleasuh sho is mine.
Den we tole de other fellers
Dat wus standin dair erbout,
Scuse us, we wood see 'em later,
Dat we is gwine ter walk erbout.
An we walked down ter my quarters,
Daih we stopped an took er seat
Ter talk erwhile, es my ole lady
'Pared us sumpt'in fer ter eat.
Soon she cums and sezs, “Ise ready!"
At de word the parsun riz;
Made er dash den fer de kitchun,
As de pleasuh all wus his.
Den he sed, “De gracious Lord, we
Thank dee fer dese nurshmints here
Dat we 'ceivin fer de body,
Fer ter gib us life cheer.”
Nebber seed er man er eatin
Lack dat preacher wus dat day;
Chickin had ter jess git fudder,
Biskits wusn't in de way.
When he reach ercross de table,
He wood say, "O! Bless de Lam',"
Bless de cook, en pass de taters,
Thank you fer er piece ob ham.
Atter while I guess he finished,
Else he jess got shame an quit;
Den he lows, "Er better dinner
Nebber will I lib ter git."
"Well”, sezs he, “Less go ter meetin,
Ets time we shud be gwine;
I jess lows, Ise wiff you parsun,
Dis time de pleasuh sho is mine.
I Don't Really Think It Is
Es I wus walkin down der street,
Erlone de udder day,
Ole preacher Jones, he hailed me,
En sed Ise gwine yo way.
En so I stopped en waited,
Fer der preacher to ketch up,
En he cum ercross en jined me,
En we went on wid de step.
But I tell yer I wuz worried,
Case I knowed jess whut I had
Crammed erway down in mer pocket,
Dat wus good en pure en red.
En he heerd dat stuff er guglin,
En he sed “Whuts dat, mer boy?"
Aw ets nothin 'tall I tol him,
Jess er little juice uv joy.
Es we walked on out de quarters,
Do Nearly ter der branch's brink,
Me bein tiered out en worried
Made me want ter take er drink.
So I sed now, look here parsun,
yer think ter drink és sin?
Didn't de good Lawd make de cider,
An bottles fer ter tote et in?
Yes, de good Lawd made de apples,
Man made cider wiff his han;
Now 'bout de sin es fur drinking,
I don't zactly understan.
Case you kno dat I'm a preacher,
En I can't fall in de dirt;
But when et cums ter cider,
Sho, er little wouldn't hurt.
Let me sample, "Fine", I tell yer,
Best I had; go on, gee whiz;
En fer sin I'm here ter tell yer,
I don't really think et is.
Den Jesus do de Ress
Some folks say erligun
Is the only thing dey need,
Fer ter soothe dem in daih sorrers,
An ter check daih sinful speed.
An Ise wiff dem on de question,
Dey air right in whut dey say;
Case er man mus' hab erligun
Fer ter stan de jegment day.
When you git to de Jurdun,
You sho mus hab it daih;
Its de only thing dats 'cepted
Frum er feller fer de faih.
Now all de time you libbin,
Ise gwine splain now whut I mean;
Jess git sum pure erligun,
An sum money in your jeans.
Tell you whut I bleve in,
But, of course, erligun's fine;
But I lub de combernashun,
You kin mix 'em up fer mine.
Some Jesus an sụm nickles
I think is allus best;
De change go to de Jurdun,
Den Jesus do de ress.
You see, erligun stirs you
When you air feelin bum;
De change, et gibs you cumfut
When rainy days air cum.
I tell you all erbout it,
You need 'em both, mer brudder;
I's haff er duzun in dis han',
An six daih in de udder.
So first you git sum Jesus,
Den feather up your ness;
Fer de change et goes ter Jurdun stream,
Den Jesus do de ress.
Dese Here Quarters Sho Is Lonely
I can't hardly reckernize et
Since de few yeahs Ise been gone,
Things dey look so natu’ly gloomy,
Lack de 'hole thing is in moan.
Whar's de other ole-time darkeys
Whut useter lib roun here?
Dey seem ter all be vanished
Frum dis sectshun ob de sphere.
Whar's de bunch ob little chillun
Dat wus playin in de san'?
An I useter cum an skeer 'em,
Tellin bout de booger man.
I'd jess lack ter see Ain Hanna,
But I guess de ole soul
Dun gone cross de ribber ob Jurdun,
Walkin streets whuts made ob gol'.
Daihs Ole Dock, de banger picker,
Whar is he? I'd lack ter kno;
Guess he's gone on wid de others,
Walkin on de golden sho.
Dese quarters sho is lonely,
Nuthin lack dey useter be;
An Ise here erlone an longin
Fer de ones dats daih ter me.
If dey all dun gone ter glory,
Leff dese quarters here belo',
Fer de sake ob ole erquaintunce,
I, merseff, 'ould lack ter go.
Jess es quiet here es midnite,
Things jess natu'ly still es deaf;
Makes me sad ter 'mence ter thinkin
Dat Ise de only one dats leff.
Guess de good Lord knose his bisnis,
But I'd luff fer him ter kno,
Dat he's dun took my ole erquaintunce
An I'd natu’ly luff ter go.
Things Aint De Same
Ise jess here an lookin
At de scenes ob long ergo,
An it almos gits me weepin
Fer de things air changed up so.
I see de ox cart standin
Out daih near de apple tree,
An er few mo erthur relicks
Dat wus leff here, yet, I see.
Dey all dun got de fashun,
An dey dun fergot de pass;
An dey call me ole an fogie,
An dey say Ise green es, grass.
Jess because I lack de ole way
Dat de people useter do,
Go ter town er dribin oxen,
Go ter meetin wid 'em too.
Dat ole spring down in de bottum
Whar de chullern useter play,
Jess es dry now es de desert,
Dey air plowin dare terday.
An de plow dat dey air usin,
Beat all I ebber seen;
Dey lay erside de hosses
And dey plow wid gaserline.
New fashun now, dey tell me,
Whut's brung erbout de change;

But things sho aint de same.
Chune My Heart ter Sing Dhy Prase

An I tell you whut es so,
Dem daih folks air sho deturmined
Fer ter make de debbil go.
Case you see Ise jess er sinner,
But Ise bout ter make er change,
Case dey shootin gospul 'tillery
At de sinners in daih range.
Man, deys preachin an er prayin,

Fer dey claim de Holy Sperrit
Makes de debbil git eroun.

Cum an gib ter me yer han,
An gib de Mastah den yer heart.
Well, Ise prayin now ter Jesus,
Fer ter please look down on me,

Till he's nearly out ob breff.
Den fol' his arms ercross his busum,

Claim dat God dun shook de dungun,
An de chains dey dun fell off.

In de mornin way 'fore day,
When de Lord sed, "Go on Enoch,

Now less all jess git tergether,

You kin play yer hi-tone musick

Fer ter do lack erthur people,
An ter ack lack you air rich.
But de rail ole-time musick

When de chune jess makes you feel

You kin play dat big peanner,

You kin play till you ain able

You kin sing, I guess you call it,
When you 'mence ter holler so;
But you nebber cud intice me
Ter let dat ole banger go.
You kin blo de hone, en hammer
Hard er poundin on de drum;
You kin also beat de simbul

You kin play Hawaïin musick
On de little ukalee;
But de musick ob de banger
Is de soothin sort ter me.
Brer Possum Hit de Grit ах,

Because et ain no use.

PREFACE 
 
This poem is based on facts gathered by the writer, who was a sergeant in Company "L" 368th Infantry. It was written to give some of  the life and spirit of the individual soldier; in narrating the events of the Argonne drive; the pronoun "we" refers to the regiment as a unit, and of course the supporting artillery is taken in consideration. 
 
The writer wishes to express his appreciation of the kindness of his friends in giving suggestions and helping correct the manuscript. 
 
Chester J. Westfield 
MAY 16 1919 
The Voyage to France 
 
The news came, "You'll go over," 
But we did not think it true 
Till mechanics marked our boxes 
With letters white and blue. 
 
Then we were certain of going 
Over there to tight; 
For they moved us from Camp Meade 
One cloudy Wednesday night. 
 
The boys began to say aloud: 
"Our Uncle Sam ain't jokin'." 
For we all went thru New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, to Hoboken. 
 
They soon began to realize 
Their going far from home. 
Aboard the ship George Washington, 
As she plowed the rippling foam. 
 
After a voyage of thirteen days 
Over the broad and watery main. 
We entered the Bay of Biscay, 
Along the northern coast of Spain. 
 
We had gone more than five thousand miles, 
Sailing out from the peaceful West, 
When we sighted land one evening 
And anchored in tlve port of Brest. 
 
TO THE TRAINING AREA. 
 
We disembarked from our trusty ship. 
Then two or three miles went, 
And slept on the ground in sight of 
The Pontanezen cantonment. 
 
There were no cushions for our heads, 
No warmth indeed for our feet, 
But scant the water to quench our thirst 
And scarce enough to eat. 
 
After a stay of a week or more, 
A-living 'mid dew and rain, 
We next marched to the station 
At Brest to board a train. 
 
The weary soldiers were seated, 
With their packs near to their feet; 
A three days' ration was issued 
For the hungry men to eat. 
 
These rations consisted of bread and jam, 
Many cans of pork and beans. 
This fare we enjoyed until we passed 
Thru the towns of Tours and Orleans, 
 
For full three days we rode southeast, 
And no sign of barracks found, 
But at Passavant we were glad to put 
Our feet once more on the ground. 
 
From Passavant over hills and valleys 
We marched on with a will; 
Our packs cut our shoulders severely 
Ere we stopped at Figneville. 
 
It was there two white lieutenants came,
And several weeks they stayed. 
They taught us to play "Old Grady" 
And to use the hand grenade. 
 
An order came for us to move 
Across the river Saone; 
We pitched our tents in a field near by 
The village called Lathone. 
 
At Lathone the drilling was hard 
And burdensome to our backs, 
For our exercises were done 
With rifles and full packs. 
 
 ON THE VOSGES FRONT. 
 
In trucks from there we moved 
About seventy miles away; 
And at eve we billeted in houses and barns. 
In the village, Le Rolier. 
 
Soon an order came that read: 
"On to the front, you'll till a gap." 
And at night we were hauled from there 
To the city of Raon L'Etape. 
 
On the journey many were frightened 
And murmured a hurried prayer. 
For the Grerman airmen were trying 
To bomb us from the air. 
 
The thought then came to the men 
Of filling a dangerous front-line trench, 
For the automatic gunners were sent 
To the front along wilh the French. 
 
But the French and American soldiers 
Could not each understand, 
So the other part of the units 
Went forward, not leaving a man. 
 
All thru the day 'twas quiet. 
And we did not have to fight. 
But the Huns threw bombs on our trenches 
About nine o'clock each night. 
 
At night we patrolled No Man's Land 
Thru acres of close-laid wire; 
In danger of discovery by lighted flares, 
And of death by machine gun fire. 
 
After a stay of several days 
From the front we were turned aloose 
And carried back for recreation 
To the station of La Juas. 
 
We Remained there some days more, 
A-drilling 'mid cold and rain, 
Ere our company was called together 
To go to the front again. 
 
We moved that day to a mountain, 
Which little shelter gave, 
But we made the best of it by using 
A protecting rock or cave. 
 
The captain said: "My boys, 
Your days up here'll be few, 
For we go on trucks to-morrow 
To entrain at Corcieux." 
 
THE MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE. 
 
We thought of the front-line trench. 
But all of us kept cool 
Till we detrained along the Marne, 
Near the city of St. Manould. 
 
We were put off the road in a forest, 
Hun airmen our troops could not see; 
And happy, blithe, and hilarious. 
We knocked apples off a tree. 
 
From the forest early next morning, 
On rough roads we hiked on still, 
Till we leached some French artillery 
Hid behind a rocky hill. 
 
An order came to us that night 
Which tried each brave man's nerve: 
"Your regiment will go up to-morrow 
With Company L in reserve." 
 
We passed Vielle le Chateau, 
And good entrenchments found 
Oh a high and rugged hill 
Above a shell-torn town. 
 
On the hill we were determined,
And this was the officer's plan: 
To hold that hill from the Germans 
At the price of death to each man. 
 
On our advance the watchful airplanes 
Soared o'er us with many a bombing flier. 
On the ground were wire entanglements 
And heavy machine gun fire. 
 
At last, sometime that night. 
We took over a front-line trench. 
On our right were white Americans, 
And on our left the suave French. 
 
I looked around next morning
When machine gun shots I heard, 
And saw they had wounded severely 
My comrade, Corporal Baird. 
 
We pushed them back over tangled wire, 
Thru valley and over hill, 
And ended our part of the Argonne drive 
At the village of Binarville. 
 
After many Huns we'd captured. 
Wounded, or gassed and slain. 
We bombarded their bridges which offered retreat 
Across the River Aisne. 
 
Many brave deeds were done there 
By men who never knew fear. 
Till the French and Italians relieved us. 
Then triumphant we marched to the rear. 
THE SOLDIERS GO BACK FOR RECREATION, 
 
The march from there was very severe, 
But each man did his best, 
For, being exposed to artillery fire. 
We could not stop to rest. 
 
Hungry and thirsty, we could not enjoy 
The beautiful mountain scenes, 
But Sergeant Brown helped save my life 
With an extra can of beans. 
 
We marched some days to a station. 
And a crowded train did catch; 
Following the Moselle River, 
We detrained near the town of Marbach. 
 
Our officers tried to get barracks, 
Doing the best they could; 
They found none, and the soldiers slept 
Exposed to rain, in the wood. 
 
There were few new supplies of food, 
Still fewer of the old were left; 
Rations were gotten here and there, 
Each warrior cooked for himself. 
 
After living there for several days 
We packed up and hiked away. 
And made our home on the River Moselle 
In a town by the name of Pompey. 
 
Though Pompey was an excellent town, 
'Twas not to all our boys fancy; 
Many slipped off in the gloom of night 
To visit the city of Nancy. 
 
Now, most of the boys thought Nancy 
Was the best little town in the world, 
For here their lives were brightened by wine 
Or a lively chat with a girl. 
 
After a period of seventeen days, 
Our tramping was kept up still; 
By wading thru much mud and water 
We reached the village Franchville. 
 
But Franchville was dull and solemn, 
And our boys cared not to stay, 
So the officers showed their sympathy 
By marching us back to Pompey. 
 
 BEFORE METZ. 
 
After waiting in Pompey for orders 
For about five days or more, 
Then a march was made to a dugout 
Near the village of Gezoncourt. 
 
Our superior officer said: "My boys. 
You're not thru fighting yet." 
And on the tenth of November we went 
To fight at bloody Metz. 
 
For each hour of fighting we thought 
We'd lose a thousand or more. 
For the number of hours we meant to attack 
Was three times twenty-four. 
 
After passing thru many dangers 
In combating our subtile foes, 
The message came at seven o'clock 
That the war would probably close. 
 
At eleven the big guns ceased roaring; 
The machine guns quit raising Cain; 
The Boche stopped firing along the line; 
God smiled on the earth again! 
 
We were glad when the message came 
That America would fight no more, 
And victorious we rolled our packs 
And marched for Gezoncourt. 
PERIOD OF WAITING. 
 
We endured water and mud for a month. 
Then began our movement home. 
And slung our packs and marched for miles 
To catch a train at Maron. 
 
The boys were hungry and tired, 
And their packs were heavy as lead, 
And some of our comrades who were gassed at the front. 
On the hike, fell unconscious or dead. 
 
Our superiors said: "Don't worry, boys, 
We'll go home as soon as we can." 
But, lousy and dirty, were compelled to stay 
Several weeks longer in St. Julien. 
 
Each man had a vision of sweetheart or wife 
And no doubt of his parental house; 
When at last we journeyed westward 
To Le Mans in order to delouse. 
 
We longed for our homes in America, 
In the far-off golden West, 
When we were moved 'side the foaming sea 
To the forwarding camp at Brest. 
 
We had helped to conquer the Iron Man, 
Who for glory and 'power did crave. 
And were ready to sail for home again. 
To the land of the true and the brave!

The Heart of the World* 
 *Inspired by the speech of President Woodrow Wilson at Boston on his return from the first sittings of the peace conference in 1919. 
In the heart of the world is the call for peace. 
    Up-surging symphonic roar. 
'Tis ill of all clashings; it seeks release 
    From fetters of greed and gore.  
The winds of the battlefields echo the sigh 
   Of hero souls slumbering deep; 
Who gave all they had and now dreamlessly lie 
   Where the bayonets sent them to sleep. 
 
    Peace for the wealthy; peace for the poor; 
    Peace on the hillside and peace o'er the moor. 
 
In the heart of the world is the call for right; 
   For fingers to bind up the wound, 
Slashed deep by the ruthless harsh hand of might 
   When Justice is crushed to the ground. 
‘Tis ill of the fevers of fear of the strong' — 
   Of jealousies — prejudice — pride — 
Is there no ideal that's proof against wrong? 
   Man asks of the man at his side. 
 
    Right for the lowly; right for the great. 
    Right all to pilot to happiness' gate. 
 
In the heart of the world is the call for love. 
    White heart — Red — Yellow — and Black. 
Each face turns to Bethlehem's bright star above, 
    Tho' wolves of self howl at each back. 
The whole earth is lifting its voice in a prayer 
    That nations may learn to endure, 
Without killing and maiming, but doing what's fair 
    With a soul that is noble and pure. 
 
    Love in weak peoples; love in the strong. 
    Love that will banish all hatred and wrong. 
 
In the heart of the world is the call of God. 
   East — West — and North — and South. 
Stirring, deep-yearning, breast-heaving call for God 
   A-tremble behind each mouth. 
The heart's ill of torments that rend men's souls. 
   Skyward lift all faiths in hope. 
Across all the oceans the evidence rolls 
   Refreshing all life's arid slopes. 
 
    God in the highborn; God in the low. 
    God calls us, world-brothers. Hark ye! and know. 
 
 
 
 Where the Elloree Flows — An Etching 
 
 Tonight as floods of tender childish dreamings 
    Take me to scenes that e'er will pleasant be. 
 My thoughts review the make-believes and seemings  — 
    Life's golden trinkets now they are to me. 
 Amid the cotton fields, through woodlands roaming, 
    Where tendrils of the jasmine trail and grow; 
 Where all the world to me was sweetly gloaming, 
    And where the Elloree doth silent seaward flow. 
 
 The pine-top's green, with sunset's carmine blending 
 
    In color known to Nature's hand alone; 
 Gave charm to twilight and its dusky ending, 
    E'en where a star in gilded splendor shone. 
 The mocking-bird sang out its sweetest measures 
    And bade goodnight to all the world about; 
 Leaving a lone night-worshipper, as treasures, 
    The echoes, dying slowly, softly, gently out. 
 
 Again I hear the whippoorwill a-calling 
    Unto its mate from 'neath the perfumed vine, 
 Just as the sable dews are warmly falling 
    And Twilight, slumber's lap bids to recline. 
 The echoes of that happy time are waking 
    Sending life's fairest moments back to me. 
 While once again my soul love's thirst is slaking 
    In that fond stream, the clear cool Elloree. 
 
 The ripples murmur soft as if caressing, 
    While sweeping onward ever to the sea. 
 In sweetest cadences their voices blessing  
    A song that even now comes back to me. 
 My soul goes out tonight upon its travels, 
    A-drifting through the Universe, its sea. 
 Hoping life's mystery some day unravels 
   And brings its meaning clearly out to me. 
 
 
 
 A Sweet Face 
 
 Eyes have a way of winking. 
    Lips have their tempting smile. 
 Mouth utters what mind's thinking 
    When heart can show its guile. 
 
 Eyes can tell much in flashing. 
    Lips curl in sneer or scorn. 
 Mouth can show teeth in clashing. 
    Sadness is heart's big thorn. 
 
 Eyes can be red from weeping. 
    Lips can speak grief or pain. 
 Mouth can be secrets keeping 
    While heart breaks love to gain. 
 
 When eyes and lips are living 
    In harmony complete, 
 With mouth and heart love giving 
   They shape a face that's sweet. 
 
 
 The Parting 
 
 We stood beneath a moonbright sky; 
 Alone, we stood, my love and I; 
 A star peeped from its blue dark height 
 And twinkled out, "Goodnight, Goodnight." 
 
 Her head lay nestled on my breast; 
 Her softly sighing 'tokened rest. 
 A curl, with windblown, soft delight 
 Caressed my cheek, "Goodnight, Goodnight." 
 
 I know not how our eyes then met; 
 The mem'ry's closely treasured yet. 
 One pearly teardrop dimmed her sight 
 As lips framed heart's, "Goodnight, Goodnight.' 
 
 And when on earth my cares are done. 
 With all my battles lost and won. 
 May Charon stay his craft a mite 
 While 'cross the Styx comes her, "Goodnight." 
 
 
 
 The Pine Tree 
 
 (From the German) 
 
 Oh sighing pine!   Ah whisp'ring pine!    How true 
                thy crest of green! 
    Not only while the summer blows 
    But too, in winter when it snows. 
 Oh blooming pine!   Oh patient pine!   How true 
                thy crest of green. 
 
 Ah, little maid, my little maid!   How false doth 
            show thy heart. 
    You swore me true to my delight; 
    But now I'm poor thou art in flight. 
 Ah, little maid, yes, little maid!   How false doth 
           show thy heart. 
 
 Thou Nightingale!    Thou Nightingale!   From her 
                too thou hast learned 
    Thou'rt with me while the summer lasts; 
    'Midst storms and snows thy flight is fast. 
 Thou Nightingale!   Sweet Nightingale;   From her 
               too thou hast learned. 
 
 Brook in the vale!   Brook in the vale!   Thy face 
      shows deceit 
    Thou gushest on when torrent flows; 
    A drought ere long thy spring will close. 
 Brook in the vale!   Brook in the vale!   Thy face 
    shows deceit. 
 
 Ah, soughing pine!   Sad, sighing pine!   Thou dost 
                    alone prove true. 
    Not only green when summer blows, 
    But too, in winter's blighting snows. 
 Sweet blooming pine!   Ah, patient pine!   Thou dost 
                   alone prove true. 
 
 
 
 With You Away 
 
 Heart has ceased its pulsing, hope is all but gone. 
 Boundless is my grieving, surcease there is none. 
 Castles all have tumbled; sable sorrow's dust 
 Hides the soul's creations.  Love has lost its trust. 
 Daylight misses sunshine; night its stars and moon. 
 Birds don't sing as sweetly; seems they're out of tune. 
 'Round the tomb of mem'ry withered rose leaves play 
 Heart 0' Mine, I'm lonely since you went away. 
 
 Tongue has ceased cantation, fingers listless fall. 
 All I do is wait here for your tender call. 
 What's the worth of dreaming, when you dream alone ? 
 Wildwind is there solace to a heart now stone? 
 Why was I so cruel to a life so sweet? 
 Angels keep close vigil till again we meet. 
 Flown has summer's gladness; life is dull and gray 
 Since, Dear Heart, you left me — since you went away. 
 
 
 
 War — What's It About? 
 
 Clanking of armor and marching of feet, 
 Thund'rings and toilings on roadway and street; 
 Screeching of whistle — frantic, wild shout — 
 Yet, what's all this furor of mankind about? 
 
 Women are weeping and children still cling 
 To arms that along with feet tramping will swing. 
 Millions plunge into Hell's vortex — few out. 
 But what is this raging of mankind about? 
 
 Cannons are roaring and earth is ablaze. 
 Nations are grappling in frenzy and craze. 
 Brother seeks brother's blood (both brave and stout.) 
 When both in cold death lie, well, what's it about? 
 
 Nations are starving their hell-guns to feed. 
 Soul-seared men bleeding — and killing their creed. 
 Go gaze on each battlefield — somebody's rout. 
 When killing has ended, say, what's it about? 
 
 
 
 Over the Bridge of Dreams 
 
 Over the bridge 'mongst eery things 
    Where only our thoughts can go. 
 Into the land to which mem'ry clings 
    And Heart's choicest blossoms grow ; 
 Gleefully sporting in phantasm's halls, 
    Pleading with hope's bright beams, 
 Shadow-bom children, each beckons and calls, 
    Over the bridge of dreams. 
 
 Over the bridge 'twixt dark and dawn; 
    There Life's richest garden grows. 
 Tear-watered plants on Eternity's lawn 
    Bend low with each breeze as it blows. 
 Over the bridge the soul takes flight, 
    For solace when things go wrong; 
 Into Love's sunlight, out of sad night, 
    For solace, when things go wrong. 
 
 Over the bridge to magic land, 
    We hasten to Heart's retreat. 
 (Sometime these rovers of Romance land 
    And our Earthborn hopes shall meet.) 
 To treasure-land — Thule — the Hallowèd spot 
    We ever go, crossing the stream. 
 Seeking, achieving, — each one to his lot — 
    Over the bridge to dream. 
 
 
 
 Helen's Laugh 
 
 The laughter born in Helen's heart, 
    Is sunshine to the soul. 
 And when she dimples with a smile 
    Away all shadows roll. 
 
 The notes just ripple from her throat, 
    Like song from robin's breast, 
 When winds of summer sway the leaves 
    That hide her tree-top's nest. 
 
 When Helen laughs the heart holds still
    With tender happiness. 
 Her eyes dance tantalizingly, 
    Her cheeks tempt to caress. 
 
 When Helen laugh's the world is rich, 
    And all about is fair. 
 'Tis then the angels seem to sing 
    Their lightest tinkling air. 
 
 When Helen weeps earth hides in gloom, 
    As cold as winter's blear, 
 Until she nestles in my arms 
    And I kiss back a tear. 
 
 
 
 
 In Summer Twilight 
 
 Just a dash of lambent carmine 
    Shading into sky of gold; 
 Just a twitter of a song-bird 
    Ere the wings its head enfold; 
 Just a rustling sigh of parting 
    From the moon-kissed hill to breeze; 
 And a cheerful gentle, nodding 
    Adieu waving from the trees; 
 Just a friendly sunbeam's flutter 
    Wishing all a night's repose, 
 Ere the stars swing back the curtain 
    Bringing twilight's dewy close. 
 
 
 Goodbye, Mr. Gloom 
 
 Goodbye, Mister Gloom!   So long, Boy! 
    You've lingered long enough. 
 You've tried to cloud the path to joy. 
    Your efforts are a bluff. 
 You never like a good bright day, 
    But skulk in darkened room. 
 You'd better heed me when I say, 
    So long, Mister Gloom. 
 
 You've pestered me for nigh a week 
    With your long face and groan. 
 I hate the mask through which you peek. 
    You do naught else but moan. 
 I'm going to live with Mister Gay 
    Who's always got a smile. 
 So, run along. You cannot stay. 
    Your ways are out of style. 
 
 This world's no place for such as you. 
    So best be on your way. 
 The blackest clouds hide skies of blue. 
    I quit you from today. 
 We've nothing here that isn't good.  
    I don't care what you say. 
 I'm warning you — and here's your hood. 
    Now goodbye.   Fade away! 
 
  
 
 Where the Whispering River Flows 
 
 Where the whispering river's flowing 
    'Twixt two verdant mossy banks; 
 Where the glinty sunlight's glowing 
    Thro' the shade trees' knightly ranks; 
 Where King Solitude is stalking 
    Monarch ; while the silence grows 
 (To the world in volumes talking) 
    There the whisp'ring river flows. 
 
 Limpid whirlpools music bubble 
    Swirling ever toward the sea 
 Singing, "Heart forget your trouble. 
    None can always happy be." 
 Onward, ever onward rippling, 
    Never ceasing stream it goes. 
 Where dance woodsprites, each a strippling, 
    There the whisp'ring river flows. 
 
 Radiant raindrops rush or linger 
    Making love to morning dew. 
 Where old Nereus rested finger 
    Or 'mid moss his body threw. 
 Through vast leafy halls it rushes. 
 Into fields it wealth bestows 
 Ever, as away it gushes, 
    Ever whisp'ring as it flows. 
 
 "Men are doomed to work and battle. 
    Women love thro' tear and mourn. 
 Children fast outgrow their prattle 
    Rush to struggle and be torn. 
 I have seen some aeons flutter. 
    Suns have passed from night to morn, 
 Birds of passage, dust-made, splutter, 
    Storm-tossed, battered, sick and worn. 
 Earth is but a place, soul training 
    Anyone who's passed now knows. 
 I'm the link Aeternis chaining. 
    World to world my whisp'ring fllows." 
 
 
 Rewards 
 
 I tilled my garden in the spring. 
    Down midst the weeds I found, 
 A plant that gasped for air and light 
     In hard unbroken ground. 
 
 I watched it o'er with tender care, 
    Through heat till summer's close. 
 When of my work I'd most despair 
    Lo then; there bloomed a rose. 
 
 I tilled the garden of the soul. 
    Watched good deeds rooted start. 
 When seemed my work most vain and cold 
    There burst full bloom — a heart. 
 
 
 
 ‘Tis Winter, Paul 
 
 'Tis winter, and the drear' sad earth 
     Lies glistered o'er with snow. 
 Through naked, weird-songed, swaying trees  
     Wild frost-chilled wind gusts blow. 
 Some days are fair, with sunsets gold,  
    When skies, though cold, still glow. 
 They promise warmth for flowers sweet 
    Asleep encouched below. 
 
 'Tis too, the winter of our lives. 
    Upon our heads is snow. 
 A few more storms and sleets, Friend Paul,  
    Upon us yet may blow. 
 They cannot chill the heat of heart. 
    While friendship's flame's aglow, 
 And warms the blossoms of our souls  
    What care we?    Tush! for snow. 
 
 
 My Clock 
 
 Tick-tock sings my clock.  Tick-tock,  tick-tock. 
    As it tells the hours away. 
 And its song's the same as it plays life's game  
   Through the night as through the day. 
 (Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.) 
 The throb but shows how thro' space each goes  
    While the world keeps pulse apace. 
 Up and on it pleads.  Banish wrongs and greeds.  
    Birth to death 's a mad wild race. 
 
 Tick-tock, goes my clock. Tick-tock, tick-tock.  
    And it tells of changing friends. 
 Thus goes the world as 'tis ever whirled.  
    And the song?  It never ends. 
 (Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.) 
 Why the haste it asks?  Every day has tasks.  
    And each one's to be done. 
 Just plod along with a smile and song.  
    After night 'gain comes the sun. 
 
 Beat-beat, goes the heart.  Beat-beat, beat-beat.  
    Reaper Time makes sure his toll. 
 Faith and love should march through triumphal arch  
    Ere hath ceased the muffled roll. 
 (Beat-beat, beat-beat, beat-beat, beat-beat.)  
 With the music tread.  Never fear, never dread.  
    Every day's work frankly face, 
 With a song of hope; then we'll never mope, 
   And we'll win life's rugged race. 
 
 
 
 
 Poesy Land 
 
 I know of a land where the heart loves to dwell 
     Where no clouds ever sadden the soul ; 
 Where the fountains of kindness eternally well, 
      Where love mists to beauty cajole. 
 A land where the wreckage of hopes never drift 
      From the crests of life's billowy sea, 
 Where friendships, in faith, find never a rift ; 
     Where troths never broken shall be. 
 
 I know of a land where happiness whiles 
     A land full of sunshine and song. 
 A land, sans the darkness, aglow with the smiles, 
     Where the days are eternity long. 
 I know of a land full of truth and of right. 
     Where everything is as it seems. 
 Where tenderness tempers the arm of might — 
     A beautiful land of dreams. 
 
 Then come, and we'll stroll, through Elysium's fields 
     Where Morpheus's way is supreme. 
 Why bother with fame or the tithe that earth yields, 
     Where the symbols of trife ever gleam? 
 I'll weave you a garland of bright poppy leaves 
     Whose fragrance with blessings e'er teems. 
 I'll pilot where love nor the heart ever grieves 
    To the land of our innermost dreams. 
 
 
 
 To Miss Nineteen On Her Birthday 
 
 Sweet Elsie, fair as day in June,  
    With heart as light and free 
 As tempered winds which kiss the dune,  
    Or sport with maple tree, 
 You've passed another milestone by,  
    And full of hope you face 
 The coming year with clear calm eye  
    And every winning grace. 
 
 I wonder if the future years  
    Will hold, in joy, for you, 
 The happiness, carefree of tears  
    Your nineteen's passed you through? 
 Youth counts impatiently its time  
    And always looks ahead. 
 'Tis only when we've passed our prime  
    We see the past that's dead. 
 
 Hope is for youth.  But memory  
    Grows dearer as we age. 
 And things which you now lightly see  
    Will brighten life's late page. 
 So gather blooms of joy each day.  
    Let each year mean the more. 
 That when your pulse slows you can say,  
    "I've lived.   What ask I more?" 
 
 
 Friendship 
 
 Far out in life where skies are blue,  
    Though dreary or sunshiny bright, 
 Friendship is dreaming ever of you  
    And flashing to you its light. 
 Wishing you well as hours drift  
    From sunrise to twilight's dew 
 Hoping the clouds that shroud you lift 
    And show always skies are blue. 
 
 Out of the kingdom where friendships all grow  
    Love incenses waft I to you; 
 Borne upon tend'rest of Zephyrs that blow  
    And comrady thought petals strew. 
 Each is a soft touching whispery kiss 
    Bidding the heart be gay. 
 Presaging sorrow's quick flight and much bliss  
    As true friends go treading life's way. 
 
 
 Finis 
 
 (To a Clergyman Going Blind) 
 
 Daylight's ending; fetch the candle.  
    Death delay!  I cannot go. 
 Whet your scythe a moment, and I'll  
    Help to lighten brother's woe, 
 Till I share my neighbor's sorrow  
    Just another hour or two. 
 When they smile, nor trouble borrow,  
    I'll have finished;  I'll be through. 
 
 Night is growing; light the candle.  
    There is still much work to do. 
 Hearts need love.  ('Tis life's great handle)  
    Just as lilies need the dew. 
 One by one the stars are peeping  
    Through the limpid golden glow. 
 Hope and faith their vigil keeping.  
    Heaven's best pilots they, I know. 
 
 Let me love its warmth upsending  
    While the parting sun doth beam. 
 When 'tis gone my task is ending.  
    I'll have finished.  Then I'll dream. 
 Then I'll lie me down to slumber  
    With no ling'ring look behind. 
 When I seek the spirit number  
    Bright the pathway I shall find. 
 
 
 
 To Madrienne 
 
 (A Confession) 
 
 Had I aught that would commend me  
       To a spirit such as thine, 
 Madrienne, I'd count the blessing  
    Nature'd given near divine; 
 Laugh to scorn this world of ours;  
       Deem myself almost a god. 
 But alas, a weaker being  
       Mortal earth has never trod. 
 
 Passions sway me just as billows  
       Toss the wreckage on the sea. 
 Powerless, I drift, a plaything.  
       E'en Time's wavelets sport with me. 
 Form nor feature, voice nor culture;  
       Not a grace claim I a part. 
 Simply one weak, human mortal  
       With a something called a heart. 
 
 Not a thing to recommend me  
       Save this frail enfeebled part,  
 Known to science as a human, 
       Fleshen, pulsing bit, a heart.  
 Yes, a heart.  But it doth echo 
       Every throb of human woe;  
 And can sense the blight of sorrow; 
       Bow with pain that others show. 
 
 Like the flowers that bloom in sweetness  
       All around seems bright and fair. 
 Like a weed, unnoted silent,  
       Breathe I only to the air. 
 Weakest clay that e'er existed.  
       Seem I, of life not a part. 
 Just what Nature's fancy made.  A  
       Struggling tender bit of heart. 
 
 
 When Night Comes On 
 
 When night comes on, and day 
 Forsakes us with his glory bright; 
 When I have ceased my daily tasks, 
 And sought my home for rest at night; 
 When Sun god draws his whip across the sky 
 And writes, "Goodnight,"  my burdens fall. 
 Before my fitful blaze I sit and dream 
 Such dreams as only lonely soul can know; 
 Of pleasures gone so long they seem 
 Lost — till Eternity can bring 
 Hearts face to face again.  All this 
 When night comes on. 
 
 I fashion fancies fair.  
 And with them picture scenes  
 That give my soul delight, e'en tho'  
 They're formed alone from might-have-beens  
 And never can be true.  Ah no!  
 When me the glowing embers bid  
 Seek strength which next day's combat will  
 Demand, I seek my couch and rid  
 My soul of all save God above.  
 When night comes on. 
 
 
 Easter Chimes 
 
 (After the War) 
 
 Easter chimes are ringing.  Gladsome Easter chimes. 
 Telling forth the tidings — joy to many climes. 
 Christ the Lord is risen.  Peace hath come again, 
 Love triumphant's master.  Peace again doth reign. 
 
 Easter voices singing, glory to our King. 
 Let's all join the anthem, fervently we'll sing. 
 Life has newborn meaning seen from Calvary. 
 Christ forever liveth in man's soul set free. 
 
 Easter chimes are sounding.  Happy Easter bells. 
 Hearts their prayers are lifting.  Loud the murmur swells. 
 Lord, let peace be with us; everlasting peace, 
 Banishing all hatreds — Lord, let battles cease. 
 
 
  
 
 They've Lynched a Man in Dixie 
 
 They've lynched a man in Dixie.  
    Oh God, behold the crime. 
 And 'midst the mad mob's howling  
    How sweet the church bells chime. 
 They've lynched a man in Dixie.  
    You say this cannot be? 
 See where his lead-torn body  
    Mute hangs from yonder tree. 
 
 They've soiled the soul of Dixie.  
    They've steeped her heart in guilt. 
 Long ages will remember  
    This shame her people built. 
 Blind, bestial, brutal murder  
    To sate some selfish claim! 
 Is this the land of freedom?  
     For this doth Justice aim? 
 
 They've sent a soul to judgment.  
    God! yet they say they're good. 
 They strive to save the heathens  
    Yet thirst for human blood. 
 Must life be held so lightly  
    Which dares some right to claim? 
 Which asks Christ's human living;  
    Must they that body maim? 
 
 Where is the heart of Christians  
    When brute force rules the band? 
 Is there no fairness in you  
    Oh, this my native land? 
 They've lynched a man in Dixie.  
    Dear God, look down and see 
 Where men feed lusts and hatreds  
    And shame fair Liberty. 
 
 Where is the dream of Justice  
    For which our souls we give? 
 If man beneath we trample  
    Because he seeks to live? 
 Look to the Cross, oh people.  
    Once raised on Calvary. 
 Bleed heart, for pain and sorrow  
    But brothers let us be. 
 
 
 
 
 My Jewels 
 
 Three jewels have I in my crown.  
    Three gems beyond compare. 
 More precious they, tho' 'f less renown,  
    Than any rulers wear. 
 
 Each has a heart of purest gold  
    Inset with love so true, 
 That all are dazzled who behold  
    These gems of warm bright hue. 
 
 I keep them safe within my home 
    Lest robbers steal my joy.  
 And never from my heart they roam 
    My wife, my girl and boy. 
 
 
 
 Turn Out the Light* 
 
 *Written upon the death of the late former President Theodore Roosevelt whose last utterance was the request, "Turn out the light, please." 
 
 Turn out the light.   Now would I slumber, 
    I'm weary with the toil of day. 
 Let me forget my pains to number.  
    Turn out the light.   Dreams come to play. 
 
 Turn out the light.   The hours were dreary.  
    Clouds of despair long hid the sun. 
 I've battled hard and now I'm weary.  
    Turn out the light.   My day is done. 
 
 I've done life's best gloom's ways to brighten 
    I've scattered cheer from heart to heart.  
 And where I could I've sought to righten 
    The wrongs of men ere day depart. 
 
 This morn 'twas bright with hope, — and cheery. 
    This noon gave courage — made me brave. 
 But as the sun sank I grew weary  
    Till now my soul for rest doth crave. 
 
 Turn out the light.   I've done my duty  
    To friend and enemy as well. 
 I go to sleep where things of beauty  
    In glitt'ring chambers ever dwell. 
 
 Turn out the light.   Now would I slumber.  
    To rest — to dream — soon go we all. 
 Let's hope we wake soul free of cumber.  
    Turn out the light.   Dream comrades call. 
 
 
 
 
 Voyaging 
 
 Night in the sky above me.  
    Uncharted deep below. 
 Onward my craft goes sailing,  
    Whither I do not know. 
 
 Loud roar the waves about me.  
    And then their angry moan 
 Dies in the mirk beyond me.  
    Restless, they surge and groan. 
 
 Who knows the breakers' danger?  
    Who cares, Oh heaving sea? 
 Thou art my great adventure.  
    Fading yon shelt'ring lea. 
 
 Night — and the stars above me  
    Glint through the rifting clouds.  
 Pale moon lights up the shoalings 
    For many ships they're shrouds. 
 
 Life too 's a vast, vast ocean —  
    Uncharted restless sea. 
 O'er it my soul craft's sailing  
    On toward the distant lea. 
 
 Dreams are the bright stars shining 
    Hope is the moon that guides  
 Right is the pilot holding  
    Heart thro' the storms it rides. 
 
 Night in the sky above me.  
    Uncharted deep below 
 Pulsing a sailor's longing  
    For home port's beacon glow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Goodbye Old Year 
 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Here comes New. 
 You've done wonders; now you're through; 
 Adding wisdom to the ages, 
 Making history's best pages; 
 Rest and slumber with the sages. 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Welcome New. 
 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Welcome New. 
 Off with false hopes; on with true. 
 Nations raise a mighty chorus, 
 Rich intoning, grand, sonorous, 
 Blithe and gladsome, sad, dolorous; 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Welcome New. 
 Off with false hopes.   On with true. 
 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Hail the New. 
 Goodbye hatreds.   Wrongs adieu. 
 Down Life's lane, with high or lowly, 
 Weak, or strong, sin-cursed, or holy, 
 Time is reaping-trudging slowly. 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Hail the New. 
 Goodbye hatreds.   Wrongs adieu. 
 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Come in New. 
 Stout hearts look for light, to you.  
 Rising hopes new scenes are staging; 
 Brotherhood our thoughts engaging. 
 Dreams of Peace hide battle raging. 
 Goodbye Old Year.   Come in New. 
 Stout hearts fondly look to you. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Merry Christmas All 
 
 Bells are ringing, hearts are singing;  
       Love drives care away. 
 Hopes are lifting, pain is drifting.  
       This is Christmas day. 
 Smiles of gladness banish sadness. 
       O'er the earth the call 
 Echoes, rolling, chime-like tolling —  
       Merry Christmas all. 
 
 Off with sorrow till the morrow;  
       'Tis our day of joy. 
 Flee on trouble, cheer we'll double.  
       Nought let soul annoy. 
 Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!  
       Church and home and hall, 
 Send the tiding skyward riding.  
       Merry Christmas all. 
 
 Life is measured, life is treasured  
       By the love we give. 
 And it brightens, burdens lightens.  
       Christ again doth live. 
 Start the greeting; hours are fleeting  
       Soon the shadows fall. 
 Smile on meeting — smile repeating —  
       Merry Christmas all. 
 
 To Louise 
 
 (A Song) 
 
 In the wonderful garden of life, Dear Louise,  
       There's a flower that's blooming for you, 
 And its fragrance is wafted on each gentle breeze  
       When the sun's making mist of the dew. 
 'Tis a tender young thing but 'twill happiness bring  
       If 'tis nurtured and faithfully reared. 
 'Twill shed its bright glow wherever you go  
       O'er all those to whom you're endeared. 
 
 Then touch the heart gently, my pretty Louise, 
       For the Flower of love ever grows.  
 Its perfume will bless like a tender caress 
       Till the twilight of life's at its close. 
 
 In the field of the world where there's work to be done  
       'Twill lighten the burdens you bear. 
 No victory's too great by it to be won  
       And 'twill lessen your heaviest care. 
 So bless the plant's blooming forever and aye  
       As 't grows by the path to the skies. 
 Though dull be the way or dark be the day  
       Where the heart is there happiness lies. 
 
 Then touch the heart lightly, my pretty Louise 
       While the flower of love ever grows.  
 Its perfume will bless like a tender caress 
       Till the twilight of life's at its close. 
 
 
 
 October Chill 
 
 When the fields are sere and golden  
    In the gray October chill. 
 When the leaves begin their turning  
    Red and brown just o'er the hill. 
 Then my thoughts go backward roaming  
    To the years of boyhood time; 
 To the old farm in the gloaming,  
    To the fun of nutting time. 
 
 I can hear the dry leaves rustle,  
    As we waded shoe-deep through, 
 To the thicket where the walnut  
    And the chinquapin trees grew. 
 I can hear the squirrels chatter  
    Angry as we halt their feast, 
 While we gather in the kernels  
    From their prickly burrs released 
 
 How we toiled 'mid twilight's falling  
    Toward our homes with ladened bags. 
 Happy, though our homespun trousers  
    By our climbing turned to rags. 
 Home we'd hasten to the kitchen  
    Where we would our stomachs fill 
 Of the good things mother'd saved us  
    'Gainst October's twilight chill. 
 
 Then we'd count our long day's harvest.  
    Wealth in millions sure had we. 
 And we'd pack them for great feastings  
    When the snow clothed house and tree. 
 Soon would end our childish laughter;  
    All the house be calm and still. 
 We'd be tucked beneath the covers  
    From October's frost and chill. 
 
 
 
 Calling 
 
 Evening shadows falling, falling 
    O'er the meadow and the hill;  
 While the brooklet gently gurgles 
    Its complainings to the mill. 
 
 All the earth night dews are bathing 
    While the shepherd blithely sings,  
 Home his trusting charges leading, 
    Back his yodles echo flings. 
 
 Down the vale the music's ringing.  
    Men and beasts rejoice to hear. 
 Happiness from soul is springing,  
    Tympanating on the ear. 
 
 And there answer bleat and mooing 
    From the cattle, while the air  
 Golden-tinged is filled with cooing 
    Goodnights, gentle pair to pair. 
 
 Life's great Shepherd too is calling 
    All the heart fold home to rest.  
 Calling — calling — calling — calling 
    Toil-worn broken hearts to rest. 
 
 
 
 
 Contentment 
 
 A cot at night; 
    Some work by day. 
 The will to fight  
    My griefs away. 
 
 A peaceful home 
    Where children run;  
 Blaze lighting gloam 
    When day-time's done. 
 
 Someone to love — 
    For whom to pray —  
 Help from above 
    Thro' night and day. 
 
 With lots of health;  
    A soul that sings; 
 A little wealth —  
    I'm king of kings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Autumn 
 
 Winds are whisp'ring,  
 Music lisp'ring,  
 Summer's echoing refrain.  
 Leaves are dying,  
 Trees are sighing,  
 Hark the weird dolorous strain. 
 
 Frost is nipping,  
 Airs are zipping  
 Daylight hours becoming drear.  
 Songbirds going,  
 Shadows growing,  
 Speak the twilight of the year. 
 
 Life is changing,  
 Ever ranging,  
 Just as seasons come and go.  
 Spring trails winter,  
 Melts its glinter,  
 Guiding hope to summer's glow. 
 
 
 
 
 Gone West 
 
 (To the Heroes of the World War) 
 
 Gone West. They follow the sun. 
 Gone West. Their work is done. 
 The minotaur threatening us has been slain. 
 Ease has succeeded the tortures of pain. 
 The white winged Columba is cooing again. 
 Gone West. They follow the sun. 
 Gone West. Their work is done. 
 
Gone West. Their struggles are o'er. 
 Gone West. To come no more. 
 At Verdun — in Flanders — at Luneville they lie. 
 All-lasting, emblazoned their names on the sky, 
 In glorious efforts that never will die. 
 Gone West. Their struggles are o'er. 
 Gone West. To come no more. 
 Gone West. Ahead of their night. 
 Gone West. For what they thought right. 
 God ne'er intended brute forces to rule. 
 Thus was it fixed in Gethsemane cool 
 By Him who made blessed fair Siloam's pool. 
 Gone West. For what they thought right. 
 Gone West. Ahead of their night. 
 Gone West. But not gone in vain. 
 Gone West. Their death 's our gain. 
 Children for ages their mem'ries will bless, 
 And nations will breathe an eternal caress 
 For those who have given their all and no less. 
 Gone West. But never in vain. 
 Gone West. Their death 's our gain. 
 
 
 
 Winds 
 
 Each wind is best, 
 
 The poet sang. 
 Some winds are blest 
 
 Some have a tang. 
 
 Some winds are warm, 
 Some winds are cold. 
 
 With joy or harm 
 To young and old. 
 
 Some winds are soft. 
 
 Some winds are rough, 
 As o'er the croft 
 
 They sweep and buff. 
 
 No matter how 
 The breezes blow. 
 
 Hold straight the plow 
 And till life's row. 
 
 The wind that blows 
 The snow and rain; 
 
 That same wind shows 
 The sun again. 
 
 
 
 
 So heart, be brave 
 
 Along the way. 
 Night winds may rave 
 
 But soon comes day. 
 
 
 
 
 Ice 
 
 The day is drab — drear clouds o'erhead. 
 'Neath snow and ice the earth seems dead. 
 Now comes a win drift in the gray; 
 A sunbeam warms the snow away. 
 
 The soul is dark with gloom — and drear. 
 'Neath cares the world seems drab — and blear. 
 Friendship's soft winds begin to play; 
 Love comes — brings warmth — and heart is gay. 
 
 Ice cannot stay where sunbeams fall. 
 Clouds blow away as windhorns call. 
 Gloom spirits flee and quick depart 
 When friendship warms to love the heart. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Universe 
 
 Count o'er the million leagues from here to yonder star. 
 On then. On to the next count of a million more. 
 Sum up the myriad gleams that light the night; 
 Add too, the orbit where the cold bright moon doth soar. 
 That done, return to earth and with thy mind outline 
 That huge expanse called space; and then out from our Hearse 
 Of changing dust dream out the words — The Universe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bubbles 
 
 Flimsy, filmy, froth-made globes 
 
 From my pipe I blow. 
 Rainbow — tinted elfin robes 
 
 Floating up they go. 
 Made of suds and short breath-puff; 
 
 Puff and suds — no more. 
 Struggling toward the sun — such stuff — 
 
 Bubbles — nothing more. 
 
 Flimsy globes of unshaped thought 
 
 From the mind depart. 
 Whirling spaceward, some, earth caught, 
 
 Never even start. 
 Hope, and wish, and dream in turn 
 
 Float off, blessed or cursed — 
 Float away till soon I learn — 
 
 Bubbles — which all burst. 
 
 Globes of good deeds, one by one. 
 
 From the heart are blown. 
 Float away, burst, duty done. 
 
 Just like bubbles flown. 
 More than bubbles they, howe'er. 
 
 For they leave behind, 
 Some of love — a smile — a tear — 
 
 Wounds of soul to bind. 
 
 
 
 
 Reflection 
 
 Whence have we come, this world and I, 
 
 Minutest details of a vast expanse? 
 Does source of self within us lie? 
 
 Hath unseen hand formed us by chance, 
 And yet the purpose hath withheld? 
 
 Thro' opalescent haze we grope 
 For truth. Yet mind has never spelled 
 
 The word that clears our misty hope. 
 
 Today we stand upon a mound 
 
 Of woes and doubts; of dreams and trys. 
 Hope's bubble swells, then falls aground. 
 
 Life's passing's naught but wants and whys. 
 Behind lie heaped slags of regret 
 
 Whose peaks are lost in ages dead. 
 Who is the power to pierce the net 
 
 Fine screened, that veils the dark ahead? 
 
 We dream — and think — then dream again. 
 
 Lo! while we're dreaming, puff! we're gone. 
 Our mortal ties are left — our pain — 
 
 Back to its dust-like self alone, 
 All that is earthen, back it goes. 
 
 But whence that which we call a soul; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That link immortal, ah, who knows? 
 Whose magic can the shade uproU? 
 
 Tho' science delve back deep in Time, 
 
 Find footsteps where the Ages tread, 
 She cannot trace the path sublime 
 
 That runs between the quick and dead. 
 So far it goes and then it ends. 
 
 All mem'ry's markings show a grave. 
 Who's Master of the brew that blends 
 
 Our drink ? — but one — The one who gave. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Apple Blossom Time 
 
 Crickets bold are chanting 
 
 'Neath yon fragrant hedge; 
 Bullfrogs join the chorus 
 
 Near the millpond's edge. 
 Lad and lass are dreaming, 
 
 Humming springtime's rhyme; 
 Bees' wings drone their music — 
 
 Apple blossom time. 
 
 Brooklet in the meadow 
 
 Purls its way along, 
 Onward seaward rippling. 
 
 To its kindred throng. 
 Life and love are leaping 
 
 Tripping to hope's chime. 
 Every day adds joy to — 
 
 Apple blossom time. 
 
 Bobolink is chirping, 
 
 Robin's hopping by; 
 Wind-sprites warm are painting 
 
 Blue-green on the rye. 
 Humid earth sighs rising 
 
 Perfume sage and thyme; 
 Cheer up! Summer's trailing — 
 
 Apple blossom time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Why Send Me Flowers? 
 
 Why send me flowers when I'm gone; 
 
 When tongue is mute and lip is still; 
 When all that's mortal lies alone 
 
 Nor cares, tho' rooms their fragrance fill? 
 
 Why deck my grave with wreath today; 
 
 Shed tears and stand with mournful mien 
 O'er weakly clinging dust and clay 
 
 That's soon dissolved and no more's seen? 
 
 Love me a little while I'm here, 
 
 While lips may smile and heart can speak. 
 For smiles life's choicest flowers rear. 
 
 They flourish best on love's high peak. 
 
 Far better 'twere if you could feel 
 
 When at my head you place a stone, 
 
 That we'd known friendship rich and real 
 And keep on smiling though I'm gone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory 
 
 Oh, Memory, fond friend of mine! 
 
 Thou boon companion of my soul! 
 How can I thank thee for the aid 
 
 Thou'st gi'en me in my gloomy goal. 
 What would my world without thee be? 
 
 Just one drab blurr of toil and pain. 
 But you, dear friend, whatever my mood 
 
 Beguile my hours in fancy's train. 
 
 Whene'er the storms of life overtake, 
 
 To rescue me thou art at hand. 
 And from the castles of the past 
 
 Come joyous hosts; bright sunshine's band. 
 Sometimes they call to childhood's days. 
 
 We romp again through meadows green. 
 A smile sets all my heart aglow 
 
 As I live o'er scene after scene. 
 
 The playmates of those days are gone 
 To distant fields where duties call. 
 
 Yet each has left an impress fond 
 
 To brighten up my dwelling's wall. 
 
 So great the magic of thy wand 
 
 That when it waves time all but dies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There is no distance in thy world 
 
 So quick thy wing, Oh Mem'ry, flies. 
 
 Light once again love's young days' screen. 
 
 When life was one long, pleasant dream. 
 Hold to that view a moment, friend, 
 
 Life flashes there its brightest beam. 
 Yon rosy cheek and laughing eye; 
 
 Who knew that fate wrought them for me? 
 Sweet face that sweeter grew with years 
 
 Till death her patient soul set free. 
 
 Show next that scene of homey things, 
 
 So real they seem I cannot miss 
 Companionship that hovers till 
 
 I'm sure I feel a shadow kiss. 
 I hear a childish prattle now; 
 
 Now someone clambers to my knee. 
 I can't but smile they seem so near — 
 
 Reach out to clasp them — cannot see. 
 
 Thus Memory, sweet friend of mine. 
 
 Thou art companion to my soul. 
 How can I thank thee for the aid 
 
 Thou'st gi'en me in my gloomy goal. 
 What would my world without thee be? 
 
 Just one drab blurr of toil and pain. 
 But you, dear friend, whate'er my mood 
 
 Bring witching hours — and fancy's train 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My Mother's Gold Ring 
 
 I've one little trinket more valued than life. 
 
 It's kept me from sorrow and helped me through 
 
 strife. 
 Far dearer than riches is this little thing, 
 A Heaven-welded circlet, my mother's gold ring. 
 
 'Tis nothing that's ornate; a plain little band 
 
 With, here and there, scratches where toil wore her 
 
 hand. 
 Each mark means a heartache; or suffering's sting 
 Impressed for her children on mother's gold ring. 
 
 The pictures it conjures from childhood's bright day 
 Are love lighted solaces — ever they stay. 
 Though humble my fortune I still am a king. 
 With, tear-christened roundlet — my mother's gold 
 ring. 
 
 Wherever I've wandered that ring, like a prayer, 
 Has spread its protection, for Mother was there. 
 No other could charm or such magic could bring 
 As, much treasured cycloid — my mother's gold ring. 
 
 Old age is fast creeping; my step's getting slow; 
 And up o'er my temples show markings of snow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 'Mid time and his battles my soul e'er will sing 
 
 Of — love bonded bandlet — my mother's gold ring. 
 
 Dear sweet face, Oh Mother! How often I miss 
 Your hand's soothing comfort; your heart cheering 
 
 kiss. 
 Though long since departed fond mem'ries will cling, 
 'Till death bids me lay aside mother's gold ring. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Commoners 
 
 There's a common end for common clay, 
 
 And an end for you and me. 
 Mayhap 'tis here; it may be there; 
 
 Or aye, o'er yonder lea. 
 It matters not if high or low. 
 
 When ends the path you plod. 
 Thy form shall rest, the poor, the best, 
 
 Just six feet 'neath the sod. 
 
 Man grows in pride as trails divide 
 
 A whit, from common lot; 
 But finds at last his form is cast 
 
 In humble little plot. 
 The fate is mine. It too is thine. 
 
 Time swings the fatal rod. 
 And soon — too soon, on vale or dune 
 
 We rest beneath the sod. 
 
 Who cares if peasant or if prince 
 
 May slumber by his side; 
 While from the cell, where night will dwell, 
 
 Each shallow walls divide? 
 Ambitions, hopes, and woes and pains, 
 
 Beset you as you plod. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But all forsake you in your home 
 Short six feet 'neath the sod. 
 
 Power to rise within each lies, 
 
 Above our common clay; 
 Where we abide on fortune's tide 
 
 Till on some final day, 
 Earth's clinging arm robs of all charm 
 
 Embracing kindred clod. 
 With one brief sigh we'll mould'ring lie 
 
 Just six feet 'neath the sod. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To a Skull 
 
 Ghastly, ghoulish, grinning skull, 
 
 Toothless, eyeless, hollow, dull, 
 
 Why your smirk and empty smile 
 
 As the hours away you while? 
 
 Has the earth become such bore 
 
 That it pleases nevermore? 
 
 Whence your joy through sun and rain? 
 
 Is 't because of loss of pain? 
 
 Have you learned what men learn not 
 
 That earth's substance turns to rot? 
 
 After learning now you scan 
 
 Vain endeavors man by man? 
 
 Do you mind that you as they 
 
 Once was held by mystic sway; 
 
 Dreamed and struggled, hoped and prayed. 
 
 Lolled and with the minutes played? 
 
 Sighed for honors; battles planned; 
 
 Sipped of cups that wisdom banned 
 But would please the weak frail flesh; 
 Suffered, fell, 'rose, struggled fresh? 
 Now that you are but a skull 
 Glimpse you life as life is, full 
 Of beauties that we miss 
 Till time withers with his kiss? 
 Do you laugh in cynic vein 
 
 Since you cannot try again? 
 And you know that we, like you, 
 Will too late our failings rue? 
 Tell me, ghoulish, grinning skull 
 What deep broodings, o'er you mull? 
 Tell me why you smirk and smile 
 Ere I pass life's sunset stile. 
 On My Way Home 
 
 On my way home from irksome toil of day, 
 
 When end the bickerings in trade's busy mart. 
 After the carping strife for what's called pay, 
 
 My thoughts turn hungrily to home and heart. 
 I leave behind me frantic, frenzied, fighting fiends. 
 
 Wild with the hatred greed and hell-born envy 
 stir. 
 Forget the false smile which to me but means 
 
 A conscience blunted with a golden blurr. 
 
 I hurry home and leave me far behind 
 
 Their cursings, bowlings, shouts and groans. 
 And in the quiet peace of home I find 
 
 Sweet solace for the mem'ries, echoed moans. 
 I learn again, and from the lessons take 
 
 The strength that sends me back into the fray; 
 Not rich is he who most of money makes 
 
 Mere grabbing heaped-up wealth will never pay. 
 
 On my way home from earth to better land 
 
 What though my feet be heavy, body torn and 
 grimed ? 
 I know I'm on my way to loving band 
 
 Whose arms reach out and ease the way I 
 climbed. 
 On my way home from wearing toil each day 
 
 My spirit soars though slow my feet still plod. 
 
 Though earth be full of bitter strife, my way 
 
 Leads on through love from men straight unto 
 God. 
 A Southern Love Song 
 
 Dogwoods all a-bloom, 
 
 Perfume earth's big room, 
 White full moon is gliding o'er the sky serene. 
 
 Quiet reigns about, 
 
 In the house and out, 
 Hoot owl in the hollow mopes with solemn mien. 
 
 Birds have gone to rest. 
 
 In each tree-top nest. 
 Cotton fields a-shimmer flash forth silver green. 
 
 O'er the wild cane brake. 
 
 Whip-poor-wills awake. 
 And they speak in tender voicings, Heart, of You. 
 
 Answering my call. 
 
 Through the leafy hall. 
 Telling how I'm waiting for your tripping. Sue. 
 
 All the world is glad. 
 
 Just because I'm mad. 
 Sense bereft am I through my great love for you. 
 
 Night is all a-smile, 
 Happy all the while. 
 That is why my heart so filled with song o'erflows. 
 I have tarried long. 
 Lilting here my song. 
 And I'll ever waiting be till life's step slows. 
 Come to me my girl, 
 Precious more than pearl, 
 
 I'll be waiting for you where the grapevine grows. 
 
 How my heart doth yearn, 
 
 And with anguish bum, 
 Hungry for sweet pains awaked with your embrace. 
 
 Starward goes my cry. 
 
 Echo hears my sigh. 
 Heaven itself its pity at my plight shows trace. 
 
 Parson waits to wed. 
 
 Soon the nuptials said. 
 I've a rose-clad cottage reared for you to grace. 
 Speculation 
 
 I wonder why my heart to you keeps backward 
 turning. 
 You whom I vowed to bar from mem'ry's hall. 
 I wonder why my soul's shrine still shows deep a 
 yearning 
 While shadows lengthen from my heart's home 
 wall. 
 I wonder why I watch the sunset slowly fading; 
 
 Grow more forlorn as night shades lay their dew. 
 I wonder why the ghosts of yesterdays parading 
 All beckon till my heart goes back to you? 
 
 You crushed the love that I so free, unbidden, offered. 
 
 And share with others what I so much crave. 
 You turned to false friends, spurning what I prof- 
 fered, 
 
 The while they sipped the wine of life you gave. 
 The years are drifting by but they can never carry 
 
 Away my ken of life's most pleasant ways. 
 We pluck the rose — it dies — yet still will tarry 
 
 The perfume while the leaf with windpuff plays. 
 
 Those other days ! — those days when you were always 
 tender. 
 How hard I've tried to blot from mind the pain. 
 Strive how I will I fail yet cannot quite surrender 
 Myself to gloom; but wish those days again. 
 
 Perhaps it was the hope that sometime you'd re- 
 member 
 A soul that never has been aught but true. 
 
 I know that hope is dead — a cooling, ashen ember — 
 And yet my love keeps turning back to you. 
 
 At morn the bees fly straight to honeyed flowers. 
 
 The birds seek out their cosy nests at night. 
 Though Pluto's darkness grip the starless hours, 
 
 Aurora binds the sun god's car to night. 
 A leaking vessel never can stay filled to brimming. 
 
 An empty heart will ever long and sigh. 
 That's why my thoughts like swallows home are skim- 
 ming 
 
 Back to the past. Once born love cannot die. 
 The Potter and His Ware 
 
 I watched a potter at his work today 
 Amid his varied shapes of earth and clay. 
 Some were completed — ready for the mart, 
 While some showed yet no sign or touch of art. 
 The potter, old and wrinkle-skinned, by time 
 While toiling hummed, sharp-voiced this rhyme. 
 'Tis not the glaze that makes the jar, 
 
 Nor strands of thread the man. 
 Life's best and poorest vessels are 
 
 Told by the way they pan. 
 
 Then from a heap of fine ground powdered earth 
 He scooped about a Grecian drachma's worth. 
 Into a mixing mill the stuff he threw 
 And added just a drop of liquid blue. 
 From this he shaped a wondrous brilliant jar 
 Whose beauty rivalled sky's most lustrous star. 
 
 'Tis not the glaze that makes the jar, 
 Nor strands of thread the man. 
 
 Life's best and poorest vessels are 
 Told by the way they pan. 
 
 Thus many bits of odd-tinged ware he shaped 
 And fashioned as of musty earth he scraped. 
 I marvelled that each bowl did so much seem 
 To differ from its fellow in its gleam. 
 And thought how wondrous was the skill that could 
 Remake of dust such ware, so odd, so good. 
 'Tis not the glaze that makes the jar. 
 
 Nor strands of thread the man. 
 Life's best and poorest vessels are 
 Told by the way they pan. 
 
 The Master Potter, too, of clay hath made 
 Earth bowls of every varied hue and shade. 
 Into them all some of his breath he sent 
 Then left them in the sun for warp and bent. 
 Till free of crudeness each is burned and dry 
 And ready for eternal shelves on high. 
 
 'Tis not the glaze that makes the jar. 
 Nor strands of thread the man. 
 
 Life's best and poorest vessels are 
 Told by the way they pan. 
 Enteuthen Exelaunei 
 
 As dancing dawn had warned me of the sun, 
 
 Fast rising from his crimson conch of rest, 
 His blazing war car, its diurnal run 
 
 Began, and set to flames the ocean's crest. 
 A valley at my feet still bathed in dew. 
 
 Began to clear of mists and show a path, 
 Which wound 'mid fields, and pleasant meadows 
 through ; 
 
 (Trail of the Seeker, to Life's Aftermath). 
 With eager feet I would be on my way, 
 
 Yon hill to reach before the call of noon, 
 When from beneath me cried a voice to say, 
 
 "Hold, Comrade, do not leave me thus so soon. 
 A-while you slept I cradled you; kept watch; 
 
 And warmed the narrow berth in which you lay. 
 So 'grudge me not an hour. No record splotch 
 
 Will mark you at the end of this your day. 
 Here have I lain through shifts of sun and snow. 
 
 Unheeded by my kindred passing by. 
 My whispered plea up with the wind I blow 
 
 Yet in their rush but few have heard my cry. 
 Why all their hurry as they play the Game? 
 
 Soon they'll be gained in the rolling years. 
 I too was once as they — I was the same — 
 
 Yet here I lie unfettered by their fears. 
 They all forget that lordly kings and queens 
 
 Have passed this way with poorly peasant kind. 
 
 All start the same; have varying betweens; 
 
 But dust is dust when all is done, they find. 
 
 We are but bits of clod tossed in a tray, 
 
 By Life's Great Gleaner of the starry world. 
 Some, to the surface, with the motion stray. 
 
 Rush and touch elbows as in brack they're whirled. 
 With friendly clasp of hand they journey on 
 
 Forced by the Motion and the Swing of things. 
 Time and the motion rend them one from one, 
 
 With bitter pangs at parting; bitter stings. 
 Then why the crowding? Why the hates and greeds? 
 
 The lust for gold, or fame, or pomp, or power? 
 Each but through endless torments hastens, speeds; 
 
 All doomed to be forsaken in the Hour. 
 
 But one day's sun or so and Beauty's lips 
 
 Which once upset a monarch and his crown. 
 Their smiling gone, up to the sun there slips 
 
 A rose, perhaps — to bloom and sigh full grown. 
 Her tresses, once so envied of all maids 
 
 Will be but grass of very greenest green. 
 While through her dainty digits interbraids 
 
 The Jasmine's trailing tendrils all unseen. 
 The winds will whisper songs her tongue did sing 
 
 And yet, unheard, by mortals, this her lute. 
 The swaying trees, the rhythm of her toes will swing 
 
 Whose waving leaves will talk yet she'll be mute. 
 
 Why all the pride of birth, or name, or race? 
 
 The plutocrat is no whit more than I. 
 What though his clay be laid in marble place? 
 
 Time's playful breath will blow it high and dry. 
 They miss the master why of all this life; 
 
 Choose empty bubbles that too soon will burst; 
 Stir up a lot of endless, useless strife 
 
 And struggle on more cursed than the first. 
 The Soul it is that makes of man a man. 
 
 Not clay, nor tint of mixed grime and sand. 
 The soul and clay must both the Outlook scan 
 
 If they would serve the purpose for them 
 planned. 
 That which has chief est worth they all forget 
 
 Though costing least in toil or dulling pain. 
 How few have mastered lessons for them set! 
 
 Too late they learn, and then would try again. 
 Love is the great All Holy sacred word 
 
 That moves the Universe about, and sends 
 Its meaning down Life's way almost unheard — 
 
 Persistent, pleading strain that never ends. 
 They chase the rainbow for the pot of gold, 
 
 And trample treasures under foot, by far 
 More precious than mere crumbling dross that's cold; 
 
 Much closer to their grasp than Fame, their star. 
 The world, the soul so little knows; the heart 
 
 So little understands. Ingratitude 
 To wax in men needs but a little start. 
 
 Fame plods behind the Reaper. Such her mood. 
 'Tis only when you've passed the Way along 
 
 That mortals find their path leads through your 
 street. 
 
 Then only do they ken the meaning of your song 
 And lay belated tribute at your feet. 
 
 So, ere you leave the distant hill to mount 
 
 Fill full your heart with love and smiling cheer. 
 Live so that hosts you can your neighbors count 
 
 And bring a happy ending to your year. 
 Hold not the frothy riches of this earth 
 
 More valued than the soul and inner things. 
 Each gift of friendship more than brings its worth 
 
 And in the Judgment up the balance swings. 
 Love Fellowman. That is the big command. 
 
 And followed leads straight on to Paradise. 
 Learn thou to know the Gleaner's chief demand 
 
 And on thy journey heed to my advice. 
 Be off. The world in its impatience waits 
 
 To test the mold and weapon in you cast. 
 Live Now; with eyes on Yonder swinging gates, 
 
 Nor cling too close to footprints of the Past. 
 Drink deep the draught, though bitter sweet, of life. 
 
 By drinking deeply only can you view the sky. 
 Then, when you've breasted Heaven and Hell in strife 
 
 Come back, oh Comrade, back to Earth and die. 
 'Tis in such death that you will live again. 
 
 For then it shall be right for you to know, 
 The Master Gleaner's Purpose ne'er is vain. 
 
 So ends my talk. Your part calls to the Show." 
 From Day to Day 
 
 Sometimes it's dark; sometimes it's bright. 
 Sometimes it's wrong — bye'n bye it's right. 
 Now 'tis a joy day — now full of pain. 
 Days when the hard luck pours like the rain. 
 
 Days full of true love; days full of hate. 
 Times when there's bitterest wailing at fate. 
 Days when there's hunger — days when there's food. 
 Sometimes there ne'er seems anything good. 
 
 Some days the wind's warm ; some days it's cold. 
 Some days I'm struggling eager and bold. 
 Sometimes for bruises there seems no balm, 
 Times when my soul craves comfort and calm. 
 
 Sometimes the heart's hills seem hard to climb. 
 Life's lane's so thorny lames every limb. 
 Pathways are so rough feet can't but drag. 
 All that we gather — crumbs and a rag. 
 
 Hours full of longing, soul full of dreams. 
 Sometimes no light on life's strandway gleams. 
 Sometimes a heartache, sometimes a sigh; 
 Seems like the world's gone out of the sky. 
 Come days of gladness or days of woe 
 Each soul from God thro' Gehenna must go. 
 We live all our days out as willed by fate. 
 'Tis thus we pass thro' our imperfect state. 
 
 Let's take the bitterness, also the sweet; 
 From no misfortune ever retreat 
 Unto each day's task all might address. 
 Come good or ill days all come to bless. 
 
 78] 
 A Dream 
 
 I looked into the diamond studded dome of night 
 And glimpsed a fleeting shadow form — a blurr. 
 The vision vanished just as quickly from my sight 
 Adown the paths on which God's universes whirr. 
 My puny man-length arms reached out but could not 
 
 clasp 
 The phantom which my soul cried out to gain. 
 I groped amid the gleams and bravely sought to 
 
 grasp 
 That hazy misty form but only felt a pain. 
 
 Again I tried and failed then heart grew sad and sore. 
 Strive how I would 'twas ever where I could not reach. 
 The tears that failure brings in bitterness did pour 
 Nor could they heal the wound deep disappointment's 
 
 breach. 
 Then cross the sky there flickered just a shaft of light 
 That gave my soul a hope — Oh, blessed beam. 
 Straight 'midst the stars it went and pierced the night. 
 It showed my phantom's hopes were but an empty 
 dream. 
 
 I turned to earth, soul chastened yet not cured 
 Of longing unfulfilled and wish that would not die. 
 I saw about me kindred broken shapes allured 
 Whose souls could not but echo heart born cry. 
 In min'st'ring unto them my soul pain dropped be- 
 hind 
 And in its stead there showed the dawning's gleam. 
 I found life's solace not where longing sought to 
 
 find- 
 In loving others brightness came — I found my dream. 
 
 180J 
 Life's Way 
 
 A little joy without alloy — 
 
 Some hope — some disappointment. 
 
 A futile wail at some annoy, 
 
 A dip in life's anointment. 
 
 One effort made to swing the blade 
 
 And reap from earth's brief planting; 
 
 A groan of pain o'er little gain 
 
 Then night — our hopes recanting. 
 
 A little haste 'midst heaps of waste; 
 
 One hour's harsh drill receiving. 
 
 A stifled cry and then a sigh 
 
 While friends behind are grieving, 
 
 A little love — some right — some wrong 
 
 Each of himself is giving. 
 
 Some tears — some smiles — from weak and strong. 
 
 All summed up — that is living. 
 
 Housecleaning 
 
 I cleaned my house one day last spring, 
 Of dust and dirt collected in the year; 
 Then in yard corner did the rubbish fling, 
 Forgotten till foul odors of decay did rear 
 And smite my nostrils with their breath. 
 
 A few days on I sought with rake to move 
 The stenchpile lest disease it spread. 
 When lo! upon the heap, from topmost groove, 
 A tall white-blooming lily raised its head. — 
 Distasteful once what now was sweet. 
 
 Out from our house we cast the wrecks 
 
 Of life, distorted toys of fate. 
 
 We cannot see that beauty decks 
 
 The soul which still 's untouched by hate. 
 
 And perfumes at the call of love.

 INTRODUCTION. 
 
     It is the very great pleasure of the writer to introduce to the poetical world Misses Ada Tress Peters, and Ethel Pauline Peters the only two daughters of Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Peters, of Beckley, West Virginia. 
     These young ladies will be known to the poetical world as "The Peters Sisters." 
      Always seen together, and always do ing nearly the same thing at the same time, and seldom, if ever talking about any subject, unless it be poetical, is one of the peculiar features of these two young ladies. 
      Miss Ada Tess is eighteen years of age while Miss Ethel Pauline is only seventeen years; though the younger, yet the elder in the poetical world, having start ed poetry writing while not yet nine years of age, and while confined to bed in a hospital. Miss Ada started to write three years later, and ever since that time each of the girls has been from time to time placing before the public some work on poetry. 
     The Peters Sisters have had very limited education. Each of them spent one and one half years in high school at Institute. West Virginia, under Prof. Byrd Prillerman. 
 
                                                       Courteously Yours, 
                                                                   WM. F. DENNY. 
* * *  
      The first poem written by Miss Ethel Pauline Peters while in Hospital and not yet nine years of age. 
 
 When I get an old lady, 
      I tell you what I'll do, 
 I'll patch my apron, make my dress 
      And hoe the garden too. 
 
     The first poem written by Miss Ada Peters. 
 
 Little birds up so high, 
 Who has taught you how to fly. 
      How to sing and how to play, 
      All the hot summer day? 
 God has taught us how to sing, 
 Early in the lovely spring, 
      He hath taught us how to play, 
      In his own glorious way.

 PEEFACE. 
  
     The sole intention of the Authors in writing these poems is to show the Negro's loyalty to the Stars and Stripes, in the war with Germany; and to show the need of unity of all men in the fight for democracy. 
                                                             The Authors.

 Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters. 
 
 OUR WAR WITH GERMANY. 
 
 I. 
 
 America and her Allies are now engaged 
      In a war that freedom might live, 
 That all nations may not be enslaved 
      Giving as all True Americans would give 
 Fighting lest Germany's Kaiser should spread 
      The spirit of feudalism over the earth, 
 That the Sons of Liberty may not be led 
      Captives from the land of their birth. 
 
 II. 
 
 While foreign field were strewn with dead 
      With folded arms we merely looked on 
 'Till the wronged people believed and said 
      "They are gamblers, in search of coin." 
 We became apoligist for our neutriality 
      While an uncivilized war waged on 
 Devoid of all principle and morality 
      Urged on by brutes in human form. 
 
III. 
 
 When the country of Belgium was invaded 
      And It's inhabitants tortured and slain 
 When other defenseless towns were raided 
      And mines in neutral waters were lain 
 When the smoldering ruins of France we saw 
      The home of the world's greatest arts 
 Then Humanity forced us into this war 
      For America too, must do her part. 
 
 IV. 
 
 The Imperial German Government smiled 
      When the Sussex, and Lusitania went down 
 Unwarningly murdering American lives 
      While on peaceful missions bound 
 Should not this wicked and hideous crime 
      That sent our friends to watery graves 
 Help more close our hearts to bind 
      And strengthen us on our rugged way? 
 
 V. 
 
 Some of History's cherished monuments 
      Have wantonly and maliciously been destroyed 
 While plots that outrage man's common sense 
      By German Seditionist have been em  ployed. 
 Like cowards they secretly tried to bribe 
      Our friend and neighbor country Mexico, 
 Those same conspirators and spies 
      Are sneakishly lurking within our doors. 
 
 VI. 
 
 Have not their deadly bombs been dropped 
      In Hospitals of our wounded boys? 
 Killing helpless ones upon their cots 
      Playing with American lives as with toys 
 With tear dim eyes we have heard,
      Women and children victims crying for help 
 While these destructive missiles are hurled 
      Upon them in the jaws of death. 
 
 VII. 
 
 If the policy National Necessity is sustained 
      Treaty Obligation '11 be buried in the past 
 For the royal castle will again reign 
      Oe'r the common people's village at last 
 Thus the covenants that have been kept 
      As a tie of friendship that binds 
 Is forgotten in Germany's World Conquest 
      A vile insult to all man-kind. 
 
 VIII. 
 Boys you're fighting to preserve American Rights 
      To proteat the homes of the brave. 
 And we're with you in this fight 
      Till Autocracy lies within her grave 
 The Red, White and Blue, will be borne 
      As a true emblem of justice to all 
 For it gives the weary traveler a home 
      Then how could such a government fall? 
 
 IX. 
 
 We are struggling in a Common Cause 
      With only one purpose in our hearts 
 And that purpose is freedom for all 
      Made sacred by the blood of patriots 
 Young men how proud you must feel 
      To know you're defending a Noble Cause 
 That your life you owe to Liberty 
      To your countrymen and to your God. 
X. 
 We see your bosom swells with pride 
      With love for the mother that gave 
 Her flesh, her blood, her only pride,
      That the Star Spangled Bannner, might wave 
 We know again the respect you had 
 When your Dear Old Father firmly said, 
 "Be another George Washington, my lad 
 And sleep in an honored Martyr's grave." 
 
 XI. 
 
 When some of you beyond the clouds 
      With iron nerves are fighting at dizzy heights, 
 And on earth the cannon's roaring loud 
      Proclaims your comrades are in the fight
 While the brave boys on the briny deep 
      Are sailing on blood-stained waves 
 But in the air on land or sea 
      You're fighting that Old Glory, might wave. 
 
 XII. 
 
 When you're in "No Man's Land." 
      Far from home annd friends you adore 
 Seek shelter in the hollow of God's hand, 
      'Till the tempest of war is oe'r, 
 "O God, may our brave boys return, 
      Bearing Freedom's Flag from over there 
 While men repenting to Thee shall turn 
      And Peace and Democracy reigns everywhere! 
* * * 
 
 A FATHER OF INSPIRATION. 
 (Dedicated to President Byrd Prillerman) 
 There are many in every nation 
      That scorn those in the mire, 
 But few are fathers of inspiration 
      Like the President of W. V. I. 
 
 II. 
 
 The black Leader of the free 
      Bade me strive to be the best 
 But Honorable Byrd Prillerman helped me  
      To travel the road to success. 
 
 III. 
 
 Unlike those who seek to charm 
      The world with their selfish aims 
 He's guarding Ethiopia on the farm 
      For the good that might be gained. 
 
 IV. 
 
 West Virginia has given most 
      Of her sons to liberty 
 But she shall never boast 
      Of a Nobler Teacher than he. 
V.
 For when peaceful Uncle Sam 
      Was troubled by Belgium's cry 
 Ready to fight in foreign lands 
      Were those trained at W. V. I. 
 
 VI. 
 
 So could a race of civilization 
      Own a greater man than he 
 A Father of Inspiration 
      And a leader of people free. 
 
 VII. 
 
 May God grant when our President 
      Has crossed the swelling tide 
 That his deeds be living monuments 
      To those whom he inspired. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 And may Ethiopia profit by 
      The standard he hath placed 
 And sons of W. V. C. I. 
     Be a credit to our race. 
                     —By Ethel Pauline Peters. 
      God bless you, I share your thought, your President is indeed an able and noble man. Long may he live.

 ORIGINAL POEM. 
 UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES. 
 (By E. P. Peters.) 
 
 April the sixth, Ninteen and seventeen, 
 Under the stars and stripes. 
 We were forcibly drawn 
 In a war for our rights. 
 We would be neutral no longer,
 And hear humanity's plea, 
 Nor behold our vessels unwarningly sunk 
 By submarines at sea. 
 Freedom shall ever be 
 In the country where Glory waves, 
 And the golden land of Lafayette 
 Shall not be enslaved. 
 Boys make Kaiser's poison gas  
      Unnable to kill American's power. 
 Feudalism shall not spread 
 Oe'r this free country of ours. 
 We'll help you show Germany's rulers 
 Feudalism can not defend, 
 Cultured civilized people, nor the 
 Rights of free born men. 
 Rulers that disregard treaties 
 And cause bloody wars in laud 
 Shall never reign on libertys soil 
 To execute their plans. 
 Germany's strong aviation corps 
 Like winged birds sail the air 
 Dropping 'missies, taking innocent lives 
 In her brutish warfare. 
 She for many years prepared 
 Her selfishness to unfurl  
 With out warning or reason, to
 Conquer and rule the world. 
 O, God help us to fight 
 For Democracy on foreign strands 
 That we might be delivered from 
 Our enemies wicked hands. 
 By spreading sedition through states 
 Kaiser struck patriotism a blow 
 Pretending to be our friend. 
 Intriguing with Japan and Mexico. 
 Our enemie's destructive pretense 
 On its deathly mission scuds 
 While America was being raided 
 With spies of German blood. 
 Her schemes can not make 
 Enemies of people that gave 
 Their prayers, lives, and all 
 That Old Glory might wave. 
 
 Victory by Germans would mean 
 Enslavement to the human race, 
 While once fair fields 
 Of France and ours lay waste. 
 America's cities would not stand 
 As homes of the free. 
 New York would lose her friend 
 The statue of liberty. 
 The dear flag would be destroyed 
 By a savage race, 
 And the richness of our country 
 Would be the Kaiser's estate. 
 
 But to win this war, we 
 Can not all take arms 
 Some must help Uncle Sam's boys 
 By buying Liberty Bonds. 
 Send lots of letters 
 For joy in them they'll find. 
 Save food for our boys 
 In France on firing lines. 
 Encourage them in camp 
 And they'll be proud to go 
 To fight for freedom, as 
 Their fathers fought years ago. 
 
 Democracy long hath reigned 
 In the land of the brave. 
 The cherished banner of Betsy Ross 
 Long o'er us hath waved. 
 T'was providence that directed 
 Us in the path of right. 
 Enabled us to live peacefully 
 In war helped us to fight. 
 Gave us Washington, Father of 
 Our country to help defend 
 The rights and freedom 
 Of his rising fellow men. 
 
 All in self defense boys 
 Your part you must play 
 Just as your friends are 
 Doing, on French soil today. 
 We are waiting and praying, 
 For you patriots and braves 
 To bring the glad news back 
 From Autocracy we're saved. 
 While in service, if your 
 Tasks seem hard to do, 
 Cheerfully do your best boys 
 For the red, white and blue.

 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters) 
 BOYS ON TO FRANCE. 
 
 Sons of America, do you not hear 
      The roaring of Germany's guns? 
 Get up and be busy; war is near 
      We must face Kaiser Wilhelm. 
 Just as our fore-fathers years ago 
      Against the Red Coats, made their stand 
 So to France, you must go 
      And protect the honor of our Native Land. 
 
 II. 
 
 If God's on our side, we need not fear 
      For His Cause, has always won 
 Fight on though the price seems dear 
      Push forward, 'till the race is run. 
 Mothers you too, must do your part 
      In the impending strife 
 Clasp not the son to your heart 
      But give him to the Cause of Right. 
 
 III. 
 
 Show him you're willing to give 
      All in life you possess 
 Giving that Freedom might live. 
      And mothers they'll do the rest. 
 For their souls will then swell 
      With that Holy Divine Strength 
 That only Americans have felt 
      As from it's Fountain they drink. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Black Boys, Uncle Sam is calling you too, 
      Calling you men of African Birth 
 Will you to America be true? 
      And in the struggle prove your worth? 
 Boys, you may think it unfair to fight 
      That it's hard to have a patriotic zeal 
 For a country that denies us our rights 
      That pushes us back though we're free. 
 V. 
 But do good for evil we've learned 
      In the Book of Ever-lasting life 
 That in Heaven, a home, we might earn 
      Where Blessed Peace reigns and not strife. 
 Old Glory, you triumphantly wave 
      O'er the Land of the Free 
 Yet from the mobs we're not saved 
      To whom, for refuge must we flee? 
 
 VI. 
 
 Is it right hotheaded men should take 
      The law of the land in their hands? 
 Can innocence be proved at a burning stake? 
      No, then why not give us a chance? 
 But boys of African Blood be true 
      Ready and willing the Cause to defend 
 Then may the Red, White and Blue 
      Forget color and recognize men. 
 
 VII. 
 
 Dear Flag, we've proved ourselves Masters of Art 
      Great inventions to the world we've 
 Yet in the government we take no part
      Then why are we to war driven?
 If in jim crow cars we must stay 
      Too illiterate to ride with the whites 
 Are we to sleep in a soldiers grave 
      Or, illiterate stand by your side and fight?
 VIII. 
 
 Columbia, when on the battlefield 
      Our soldiers, dying whisper, "I thirst" 
 Let this woman attend to their needs 
      She's a dark skin, Red Cross Nurse 
 Give us the chance and we'll show 
      The skill and bravery of the fairer-sex 
 How we'll face the enemy's blow 
      Though we know the stand means death. 
 
 IX. 
 
 O, God, could a stronger race do more 
      For American Freedom to gain 
 Than my people who bore 
      The curse of slavery's chains 
 When across the waters you're borne 
      Boys, to the Land of Some-where 
 You're defending Our Homes 
      And "God Bless you," is our prayer. 
X. 
 Some day the war'll be o'er 
      In triumph Old Glory'll be borne  
 Back to American shores 
      Back to Home, Sweet Home 
 '"Till then boys, we bid you adieu 
      Yet in the government we take no part
 Then why are we to war driven? 
      Each one of you play well the game 
 And may God be with you 
      'Till we all meet again.

 OLD GLORY'S RECOGNITION. 
 (By E. P. Peters.) 
 
 Prom the cotton fields or Georgia, 
      Where our grand parents were slaves, 
 Comes a freedom we can welcome, 
      When the flag of justice waves; 
 While o'er the land is floating 
      The Red, White, and Blue, 
 The black boys are rising 
      To the old flag they'll be true, 
 They are willing to die for Liberty, 
      They hate the cursed revenge. 
 For Old Glory's crushing prejudice. 
      And recognizing her slaves' freed men. 
 We have sought for knowledge 
      From the great that we have found, 
 And are earnestly striving to regain. 
      Our lose heritage of renown. 
 It was not slavery's cruelties 
      That made black patriots in the land, 
 But the fifty years of progress 
      And the rights we did demand. 
 The black brains that were trampled 
      Now helping hands will lend, 
 For Old Glory's crushing prejudice, 
      And recognizing her slave freed men. 
 
Clouds of difficulties rose 
      When four million the Old Flag faced, 
 But with civilization's birth 
      The black people of earth, 
 Have once more become a race. 
      Hewers of wood and drawers of water. 
 For many years we've been; 
      But now with education's light, 
 We are a people again. 
      Boys remember that we are rising, 
 In a country that we'll befriend, 
      For Old Glory's crushing prejudice, 
 And recognizing slave freed men. 
 
We are a patriotic people;
     We're proud to see the colors wave, 
 That signifies justice to all, 
      In a free land of the brave; 
 That acknowledges there is black brain; 
      For God to all deals fair, 
 And Uncle Sam is growing greater, 
      For liberty we too can share. 
 We are steadily growing to success, 
      And helping all men to ascend, 
 While Old Glory's crushing prejudice 
      And recognizing slave freed men. 
 
 Old Glory, 'twas fifty years or more 
      We prayed hard to deliver 
 Thy black people from burning stakes, 
      To rights that God gives her. 
 Just as we on thy fertile fields. 
      Fought bravely to be free. 
 We will fight and die for thee. 
      O, flag for thy liberty. 
 We'll keep your colors floating. 
      And your rights we will defend 
 For you are crushing prejudice 
      And recognizing slave freed men.

THE SLACKER.
(Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters) 
 God forbid ere man was born 
      To crush honor beneath his feet 
 That the light of day should dawn 
      Upon one, who from duty flees 
 While on Freedom's Bleeding Altar, 
      His Noble Comrades have bled 
But he stands idle a slacker 
     Disgraced before living and dead.
 
II. 
 
 Friends is there one among you  
      Who has shunned the Righteous Cause 
 Spurned the Red, White and Blue?
      That stands for justice to all
 How can you silently sit 
      When Liberty hangs in the scale? 
 Where is the spirit of seventy-six? 
      That you would be enslaved. 
 
 III. 
 
 Do you deem your life greater 
      Than the just rights of man 
 Then you're a fool and traitor 
      Exiled in your Native Land, 
 Rough and steep is the way
      Leading to the victory we seek 
 But death and a coward's grave
      Is what the slacker will meet.
IV.  
 For dead must be the soul
     That slumbers while Humanity Calls
 And beholding his brother's foes 
     Cries, "Give me peace and not War"  
 O, Slacker what fate awaits thee 
     How shamefull will be thy end 
Unless thou fight to free 
     All races and colors of men.
V.
 
 How can you bear to see 
     Christianity laid in the dust? 
 By one, who hates Democracy 
     And the God, whom we trust 
 One who has boastingly debased 
      The virtue of true womanhood 
 That poligamy takes the place 
     Where Sacred Rights once stood. 
 
 VI. 
 
 And though you were not born 
      In the Land of the Free 
 And your kindred at home
     Is far away oe'r the sea 
 Eternal Allegiance you swore 
      To the Stars and Stripes 
 When you stepped on our shore 
      To enjoy equal rights. 
 
 VII. 
 To our protection you fled 
    As a bird seeks its nest
 With mercy we pillowed your head 
     That the wanderer might rest
 Drinking from the cup of kindness
     Administered by loving hands
 Your eyes lost their blindness 
     As you saw the Spirit of Man.
 
VIII. 
 And now the flag needs you
     Will you stand like a man 
 Or, do you feel, as slackers do 
     I must help the Father Land 
 Let conscience be your guide 
     And it will lead you a'right 
 To Columbia's bleeding side 
      'Neath Liberty's burning light. 
 
 IX. 
 It's true we all can't go 
      To the land of Somewhere 
 But we can strike a blow 
     By helping those, Over There 
 Thus the German Kaiser'll know 
     He cannot enslave free men 
 And that every American Soul 
     Will fight him to the end. 
 
 X. 
 
 So when the Victory is won 
     And the world is at peace 
 When the shedding of blood is done 
      And mankind again is free 
 Uncle Sam, if giving up life 
     For the deliverance of men 
 Does not give all, equal rights 
     Who will be, the slacker then? 
 
* * *
 DO YOUR BEST BOYS. 
 (Original Poem by E. P. Peters.) 
 
 Do the best you can, boys, 
     In Uncle Sam's call to arms.  
 Fear not the Boches' bluff noise; 
     Be ready, brave, true and calm. 
 Keep the dear old banner flying 
     With your bayonets its rights demand, 
 Show the world you're upward striving, 
     And doing the best you can. 
 II. 
 
 O, loyal citizens go not unheeded, 
     To the call humanity makes. 
 Your money and help is needed, 
     To keep the United States. 
 The appeals to you sons of Liberty, 
     And to those from foreign strands, 
 To protect those who protected thee, 
    By doing the best you can. 
 
 III. 
 
 Your eyes opened at freedom's touch, 
     So come now, do not wait. 
 Show Wilhelm you're with us. 
     For the welfare of our state. 
 Let not your hearts be confined; 
     Let feuds die with the past. 
 Strengthen us in this perilous time. 
     Ye of all races, colors and class. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Though scant your purse may   be, 
     Keeping you from giving your best. 
 Explaining, you can make others see.  
     The need of buying W. S. S. 
 For the Red Cross' noble work, 
     We humbly ask your aid again, 
 Pray do not from duty shirk. 
     But do the best you can. 
 
 V. 
 We know its far away boys 
     To a strange land you go, 
 But fight to keep home's joy 
     From destruction of the foe. 
 Yes they will make it warm. 
     For you in No Man's Land. 
 But remember that you are American born 
     And do the best you can. 
 
 VI. 
 
 If you get blue and lonesome 
     Forget it all and smile, 
 Be proud that you're saving home, 
     If its only for awhile. 
 To your countrymen be true, 
     Hold high the rights of man; 
 Fret not at what you're told to do 
     Just do the best you can. 
 
 VII. 
 
 When you hear your comrades grumble, 
     Pat him kindly on the back, 
 Tell him right must not tumble. 
     Because some fellow grows slack. 
 If you try this simple plan, 
     Courage's spark you can renew. 
 And Sammies will realize their stand. 
     For the Red, White and Blue. 
* * * 
 VIII. 
 
 When shells fall fast around you, 
     And perhaps you would like to hide, 
 Think what great things we do, 
     By working without growing tired. 
 Boys don't mind the war cloud, 
     Fight for your people and land. 
 We of you patriots are proud. 
     So do the best you can. 
 
 THE NEGRO'S RIGHT TO FIGHT. 
 
 O, ye men of African Creed, 
     America is our home 
 We were born among the Free 
     Though bondage claimed our own, 
 I know we have forgiven 
     All the wrongs done a race 
 And as American Citizens 
     Are ready to take our place.
 
 II. 
 
 Boys we were right to fight 
     For how oft have we prayed 
 For justice and Equal rights 
     Yea, for this trying day 
 Ethiopia sends forth her Herald 
     In answer to our prayer 
 Crying Freedom for the World 
     And Democracy everywhere. 
 
 III. 
 
 Noble Comrades 'tis our black hands 
     That will bear Old Glory across 
 The fields of No Man's Land 
     To Humanity's Bleeding cross. 
 There we will wrestle with death 
     Till the great Victory is gained 
 And when we are laid to rest 
     God grant we die not in vain. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Out of this war will rise 
     Not the black man of old 
 But one who fought and died 
     The true American Negro.
 So boys every one should fight 
     To preserve a Just Cause 
 It's only fair and right
     To give our lives, our all.
V. 
For when Belgium was robbed 
    Of life and years of toil 
Faster beat our heart thobs
    Warning us that duty calls. 
And then we saw France struggle 
    In the conflict just begun
As she called her Black Brother’s 
    To help conquer the cruel Huns.  
 VI. 
 
Boys as a Brother to Man 
    We've proved loyal in the past 
Thus winning the right to stand 
    And defend the Stars and Stripes. 
So friends, we'll keep the trust 
    That swells our bosom with pride  
And She'll never trail the dust 
     While we are by Her Side. 
 
 VII. 
 
Uncle Sam we are with you 
    For you are with the Right 
And with hearts that are true 
     We'll help you win this fight 
We stand ready at your command 
     For you seek not personal prize 
With the enemy hand to hand 
    We'll save that principal or die. 
 
 VIII. 
 Brave Warriors, when we leave  
     For the trench and fireing line 
 Our hearts will ache with grief 
     To leave loved ones behind 
 But there is a Greater Love 
     That leads us on and on, 
 Leads us through flames and floods 
     To the "Great Awakening Morn." 
 
 IX. 
 
 Look boys as Old Glory waves 
     We behold the spirits of man 
 Lincoln and Douglas from the grave, 
     Guide us as to foreign strands 
 They salute the Stars and Stripes 
     These Honored Myrters, side by side 
 Showing us we've a right to fight 
     As they nobly fought and died. 
* * * 
 THE EIGHT DIRECTION. 
 (Original Poem by E. P. Peters.) 
 
 In nineteen I was grieved to hear,
     The murmur of many strange tongues, 
 That told in a struggle near, 
     Liberty would sacrifice her sons. 
 Strong, weak, and innocent will perish 
     Until the right cause is won. 
 For man's life is not cherished 
     By the beastly, heartless huns. 
 
 And as I sat busy thinking, 
     How to help protect the stripes, 
 I saw my black brother drinking 
     From the cup of disfranchised rights. 
 I saw sons of honest toil. 
     Robbed of life and protection. 
 Yet they are answering Democracy's call 
     And striving in the right direction. 
 
 The black mothers of Tennessee, 
     Are giving their blood to France, 
 And only asking of people free. 
     That they be given a chance. 
 From the blood hounds thirsty flight, 
     They are asking to be saved. 
 For men should enjoy equal rights 
     Where the Star Spangled Banner waves. 
 
 Just as God rained down manna,  
     And the children of Isreal fed; 
 He'll give sons of Louisiana, 
     The rights for which they've pled. 
 For we're not fighting for possession. 
     Nor wishing that others should fall 
 But traveling in the right direction. 
     To a home that welcomes all. 
  So remember that we've not protested, 
     To do a loyal citizens part, 
 Though the memory of Houston, Texas, 
      Is still burning in our hearts. 
 Our duty is to Glory, boys, 
     No matter what falls our lot. 
 That Democracy may not be destroyed, 
     And that the paths be not forgot. 
 
 I saw Ethiophia Slowly rise,
     In the midst of scornful men, 
 Guided by power from on high. 
     And deserted by earthly friends. 
 But her voice is not still, 
     Nor hid is her black face, 
  For her patriots of San Juan hill, 
     In history have no place. 
 
 And though our tongues were bridled 
     Because we were sons of Ham, 
 "We could not stand by idle, 
     When needed by Uncle Sam. 
 With heart sympathy we listened, 
     To innocent mouths crying for bread,
 Still unseen we have risen 
     That the hungry might be fed. 
 
 Old Glory you have many friends, 
      But we have proved the truest. 
 Although you've failed to defend 
      Your sons of East St. Louis, 
 From poverty and oppression, 
     The weary wanderer of night, 
 Starts in the right direction 
      To help win the perilous fight. 
 
 Mother when clouds sweep before you. 
     And your sons you sacrifice, 
 Be proud brave Ethiophia, 
     Is still dying for the right. 
 Dropping college books and professions, 
      Leaving an Educational chance, 
 We follow in the right direction, 
      To help our brothers in France. 
 
 To preserve Christianity, 
     We did not ponder or wait. 
 And fought to save humanity.
     While our comrades burned at stake. 
 But boys hold high the Stripes, 
     Give them your strong protection, 
 For you shall inherit eternal life 
     That strive in the right direction. 
 
 So let us forget our trials, 
     Though like pilgrims we roam, 
 But thank God we're not exiles, 
     And America is our home. 
 Let the spirit of sixty-five 
     In every bosom swell, 
 For Democracy ever strives 
     That in paradise all will be well. 
 
 No longer we're patient or humble, 
     For the barbaric crimes we see, 
 Shall not cause justice to crumble. 
     Nor enslave old Liberty. 
 So black sons of rejection, 
     Be loyal, be brave, be true. 
 Go forth in the right direction, 
     Defend the Red, White and Blue.

 THE BETTER PART. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters) 
 
 On Boston soil in 1775, 
     When America fought to be free 
 Crispus Attucks a Negro 'didst die 
     'Didst shed his blood for Liberty; 
 Though slavery's yoke was upon him 
     Though his people had no voice 
 A heart beat for his fellow-men 
     And Freedom or death his choice. 
 
II. 
 His body in shot torn rags 
     Fell beneath the Stars and Stripes 
 Lifting his eyes saw the Flag 
     For which he gave his life 
 To that Celestial City, went forth 
     The soul of the Black Patriot, 
 As he gave up the ghosts 
     We chose the Better Part. 
 
 III. 
 
 When Spain fought her Cuban Brothers 
     Crushing the rights of a weaker race 
 Our hearts in sympathy were troubled 
     As we saw Humanity disgraced 
 Our boys said to Uncle Sam, 
     "Is not this war our war? 
 Then give us power to stand 
     And help defend the Cause." 
 
 IV. 
 
 In the charge up San Juan 
     When the rough riders faced defeat 
 When lost victory before them dawned 
     And behind them a scorned retreat. 
 It was then the True Soul 
     Of the black troops were tried 
 And the story we all know 
     Of how they fought and died. 
 
V. 
 Through facing the Spaniards fire. 
     Through Our Blood, that was spilled 
 Old Glory was placed on high 
     On the summit of the hill. 
 Such deeds have buried the tomahawk 
     Healed the wounds of bleeding hearts. 
 Together the White and Black walk 
     To choose, The Better Part. 
 
 VI. 
 
 Thus the two races, in union 
     Toiled along the road of life 
 In a brotherly communion 
     Free from hatred and strife 
 When from far o'er the sea 
     Came Humanity's Call for help 
 Came groans of people bereaved 
     In a struggle of Freedom and Death. 
 
 VII. 
 
 We saw German Soldiers Kill 
     Siberia's peace loving Sons 
 Saw blood of innocent ones spilled 
     In the mouth of murderous guns, 
 Heard the cries of women and children 
     Beholding their humble homes afire 
 Then into dark slavery driven 
     Like cattle, to perish and die. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 Bleeding Belgium, cried to live 
     As she struggling gave all 
 That earthly mortals could give 
     To preserve the Righteous Cause. 
 France stretched forth her hand 
     The hand that proved our friend 
 Pleading from, "No Man's Land" 
     For the Freedom of Men. 
 
 IX. 
 
 Old Glory, your Black Boys 
     Long to see. Democracy reign. 
 For Freedom's fully enjoyed 
     By those, who have worn chains. 
 Uncle Sam, we're by your side 
     Fast within beats our hearts 
 And when we say goodbye 
     We will choose, The Better Part. 
 
 X. 
 
 A black mother pressed her son 
     To the bosom that nursed him 
 For the parting hour had come 
     To help defend his countrymen. 
 Looking into his eyes she said, 
     "On the altar of thy heart 
 Burns a spirit that has led 
     You to choose, The Better Part. 
 
 XI. 
 I who have watched o'er thee 
     From the very moments of birth 
 Feel the patriotism you feel 
     Knowing my boy'll prove his worth. 
 If this be the last time 
     To press you to my heart, 
 Die fighting on the firing line 
     And choose, The Better Part. 
 
 XII. 
 His countenance now bore 
     A greater love, a greater pride 
 For the Uniform he wore 
     And the woman by his side. 
 "Mother he said, Thy Sacrifice 
     Is not made in vain 
 For the Stars and Stripes 
     Shall wave in peace again. 
 
 XIII. 
 I fear not, the cruel Huns 
     Nor their horrible deeds and threats. 
 For is it in my people born 
     To cringe, from a Noble Death? 
 Then mother, wipe away thy tears 
     And kiss me 'ere I start 
 For I cannot linger here 
      And choose, The Better Part."

 WITH THE COLORS. 
  (Original Poem by E. P. Peters.) 
 
 Faded is the light of day, 
      When I have finished my task, 
 And in a land far away, 
      Your memory holds me fast. 
 For it seems but yesterday, 
      I held you on my knee, 
 Never thinking that you would play 
      In the game for Democracy. 
 But my son I am glad 
      My feeble fingers can knit 
 For patriots of the service flag. 
      Who are proudly doing their bit. 
 
 II. 
 
 I'm sacrificing when I stay,
      At home where you have been, 
 And toiled daily that you may. 
      Help the right cause win. 
 Vacant is thy room above me, 
      And empty is thy chair, 
 But onward, for 'tis victory, 
      Awaiting those playing fair. 
 And though silver is my hair, 
      I'm still your faithful mother; 
 World freedom is my prayer 
      For I am with the colors. 
 
 III. 
 
 We the mothers of the free
      Are proud that we toiled not alone 
 In the fight to keep Autocracy 
      From the heart of Liberty's home. 
 All nations are in a stir, 
      For mankind's being slaughtered 
 By the hands of German Kultur, 
      Who has no excuse to offer. 
 Brutality in our face is slamed, 
      Morality they've tried to smother, 
 But fear not dear Uncle Sam, 
      For I am with the colors. 
 
 IV. 
 
 We will preserve Democracy, 
      No matter what it may cost, 
 We're servants of the Almighty, 
       And followers of the cross. 
 In the dreaded war zone 
      Where man seeks not for rest. 
 Loyalty and bravery is shown. 
      By aid of the fairest sex. 
 Red is the cross they wear. 
      They're helping our wounded brothers 
 We cherish them as gems rare 
      Who are serving with the colors. 
 
V. 
 In the Y. M. C. A. 
      Brave Sammy takes a part, 
 For 'tis encouragement by the way, 
      And peace to our troubled heart. 
 The sun of eighteen and nineteen 
      Is smiling on them over there,
 And though no longer they're seen 
      We're helping them everywhere. 
 Foreigners, strangers, black and white, 
      Are working with each other. 
 Striving, dying to win the fight, 
      Forgetting race class and color. 
 
 VI. 
 
 Greater is the spirit of today, 
      Than that of seventy six 
 For fuedalism can not stay 
      Where Democracy doth exist. 
 The Lusitanian victims we saw, 
       But still loyal we stand, 
 'Till o'er is the bloody war, 
      And safe is our native land. 
 To Berlin we will gladly go,
      And if it need be further,
 Just to let the whole world know 
      That we are with the colors.

  TRIUMPH OF THE TUSCANIA. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters.) 
 
 America drops a Laurel 
      On the Tuscania's dead 
 While war's cold wind howl 
       O'er our uncovered heads. 
 
 II. 
 
 Though silent now the tongue 
      Of that brave gallant host 
 The race is yet to run, 
      The prize is not lost. 
 
 III. 
 
 We still hear them sing 
      Awaiting the water's call 
 As if death was a thing 
      Welcome to us all. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Asleep in a watery grave 
      Thy Noble Spirits still live 
 As to Freedom Thou gave 
      In like manner we give. 
 
V. 
 Mother your son slumbers 
      While his unfinished work 
  Is carried on by numbers 
      Whose duties will never shirk. 
 
 VI. 
 Falling your son gave all 
      That human heart could give 
 To save the Righteous Cause 
       And his country from ill. 
 
 VII. 
 
 Then mothers do not cry 
      For thou suffereth not alone 
 Comfort others that must die 
      For their flag and home. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 When America is safe 
      From the Barbaric Huns 
 And Kaiser finds his place 
      Is not in the sun. 
 
 IX. 
 
 When Autocracy is crushed 
      By the hands of right 
 And Feudalism's doctrine hushed 
      From those seeking the light. 
 
 X. 
 
      Then the Tuscania's Boys 
      Shall triumph in the grave 
 For their comrades loyal 
      Fought and saved the day.

 SAMMY'S CHRISTMAS GIFT. 
  (Original Poem by E. P. Peters.) 
 
 When the merry Christmas day, 
      Dawned in No Man's Land, 
 And Christmas boxes from home,
      Given Sammies on foreign strand; 
 All heads bowed low, 
      While Old Glory was raised, 
 Giving thanks to man,
      And to the Christ Child praise. 
 When prayer had been offered, 
      Happy, two trenches did depart,
 All save one remained 
      With bowed head and aching heart. 
 
 II. 
 
 As the old flag rippled, 
      He cried, May she live,
 Always for the right, but 
      Oh, God, what can I give? 
 To my kind people in 
      The land of the free, 
 Who has sacrificed to 
      Send this box to me, 
 Oh, what can I give 
      For the cause of right. 
 But his cries was hushed 
      In the command to fight. 
 
 III. 
 
 With pride he fought, while 
      Bursting shells filled the air, 
 Smiling faced the enemy. 
      Tried not his life to spare.
 Stood while comrades fell beside 
      Him, fighting with wounding hand, 
 To keep the cursed Autocracy 
      From retgning in the land. 
 But as the battle grew hotter, 
      The Sammies filled with fear. 
 For in death their Captain lay 
      With the enemy near. 
 
 IV. 
 
 At last from out the smoke, 
      The wounded hands did raise. 
 "Boys on to victory, be 
      Brave and fight," he cried. 
 Then fighting like true Americans, 
      The battle was on again,
 The enemy retreated leaving fieldm
      Of sleeping and suffering men. 
 Dying their leader cried, pointing 
       To the Stars and Stripes, 
 "Boys I've given all. 
       To help you win the fight." 
 
V. 
 "Don't retreat in battle, fight 
      On till all is well. 
 Till the right has won. 
       And peace on earth dwells. 
 When you fight hardest, pray 
     God will help you give 
 Your life to old Liberty 
      That free people might live. 
 So boys meet me when 
      Your country you have saved. 
 Goodbye all and Old Glory 
      May she ever wave." 
 
 VI. 
 
 When the sun hid its face, 
      Behind the snowy hills, 
 When the battle field was cleared, 
      And thundering cannons stilled,
 The stars from their firmanent 
      Gave forth their brillant light, 
 Guarding as they did the 
      Shepards, sleeping Sammies through night. 
 The old flag still waved,
      Though torn in the fight. 
 Cheering patriots dead and 
      Dying for Democracy and it's rights. 
 
 VII. 
 
 When Christmas night was o'er, 
      From a long sweet repose, 
 Boys of Red, White, and Blue, 
      Sad but bravely rose. 
 Each man performed his duty, 
      Each offered a morning prayer. 
 Bugles summoned to mess hall. 
      In the land of somewhere. 
 Their hearts beat with patriotism 
      While grieved countenance showed respect 
 To the comrade who saved them 
      From captivity and death. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 When the spot was chosen,
      And the opening waiting there, 
 Sammies marched with tearful eyes, 
      While music filled the air. 
 The old flag was borne 
      And waved slowly over head, 
 While the patriot was lowered 
      Into a country martyr's grave. 
 And the epitaph was written, 
      Love for, Stars and Stripes 
 Could not be greater than 
      The man that gives his life.

 SAMMIE'S CHRISTMAS DREAM. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters.) 
 
 An American rises on Christmas Day 
      In the dawn of coming manhood 
 Falling upon bended knee to pray 
      As his teachings bade him do 
 Humbly asking his God to guide 
      Him in the paths of right 
 When absent from his mother's side 
      To make his way in life. 
 Begging for strength lest he fall 
      Discouraged by the way 
 Ready to help Humanity's Cause 
      Of those, who've gone astray. 
 
 II. 
 
 Pleading for the girl and boy 
      That drifting with the tide 
 Seeking only pleasure and joy 
      Losing self respect and pride 
 Change their hearts 'ere they meet 
      The doom that will surely come 
 Though tears of regret they weep 
      Is useless when life is done. 
 When their hair is fading gray 
      May from repenting lips be told 
 Dear Jesus passed by the way 
      And saved my dying soul. 
 
 III. 
 
 For the sinful father he prays 
      That craves and begs for rum 
 Sending his wife to her grave 
      From the shack in the slums. 
 Leaving two little blue-eyed girls 
      To make their way in life 
 Ignorant of the sinful world 
      Of it's temptations and strife, 
 O, God may thy Guiding Angel 
      Lead these little Maidens fair 
 Out of earthly harm and danger 
      To Thy Holy House of Prayer. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Again 0, God, I beseech Thee 
      To bless my Native Land 
 Divided may we never be 
      For only united we stand. 
 If cruel war should ever come 
      In the Land of the Free 
 May I proudly shoulder a gun 
      And die for Liberty. 
 May we forever fight. 
      That Democracy might win 
 Ever live the Cause of Right 
       Is my Christmas Prayer, Amen. 
 
 V. 
 
 Then slowly he raises at length 
      Refreshed in his morning's prayer 
 His face radiant with Divine strength 
      That God's messengers planted there. 
 From this brave lad we gleam 
      A lesson for young and old 
 That'll make life a pleasant dream 
      Unmarred by sin and woe. 
 For how happy we'd all be 
      Instead of thinking of self 
 If we'd give others in need 
      Helping those, in distress.
 
 VI. 
 
 Sisters and brothers clinging to him 
      They join the family fire side 
 Mother and Father greeting them 
      Their only jewels, there only pride. 
 Suddenly on the air there falls 
      The chiming of Christmas Bells 
 Shaking the ancient church walks 
      As joyfully the good news tell 
 Their voices in harmony blend 
      In the old fashioned pew 
 Singing to the Sons of Men 
      A song of Love and Truth. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 He hears the white haired priest 
      Tell the story of our Christ 
 Of the babe that would teach 
      Men the way of Eternal Life 
 How in a manger he lay 
      Close to his mother's breast 
 Upon a lowly bed of hay 
      To pay man's sinful death 
 An example for us to be 
      Meek and lowly of heart 
 Seeking not the front seat 
      But satisfied with our lot. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 While the shepherds by night 
      Watched their flock of sheep 
 They saw a wonderful light 
      A great star in the east. 
 A loud noise was heard 
      An angel stood before them 
 Saying "Peace on Earth, 
      Good Will to Men." 
 When the child was found 
      They gave thanks to God 
 Who's Son to earth came down 
      And filled tile world with Love. 
 
 IX. 
 
 As Christ toiled day by day 
      The blind saw, the dumb talked, 
 And to a cripple he said, 
      "Take up thy bed and walk." 
 Thus man's soul was redeemed 
      For Christ the mortgage payed 
 His blood the sinful world cleaned 
      And taught us how to pray 
 On the cross with thorn clad head 
      To his promise still was true 
 "Father, forgive them," He said, 
      "They know not what they do." 
 
 X. 
 
 Floating in the morning's breeze 
      The old flag, silent and serene 
 Awakens Sammie from his sleep 
      From his happy Christmas Dream. 
 Then Sammie saluteing the Stars and Stripes 
      With swelling breat exclaimed 
 I've pledged you honor and life 
      That world Democracy will reign 
 As this brave soldier sits 
      Smiling in his trench Over There 
 Lo, a sonff falls from his lips 
     His Country's National Air.

PEARLS UNRECOGNIZED. 
(Original Poem by E. P. Peters.) 
 
Oh wandering pilgrims of Virginia, 
    Who made you noted men. 
Whom was ever your defender. 
    And proved old Glory's friend. 
Was it not back in sixteen 
    For slaves of your selfish will. 
When your unfree tongues were still, 
    You ignorantly bought pearls unseen, 
 
 II. 
 
In vales and on historic hills, 
    Where your gallant heroes sleep, 
Once Ethiophians your soil tilled, 
    From dawn till sunset peace. 
Raised grain and your cattle fed, 
    In your business planned and advised, 
Without place to lay their heads 
    Your own pearls unrecognized. 
 
III. 
 
From tobacco made you wealthy,
    Your cruelty was humbly borne 
Slave cooks made you healthy,
    Black boys protected your homes,
With maimed bodies and chained hands, 
    Died to make your sons free, 
Rare gems in a slave land. 
    Robbed of rights and liberty. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Mother Nature doth sadly gaze 
     On the sunlit southern plains, 
 Pityinng hands forced to raise  
     Crops for their masters gain. 
 Tilling fields of cane and cotton 
     That you heartless masters rest, 
 And your home builders you've forgotten 
     Laid foundations for your success. 
  
V. 
 Scarred backs of unpaid toil, 
     Motherly rocked your brave sons,
 While their black faces spoiled 
     All good things they'd done. 
 For two hundred and forty years 
     Served you faithfully as a friend, 
 Unpitied dwelled in want and fear, 
     Four million helpless uncounted gems. 
 
 VI. 
 
 Naked on the auction block, 
     You separated mother and child, 
 At their pleadings only mocked. 
     On their pitiful condition smiled. 
 Forgiving humanity toiled patiently on. 
     Sacrificing for your boys and girls, 
 While poverty on the cabins dawned,  
     Of the uncared for hated pearls. 
 
 VII. 
 
 From whipping posts of plantation, 
     Rose innocent cries of man. 
 Music of a southern Nation, 
     Execution of their commands. 
 Still loyal with heart aches, 
     They came eager to your aid 
 Pearls that perished at burning stakes, 
     You a leading people made. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 While wealth made you able, 
     To do other honerable deeds, 
 The crumbs from your table, 
     Were left for those in need. 
 Honored by Ethiophia's children,
     Served by their willing hands, 
 You forgot you once were pilgrims,
     And crushed the rights of man. 
 
 IX. 
 
 Your words were deemed great, 
     As proud emperors of Rome, 
 Sowing earless seeds of waste,
     Unthankful of having a home. 
 In ignorance gloom kept a race, 
     Taught them to steal and fraud; 
 Morality shamefully did debase, 
     Told them nothing of a God. 
X. 
 Loved ones their only pride,
     Rags their physical protector,
 Independence spark slowly died 
     In hearts humiliation melted. 
 Brave gems from their people sold,
     Tried hard to forget their pain, 
 Noble emotion blossomed in their souls,
     Reminding them black sons have brains. 
 
 XI. 
 The long uneducated minds, 
     Gradually in wisdom grew broad, 
 Soul salvation they did find, 
 In a true forgiving God. 
 When through the night they prayed, 
     That their sons might be free. 
 Asked forgiveness for those who made, 
     Slaves of pearls and humanity. 
 
 XII. 
 
 Low bowed heads snowy white, 
     Stood in every vabin door, 
 Thankful that the bloody night, 
     God suffered to pass o'er. 
 Tear stained cheeks smiled with pleasure 
     Of being in a revolutionized world. 
 For Freedom their long lost treasure 
     Returned to unrecognized pearls.

 A DAUGHTER OF HAM. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters.) 
 
 A little maiden left home and friends 
     To brave the storms of life's sea 
 Filled with ambition for Great Things 
     With hopes of a Race just free 
 Born with a longing desire to help 
     Humanity regardless of color or creed 
 Made her the Sunshine, where ere she dwelt 
     To the friendless, and those in need. 
 
 II. 
 
 Purity of thought, blinded her eyes 
     To the world and it's selfish aims 
 Of men and women daily beguiled 
     In search of favor and fame 
 Crushing people because of birth 
     Because of blood flowing in their veins 
 Thinking not of the soul and it's worth 
     Nor recognizing the power of brains. 
 
 III. 
 Little did the Noble Child realize 
     Of disappointments not afar off 
 Of opportunities to be denied 
     And battles that must be fought 
 I see her as she smilingly bade 
     Childhood's happy scenes adieu 
 And turning sought the untrodden way 
     That led to friends and foes anew. 
 
 IV. 
 Behold our heroine makes her way 
     Through the 'midst of the city's poor 
 As she walks we hear her pray 
     For the victims of poverty and woe 
 Suddenly across the path there falls 
     A form motionless at her feet 
 While to her ear comes a faint call 
     "Give me food that I may eat." 
V. 
 Thus two earthly mortals take leave 
     And start on life's journey refreshed 
 
 VI. 
 
 "When I lie hungry by the road 
     Thou gavest me bread to eat 
 Lightening the burden, of a weary soul 
     With a spirit so humble and meek 
 Though cursed thy dark skin be 
     Continue to feed God's Lambs 
 And good will, shall follow thee 
      Thou Faithful Daughter of Ham." 
 One because of the blessing received 
     The other saved from hunger and death 
 They shall meet in that Holy Land 
     When the sea gives up it's dead 
 Our Beloved Daughter of Ham 
     And the hungry that was fed. 
 
 VII. 
 
 She has labored for many days 
     Helping alike both Saints and thieves 
 And with eager hands, to them gave 
     All she had, even to her need 
 The body fatigued and careworn 
     Cries out for bread and jam 
 For Humanity's burden daily borne 
     Grew heavy to the Daughter of Ham. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 When despairing of her quest 
     She heard voices happy and gay 
 And saw people richly dressed 
     Entering a door by the way 
 Hoping here to find her goal 
     Footsteps are turned to the crowd 
 Where a servant fills the door 
     With a king's air so proud. 
 
 IX.
 
 "Pray what can I do for you?" 
     Said the servant, to the maid 
 "I'm starving give me food" 
     Our little pilgrim said. 
 Then the servant, with a ghastly stare 
     Hastily replied, "I'm sorry mam 
 You are forbidden to eat in there  
     For you are a Daughter of Ham."
 
 X. 
 
 Then passing into the night 
     She offered to heaven a prayer 
 That some one would bear the light 
     To sinning men and women fair 
 Lo, as the stars gave forth 
     Bright light o'er all the land 
 To God's Throne marched the soul 
     Of the dying Daughter of Ham. 
 
 XL 
 
 Sons of men why hurl 
     Hate and scorn at one another 
 When Christ died for the world 
    And not for race or color 
 He dying shed his blood 
     That we all might live 
 In unity and love 
     Ever ready to forgive 
 
 XII. 
 On the face man look 
     And if it pleases the eye 
 We blindly shield a wolf 
     Oft times a thief and spy 
 But God seeth the heart 
     And judges us thereby 
 Thus all can own a part 
     In a home on high 
 
 XIII. 
 When our eyes grow blind 
     With the veil of years 
 May we leave behind 
     A record honored and dear 
 So both rich and lowly 
     Remember the Bleeding Lamb 
 And forget not the story 
     Of the Daughter of Ham. 
* * * 
 SPIRITUAL AWAKENING. 
 
 Upon the long hard frozen ground, 
     Snow flakes lay thick and white; 
 And twilight scarcely its way found,
     When it was lost in night. 
 
 In a palace of wealth and beauty, 
     Happy was wife, husband and child, 
 Forgetting faith and Christian duty, 
     Following vanity, fame, and style. 
 
 Suddenly from out the silence came, 
     A loud rap upon the door, 
 And before them with unknown name,
     Stood a frail form covered with snow. 
 
 Then husband ordered bread and wine, 
     To redden the pale guests face, 
 While a servant was commanded find 
     The weary stranger a resting place. 
 
 The food of the very best, 
     Pilgrim was invited to eat, 
 And slowly as one in distress,
     He rose upon his aged feet. 
 
 "You are very kind he said, 
     To lend me a helping hand, 
 You shall for all be paid, 
     For you are a brother to man." 
 Clothed in a costly evening gown,
     The proud wife before them stood; 
 With upright head and scornful frown,
     Looked upon the begger of food. 
 
 "Have I not seen you before?" 
    Of the stranger she inquired. 
 "Yes," he answered, "among the poor, 
     You've "Seen and passed me by." 
 
 Taking innocent children from unknown friend 
     Wife left blinded to mankind's plea, 
 But husband followed Pilgrim to defend, 
     The cause of suffering humanity. 
 
 With Pilgrim who long had borne 
     The burden of a sinful world,
 Husband entered a drunkard's home. 
     And rescued his friendless girl. 
 
 Clothed in his coat of fur. 
      The unpitied was sheltered from cold 
 Into his rich home took her. 
     To teach her of the soul. 
 
 "I've brought Alice a playmate" 
      Said husband to his wife. 
 But she proudly refused to take 
      The poor into her child's life. 
 
 So innocent children ignorant of class. 
     Became devoted to each other. 
 While o'er them was passed, 
      The cruel sentence, of Alice's mother. 
 
 "She must not stay here John," 
     She said, "You must go alone, 
 And take away the low born,  
     You unthinkingly brought into our home." 
 
 "It is God's will," he replied, 
     "I'll fight till the victory's won, 
 Never again will I drift with the tide, 
     For I'm needed in the slums." 
 
 At wife's request, clergymen talked, 
     To husband how he was losing, 
 The dignity of their Christian walk. 
     With the poor they thought amusing. 
 
 Husband in silence had remained 
     Until his friends ceased to come. 
 Then from the pulpit he exclaimed, 
     "Duty calls me in the slums.”
 
 Taking with her their only child, 
     Wife joined her society friends; 
 Charmed by luxury and style. 
     And blinded to her sin. 
 
 On bended knees at night fall, 
     When mankind goes to rest,
 Christian on the Savior called 
     To strengthen him in distress. 
 
 His life was deprived of sunshine,
     Or all he had was gone. 
 But Pilgrim came the second time 
     And guided him from wrong. 
 
 So again in the narrow path, 
     Teaching sons and daughters of men,
 Christian helped the downtrodden class, 
     To come out of their sins. 
 
 Saloon keepers, bartenders, gamblers, 
     Vile men that swear and curse,
 Willingly stopped their sinful ramble 
     And became a part of Christian's church. 
 
 When told of his childs death, 
     Christian grieved not nor mourned, 
 For he'd sacrificed pleasure and wealth. 
     To join her round God's throne. 
 
 Though bent with toil and grief, 
     His work the world was demanding, 
 He lived to tell of a peace, 
     That passes all understanding. 
 
 Smiling upon his friends with pride, 
     He bade them meet him there, 
 And entered his chamber and died, 
     With the Holy book of prayer. 
 
 As the prodigal son returned home, 
     So unto her husband did wife,
 Finding God had claimed his own,
     And given him eternal life. 
 
 In grief kneeling down by husband,
     She looked heavenward to pray 
 When before her stood Pilgrim 
     The street beggar she'd turned away. 
 
 Pilgrim's countenance became bright and pure. 
     His worn rainment spotless and white 
 "Now," she cried, "I know you. 
      You are the truth and light." 
 
 She saw as a shepard sees, 
     That cares not for his fold, 
 The child she hoped to be, 
     Left hungry, penniless, and cold. 
 
 "O, John, what shall I do," 
     She cried, "I've scorned humanity."  
Child whispered, "God will save you, 
    For He saved Pa and me." 
 
 At last forgiveness had come, 
     Upward strived child and wife. 
To meet their sleeping loved ones 
     When the soul seeks its flight.

 FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters.) 
 
 In the year 1858 
      On a Virginian Plantation 
 Was born a babe who someday 
      Would walk and talk with nations 
 In his veins flowed the blood 
      Of Ethiopia's Noble Hearted Sons 
 Born 'midst slavery's mire and mud 
      A great leader of men had come. 
 
 II.  
 
 In a rough hewn board hut 
      Booker saw the light of day 
 Blessed with a kind mother's trust 
      In her arms he fondly lay 
 His childish eyes did not gaze 
      Upon fine paintings on the wall 
 But watched little pickanninies play 
      While water in the kettle boiled. 
 
III. 
 
 The child of Nature boasted not 
      Of proud ancestory or titled kin 
 For bondage had fallen his lot 
      And four million of his fellow men 
 Deep in the heart of that boy 
      A spark of independence burned 
 Early losing the thrill for toys 
      Longing for a chance to learn. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Just before the dawn of day 
      When the world's lost in dream 
 The lad heard his mother pray 
      And there the truth was gleamed 
 From then was waged a battle 
      From then his life work begun 
 To enlighten the Human chattels 
      When 'ere the hour should come. 
V. 
 At last God heard the pleas 
      Of the four million humble souls 
 And suffered them to be free 
      To serve their God of old. 
 With the North and South's decision 
      The slave child's hope was realized 
 Going forth to prepare his mission 
      He bade his lowly habitat Goodbye. 
 
 VI. 
 
 Toiling through sunshine and rain 
      Working patiently in the salt mills, 
 Took unto himself a name 
      The proudest that history could give. 
 An unseen eye, saw a day 
      Drawing near; when the world's readers 
 Beholding his works would say 
      "He too, is Father of His People." 
 
 VII. 
 
 As in the days of old 
     Brave Romans with armors of steel 
 Met in the arena their foe 
      Either to kill, or be killed. 
 So with his schooling completed 
      Booker Washington, now went forth 
 To conquer or to be defeated 
      True to his boyhood oath. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 His helmet the Word of God, 
      Freely given to those that ask 
 His sword a heart of love 
      And Divine truth, his only mask. 
 Thus clad in this court of mail 
      That protects the souls of men 
 On life's stormy sea set sail 
      To battle against fog and wind. 
 
 IX. 
 
 Ever in the quest of Knowledge 
      Took up the study of law 
 Entered the famous Hampton Institute 
      Preparing to stand in Congress Hall. 
 But providence had a Nobler Cause, 
      For this young man to pursue 
 Throwing down the books of law 
      Sought his works in fields anew. 
 
 X. 
 
 It was then Tuskeege called him 
      At last had come the Morn, 
 To teach and defend his fellowmen 
       For which work he was born. 
 His soul urged him to go 
       He was filled with new zeal 
 Determined his Brothers should know 
       What it means, To Be Free. 
 Ever Onward, to reach higher ground 
       Helping 'all People to greater aim 
 The world in admiration now found 
      Dr. Washington, rightly chose, name. 
 Instructing the Negroes to buy land 
      To study the advantage of soil 
 Proving his theory with his hands 
      Showing the profit of honest toil. 
 
 XII. 
 
 In the pleas for his race 
      A great Orator, was made known 
 Sought not for a political place 
      Ever striving to help his own 
 Respected in courts of fame 
      Daily honored by rich and poor, 
 Popularity never made him vain 
      But was loved as, "Booker," of old. 
 
 XIII. 
 
 Then God called his servant home 
      Called the Great Educator to rest 
 Leaving his friends to fight alone 
      To live forever with the Blest, 
 A lasting monument is left 
      In hearts of young and feeble 
 And though parted by death 
      He still is. Father of His People.

 PAUL LAURANCE DUNBAR. 
 
 In eighteen seventy one, 
      Two freed slaves met in life; 
  Joshua Dunbar, Matilda Murphy's love  won, 
      And were united as husband and wife. 
 
 Matilda from a little child, 
      Was a lover of poetry and art;  
 And always in a manner mild, 
     She dealt with cruel hearts. 
 
 So it was the following year, 
      A son to her was born; 
 The black face, the infant dear, 
      Who gave the world book and song. 
 
 At seven years of age,
      New ideas entered his life; 
 His mind in best thoughts engaged, 
      And his dreams he began to write. 
 
 By birth, a genius and poet. 
      By writing, won world wide fame, 
 The black author lived to know it; 
      Paul Laurence Dunbar by name. 
 
 Literature, spelling, and grammer, 
      Were his favorite studies in school. 
 He was modest and timid in manners,
      And obedient to the rules. 
 
 He edited the High School Times, 
      Which contents interesting found. 
 By diligence he did climb, 
      To success and future renown. 
 
 But at last the time had come, 
      To launch out and labor find. 
 Graduating in eighteen ninety one, 
      Leaving schoolmates and friends behind 
 
 His color was against all he'd done, 
      Every one to him seemed greater. 
 An elevator boy's task he begun; 
      Looking for recognition later. 
 
 Few flowers in his path were strewn, 
      But there were many thorns. 
 His determination was not to ruin, 
      The talent that was in him born. 
 
 A quaint philosophy was breathed, 
      In his dialect poems and prose; 
  Some were thoughts he achieved, 
      And others gleamed from stories told. 
 
 One evening Dunbar entered home,
      With a smile on his face, 
 The first difficulty he had won, 
      For his people and his race. 
 
 His "Oak and Ivy poems" printed,
      Made wide his reputation; 
 And though of African decent. 
      He was generous to all nations. 
 
 The poet was defender of his race; 
      His life work did devote her, 
 And his soul contents we trace. 
      In his Ode to Ethiophia. 
      
 To Chicago to the world's fair,
      He must go aid his brother; 
 Alone the burden was hard to bear; 
      He hated to leave his mother. 
 But by special Providence, 
      He found work and friends, 
 Who always came to his defense, 
      With willing aids to lend. 
 
 Honorable Fred Douglass said, 
      He's a promising Colored man; 
 To him tribute should be paid, 
      For the place that he demands. 
 
 In congress in Washington, 
      He became efficient in literary work. 
 Though hardest blows he'd overcome, 
      Never would be duty shirk. 
 
 His fourth book, "The Lyrics and Hearth side." 
      Was dedicated to Alice, his wife, 
 His wise counsellor and guide, 
      And the sunshine of his life. 
 
 Of the shadows of Rocky Mountain, 
      In broken health the poet cried, 
 "Once I drank from thy fountains, 
      And sat on thy rugged side. 
 
 Once I was young and strong, 
      A healthy robust lad, 
 I admired the bird songs, 
      I smiled when I was sad. 
 
 All men held the poet dear, 
      For he lived a life worth while; 
 Although his end was drawing near, 
      He was happy, calm, and mild. 
 
 He gazed on the flowers sent him, 
      To give his pains relief, 
 But in a few days left them 
      And was numbered with the deceased. 
 Doctor H. T. Tobey, of Toledo, 
      Mourned the loss of his friend. 
 He regretted the Great must go, 
      As the other sons of men. 
 
 Ethiophia long shall weep,
      And shall always honor give, 
 For though the poet now doth sleep, 
      His work shall ever live.

 THE SLAVE'S DYING PRAYER. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters.) 
 
 In the year 1619 a Dutch vessel 
      Sailed the waters of the Black sea 
 With the angry waves it wrestled 
      Traveling to a land called the Free. 
 Thirty Negroes trembling with fear 
      Hovered in a dark and dingy hull 
 Many strange tongues they could hear 
      While fast faded the land they loved 
 Though they were heathens yet they prayed 
      With the conquering spirit of their race 
 To the God of stone, who ruled the day 
      While hope beamed on every face. 
 
 II. 
 
 At last the vessel landed at Jamestown 
      With it's cargo of Human Souls 
 Naked they stepped on slave cursed ground 
      And like beast of the field were sold. 
 For two hundred and fifty years 
      Our people knelt in the dust 
 Robbed of all a race holds dear 
      To satisfy the white man's lust 
 The tender ties of mother, father and child 
      Were crushed beneath feet of heartless might 
 They were hunted like creatures wild 
      Their moans were bird songs of the night. 
 
 III. 
 
 The thought of Independence burned 
      On the Sacred Altar of their Heart 
 Though humiliated and spurned 
      They were ready to play their part. 
 Engulfed in poverty, they could see 
      The cloud of a long and bloody strife 
 Stronger grew the desire to be free 
      To stand like men and pay the price 
 In the starless night of ignorance 
      A just God showed them the way 
 He gave them patience and endurance 
      For a God of mercy heard them pray. 
 
 IV. 
 
 The slaves wept and prayed for joy 
      When on April the twelfth 1863 
 Was fired the guns of the Civil War 
      In the struggle to set us free. 
 The Blue and Gray alike upheld 
      The cause they thought was right 
 They bravely fought and fell 
      Sacrificing honor and life. 
 In the game of Freedom and Death 
      The fearless Negro dashing and brave 
 Urged on by memories in his breast 
      Died to redeem the Human race. 
 
  
 V. 
 
 Abraham Lincoln, who believed 
      In the equal rights of man 
 Said, "To save the union I will free 
      All slaves through out the land." 
 Lincoln on January the first 1863 
      Issued the Emacipation, Proclamation 
 Declaring, the Negroes are set free 
      From cruel slavery and degradation. 
 Thus penniless, but free we left 
      Our old plantation homes 
 Facing starvation and death 
      Knowing not whither we roamed. 
 
 VI. 
 
 But providence was our guide 
     Along the rough and thorny path 
 Little by little we strived 
      To overcome the dreadful past. 
 Before the bar of justice the Negro stands 
      As the grand champion of his race 
 Begging and pleading for the Rights of Man 
      Forgetting his kinky hair and black face 
 In the Medical profession he longs 
      To lengthen and enoble life 
 Healing the wounds of the wronged 
      A bearer of the Sacred Light. 
 
 VII. 
 
 The Black Poets, doth write 
      Of their beloved Dixie Land 
 Singing of the picturesque sights 
      Of the hot and scorching sands; 
 Though poverty attended the Negroe's birth 
      Industry has been his home 
 In tilling the soil he's proved his worth 
      Regardless of the trials he's borne 
 Through sorrow and toil may be 
      Our humble and lowly career 
 Let us thank God we're free 
      For rest lies beyond the veil of tears. 
 
 VIII. 
 An old slave mammy who's hair 
      Is covered with snow, that never melt 
 Smiling prayed this dying prayer 
      In the land of her humble birth. 
 "O, God, I shall soon be with Thee 
      In a land where all is love 
 My prayers are answered, I die in peace 
      To join the Heavenly Hosts above, 
 My body shall soon return to dust 
      Beneath the cold and damp sod, 
 How sweet in death to have trust 
      In a true and living God. 
 
 IX. 
 
 Just as death in his chariot will come 
       To still my heart and bear me away 
 So will the prize we seek be won 
      When some of you sleep, beneath the clay 
 At last the hour has come 
      And she bids us a parting farewell 
 She has kept the faith, her work is done 
      And all is well, all is well." 
* * * 
 THE NEGRO'S PROGRESS. 
 
From the roaring cannons of sixty five, 
     From the hour the Negroes were alive; 
 They thankfully thanked the God of peace 
      Who them from bondage did release. 
 Departing from ones that once knew success, 
      Helpless, launched out to do their best 
 And in the struggle to be recognized, 
     They were oft defeated on every side. 
 
 But with sincerety that cannot be stilled, 
      They, educational schools begun to build; 
 Making progress, but failed to know it, 
      Until Literature welcomed its black slave poet. 
 As famous actors, they played their part; 
      They demanded fame in the world of art; 
 From Colored papers can be traced, 
      The progress of a short freed race. 
 
 Coming from poor farmers our songsters found 
      The door of progress opened to renown; 
 Our graduates of college sought no rest, 
      Until the world had received their best. 
 
 Blacksmiths and carpenters were in demand. 
      Lawyers and doctors each took their stand. 
 Slave orators, the people did address 
      Telling them of the black brother's progress. 
 
 From the pulpit they learned of God; 
     By reading books their minds grew broad; 
 They were honest and loved one another, 
     And never forgot their weaker brother. 
 
 For they by the aid of Providence, 
      Their missionaries to African shores sent,
  To teach them of their own accord, 
      To worship the true and living God. 
 
 Thus many have crossed the reckless sea 
      And seek knowledge of people free 
 To learn, that others they might reach, 
      To return home and their kindred teach. 
 With helping hands go to their defense,
      That their hearts then might be con tent. 
 In school they've learned to be clever; 
      They are taught to stick together 
 
 They have musicians and chorus bands,
      They organize lodges throughout the land; 
 Work in factories of every kind; 
      Being industrious, they'll always labor find. 
 
 Own nice homes and large fertile farms 
      With modern conveniences to multiply their charms. 
 Run hotels and stores in every state, 
      Work on boats, passenger trains and freights. 
 
 In prominent banks they are clerks; 
      For firms they're doing real estate work; 
 Our specialists and dentists are having success, 
      Ranking like the whites, with the best. 
 
 Our editors of papers and magazines, 
      In writing have proved to be serene; 
 Colored stenographers hold positions that pay; 
      Chauffers are hired by months and days. 
 
 Elevator boys are paid by the week; 
      Black cops are bravely guarding their beats; 
 Contractors and plasterers do efficient work; 
      Bankers and business men are thous ands worth. 
 
 Lecturers tell how the black race rose; 
      How great leaders among them were choose; 
 How the bleeding backs from slavery's chains, 
      Rose up to be a people again. 
 
 Clouds of darkness and then shown light 
      That awaken minds to opportunities of life. 
 If this be true why not stand, 
      And demand all rights due to man. 
 
 For though progress we've made 'tis true 
      There is still greater work to do. 
 There should be love for one another; 
      Love that envieth not its brother. 
  
 But delights in mankind's success, 
      That strives in life to be best. 
 When we stand as great men stood, 
      And as a people unite in brotherhood. 
 
 We'll not by other race be passed; 
      Or with the ignorant ones be classed. 
 We'll not in the rear be shoved; 
       We'll not be dispised but loved. 
 
 We'll not be Jim Crowed or scorned; 
      Or hate the day that we were horned. 
 We then can realize education's worth. 
      We'll know how to appreciate free dom's birth. 
 
 We can face the difficulties of life; 
      Can be true to the stars and stripes. 
 Then gladly our enemies we'll befriend. 
      We will help the sons of men. 
 
 And through the land the message send; 
      "We're rising through love and not revenge. 
 We're rising with praise and jubilee song 
      We're rising to righten the wrong." 
 
 "We're rising for we could hot rest. 
      Until the black boys had made progress 
 Rising to praise the ruler of all. 
      Who caused bondage's strong chains to fall. 
 
 Rising as pilgrims of the night; 
      Rising to defend the right; 
 Rising till Ethiophia stretches forth her hands. 
      And claims her people of the land.

 THE COST OF REPENTANCE. 
 (Original Poem by Ada Tessibel Peters.) 
 
 As the Sun sank behind the mountain 
      And the flowers bowed their heads 
 Earth was watered from Heaven's Fountain, 
      While I mourned with my dead. 
 Through the window the stars gazed 
      Upon my mother's form, 
 Listening they heard me pray 
      For all I had was gone. 
 Upon her calm face I read 
      My future destiny 
 Her soul had fled 
      Into Eternity. 
 
 II. 
 
 "Mother," I cry, 
      But she hears me not 
 For motionless she lies 
      Upon my childhood cot. 
 Deep wrinkles I carved 
      Upon her once fair face 
 I've sinned against God  
      Behold the price I pay, 
 Her eyes now closed in sleep 
      With tears I often filled 
 It is now my time to weep 
      For the heart I broke is still. 
 
 III. 
 
 A vision rose before me 
      Revealing my deeds of the past  
 From that scene, I tried to flee 
      But memory held me fast. 
 I saw my comrades dance 
      Down a broad and smooth road 
 At first I thought them emigrants 
      But on their baclcs, they bore no load, 
 Just ahead these words I beheld 
      In letters large and bold 
 "The road that leads to hell 
      To shame and endless woe." 
 
 IV. 
 
 I see my people 
      In the gambling dens 
 Squabbling and cheating 
      As they lose and win. 
 Some child is crying for bread 
      Some poor form trembles with cold 
 It's father to this den is led 
      While poverty knocks at his door. 
 His wife haggard and worn 
      On the verge of death 
 For years this burden has borne 
      Longs for rest, sweet rest. 
 
 V. 
 
 To my pleadings they payed no heed 
      While cruel death lay in wait 
 But with merry and dancing feet 
      Stumbled on to meet their fate 
 Hark I hear Cries of distress 
      Wails and shrieks of woe 
 Prayers of agony ascend for help 
      They are prisoners of the foe 
 Lo, a gulf opens 
      And head long in they fall 
 The dying words that are spoken 
       "Hide me from an, Angry God." 
 
 VI. 
 My comrades on the ball-room floor 
      Are dancing the dance of death 
 Vile men lurk within the door 
      Garbed in the best of dress, 
 Some mother's daughter is deceived 
      As she partakes of wine 
 Her partner's false words are believed 
      For he's attractive and kind. 
 Ah, if she could have read 
      The motive in his heart 
 From his clutch would have fled 
      While her fair name bore no blot. 
 
 VII. 
 I had followed but yesterday 
      This fatal and sinful crowd 
 I found myself trying to pray 
      Pleading with a merciful God 
 I have spurned God's Saints 
      And his words put to scorn 
 Fighting for worldly fame 
      Trying to live alone 
 Mother's prayer has saved me 
      From an early grave 
 My soul from sin she freed 
      Her life for me she gave. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 When my youthful days are o'er 
      And my hair is faded gray 
 When my steps are weak and slow 
      And my form is bent with age, 
 Mother welcome will be 
      That long and sweet repose 
 To live once more with thee 
      In thy blest abode 
 Life's journey'll be ended 
      But friends j'ou'll not forget 
 Humanity's cause I defended 
      When my eye lids are closed in death

 THE DEFENDER OF RIGHT. 
 
 On the lonely bank of Nolin creek, 
      The full moon looked down and smiled 
 While the bubbling waters tried to speak 
      Of the new born loved cabin child. 
 The tall green shaggy forest pine, 
      Round the little log cabin swayed, 
 And seemed to whisper to eighteen nine, 
      We're proud of the sun you gave, 
 Song birds from their lofty height, 
      Sang to sleep the farm house babe, 
And the watch dog through the night, 
     Guarded the crib of sleeping Abe. 
 
II. 
 But time fast on its journey sped, 
      Never tiring of its weary load; 
 And to Indiana Abe Lincoln led, 
      To help find a new abode.  
 The Lincoln family near Gentryville 
      Ceased their long tiresome roam. 
Aided by King forest timber to build, 
     They soon entered their new log home; 
And though unprotected from the cold, 
     Was the rude log planked shelter. 
 Young Abe lived without fret or scold, 
      Till Providence gave them better. 
III. 
The healthy robust country lad, 
     In making new furniture took pride,
For thoughts of living made him glad, 
     In a cabin of four strong sides. 
'Twas in that cabin loft at night 
     Mid the hum of birds and bees,
Our hero dreamed of bonfires bright, 
     On his bed of sweet smelling leaves. 
When restless cattle in their stalls, 
      Lowed for their meal of hay, 
Lincoln went forth to his daily toil, 
      And forgot his dreams of play. 
 
 IV. 
 
 Suddenly in the midst of childhood joy, 
      Came Death, the unwelcome brother. 
 And took from the happy country boy, 
     His kind, loving, faithful mother. 
 The grieved, young, brave loyal heart 
      Beat slow through the hour of pain, 
 Left alone to play a Christian's part 
      Till they'd meet to ne'er part again. 
 When the world was lost in gloom, 
      And mankind was fast asleep 
 Abe wept besides his mother's tomb,
      Till his soul in prayer found peace. 
 
V. 
 Ever upward in life he was reaching, 
      His just debts he always paid, 
 And true to his mothers teaching, 
      He was rightfully called Honest Abe. 
 As a flower comes from its bud, 
      To make the gloomy pathway bright, 
 So the poor son of noble blood 
      Came to cheer man in his strife. 
 Though tired by the fire at night, 
      He would not from duty shirk, 
 But learned how to read and write, 
      Thus preparing for lifes great work. 
 
 VI. 
 
 In the wild forest of Illinois, 
      With no company save his ax, 
 Unaccustomed to life's luxury and joy, 
      He split rails to clothe his back. 
 And though stronger were his brawny arms 
      Than any of the shrewd school lads,
 He was never known to do them harm, 
      For a kind loving heart he had. 
 Ever ready to help those in need, 
      But I want you to understand. 
 He could help a drowning pig, 
      As well as his fellow man. 
 
 VII. 
 
 And as old time grew faster 
      This bare footed boy so free, 
 Became a surveyor and postmaster. 
      And a lawyer honored for honesty. 
 Faithful in little things among the few, 
      There came to him a greater call; 
 Elected four times to State Legislature, 
      And from there to Congress hall,
 But this tall, green, awkward, man 
      Was not ready yet to stop, 
 He was needed for a greater stand, 
      For his place was at the top. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 So the rail splitter's time had come,
      And all that he'd hoped to be; 
 Beneath the stars of sixty one, 
       Stood as President of the free. 
 The loyal defender of Union and Right, 
      Saw a rising struggle mid the brave; 
 While on each side man gave life, 
      He pitied the four million slaves. 
 To preserve the Union was his stand,
      And to protect the Stars and Stripes. 
 But he could not rest while man 
      Was robbed of freedom and right. 
 
 IX. 
 
 In the cherished year of sixty three, 
      Lincoln performed and act of bravery. 
 And his fellow men set free, 
      Forever from the pangs of slavery. 
 Thus the welcomed year of sixty five, 
      Untold joy to mankind brought, 
 Making humanity proud and alive, 
      For the freedom they long had sought. 
 And as ye journey sons of Ham, 
      Forget not how the cause was won,
 By our loyal martyr, God's chosen man, 
      Our true, honored, loved, Abraham Lincoln.

      While infants, in student life, 
 To place our love and trust,
       In the good old Stars and Stripes.

      We must leave you now 
 We go to fight and die 
      That justice may be found.

 MUSING. 
 (By E. P. Peters.) 
 
 I sat by my window at eventide, 
      While the sun sank in the west. 
 I was far from home. 
      And my heart was sad 
 And filled with a keen unrest. 
 
 I sighed for the days that passed.,
      Like pleasant dreams of night, 
 Tears of sadness coursed 
      Down my cheeks, 
 As the sun sank from my sight. 
 
 I thought of all the happy hours, 
      I had spent round the dear home fire, 
 With lessons to learn, 
 And nuts to crack, 
 Not more did my heart desire. 
 
 I longed for the food my mother prepared 
      That now I seemed to taste, 
 I longed for the crumbs,
 From the cubbard shelves,
 That once I used to waste. 
 
 I sighed for the friends I loved so well; 
      But my sighs seemed all in vain; 
 I turned towards the skies,
 And prayed this prayer, 
 "Lord let me get home again." 
 
 "Home where my mother and father dwell 
      Home where abides peace and rest. 
 For I felt like a bird, 
 In a cold strange land, 
 Far from Its native nest. 
 
 Home to the ones that love me; 
      To the friends that never grow old; 
 Who think of me kindly,
 Wherever I am,
 Though others to them grow cold. 
 
 I sit and dream and deeply grieve, 
      For the scenes that are no more; 
 For the sound of my mother's loving voice,
 As she called me,
 From the door. 
 
 I see again my father's face,
      As he called me to his side, 
 And bade me live a noble life, 
      Whatever might betide. 
 
 He bade me in my life at school, 
      What ever else took place,  
 To live for God and fatherland and 
      The honor of my race. 
 
 O, God, do grant my humble cry, 
      And help me on my way; 
 Help me to help my fellow man, and 
      Cheer him on his way.

FOREWORD
Most of my work in verse, hitherto, has been of a
religious nature, samples of which may be found at
the end of this volume. My preference would have
been to publish that volume first, but a humor-loving
public had first say.
It is my firm purpose, however,
to put forth, as soon as possible, a volume devoted
quite, if not exclusively, to devotional, moral, and
religious subjects.

INTRODUCTION
I AM glad to have the privilege of presenting my friend
who, through the medium of these pages, will sing to you.
There was a time when he had stopped singing. I am
responsible for stirring him up to sing again, and there-
fore these pages.
He comes of a race that not only delights to sing but
that sings because it must. It is said of a great singer
that a man who once heard her sing remarked that her
voice, while fine, was a trifle harsh. "Only let me marry
her and break her heart," he said, "and she will sing with
a new sweetness." The man accomplished his purpose,
and it is said that after her heart had become broken
the cantatrice so sang that the angels would hang over
Heaven's parapets to catch the sweetness of her tones.
My friend who writes these verses has entered into
the heritage of a race that is no stranger to sorrow. Thus
here and there will be found the tinge of the sorrow songs
of a race.
But our friend, although he has looked into the valley,
has not dwelt there. Fortunately his father was a man
of aspiration as well as inspiration, and always sought for
his son higher light. As a result the lad had the best
opportunities for education that could be obtained in
schools. Yet he is not a bookworm, as these pages will
show. To him commencement day was really a day for
commencing his larger education. A residence in vari-
ous sections of the country has given him that contact
with men which is, after all, the better part of culture.
There are no books like men.
Nevertheless this student and traveler is a son of the
soil. After a career in the schools, -- literary and profes-
sional, -- after a sojourn in the cities, after a life in touch
with the artificialities,-after all these things he has come
back to the backwoods, to the soil, to the birds, to the
animals, to the plain people Lincoln loved so well. Away
down in the heart of Georgia, where one may not hear
the whistle of the locomotive, I found him, with his books,
his fields, his friends, his work. Here these songs were
sung, and back here, away from the haunts of men, he
is beating out his music.
And, as will be observed by the reader, these verses
reveal the mystic. Combined with the practical wisdom
of a man from the common people, and the humor of one
who sees keenly the foibles and frailties of his fellow-men,
will be found a vein of mysticism that sanctifies the vol-
ume. This singer sees deeper than the human eye can
penetrate and enters, by means of the sixth sense, into that
which is behind the veil. And in this day, when the
world is torn with strife, it will be a joy to go aside and
rest with this mystic in the shade of the Unseen.
In presenting John Wesley Holloway I confidently predict 
that his songs will receive an acceptance such as have
those of no other man of his racial grouping since Dunbar's 
voice was stilled.
HENRY HUGH PROCTOR.
First Congregational Church,
Atlanta, Ga.,
January 16, 1919.
I AM A VOICE
I AM the voice of a race of men
Who lie at the point of death;
I hold mine ear to their fainting lips,
To catch their dying breath.
I gather up the songs they sang
And the words they had to say,
To hoard them till the coming time
Brings in a better day.
I write it down,-the tale of woe
My mother used to tell;
Record my father's story, too,
Who stood his bondage well.
I sing the song of the cabin home
And the banjo on the wall;
I catch the prayer of the sighing saint
To whom "de Lawd" was all.
They one by one have laid them down
In a low plantation grave,
Till rarely one of the host is found
Who says: "I was a slave."
The red-bandana days are gone,
Never to come again;
And the days of freedom, force, and fire
Have dawned for this race of men.
I write for him,-the ignorant,-
Whose true heart was not dark;
Who, though his mind was fettered fast,
Heroic, "made his mark."
The words I write will pass away,
His story may not die;
Sublimer bards will fashion it
Fairer than e'er could I.
I tell of his joy when "burdened down,"
Of his Faith when Hope was dead;
Of duty faithfully performed;
How he bravely fought and bled;
Of his struggle to win himself a name,
To build himself a home;
Of his sacrifice to school his child,
Of his love for "the Kingdom Come."
"Uncle" and "Aunty," curtseying,
No more in force appear;
But a new-born race, in a new-born world,
In a new-born rôle, is here.
Peace to the ashes of the dead;
Success to the brave and new;
Tears for the dying race be shed.
Cheers for the bold and true!
II
I sing of half a hundred years,
Now sped into the past,
To the turning-point of a world-wide war,
That brings us peace at last;
We come at length to the Age of Gold,
To the end of the Age of Lead;
See Phoenix Freedom rise anew,
Out of his ashes dead!
Above a land as green, as fair,
As ever kissed the sun,-
Nested on union, labor, thrift,
Where the Liberty hatch was done,-
"The Eagle in a sky of blue,
Lifts up his mighty head,
On silvery clouds of morning white,
On gold of evening red."
Forever live, Columbia!
Hail, hail, America!
Hail, thou who freest thyself at home,
And champions lands afa'!
Thy stars stand in eternal blue;
Thy bars for aye unfurled;
Thou emblem of a vision true,
Thou hope of all this world!
15
America! America!
God rest Himself in thee!
And rest thou at His Mighty Throne,
Thou Freedom's Sovereignty!
Be armed with all thy holy might!
Prepare Jehovah's way,
Till Justice, Peace, and Righteousness
Hold universal sway!
THE MOCKING BIRD
HILARIOUS, bursting, bubbling thing,—
Fountain of life and mirth,—
By night and day you sit and sing
Carols that charm the earth!
Whence comes that bold Niagaran flood,
Pouring in torrents down?
You gladden me, you stir my blood,
You happy, kingly clown?
Whence? Why, you gathered all the songs
Of all your neighbor birds,
To hymn their rights, to chant their wrongs,
In notes too sweet for words!
The catbirds mew, the robins pipe,
The swallows chirp anew,
And birds of every hue and type
Find fellowship in you!
You lilt the songs of all your kind,
Disdaining not the rote
Wherewith your comrades woo the wind,-
Each with a single note.
A lesson learned: I'll copy you,-
I'll gather from all men
Their softest notes, and then, I, too,
Will pour them out again.
--
THE BIRDS' QUARREL
BIRDS had a quarr'l ovah hyah t'o'r night,—
But Ah nevah quite made out de trouble-
Li'l a'ter sunset, 'bout twilight;
My! but dey did mek a hubble!
A big man bird wid a sweet-tone voice
Wuz a-sayin' so nice, ez 'e flew,
To putty li'l lady-bird, watchin' o' him:
"Ah love you! Ah love you! Ah love you!"
It seem' to tek de lady-bird all b' s'prise.
She studied hard fo' to move it,
Den h'istin' wing, flew tothah way, an' said:
"Prove it! Prove it! Prove it!"
A middle age' lady-bird, preenin' huh wings,
Gittin' ready to go in fo' de night,
Called to de lady-bird flyin' away:
"You're right! You're right! You're right!"
But out f'om de pon' at de back of de lot,
As dey bof rose higher an' higher,
A harsh rough voice screeched out f'om de mud:
"You're a liar! You're a liar! You're a liar!"
Den a pop-eyed bird wid a topknot head,
Lookin' almos' ez wise ez you,
Looked down in de mud at de lon'-leg t'ing,
An' arst of 'im: "Who? Who? Who?"
F'om a fine young co'nfiel' ovah de way,
Rose a bird wid a well-filled craw,
He seemed mighty anxious fo' to keep down de fuss,
Fo' 'e kep' sayin': "Pshaw! Pshaw! Pshaw!"
A dainty li'l t'ing on a Cherokee rose,-
Ve'y modes' an' gentle to me,
Wouldn' tek neithah side, but twitted 'em all,
Sayin': "Fiddle-de-dum! Fiddle-de-dum! Fiddle-
de-dee!"
A mothah was callin' huh wanderin' boy,
To git 'im away f'om de fight,
So solumn dat a mockin' bird didn' mock huh,
Ez she called out to de lad: "Bob White! Bob
White! Bob White!"
Anothah oneasy li'l ma'am cried out,—
'Bout huh husban', 'twas easy to see,—
To a scared li'l Bobby Bird whirrin' away:
"Wait-fo' Mr. McCree! Wait-fo' Mr.
McCree!"
Dat minute Ah notussed a sparkin' young pa'r,
In de top of a deep leafy dome;
Didn' see whut de fellar had done, but she wailed:
"You're a naughty boy! Ah'm gwine home!"
An' ol' mo'h'r Ree wuz callin' huh Jo,-
Not anxious,-Ah'm boun' to agree;
Ah jedge she wuz ig'nant o' trouble gwine on,
Fo' she quietly called: "Jo Ree! Jo Reel"
An' all dis time a ciccady ban'
Wuz a-chunnin' up in de trees;
An' a do-re-mi concert out by de pon'
Wuz a-movin' along wid ease.
But de fuss kep' a-growin', gittin' higher an' higher,
Till a bird sung out in a treble,
Lightin' in a cedar tree ovah mah head:
"Kick lak de debul! Kick lak de debul!"
Again f'om de wise one: "Who? Who? Who?"
Fo' answer echoed de treble,
'Way cross de rice pon' ovah de swamp:
"Kick lak de debul! Kick lak de debull"
A batch'ler maid in a willer tree,
Whar 'is ugly words could reach 'er,
Woke up wid a start an' a pious scream,
Ez she hurried out: "Preachah! Preachah!
Preachah!"
A weak voice asked: "W'at's 'at? W'at's 'at?"
Seemin❜ly wantin' to he'p 'ah;
Till a strong one answerin', knowin❜ly said:
"She's peppah! She's peppah! Peppah!"
De sparrer was boostin': "Peace! Peace! Peace!"
De ducks an' geese come flockin';
But de cry was drowned by a big flock o' geese,
An' de peckah-wood was knockin'.
De owl ha! ha'd! de catbird hissed!
A rain-crow Ah recall;
A bull-bat, too, was dippin' in,
An' de blue jay, meanes' of all.
But Ah wuz 'temptin' to 'termine de side,
Whar de kick-bird wuz tekin' 'is stan';
An' 'e didn' tell me, an' 'e didn' tell de owl,
Wid de scrap spreadin' ovah de lan'.
But Ah made up mah min',-don' know 'bout de
owl,-
1
Dat w'enevah yo' git into trouble
Smooth it all off jest ez nice ez yo' can,
If yo' mus' kick, kick lak de debul!
Oh, dis worl's a fussy an' a funny ol' worl',
Whut time yo' don' hafter grieve 'ere,
Fo' jes' den de clock on de mantel struck twelve,
Ez Ah heard: "Yo' gotta leave 'ere! Yo' gotta
leave'ere!"
Den Ah t'ought on life, an' Ah t'ought on deat',
T'ings dat always puzzles mah head;
But Ah quieted down wid de frogs an' de birds,
An' Ah ambled off to bed.
THE PESSIMIST
HIT's a crime to steal a chicken,
So de starvin' poo' are taught;
'Tain't no crime to steal a million,-
All de crime's in gittin' caught.
'Sright to undermine yo' neighbor,
Spile his business if yo' can;
Tumble down his reputation,
Only, do it lak a man.
Seems to be a sacred duty
Fo' de rich to 'press de poo';
But it's wrong to kick yo' neighbor,
Till he's prone upon de floo'.
Poo' man got to go it 'umble,
Till 'e git de upper han',
Den 'e got to sco'n de people,
W'at don't own no house an' lan'.
'Tain't no harm to shoot a robin
Singin' merry on de tree;
Hit jes' spo't to kill a rabbit,
Hit jes' fun to rob a bee.
Blue grass 'posin' on de meadah,
Cattle 'posin' on de grass;
Poo' man 'posin' on de cattle,
An' de rich man on de mass.
Well, Ah'm feelin' kind o' t'irsty;
Here's a watermelon patch!
Guess Ah'll 'pose upon somebody,—
'Thout Ah meet up wid mah match.
MOON AND STAR
(The night of May 5, 1916)
O MOON and Star,
How fair you are,
Up there in the sky!
Sky so blue,
Golden, too,
Underneath the two of you.
Twilight fades;
Deeper shades
Gather in the trees;
Moon and star
Brighter are
In the sky afar.
How you glow,
Bright as snow
In a streak of light!
Pale the rest,-
E'en the best,-
All eyes seek the west!
First o' May,
Lovely day,
Night calm and serene;
Blooming trees,
Swarming bees,
Green lawns, grassy leas!
Yard apart,
Head and heart,
Just you two up there;
Shine together,
Crown the weather,
Springtime everywhere!
DISCOURAGED
TELL yo' what, mon, Ah'm discouraged!
Been a man since forty-fo';
Nevah had de luck Ah'm havin',
Since Aun' Katy barred de doo'.
Rain a-fallin' ever' mornin',
Storm a-comin' ever' night;
Nevah see sich nasty weathah,
Since de Lawd gi' me mah sight!
Boll-worm eatin' up de cotton;
Mildew eatin' up de co'n;
'Taters in de groun' a-rottin',-
Wush ol' Gabul blow 'is ho'n!
Colry killin' off de cattle;
Rabbits eatin' up mah peas;
Some on' stealin' all mah mellins;
Chickens dyin' wid disease.
Can' stir roun' fo' so much watah,-
Settin' roun' bof night an' mo'n,—
Grass a-growin' lak de dickuns,
Woe is me dat Ah wuz bo'n!
Dar's dat sto' man actin' funny,
Othah's pressin' fo' deir pay;
If Ah had a little money,
Fo' de Lawd, Ah'd run away!
Cross ol' 'oman, bawlin' chil'en,
To mah finish sholy p'ints;
'Sides, Ah feel mos' lak Ah'm dyin',
Wid dis mis'ry in mah j'ints;
'Clar' to goodness Ah'm discouraged!
Dough Ah'm Christ'an thu an' thu,
Le' me have a jug o' licker,
Ain' no tellin' what Ah'd do!
QUILLS
OH, de banjer's fo' de cabin,
An' de bones is fo' de pan,
De guitar's fo' de pahlah,
An' de drum is fo' de ban';
But dar is a kind o' music dat des suits de woods
an' hills:
Hit's a whoop! an' a toot!
An' a picanin' to boot,
Wid a "Oo-lalla-oo!" to de quivah of de quills!
W'en yo' hyah it in de mornin',
Erbout de break o' day,
'Way ovah cross de meadahs,
A mile or two away,
Yo' c'n hol' yo' bref an' lis'n till yo' livah fairly
th'ills!
Hit's a whoop! an' a toot!
An' a nappy head to boot,
Wid a "Oo-lalla-oo!" to de quivah of de quills!
Yo' c'n break up de pianny!
T'row de organ in a heap!
De banjer, bones, an' guitar's
Plenty good ernough to keep!
But de whistle of de fores' an' de chatter of de
rills
Is a whoop! an' a toot!
An' a raggedy rat to boot,
Wid a "Oo-lalla-oo!" to de quivah of de quills!
To me hit's jest a mem❜ry
Of w'en Ah wuz a boy:
Ah used to hyah it ever' day,
An' ever' time wid joy!
Hit 'uz better dan a doctor wid a coffin-full o'
pills:
'Twas a whoop! an' a toot!
An' a woolly head to boot,
Wid a "Oo-lalla-oo!" to de quivah of de quills!
FAËRY QUEEN
MERRILY and cheerily
O'er the hill she comes;
Prettily and wittily
Through the grove she hums.
Hurriedly and flurriedly
O'er everything she runs,
Making billows on the wheat,
And turning eyes to suns.
Easily and pleasingly
She bids us be polite,
Or else she'll take our hats away
And keep them off till night.
Blund'ringly and wond'ringly
We ask her whence she comes;
Smilingly, beguilingly,
She shakes her head and hums.
Playfully and gayfully
She courts a pretty cloud;
And when he makes an awkward move,
She always laughs aloud.
Willfully and skillfully
The sparrow leaves her nest,
And flying to the Faëry's,
It twitters on her breast.
Knowingly and showingly
Calm Nature likes her touch,
For every time she passes by,
His looks improve so much!
Faëry Queen, Faëry Queen,
We bless you every day!
We long to feel your tender touch
When you are far away!
But you will come again in spring,
With all your old sweet way;
For, dear, you are no other than—
Miss Pleasant Breeze of May!
DOWN TO FARMER JOE'S
It's a happy time an' hearty,-
Ever'body goes,—
When dar's gwine to be a pahty
Down to Fahmah Joe's.
He jes' chins up to his fiddle,
An' 'e gits 'is heel a-gwine,
Pulls de bow across de middle,
An' 'e sets dat t'ing a-cryin'!
W'en yo' ketch yo'se'f you're amblin'
To de middle o' de floo',
Wid yo' pardner round a-ramblin'
To de call o' Fahmah Joe.
Hear 'im holler, "Swing de co'nahs!"
"Ladies, sachez back again!"
"Gent'men, give yo' ladies honahs!"
"Ever'body balancin'!"
W'en yo're standing still, yo're jumpin'
In de middle o' de air,
Clappin' han's,-an' how yo're humpin'!
Feel jes' lak yo' got to r'ar!
Got to smile roun' at yo' lady;
Got to take huh by de arm;
Got to cake walk whar it's shady,
Down to Uncle Joie's fahm.
B'mbye de rooster crows fo' midnight,
Den Aun' Judy teks a han';
"Come," she says, "an' git a li'l bite!"—
Not'in finer in de lan'!
W'en it's ovah, back to dancin';
"One mo' set befo' yo' go!"
Sich anothah jinks an' prancin'
Roun' dat ol' log-cabin floo'!
All de gals git lookin' at yo',
Smilin' sweet an' lovin', too;
Boys a-frownin', sayin', "Drat yo'!"
An' dey're hintin' roun' at you.
Den you holler out, "Ah'm goin'!"
Flingin' open wide de doo';
All de gals come round you flowin',
In a grea' big ring,—jes' so!
Lak a prince you walk among 'em,
As dey scuffle fo' yo' ahm;
Tho de othah fellars brung 'em,
You're deir doughty champion.
Off you march in all yo' glory,
Lookin', feelin', brave an' bol',
Tho you feel anothah story
Mus' be swiftly, quickly told.
Soon de naughty fellows shock yo'
W'en dey yell wid dreadful soun';
Den dey stay behin' an' rock yo',
Ever' blessed step to town.
You jes' herd yo' flock an' leave 'em,
Each one at huh mothah's doo';
An' yo' do yo' bes' to grieve 'em,—
T'ings yo' got to undergo.
But it's not de boys dat git yo'
W'en yo' thoo yo' winder creep,-
It's yo' mammy's rattan hit yo',
W'en yo' t'ought huh fast asleep.
But yo' hardly feel de whiskin',
An' yo' sca'cely min' de blows;
Fo' yo' heart is dancin', friskin',
Wid de gals at Fahmah Joe's.
PLOWIN' CANE
HOL' up yo' haid, ol' mule, I say!
I know you t'ink dis cane is hay,
You're trained to leave dat co'n alone,
But dis 'ere cane's anothah one:
"Twan't made fo' mules, hit's made fo' men;
An' don't you bite dat stuff again!
Hit's strange to me dat you don' know
Hit's bettah to let de green t'ings grow
Till harves' time; hit's sweeter den,
Besides, 'twill be as much again.
But you'd bite down de growin' grain,
An' starve w'en snowflakes sweep de plain.
But I don' know. Perhaps to God
I'm bad as you. Hit's mighty odd,
But lots o' t'ings I should leave alone
Till harves' time, I bite 'em down;
And fruits He meant fo' 'ternity,
I t'ink are none too good fo' me.
I go to war an' shoot His men;
I kill His oaks an' feel no sin:
If I was wise an' jes' but knew,
Dar's worse'n dat I 'spec' I do,—
Lay rash han's on His treasures rare,
An' de angels wonder how I dare.
An' I been taught temptation's way,
To watch an' fight, an' strive, an' pray;
But you ain' had no teachin' 'tall,
An' I'm yo' God,—but dat ain't all:
You know yo' right to a wisp o' hay,
An' yo' t'ink you're robbed o' your lawful prey
W'en I mek yo' leave dis sorghum be,
An' I know you t'ink it's mean o' me.
Well, eat some mo'; we'll soon be done;
A mule deserves a little fun;
An' may my God look on me, too,
Jes' lak I'm lookin' on to you!
WOOD-NYMPHS
OH, I know a shady nook,
Where the saucy wood-nymphs play;
Through it runs a babbling brook,
Whither gentle breezes stray.
Violets deck its mossy sides,
Sparrows twitter in the trees;
Sweet it murmurs as it glides
Gently o'er the mossy leas.
It is there that life is sweetest,
When the flowers are bathed in dew;
Nature's joys are then completest,
When the day is bright and new.
Oh, the wood-nymphs are beguiling,
And they charm my senses so!
For, anon, I catch me smiling
O'er some scene of long ago.
All the sweetest days of childhood,
All the things I loved most dear,
Rise before me in this wildwood,
Bringing light and hope and cheer:
Schooldays, parties, notes, and glances,
Moonlight rides through wood and glade,
Fiddler Bob's and merry dances,
Happy strolls in sun and shade!
Dear old faces rise before me,
In the gladness of this hour;
All the charm of youth steals o'er me,
With its strange, unearthly power.
There was Hester! How I loved her!
She, my first and purest joy!
But, alas! aside I shoved her
When she loved another boy!
There were Sallie, Susie, Carrie,
With each once I played the dunce;
But I none of them would marry,—
Man can never love but once.
Hark! The sun is mounting higher;
I must leave this bosky dell!
Schooltime draws each moment nigher-
Horrors! There's the breakfast bell!
AUNT BETSY'S CHRISTMAS DINNER
GUESS Ah'll set hyah at de en',-
Plenty elbow room!-
Been gwine hongry two, t'ree days,
Waitin' fo' dis to come!
An' since de blessin' done been ax',
An' business set a-gwine,
Let ever'body he'p hisse'f,
Ah'm gwine on down de line!
Aun' Betsy's Chris'mas dinners, mon,

Whoevah gits a chance to come,
Gits w'at 'e wants to eat!

De way mah honger leans;
Jes' he'p mah plate up good an' strong
To dat bacon an' dem greens!
De way she beats a biscuit, sah,
An' bakes a pone o' bread,
An' brews a bar'l o' simmon beer.
'Ould tu'n a prince's head!
My goodness!-uh, uh!-Hyah dey come,
Hot Yankee po'k an' beans!
Ah know Aun' Betsy cooks 'em good,
But-Pass me back dem greens!
A Frenchman couldn' brown a fish
De way Aun' Betsy can;
An' de way crab gumbo acts fo' huh-
W'y, honey, it beats de ban'!
Dat chicken roas' 'ould mek a dish
'At's fit fo' kings an' queens;
Aun' Betsy's han's is prime at dat,
But Shove me back dem greens!
Dat coffee smoke 'ould mek yo' smile,
As fur as you c'n smell;
But w'n yo' scent huh chicken pie,
Hit hot an' pipin',-well!
An' sassage sniffin' thyme an' sage,
Han'-stuffin',-no machines,
An' hot fried chicken, Glory be!
But-Jes' once mo', dem greens!
An' w'en she boils a pot o' rice
An' puts de gravy in,
De man dat tu'ns his back on dat,
He mos' commits a sin!
Dat possum wid dem 'taters roun'
Jes' fits mah cut o' jeans;
Not quite ready fo' 'im yet,
Jes'-reach me roun' dem greens!
An' w'en she smoke an' fry a ham,
Or bile 'im till 'e cream,
Jes' shet yo' eyes an' go to sleep!
Hit sholy is a dream!
Dem chitlin's, long wid cracklin' bread,
Remin' me o' mah 'teens;
La! la! dey's good,-Ah know dey is!
But-Please, ma'am, pass dem greens!
Ah wush Ah wuz a elerphunt,
Ah'd do dis dinner jus'!
Ain' got no room fo' not'n' else,—
Ah gotta quit or bus'!
One little tas'e o' 'tater pie-
Ah'll resk dem colic peens-
But won't you pass dat pan once mo'?
Ah'll finish up dem greens!
SUNRISE ON THE FARM
SICH a singin' in de trees!
Sich a hummin' o' de bees!
Sich a sweet an' holy calm!
Roun' de meadows cowbells ring,
Stirrin's ever' livin' thing,
W'en yo' wake at daybreak,-fo' sunrise on
de farm.
Kittens purrin' at yo' leg,
Puppies prancin'-on de beg,
Pidgins lightin' on yo' arm,
Daisies bloomin' at yo' feet,
Dewy grass and roses sweet,
W'en yo' come downstairs at daybreak on
de farm.
Pigs a-squealin' in de pen,
Heifers lowin' to git in,
Biddies scootin' 'way f'om harm;
Dobbin swishin' at de flies,
Bats a-flappin' 'cross de skies,
W'en yo' walk abroad at sunrise on de farm.
Far away de river flowin',
Here an' yonder rooster crowin',—
Noises full o' soothin' balm;-
Sich a click an' clack an' clutter!
Sich a flip an' flap an' flutter!
W'en yo' 'proach de barnyard at feed-time
on de farm.
Catbird callin' to his mate,
June-bug buzzin' th'u de gate-
W'at enchantment! W'at a charm!
Mocker trillin' in de glen!
Blue-jay, swallow, coot, an' wren
Greet yo' happy ears at sunrise on de farm.
Feed de chickens, milk de cows,
Hitch de mules up to dem plows,—
Sun's a-shinin' bright an' warm!
Eat a bite, an' kiss de pump,-
Bet yo' life yo' got to hump,
W'en it's plantin' time at sunrise on de farm!
THE CORN SONG
JES' beyan a clump o' pines,-
Lis'n to 'im now!-
Hyah de jolly black boy,
Singin', at his plow!
In de early mornin',
Thoo de hazy air,
Loud an' clear, sweet an' strong,
Comes de music rare:
"O mah dovee, Who-ah!
Do you love me? Who-ah!
Who-ah!"
An' as 'e tu'ns de cotton row,
Hyah 'im tell 'is ol' mule so;
"Whoa! Har! Come 'ere!"
Don't yo' love a co'n song?

Ever'body list'nin',
In de neighborhood!
Standin' in yo' front doo'
In de misty mo'n,
Hyah de jolly black boy,
Singin in de co'n:
"O Miss Julie, Who-ah!
Love me truly, Who-ah!
Who-ah!"
Hyah 'im scol' 'is mule so,
W'en 'e try to mek 'im go:
"Gee! Whoa! Come 'ere!"
O you jolly black boy,
Yod'lin' in de co'n,
Callin' to yo' dawlin',
In de dewy mo'n,
Love 'er, boy, forevah,
Yodel ever' day;
Only le' me lis'n,
As yo' sing away:
"O mah dawlin'! Who-ah!
Hyah me callin'! Who-ah!
Who-ah!"
Tu'n aroun' anothah row,
Holler to yo' mule so:
"Whoa! Har! Come 'ere!"
GARDENING
OH, what joy in merry Maytime,
In the merry morning, too,
Just to walk abroad at gray time,
When the grass is laved in dew!—
Just to walk among your flowers,
Hovered o'er with buzzing wings,
There to spend the cheerful hours,
Lookin' at the growin' things!
How the collards are a-jumpin'!
How the pea-vines spread around!
How the lettuce is a humpin'!
How the squashes kiver groun'!
Goodness, how the grass is growin'!
Wow!-that nettle-how it stings!
Bugger! You shan't git a showin'
With my precious growin' things!
There's a lily bowin' at you,
With a gauze-wing poising near;
Blooming zinnias! There's a,-drat you!—
Black gnat thund'rin' in my ear!
Just a little wind and weather,-
Just the kind that kind o' clings,-
Till the rain has soaked the heather,
Then you'll see some growin' things:
English pease and greens for dinner,
Cauliflower and new potatoes.
Make these beets a little thinner,
Gather in these red tomatoes.
What is life without a garden,
And the good things Maytime brings,
As you watch the soft stems harden
And you grow with growin' things?

THE ROBIN'S LAY
OH, I breathe the balmy air,-
As I sing, as I sing,—
Skimming through the sky so fair,
As I sing.
Sweet I sniff the gentle breeze,
As it wafts among the trees,
To the hum of busy bees,
As I sing.
I am working with a will,--
As I sing, as I sing,-
In a willow by the mill,
As I sing.
I am doing there my best,
As I build my cosy nest,
Though I never stop to rest
As I sing.
-
How I make the echoes ring,-
As I sing, as I sing,-
Nature seems a living thing,-
As I sing.
When I fly across the dell,
And I see that all is well,
Joys I feel that none can tell,
As I sing.
I am happy all the day,-
As I sing, as I sing,-
Swiftly flee the hours away,
As I sing.
I see such delicious things,
Where the ripples part in rings,
While I preen my pretty wings,
As I sing.
Ah! and now my nest is done!—
As I sing, as I sing,-
And the eggs in it are one,
As I sing.
I am happy more and more,
For the one has changed to four;
I shall have some birdies, sure,
As I sing.
I am staying now at home,-
As I sing, as I sing,—
Mother birds should never roam,
Though they sing.
Now I see my grand array,
As they all around me play;
Oh, what sweetness they display,
As I sing.
Soon they'll flit from tree to tree,—
As I sing, as I sing,—
Soon they'll wander far from me,
As I sing.
Soon they'll build their own sweet
home,
Resting near its palace dome,
When the springtime days are come,
As I sing.
Ah, the frost has come again,-
As I sing, as I sing,-
And the forest trees complain,
As I sing.
He has stripped those pretty trees,
He has shaken off their leaves.
How it all my spirit grieves,
As I sing!
Life is coming to an end,-
As I sing, as I sing,-
Death is flying in the wind,
As I sing.
Well I know that winter's near.
I must take my leave of here,
Far away my course to steer,
As I sing.

DREAM SONG
TEARDROPS fill mine eyes, sweetheart,
Whene'er I think of you,
Your loving lips, your sparkling eyes,
Your tender heart and true!
Your gentle voice still thrills my soul,
As in the days gone by;
As when we wandered side by side
Together, you and I.
I see you dressed in white, sweetheart,
A rosebud in your hair
That glistens like an aureole
Above your brow so fair.
You hold your bonnet by a string;
A smile lights up your eye;
As side by side in merry May,
We wandered, you and I.
Long years have come and gone, sweetheart,
But still I mourn for you;
The world of men has all proved false,
And you alone are true;
Mine eyes are dimming to the world,
But sparkling to the sky,
And soon we'll wander once again
Together, you and I.

WHEN LINDY PLAYS A RAG
Chacun à son goût.
I HAVE listened to de masters,
I have hyard de Navy Ban';
I have hyard de fines' singers,
Evah traveled thoo de lan';
I have seen de bonny Scotsman
Playin' pibrochs on his bag;
But I ruther set an' lis'n
When Lindy plays a rag!
I have hyard de banjo ringin',
"Jes' beside de cabin doo" ";
I have hyard de darkies wingin'
Roun' de ol' log cabin floo';
I have hyard de big pipe organ
Mek de rafters crack an' sag;
But yo' nevah hyard no music
Till Lindy plays—a rag!
Fust, yo' feels yo' pulses quicken,
Den yo' break into a smile;
Den yo' catch yo'se'f a-larfin'
Till dey hyah yo' 'arf a mile;
Den yo' knees begin to quivah,
An' yo' might be on a jag,
Fo' yo' feel you're drunk all ovah,
When Lindy plays a rag!
I have sot an' watched a preachah
Try to keep his face in trim;
You could see his breast a-heavin'
Till it swell' up to de brim;
Den yo' ketch his teef a-shinin',
An' his jaw begins to swag;
He jes' lif's his voice an' hollers,
When Lindy plays a rag!
Hit will drive away yo' troubles;
Hit will mek yo' want to dance;
Ef yo' don' know how to do it,
Hit will sholy mek yo' prance!
Nevah saw de birds stop singin',
But I've seen a lively nag
Cut de buckhead in de stable
When Lindy plays—a rag!
Ef I evah git to glory,
An' I hyah de angels sing,
An' I hyah de silver trumpets
Thoo de cou'ts o' heaben ring,
I will nevah hyah no music
Dat can please me,-an' no brag,—
Bettah dan de kin' dat's ringin'
When Lindy plays—a rag!

"Mean it?" 'Deed Ah do!-
An', r'ally, any kind o' girl
Ain't good enough fer you!
A flouncy, fluffy, baby girl
Can' mek a man a wife;
Fo' sparkin' roun' dey're fine, but not
To tie up to fer life!
A nice hard workin'man lak you,
Deserves a happy home;
But sugar kisses melt away
W'en honeymoons are gone.
A home means work as well as love,—
To scrub an' patch an' stew;
An' while not braggin' on mahse'f,
Ah know whut Ah c'n do!
"Don't love dat gal?" Don't say dat, Jim,
You t'ink mah eyes can' see?
Now, don't you 'spicion a single time,
Ah want yo' to mar'y me!
No! Ah'm not anxious! Go to huh!
Hang on huh baby breat'-
"Want me?" Well, buss me, Jim, an' Ah'll
Be yo's until muh deat'!
CRISSY
I CALLED at Crissy's cabin home-
A feast of eyes in store;
Her granny placed a chair for me,
Before the open door.
But Crissy wasn't in the room,
Nor anywhere in sight;
Perhaps she loiters by the spring,
And won't be home till night.
There's not a sound of any kind
To make me think her near,
And granny does not seem to know
I've come to see my dear;
And tho' she tries to keep my company,
And says good things and true,
I came to see another girl,
And nothing else will do.
And just as I am standing up,
To try my luck once more,
My Juno steps fullfledged from out
Behind that cabin door.
She saw me when I turned the lane,
And joyed to see me come;
But first she hies herself away
To that queer dressing room.
Next time I miss her when I call,
I'll be absolutely sure
The little minx is dolling up,
Behind that very door.

YOUTH
I FIND my manhood strong and steady;
Memory strong and ever ready;
Hearing good and life entrancing;
Something learned, and still advancing;
And yet, I've lost a fervid flavor,
As though the salt had lost its savor;
A sweetness of the days gone by,
Ever haunts my memory.
Youth, O Youth, why hast thou fled me?
Experience, whither hast thou led me?
'Tis oh, for the warmth of long ago!
'Tis, ah! for the chill of this land of snow!
Oh, for youth's poetry and mystery!
Ah, for manhood's day of prose and history!
I would not lose what God has given,
But my soul-sigh for the bliss of heaven
Is, oh, for the time to come in truth,
When age shall drink at the fount of youth!

DAT SUSIE GAL
WENT callin' on dat Susie gal
'Istidy a'ternoon;
An' mebbe, Ah'm gwi' call again,
But it won't be very soon!
She los' a good pervider,-

An' Ah went dar jest a-pu'pose
Fo' to offah huh mah han'!
"How wuz it?" Well, Ah tell yo';
'Twarn't no fault o' hern,
But all de same Ah've shook 'uh,
An',. say, yo' git me? Durn!
Ah told 'uh Ah wuz comin',
So she met me at de doo';
Dressed to kill in silk an' satin;
She wuz lookin' sweet fo' sho!
De mirrah in de hatrack
Pictu'ed out a stunnin' pa'r!
She'd a pink upon huh bosom,
An' a rosebud in huh ha'r.
"Won't you walk into de pahlah?"
Wid dat fetchin', killin' smile!
An' she raised de winder-cu'tains,
Sparkin' wif me all de while.
"Have a seat here in de rocker!"
An' Ah looked aroun' to see;
Hit was some'n' on a platform,—
Altogethah new to me!
Ah was jubous o' dat contraption,
But Ah nevah once let on,
So down Ah sot, an' r'ared 'way back!
But de pesky t'ing,-plague on!—
Nevah stopped! Hit rolled right ovah
Lak a buggy-wheel down hill;
Flung me double-summersetts,
An' jammed me 'gin de winder-sill!
Dar Ah wuz!-a wreck, bar gracious!
Evah bone widin me broke!
'Spenders poppin', buttons flyin',
Tell yo', man, hit warn't no joke!
"Was Ah hu't?" W'y, mah bloomers bu'sted
Lak Ah run into a mule!
Wors'n all, dat Susie sniggled,
Till she larfed out lak a fool!
'Twar' not'n' lef' fo' me to do
But to ax to be excused;
Mah clodin' ruint, mah feelin's hu't,
Mah lovin' heart abused!
Ah'm sho it warn't no fault o' mine,
An' mebbe 'twasn't hern;
But all de same Ah've shook 'uh,
An', say, yo' git me? Durn!

An' Ah wush dat you would marry me!
Hello, Miss Melerlee!

HAVE I BUT YOU
I CARE not if the roses fade
In autumn's chilling dew,
If winter weight be overlaid,-
Have I but you.
The grass may wither, fade, and fall,
"Twill bloom in spring anew;
But ah, my sweet, I lose my all
Have I not you!
In summer's sun, in winter's shade,
Oh, be thou ever true;
Naught matters much with me, sweet maid,
Have I but you.

THE DOXOLOGY
"TWAS Sunday night at Sugar Hill,
The message fell like hail;
And this with many a groan and shout
Had made poor sinners quail.
But every lane must have its turn,
And as the people say,
Not, "Every cat must have her night,"
But, "Every dog his day."
Mourners called, collection in,—
The latter rather scant,—
Lifting his hands the parson said:
"Dismiss us, Deacon Gant!"
But Deacon Gant, forgetting all,
And, squatting in the shade,
Was swapping horses, and was now
About to close the trade.
"Brer Gant! Brer Gant!" from mouth to mouth
The whispered order ran;
The deacon, very much perturbed,
Arose and thus began:
8
?
"Lawd, mek us truly, humbly thankfu’
W'at we 'bout to 'ceive!"
(If I ain't gone stark natal mad,
Ah r'ally do believe!)
"Alast! an' did mah Saviour bleed-
(Ugh! ugh! now, dat ain't it)
"Hark f'om de tombs a doneful soun'-
(Ah mus' be hav'n' a fit!)
"Praise God f'om whomse all blessin's flow-
(Naw, mussy! dat ain't it!
Ah'll try once mo', plague take it all!
Den, hit or miss, Ah'll quit!)
Now Ah lay me down to sleep-
To mansions in de-(Hell f-f-f-!)
Ah'm feelin' sort o' sick, Brer Paster,
Jes' say dat t'ing yo' self!"

THE DEVIL
JESTUS hu'ts nobody,
An' r'ally, on de levul,
Hit's time some good man spoke
A good word fo' de devul.
Yo' hyah some folks complainin'
De devul's a'ter dem;
But truf compels de mention,
Dey're trapsein' a'ter him.
Dey crowd his halls an' pahlahs,
Dey th'ong his games an' parks,
Dey encore all his antics
An' shout at his remarks;
Dey leave de good folks prayin',
De preachah in his stan';
An' pay to see de devul
An' his onholy ban'.
Dey love to tease an' flatter him,
Rej'ice to hyah 'im sung;
But nevah note a Christ'an—
Excep' to see 'im hung.
But 'e nevah seems to bothah
De man whose heart is true.
If you don' plague de devul
He'll nevah bothah you.
Dough doubtless black an' wicked,
By good repo't 'tis said
He'll be de means o' bringin'
A good t'ing to a head.
De devul is a tempter,
But, fo' de crowd, Ah'm sho
Dat, 'stid o' foll'in' a'ter dem,
He's marchin' on befo'.

Ugh! ugh! folks, dis stuff is col'!

"Here's anothah one come to be baptize,
Be baptize, be baptize,

Won't work a-tall, an' 'tain't no count;
But dey won't lak you any day
Onless you do jes' w'at it say!

Tekin' 'em now is all de go!

Onless yo' gi' 'em up yo' hide!
"Goin' 'em two" jes' meks 'em smile!
An' dey won' go you 'alf a mile!
But hyah 'em snortin' evah day
Onless you go dem all de way!

BUSINESS RELIGION

Honesty's a fiction,
Policy's de go;
Evahbody's doin' it,
Wha's mo'!
Preachahs ain' preachin' it,
But dey're livin' it;
We're all hypocrites,
Mo' yit!
Fasn' to yo' money!
Le' me tell yo' twice:
Yo' jes' can' live

Ketch a fellar nappin',
Hol' 'im to de light;
Buil' up yo' own se'f,

Nevah tetch a fellar
Tumblin' to 'is fall;
Or you're not'n' but a Chris'an,-

Y'ORTER been to chu'ch dis mornin',
'At's all Ah got to say:
Tell yo' what, dat colored preachah
Sho did preach to-day!
Mon, he walked de walls o' Zion,
Some'n' sweet an' prime,—
"W'at de tex'?" Well, Ah forgit,
But 'e sho did preach one time!
Ah've hyard lots o' pow'ful sermonts,
Ah mighty well recall;-
"W'at de subjic'?" Don't remember;
Dis one heads 'em all!
Saint an' sinner got a blessin',
Ever' word was true;
"W'at 'e say?" Well, 'clar' to gracious,
Done forgit dat, too!
Ah know he made me shoutin' happy!
Dat's still widin mah reach!
All de res' done gone
an' lef' me,-
But, honey, he sho did preach!

BAP! TISM!
Ан tek mah tex' dis mornin'
F'om de 'Pistle o' 'Postle John:
He was a Hard-shell Baptis',
Long 'fo' he was bo'n.
But dat's anothah quest'on;
Ah'm gwine to prove to-day,
Dat 'e baptize folks
In de Hard-shell way.
Mah tex' says here,—
Widout a spark o' doubt,-
Dat 'e went straight in,
An' 'e come straight out.
If dat ain' what 'e meant,
It's jes' what 'e said;
An' it sho don' mean
A little watah on yo' head!
An' Ah notus Pedo-Baptis',
Clear ovah all de lan',
Don' go into de watah
Wid a pitcher in dey han'.
But Ah got a proof dis mornin',
Dat'll enter in yo' eye;
An' if it don't convince you,
Ah can' see why.

Ain' nobody doubts
Erbout de soul's conversion;
An' Ah don' see why dey should
'Bout de body an' ermersion.
Ah git mah testermony
F'om de Bible on de she'f;
But Ah got a long sight bettah one
F'om de watah se'f.
An' Ah wan' 'o have yo' notus
Dat dis 'er ain't no ism;
Fo' yo' back says, "Bap!"
An' de watah says, "tism!"
FACTS ABOUT LIES
Of all the facts about a lie,
I've been surprised to know
How quickly they can get around,
How fast and far they go.
While Truth is doubling up in bed
To push the cover down,
The Lie is dressed and out and gone,
And half-way over town.
A lie is easy to believe,
But Truth is hard to swallow;
A lie will bring a thousand pounds,
Where Truth can't fetch a dollar.
1
Truth is like a terrapin;
A lie is like a bird;
A lie will catch the eye of men,
Where Truth's nor seen nor heard.
Some people are Missourians,
But most of them, I fear,
Never believe a thing they see,
But only what they hear.
1
A lie can be preposterous,
The Truth may catch and bell it;
The lie needs do one only thing:
Just get some one to tell it.
A lie and Truth fell in a wood,
The world went passing by;
They shouldered Falsehood, took him home,
And left poor Truth to die.
Truth screamed out in the market place;
His voice around him whirled;
A liar whispered and his voice
Was heard around the world.
These are some facts about a lie,
Enough to show the sin
Of speaking carelessly, and, too,
Repeating things of men.
SAN JUAN!
OH, list the stirring story
That is told of San Juan!
Of Roosevelt's Rough Riders,
And the fate they fell upon!
This hill, the point of vantage,
Withstood a bold attack
From tried and trusty soldiers,
And these had fallen back.
The colonel, through his glasses,
Had seen it from afar;
He drew nigh with his cavalry
And loosed his dogs of war.
"Up, men!" the colonel shouted,
"The block-house on the hill!"
He spurred his charger forward!
They followed with a will!
Oh, 'twas a gallant company
Rode up the hill that day!
They never had been daunted,
Nor ever brought to bay!
But they met a hail of bullets
No mortal flesh could stand;
And, so, for once retreated,
A decimated band.
From tree-top, trench, and cactus,
The leaden shower poured,
While from the smoking block-house
The deadly cannon roared!
"Halt, company!" See the colonel's face
All deadly set, and grim!
"'Bout face!" Once more they're charging
That fated hill with him!
But galling fire pours fore and aft,
Which levels horse and men ;
They fall as fast as they advance,
And, so, must down again!
Again the colonel's orders, "Halt!"
Once more they face about!
Once more they meet that deadly fire
And still more deadly rout!
But help is nigh! A band strikes up
Down there upon the right;
And when they come there'll surely be
"A hot time-in the old town-to-night!"
Who are these sable boys in brown
That dare to take the place
Of Roosevelt's Rough Riders,
And hope to win the race?
They charge afresh! They charge and sing!
They neither shrink nor shirk!
They'd charge the very Gates of Hell,-
But singing at their work!
It hailed! It rained! It belched! It blew!
That storm of fire and lead!
They sang! They fell! They fairly flew!
But always straight ahead!
"To the rear!" their captain shouted,
And thitherward went he!
His men went pressing up that hill,
As straight as straight could be!
They never wavered! Up, and up
They sang and staggered, till
They reached the top, and nobly took
That block-house on the hil!
All hail the gallant Twenty-fourth!
The band that day played right:
They prophesied it, and there was
"A hot time-in the old town-to-night!"
BLACK MAMMIES
IF Ah evah git to glory, an' Ah hope to mek it thoo,
Ah expec' to hyah a story, an' Ah hope you'll hyah it, too,-
Hit'll kiver Maine to Texas, an' f'om Bosting to Miami,-
Ov de highes' shaf' in glory, 'rected to de Negro Mammy.
You will see a lot o' Washington, an' Washington again;
An' good ol' Fathah Lincoln, tow'rin 'bove de rest o' men;
But dar'll be a bunch o' women standin' hard up by de th'one,
An' dey'll all be black an' homely,-'less de Virgin Mary's one.
Dey will be de talk of angels, dey will be de praise o' men,
An' de whi' folks would go crazy 'thout their Mammy folks again;
If it's r'ally true dat meekness makes yo' heir to all de eart',
Den our blessed, good ol' Mammies must 'a' been of noble birt'.
If de greates' is de servant, den Ah got to say o' dem, 
Dey'll be standin' nex' to Jesus, sub to no one else but Him;
If de crown goes to de fait'ful, an' de palm de victors wear,
Dey'll be loaded down wid jewels more dan anybody dere.

BACK TO THE FARM
To Dr. Washington
THE vision of a prophet
Was yours the day you said:
"Train skillful hands to labor,
As well as heart and head."
But a wiser word you uttered
When, stretching forth your arm
And pointing to the cities,
You said: "Back to the farm!"
Speak louder yet, and louder,
Till you pierce the cities' noise,
And thunder down the alleys,
To halt the girls and boys.
Then be a true pied-piper,
And lead them, not to drown,
But away back in the country,
And far away from town.
This word must be the trumpet
To call us from our graves,
Where, buried in the cities,
We're still a race of slaves.
The Second Call to Freedom,
Proclaim from state to state;
And let the people answer,—
Before it is too late.
CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH
THAT FELLOW BEHIND THE GLASS
THE fellow that looks at me,
Behind the looking-glass,
And seems to read my soul
Right through each time I pass,-
Who is he? What's his name?
Whence comes he? Where, the same?
He seems to know me well;
Better than I could tell;
I'm sure he knows my past,
As well as what I am.
I dread his piercing eye,-
He thinks me quite a sham.
I always find him there,
Whene'er I chance to look,
And, every time, I say:
"He knows me like a book!"
I think I'd best be good
While in his neighborhood,
Or he will cause me shame,
By singing out my name.
He'd blow my secrets out,
And publish all my woes,
That fellow behind the glass,—
For I am sure he knows!
--
STINGS
"PULL out the sting before it swells,'
Said dear Mamma to me
One day when I was sorely stung
From meddling with a bee.
I tweezered out the little hair,
And down I let it fall;
Then watched to see the swelling come-
It never came at all!
Since coming into man's estate,
Her proverb serves me still:
When friends let fly the stinging word
That would our friendship kill,
I pull the sting before it swells,
When out a laugh I call;
I've watched to see the swelling come-
It never comes at all!
THE GIANT
NEAR Our house there dwells a giant
. Nearly fifty cubits high;
Every night we sit and watch him
As he looms against the sky.
Two great eyes look down upon you,
From his haystack of a head,-
Eyes that never close in slumber,
For he never goes to bed.
One long arm he stretches from him,
One he keeps close to his side;
Slender legs hold up his body
Many cubits long and wide.
Still he stands in gentle weather;
In the storm he bows his head;
Never walks for years together,
'S if his feet were made of lead.
Only after dark he's human,
With the signatures and signs
Of a weird, stupendous giant:
In the day, he's two tall pines!
THE POEM IN THE MOON
PAPA, there's a poem in the moon to-night.
Come, look and see how he shines so bright!
Write down, "the close of a sweet June day,'
Write down, "the whippoorwill calling away."
99
Don't leave out "the calm of the evening hour,"
Nor "the scent of the rose and the jessamine flower";
Put in "the katy-did's one-tone song,"
As they sing all round in a numberless throng;
"The calf's bell tinkling away in the lot,
And the crunching of corn in the selfsame spot;
The flow of the fountain falling afar,"-
You know how it ought to be done, Papa.
Make it all lovely and calm and cool,
And let me sit by you here on a stool,
Gazing up into the moonlit sky
Watching the bats go dipping by.
Leave open doors and windows, too;
Low lights,—yes, and falling dew.
Put Scorpio just above the steeple,
With the bark of dogs and the hum of people;
But over it all pour the moon's soft light,
And leave him there shining thru all the night.
SIGNPOSTS
"SAY, Father, in the path of life
We tread from day to day,
Are there no signposts on the road
To keep us to the way?
The bypaths we so often meet,
Must we them tread, to know
That they are wrong, then turn our feet.
Back where they ought to go?"
"My son, a guidepost stands in sight,
The lengthened way along;
If you will read, and read aright,
You'll find it says: 'It's wrong!'
Where'er this sign comes to your view,
Though pleasant seem the way,
Know that that path is not the true
That leads to better day.
"And if sometimes you hesitate
Because of fading light,
Read in the dust down at your feet,—
You'll find these words: 'It's right!'
No matter where this path may lead,
Up to your latest breath,
Seize on it with your utmost speed,-
It's safe for life, or death."
A FATHER'S REPLY TO A SON'S QUESTIONS
"My Father, my Father, in getting about,
Some folk are a trouble to me!"
"This world, my son, is a world of worry,
But say what yours may be."
"What shall I do when the haughty man
Looks over or down on you?"
"My boy, that's easy: Why, throw out your chest
And be a highbrow, too."
"What shall I do when the idle rich
Flaunt their wealth in your very face?"
"Why, work, and save, and step by step,
Come to a rich man's pace."
"And the wise old guy who knows it all,
And singles you out for a fool?"
"My son, his knowledge is always small,
Meet him by study and school."
"And some you meet are so very good,
They fill your soul with fear."
"That's the finest task of all the lot:
Just go him one better, my dear."
"My Father, my Father, give me a rule
To fill my soul with joy."
"Do only your best, be just to the rest,
And assert yourself, my boy."
DRINKING SONG
HERE we go with a jug of rum!
We're going off on a jolly bum;
We'll off with the mask,
And down to the task
Of making the sad world hum.
Here we go with a pack of cards;
We'll leave the parson our best regards:
In a social way
We'll spend the day,
Nor give a thought to his canards.
Here we go with a ribald song
To keep the hours from growing long;
We'll laugh and joke
In a cloud of smoke,
Nor think for once we're doing wrong.
Here we go till late at night!
We'll be carried home in a sorry plight;
But till it's done,
We'll have our fun,
And end the thing with a friendly fight.
Here we go to the prison cell!
The man was killed, but who can tell
Who struck the blow
That laid him low?
For no one saw him when he fell.
The sentence given is hard to bear;
I might have done it, for I was there;
It might have been-
Too late to mend!
So, here we gol-But where?
ON RECEIPT OF G'S PHOTOGRAPH
A WORLD of longing's in those eyes, my Lad.
They used to stop with me; now, past thy Dad,
They're gazing on the mystery of Life,—
Its joys, its hopes, its sorrows, and its strife;
They're asking: "What of all the things to come?"
But what thou questionest is deaf and dumb;
No answer does the Future give to thee
Seeking solution of her mystery.
But, forward! On! Nor o'er thy shadow grope,-
They who look backward lose the path of hope.
The pressing onward will enlarge thy scope
Of vision, and, at length, some day thy gaze
Shall penetrate Life's veil, resolve the maze,-
And thou shalt walk secure in Wisdom's ways.
THE SENSES
Look straight ahead! That's how your eyes are set;
The danger from behind dare to forget!
Foe, friend, or enemy, worthy of your steel,
Will meet you at the front, not at your heel.
Listen at each side: The future and the past
Will come within your hearing, first and last.
Choose well, and sparingly the things you taste,
Else you admit a foe, your life to waste.
Smell deeply, greedily, the sweet things of the day;
If noxious, 'tis not hard to turn away.
Feel-thoroughly,-your nerves are everywhere.
To feel for all should be your constant care.
You may be blind and deaf and be a man,
But, without sympathy,—I hardly think you can!
ENCOURAGER
To Rev. H. H. Proctor, D.D.
"ALTHOUGH you're not my equal,
I like to help a man;
And so I tolerate you.
Go, do the best you can;
You're nothing but a bubble;
And pretty soon you'll burst.
Folks say bad things about you,—
And I believe the worst."
That's how some folks impress you,
Of the way they think of you;
And your schooner takes backwater,
When their steamers loom in view.
Sometimes you meet another,
Looks you squarely in the eye,
And says: "My friend, you're special!
And I see no reason why
"You mayn't tread the Path of Fortune,
Straight to the House of Fame.
Up! At it! You are extra!
List up, and win the game!"
And you feel well-nigh invincible,
When Encourager's about;
God bless the man who heartens,
And seeks to draw you out!
THINGS DON'T STAY ONE WAY
WHEN darkness hovers o'er the earth,
And clouds bedim the day,
I'm ne'er discouraged, for I've learned
That things don't stay one way.
When Fortune frowns upon my path,—
With hard work, little pay,-
I toil in patience and I wait,
For things don't stay one way.
Whene'er the proud go dashing by,
In princely-grand array,
No iron pierces through my soul,
For things don't stay one way.
The days, the months, the years, all change,
Things increase or decay;
Eternal Wisdom has decreed
That things don't stay one way.
NELSE
SAW Jim Hedd's n*****s goin' souf
'Istidy, some'n' a'ter break o' day,
Was lookin' in de drivah's mouf,
W'en 'e give de word to march away!
"W'at 'e sell 'em fo'?" God knows, honey,-
Hyard 'e had to raise some means;
'Spose 'e jes' mus' git dat money!
T'irteen,-sol' to New Orleans!
"Was Nelse 'mong 'em?" God, yes! Gone!
Stronges', hearties' fellar on de place!
You'll miss 'is voice a-singin' in de co'n!
You'll miss 'is happy, shinin' face!
"How 'e seem to tek it?" Humph!
Ah wush Ah had de gif' to tell!
But tellin' yo' plain, de bes' Ah mek it,

Partin's allus grievin' day,
Dough frien's mus' part wid dyin' breat'!
But tearin' bosom frien's away,
Dat kind o' partin's wors'n deat'!
Nelse givin' up Dinah; Dinah, Nelse,-
Talk of a mothah an huh chil'!
But man an' wife,—dat's some'n' else!
Hit made dat boy go jes' plumb wil'!
Mar'ied come Chris'mas jest one year;
Cou'tin' since dey mos' could see;
Nevah a couple to each mo' dear
Dan Nelse an' Dinah 'pear to me!
Ol' Miss, Ol' Mars', Miss Sallie, an' Miss Fan'
Stood on de stoop to see 'em go;
Dinah, huh apron in huh han',
Wuz leanin' 'gains' de big-'ouse doo'.
Nelse fixed 'is eyes upon de gal,
An' marched off back'ard to de gate;-
No eyes fo' anyt'ing a-tall,
But Dinah, 'is sweet'eart an' 'is mate.
He waved 'is han' an' kep' a-wavin',
Till 'e struck de big road to de bridge;
Struggled hard, and kep' f'om ravin',
Till de road comes to dat willer ridge,
Den Nelse begun to sing: "Farewell,

God bless you, Honey, mah Love, farewell,
Ah'll meet you some day in de sky."
De res' took up de song an' sung

As dough de song would have no en'!
"Dinah, mah Honey, mah Darlin', good-by!
God bless you, Honey, mah love, farewell!
Ah'll meet you some day in de sky!"-
Echoed ovah an' ovah f'om de dell;
Eb'ryt'ing in de chime begun to rebble,-
De water, meadah, de hill, an' de plain:
De shoals sung bass, de mill-wheel treble,
De dead leaves whispered in quavahs of pain!
But jest as dey reach de tu'n o' de road
Dat hides de big-'ouse f'om yo' sight,
De risin' sun bu'st thoo de clouds,

De women scream, men wep' aloud,
De drivah kep' proddin' on de crowd;
But Nelse stood still, lak 'e made o' stone;
An' dem close by 'im hyard 'im groan.
His eye took on a savige light!
His voice was raised to double might!
His nose, a dancin' adder spread,
Lak serpent hissin' out 'is head!
Hit rooted me right whar I stood!
Hit steeled mah ha'r! Hit froze mah blood!
Hit 'peared to shake de solid groun',
Fo' deat' an' hell was in de soun'!
As 'e lif' 'is han' an' p'inted to de sky,

Lak t'under out f'om a shinin' sky,

An' quickly tu'nin' in 'is track,

"Ah'm gwi' to buy dat n***** back!"
WHATEVER IS IS BEST
SOMETIMES When storms of trouble roll,
And waves of trial beat
With all their fury o'er my soul,
They bring me to defeat:
Till comes the calm, as come it will,
And looking back, I see,
That, spite of either good or ill,
Whatever is is best for me.
Sometimes my faith grows dead and cold,-
No hope, no sure retreat,-
And like a sheep without the fold,
I faint with thirst and heat;
Till spreads the feast, as spread it will,
And, looking back, I see
His bounty filling all my soul,-
Whatever is is best for me.
Sometimes deep shadows cross my path,
Down in the valley low;
Sometimes the billows of His wrath
Above me overflow;
Till comes relief, as come it will,
And looking back, I see
His rod and staff my comfort still,
Whatever is is best for me.
And so I'll trust Him all my days,
And take whate'er He sends;
Come life or death, on all His ways
My thankful soul depends;
And when He comes, as come He will,
I, looking back, shall see
From yon blest height,-forever, still,—
Whatever is is best for me.
TIME
TIME is very short.
Take it by the year,-
Take them by the hundred,
Shorter they appear.
Time is very long.
Take it by the day,-
Longest time of all,
As the seconds tick away.
SEAWARD
To whom shall I leave my boy
When the ship pulls down the bay,
On the swiftly ebbing tide,
To land far, far away?
To whom shall my dim eyes look,
When the boat sinks out of sight?
Who'll foster my eldest born,—
Out yonder in the night?
There's no one else but God,
And His sufficiency;
Who guards me on the land,
Will keep him on the sea.
Here let me safely rest
My troubled heart and brain:
In Him we separate,
In Him we meet again.
INSURED
"INSURED?" "'Gainst everything!
"Company?" Moses' rod.
"Place?" The New Jerusalem.
Yes; I'm insured with God.
He hedges me round with angels;
Keeps me in all my ways;
Makes my bed in sickness,
With mercy crowns my days.
I've put my gems and property
Completely in His hands;
With policies maturable,
To ev'ry hour's demands.
He's really more than able
To keep against that day,
Whate'er I put upon Him,
Along life's toiling way.
From every kind of evil,
He gives you His protection;-
Sometimes Ten-Dollar funerals,
But a Billion Resurrection!
GETTING THINGS
WHEN you want a thing you must go and get it,—
On land or under the sea,—
Whether fortune or fame, or muscle or game,
No matter what it may be.
If it's down in the ground you must delve for it;
If up in the air, you must fly;
Some things come to you with length of life,
To win others you've got to die.
You may not wait for another man
To share with you his luck,-
Things come to the man who is up and away,-
The thing that wins is pluck.
The fellow that comes to bring you a thing,
Has come to get one, too;
And the fellow that comes to bring you a thing
Will get the better of you.
You may not wait for your ship to come,
You've got to fetch her in;
Up! Hoist your sails! Wait not for the breeze!
Right now is time to begin!
When you want a thing you must go and get it,
At a time when it may be had;
For Time cannot wait, and the Golden Gate
May close and leave you sad!
THE IRON RULE
SOME folk stand for pedigree,
Or else they call for fame,
And if a man is recognized
Depends upon his name.
But there's not a thing in pedigree,
There's nothing in a name:
You treat me like a gentleman,—
I'll treat you just the same.
For you might wear a broadcloth suit,
And sport a golden cane;
Or you might be the President,
With power to order rain;
If I passed by in ragged coat,
Or to your palace came,
If you turned up your nose at me,—
I'd treat you just the same!
I fancy those who fancy me;
Good-will to friends I show;
But if you do not fancy me,
Why, goodness, gracious!-go!
I'd rather be a jelly-fish,
Alone in all the sea,
Than dwell with you in paradise,
If you are rude to me.
I'm sure to treat you like a man,
Whate'er your pedigree;
Yet should you treat me as a fool,
Then you're a fool to me.
The man I judge a gentleman
Is he that treats me so;
And he that takes me for a fool,
Is one himself, I trow.
I do not care for patronage,
Flatter me, if you can,—
But all I ask a man to do
Is: "Treat me like a man."
And if you find you can't do that
When I'm within your call,
Just pass on by,—I do not care,—
And do not speak at all!
But if you're ever kind to me,—
Do me a friendly deed,-
On this one thing you may depend:
I'll be your friend in need.
If, though, you chance upon me down,
And give me a foul poke,
Be sure, if e'er the tables turn,
That I'll repeat the joke.
Nor shall you treat me well alone,
Then catch me in a crowd,
Make me the butt of ridicule,
Taunt me with laughter proud;
Though you excel in irony,
I'd all your wit surpass,
I'd have you crowned the king of fools,
And branded as an ass!
"The world is but a looking-glass,-
You smile, and it's returned;
But sneer upon it, and you'll find
In turn that you are spurned."
So do not stand on pedigree,-
There's nothing in a name;
But if you'll treat men like a man,
They'll treat you just the same.
THE VOYAGE
He grasped my hand as he said: "Farewell!"
For the ship stood in the bay;
And its bell did sound like a funeral knell,
As it urged my beloved away.
And I heard a wail as the voyagers passed
From the shore in a silent crowd,
To the huge black ship, in strange contrast,
To its sail, so like a shroud!
The air grew dark with a dismal hue;
A calm o'er all things lay;
As the sea into billows the wild winds blew
That bore that ship away.
My heart shrunk up, it seemed to me,
As in woe I saw her sail;
But, at length, I heard: "I'll be with thee!"
Ring out above the gale.
The sea grew calm as she passed from sight,-
From the port so like a grave;
But my heart was cheered as my faith grew bright
In the "still small voice" to save.
I know, though she comes this way again,
She'll bring my friend no more;
But a similar host will she take within,
To sail for that selfsame shore.
The course she takes is a way unknown,
From the Port of Parting Breath;
But she bears each soul to heaven or hell,
And the name of that ship is DEATH!
A PRAYER
FATHER, let Thy lightest whisper
Reach mine ear, and touch my heart;
Never let Thy gentlest counsel
Ever from my soul depart.
Let me hear when danger threatens,
Just before me in the way;
Let me catch each light commission
Thou appointest to my day.
Let the softest breath of duty
Catch my willing, list'ning ear;
And the things to be avoided,
When Thou warnest, let me hear.
Let me never quench the Spirit,
As He speaks from day to day;
Ever let me heed His pleading,
Be His message what it may.
So shall I be led in safety,
O'er the path Thy Son has trod;
So I'll come at last to Glory,
To my Saviour,-and my God.
HOMEWARD
I'VE come from out the darkness,
Direct from God's own hand;
Upon this little island,
My foot first touches land.
I know not whence I came here,
I know not where I go;
I know I'm on a journey,
And this is all I know.
This world is not the country
Where I must take my stand;
I seek another city,
In some far distant land;
I'm pausing here a moment
To catch the air and light;
Just let me get my bearings,
And I'll resume my flight.
BABY SISTER
"TELL brother John to have the organ back,"
Said Baby Sister, two years old,
And closed her eyes, and took her flight
Unto a deathless land of asphodels and gold.
The slow-swift years have sped into the past,
While age has crept into my heart;
The organ long has ceased to play,
While at her mem'ry still the tear-drops start.
The home-tree old now shelters other heads,
Where still the broken organ stands;
While Baby Sister and our family,
Are gathered, all but me, in spirit lands.
Last night I lay a-dream: A message came
Along some unseen, wireless track:
"Yes, brother John, the organ's gone;
But soon you'll get your Baby Sister back!"
WAR CAPS
BEHOLD!
The warlike hosts of heaven
Are gathering in the sky!
A moment's calm before the storm,
And see his arrows fly!
The clash of far-resounding arms
Reëchoes, peal on peal;
The air grows dark with nameless dread,
While terrors o'er me steal.
How small and helpless thing is man,
When heaven's artill'ry soars!
How like the sport of wind he seems,
When rage above him roars!
The thunder claps about his feet!
It rolls along the sky!
The lightning taps yon giant tree,-
Ah, see his splinters fly!
Shall conq'ring warriors from above
Come down to rule the plain?
Nay! From the clash of godlike arms
Descends the gentle rain.
E'en so the wrath of monstrous men,
From war-encumbered days,
Shall minister like falling rain
To God's eternal praise!
THE SERMON AND THE SONG
I WROTE a splendid discourse,
And stood before the throng;
I read it through with grace and force,
Critics found no wrong;
But not an echo did I wake
Of worship, praise, or duty;
Success was mine, but just to shape
A thing of passing beauty.
Again, I wrote a pleasing song,
And forth I stood to sing;
My tones were clear, my notes were strong,
And had the cultured ring;
But not a heart was stirred to joy,
Nor eye to shed a tear;
Chagrined, I threw away the toy
That had no power to cheer.
But later as I strove in prayer,
A message gripped my soul,-
A song of triumph seized me there,
I felt myself made whole:
I spake, and moved a mighty throng;
I sang, they Christward ran.
I found the sermon and the song
Must live within the man.
SLEEP
I SANK into a sleep profound,
Unbroken by a dream;
So deep the night had settled down
The stars cast not a gleam.
Useless the eye and vain the ear,
So to my couch I crept;
I lay me down without a fear;
I long and soundly slept.
Sleep bound me with a weighty cord
That fettered mind and soul.
Should he forever be my lord?
Would ne'er he set me whole?
He had his mystic way with me,
I suffered no abuse;
For just as he had bound me he
As gently, let me loose.
I lay me down all weak and worn;
I woke with health and grace;
I looked upon a smiling morn,
The sunbeams in my face.
So Death will bind me in his turn,
To find no fear in me,—
For he will loose mine eyes at morn
Upon eternity.
LIFE
LIFE'S a single-handed struggle,
Where no friend may take a part;
Never in the outward conflict,
Ever in the mind and heart.
Struggle every day and hour,
From the cradle to the grave;
Struggling, to become a master,
Yielding, to become a slave.
In a mortal grasp contending,
Flesh and blood 'gainst mind and soul,
One must, quailing, fainting, dying,-
Leave the other in control.
One must conquer in the conflict,
Bringing 'tother under ban;
Hard it is to drop the monkey,
Harder still to be a man.
"It is finished!" must be sounded
From the good or evil side;
He who first shall take the city
Ever victor shall abide.
See that self with right is sided,
All its strength and powers to lend;
Though the fight be fearful, doubtful,
Good will conquer in the end.
IF WE JUST BUT KNEW
IF we just but knew Who's with us
On this raging sea of life,
When the gale blows like a tempest,
And the wind cuts like a knife,
No doubts nor fears would daunt us,
Our hearts would still be true,
No demon's self could flaunt us,
If we just but knew.
If we just but knew Who's with us,
When the deluge is at hand,
When high the seething waters
Pile upon the shifting sand,
Our minds would still be resting
On Him who seems asleep;
Who but our faith is testing,
And safe our souls will keep.
If we just but knew Who's with us,
When the wind and wave are strong,
And when total wreck seems certain,-
E'en then a joyful song
Our faithful lips would utter,
And we, with no ado,
Might walk upon the waters,
If we just but knew!
-
I REST ME IN THE LORD
I REST me in the Lord,
And patiently I wait,
Though sin may bud and flower;
Though great be Satan's power;
Though hosts of sin may hedge me round,
And thunders shake the solid ground,
No qualms, no fears, disturb my breast,
For in my Lord I sweetly rest,
And patiently I wait.
I rest me in the Lord,
And patiently I wait,
While He prepares the way
To usher in the day
When all His children, bright and fair,
Shall rise to meet Him in the air.
So, till He takes me to His breast,
Forever there in peace to rest,
I patiently will wait.
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY
First Congregational Church, Atlanta
FIFTY years of service! What a record thine!
Thou hast stood for character, plus the life divine!
Thou'st kept the Great Commission: Opened blinded
eyes;
Raised the dead and dying; hast garnered in the skies!
But whiter grows the harvest as brighter grows the day;
The call, "Come o'er and help us!" is sounding hereaway;
While from the old Golgotha there still resounds the cry:
He who serves must suffer! He who saves must die!
Yea, hotter grows the conflict as fiercer glows the sun;
Tho' flesh and blood are tottering, the race is just begun;
No rest is to the weary, but only death or dearth
Till Love men's hearts shall conquer, and Justice rule the
earth.
O First Church of Atlanta! First on Southern soil!
Gird thee still for battle! Trim thee to thy toil!
Pilgrim, bravely onward! Soldier, shirk no pain!
Sympathy comes through suffering! Loss alone is gain!
AT TWILIGHT
I SIT at twilight all alone,
Watching the embers' ruddy glow;
The flame gives out a merry tone,
Dancing merrily to and fro.
Shadows pall the corners dark,
Or, fanlike, spread across the room;
And from the deep recesses,-hark!—
Voices echo from the gloom.
'Tis my mother's voice that speaks,
Calling my old familiar name;
She comes and strokes my hair and cheeks,—
I'm child to-night because-she came.
A sister comes, and then another
Takes her old familiar place;
Two sweet babes and then a brother
Flit before my yearning face.
Then a sweetheart,-wife, and fellow,—
Comes my saddened heart to cheer;
Fills my mind with mem'ries mellow,-
I sweep away the falling tear.
Now they come in troops around me,—
Friends I followed to the tomb,
Through the twilight come and find me,
Till they fairly fill the room.
"Shadows," say you? No, a throng
Of friends from out beyond the stars;
Who at twilight drop among
Their friends on earth through golden bars.
Gone the glow of hearth and embers,
Save the crack of dying coals;
Closed my heart its secret chambers,
And its treasure of dear souls.
RELIGIOUS BUSINESS
THE wholly true to Christ
Are ever on the Cross;
He who follows Jesus,
Daily, suffers loss.
He never can be rich,
As long as there are poor;
Nor enter world success,
Because Pride keeps the door.
He may not seek for gain,
Which is its own reward,-
His treasure is in heaven,
His boast is in the Lord.
He has a Christly boldness
To be uniformly good;
So, he rarely pleases men,
Is seldom understood.
But the Sons of God shall triumph,
With mighty victory!
For righteousness shall fill the earth
As waters fill the sea!
RELIGIOUS BUSINESS
Oh, his reaping time is coming,
With a fullness for his dearth,
When Christ shall have dominion,
And the meek possess the earth!
Lord, make me pure in heart,
And resolutely true;
To bear my cross in patience,
And be numbered with the few.
Help me to plumb the line,
And "follow" for the nonce;
And never to attempt again
To walk two ways at once.

DOROTHEA 
The stars in Heaven now shine with a fuller, gladder light, 
My days no longer seem a long and dreary night; 
Since thou dost love me dear, all things seem more than bright, 
          Dorothea, Dorothea, my own Dorothea. 
If griefs and sorrows come, they do not pierce so deep, 
If tears bedim my eyes they are the bitter-sweet, 
If death doth part us here, I know somewhere we'll meet, 
          Dorothea, Dorothea, my own Dorothea. 
And e'en though death does come, I'll always see thy face,
Thy hand within my own I ever will embrace,
Remembrance of thee in my soul will have a place.

TUSKEGEE 
 
Sacred spot on which thou art, 
     O school of industiy. 
Thou art doing well thy part 
     To aid humanity. 
On thy consecrated ground 
     Is carved a wondrous story, 
Out of chaos, Washington 
     Raised this place to glory. 
The world has made a beaten track 
     Unto thy very door,— 
A fountain on the desert sands 
     Thou art for evermore. 
 
DEATH 
 
The spirit out of it hath flown, 
And left the body all alone, 
So after all, what is this clay,
Which we so cherish, can you say? 
Look on this form now still in death,
The force is gone which we call breath; 
The faculties, yes, every one,
Have stopped their use, with spirit gone. 
O death, thou art so grim and drear, 
What awful silence thou doth wear. 
And thou must visit ev'ry one,— 
Yes, every being 'neath the sun. 
 
O, death, thou art a woeful state,
All mankind well doth thee berate,— 
Because we know not what awaits 
Beyond thy grey, mysterious gates. 
 
Ah death, if I could truly say, 
"I fear thee neither night nor day!" 
If I but knew to what estate 
My wandering spirit might awake— 
I would not quake when thou art near, 
Thy presence I would not so fear; 
But 'tis the mystery that attends 
Thy awful mission, that offends. 
WHEN LOVE SLEEPETH 
 
Love built a fairy bower, with roses red and white, 
And watched it ev'ry hour to keep the flowers bright: 
 For oh, it was so fair, this bower which love did make, — 
A benediction, prayer, its perfume ever spake. 
And when the chill frost came. Love showered warmth and kisses,
For whom Love doth caress, the frost he surely misses: 
But one night Love did sleep, the frost was round about, 
He pierced the roses deep to blot their sweetness out. 
Oh, desolation drear hath gripped Love's rosy bower,
No brightness find we there, for Love hath lost all power, 
Ah, Love will sometimes sleep, too oft when needed most, 
And will not always keep forever at her post. 
COME LET US BE FRIENDS 
 
Come, let us be friends, you and I, 
     E'en though the world doth hate at this hour; 
Let's bask in the sunlight of a love so high 
     That war cannot dim it with all its armed power. 
Come, let us be friends, you and I, 
     The world hath her surplus of hatred today; 
She needeth more love, see, she droops with a sigh, 
     Where her axis doth slant in the sky far away. 
Come, let us be friends, you and I, 
     And love each other so deep and so well, 
That the world may grow steady and forward fly, 
     Lest she wander towards chaos and drop into hell. 
MAN'S INCONSTANCY 
 
The earth revolves, 
     The sun doth shine, 
The moon at night,
     With stars divine, 
All tell us that 
     Fond nature's way, 
Is much the same 
     From day to day. 
We know at night, 
     When tasks are done, 
We'll sleep to wake 
     And greet the sun. 
We know the spring 
     With gentle grace, 
To summer will 
     Give up its place. 
What man is like 
     Pond nature true? 
Can we depend 
     On what he'll do? 
Today he steps 
     With heavy tread. 
Tomorrow finds 
     Him full of dread. 
Today he'll swear 
     By all the gods 
You can rely 
     Upon his words. 
Tomorrow, he 
     Will say to you, 
"I did not speak 
     Those words untrue." 
And so it is, 
     From day to day, 
We can't depend 
     On what men say. 
All thro' our lives 
     We'll meet but few 
Whom we can trust, 
     Whose hearts beat true. 
 
COMFORT 
 
I take my cares to Jesus, 
     And lay them at His feet. 
He will for every sorrow 
     Give consolation sweet. 
Upon my head He places 
     His hand so tenderly, 
He tells me that He giveth 
     His love to comfort me. 
Oh Christ, Oh Benediction, 
     Where could I go for rest,
But here upon thy foot-stool, 
     Or else upon thy breast? 
Dear Savior, I do feel thee 
     Forever at my side; 
Take not from me thy presence,
     But with me e'er abide. 
THE SPIRIT OF A FRIEND 
 
Back to the dust went the dust of the body, 
     But the spirit that turned to its Maker on high, 
Filled the air, as it passed, with so wistful a sweetness,
     That its fragrance will linger through years that slip by. 
MY FORTUNE 
 
A gypsy wandered by one day, 
When I was young and blithe and gay, 
She begged me in a way so free,— 
"Come, have your fortune told by me.”
 
Now certainly, if we could chance, 
To know our future in advance. 
Would we not think the matter o'er, 
Before the gypsy left our door? 
 
Well, this I did, in days before 
Experience had taught me; Lo, 
I told her I would pay her well. 
If she my future life would tell. 
 
I sat me down, and so did she. 
My hand she took upon her knee; 
"Ah, Miss," said she, "will you but hear. 
These rings you have shall cost you dear." 
 
The precious rings I treasured so, 
 A mother's gift, if you must know. 
I said "If these I should not wear 
I'll take them off and hold them dear." 
"Ah, no," she said, "that will not do"; 
I'll hold them for a blessing, true. 
And when I give them back again, 
The world can ne'er more cause thee pain." 
“Gypsy," I said, "I cannot part 
With these dear rings so near my heart, 
A mother's gift I must retain, 
Gypsy, you plead for these in vain!" 
She said, "If you'll not give them o'er, 
111 luck I see for you in store, 
Circles around thee do revolve, 
In blackness they will thee involve!" 
"Give o'er thy rings and thou shalt see 
Thy bondage turned to liberty, 
Riches and love and fame are thine, 
Circles so bright do thee enshrine!" 
Her eye was set upon my gold. 
Plotting for it her heart was cold; 
No sentiment could change her aim, 
Her blood was up, for gold she came. 
Forgive me, friends, when this I say, 
I forthwith gave those rings away. 
I truly thought she had the power 
To change my fortune in that hour. 
I've Hved to learn since that sad day, 
That none can know—whate’er you pay, 
Your fortune lies twixt God and you 
Who says he knows, he speaks untrue. 
THE WITCH 
 
Lo, the witch all skriveled and old! 
Come in and have your fortune told. 
She, by the aid of a magic wand, 
Can see the future in your hand. 
What in your hand she cannot trace, 
She'll surely find it in your face. 
She'll tell you when you're going to wed,—
If the friend long gone is ahve or dead. 
If you'll be poot or you'll have gold,
Come in and hare your fortune told! 
PAL, LET'S BE TRUE
 
Pal, let's be true, 
I wim will you? 
Our country calls to the strife. 
Come to its aid,
Don't be afraid,— 
For it to save, what's a lie? 
Yes, we will go, 
Fighting?   All more, — 
We'll never know a retreat. 
Proudly we move. 
And e'en will prove. 
Our fight the best in the feat.
Wonderful land,
Think of the hand 
America takes in the flight. 
Hers is to brave,
Hers is to save,
For justice, truth and the right. 
A NIBBLING MOUSE 
 
The swiftest, nibbling, little mouse, 
Has made its home within my house, 
I set a trap both night and day, 
To try and catch it if I may,— 
     This nibbling, little mouse. 
 
Today when writing at my desk, 
Out it came to make a quest. 
It ran around with so much glee, 
Seemed not a bit afraid of me,— 
     This nibbling, little mouse. 
 
Straightway I rose and got my broom 
To chase the creature from the room. 
Round and round it scampered fast; 
Trying to catch, I darted past 
     This nibbhng, httle mouse. 
 
We kept the chase up half an hour, 
Until I felt I'd lost all power 
To chase behind it any more. 
So left it prattling on the floor,— 
     This nibbling, little mouse. 
 
All tired out, I then sat down 
And soon within a study, brown, 
I thought of phantoms, as they pass, 
And how thro' life we chase them as 
     This nibbhng, little mouse. 
Yes, all thro' life we find it so,— 
Chasing shadows as we go, 
We almost catch them, but alas, 
They baffle us and slip on, as 
      This nibbling, little mouse. 
BOY AT SCHOOL IN ENGLAND
 
Mother, could you but know 
     What thoughts I have of thee, 
Your little boy so far away, 
     In this land across the sea. 
Mother, could you but look 
     Within my eyes so wet 
With tears, because I miss you so,— 
     This yearning I regret.
Could you but listen as I talk 
     Of love and home and you; 
My heart so fills I cannot keep 
     The grief from coming through. 
Last night I dreamed I felt 
     Your kiss upon my cheek. 
And thought I could not Uve without 
     That touch another week. 
The boys aiomid have mothers 
     Who see them off and on. 
Sometimes I feel so lonesome. 
     As if mine were dead and gone. 
Oh, Mother, it is awful when 
     A boy can't have the treat 
To see his mother now and then. 
     Such luck, it can't be beat.
Say, Mother, won't you promise 
     Then the next big ship sets sail,
You'll come yourself upon it,
     Instead of sending mail? 
WHAT IS IT? 
 
There is a subtle something 
     That speaks where'er you go, 
By tongue it is not uttered, 
     Than words it speaks much more. 
You go forth on your missions,
     And carry it along; 
It's like some beauteous flower, 
     And like some soothing song. 
It's like some fragrant perfume 
      That's wafted by the breeze. 
It gives out so much comfort 
     It sheds abroad such ease. 
What is this subtle something? 
     Folks ask me, and I say 
I cannot well define it 
     Nor either teach the way. 
It is an inner something. 
     I know that it must be 
Clear shining through your body 
     And giving light to me. 
I love to have you near me. 
     Just why I cannot say, 
But this I know, your presence 
     Just changes night to day. 
Methought I saw a halo 
     Surrounding your fair form, 
When you approached that mother 
     Whom death had left forlorn. 
And then when asked for service, 
     As fleet ful as a bird, 
You answered with a presence 
     Which spoke far more than word. 
I would, if you would charge me, 
     Perform some duty true, 
That I may ever daily 
     Grow more like unto you. 
What is that subtle something 
     You carry where you go? 
I long to have you name it 
     Oh do, that I may know. 
DIALECT POEMS 
MAMMY 
 
Large of frame, black of face, 
Spotless apron 'round her waist, 
Teeth so pearly, eyes so true, 
Make you think of heav'n so blue, 
                              That's Mammy. 
 
Moving 'round the house with ease, 
Trying ev'ryone to please. 
In and out with so much grace, 
Acting like she owned the place, 
                              That's Mammy. 
 
Sister trudging down the hall 
Trips o'er rug and has a fall, 
Quick as lightning Mammy's there 
Fussing with the hurt and scare. 
                              Dear Mammy. 
 
Jane has fallen in the dirt. 
Soiled all her nice new skirt, 
Comes a-cryin' to the place; 
Stops soon as she sees the face 
                              Of Mammy. 
 
Mammy soothes the hurt and scare 
Till there's none left anywhere, 
With her "Hush, now Honey, do! 
Mammy loves you through and through.” 
                              Oh Mammy! 
 
Mammy now has passed away, 
But the memory lives today 
With me, and shall never die, 
Though the years go flitting by. 
                              Blest Mammy.

THE BLACK MAN'S PLEA 
 
Chains of bondage did imprint, 
Far deeper wounds than one could see. 
Sinking through flesh and blood and bone, 
They struck the deeper life that is 
Beneath the flesh, wherein doth course 
The blood that carnal life doth give. 
Their piercing darts did wound the life, 
That's more than carnal in the man. 
Stag'ring underneath the blow, 
Which quelled a hfe-blood for a while, 
And which today hath not regained 
Its former circulation. Life-blood 
That doth make men, men! Not the 
Corpuscles of red and white that 
Coursing through veins do lend them hue,
But, life-blood that doth give that force 
Which makes a glorious race of men, 
And fills with pride and all things true, 
Giving an everlasting hope! 
 
Prostrate he lay upon his back 
Till freedom nursed him back again 
To perfect health?—Ah, far from that, 
'Tis long 'ere that can be enjoyed. 
The race, still crippled by the blow 
Is like a tree supposed dead,— 
Showing now and then some signs of life. 
Mankind! no blow is great as that 
Which strikes through flesh and blood and bone,
And wounds the vital parts where lives 
The greater, nobler life of man. 
Ye who look without today, 
Upon a race of tardy men, 
Whose step is lax and spirit slow; 
Although they measure not with those 
Who, generations freed, have built 
What liberty alone can raise, 
Great monuments,—that do proclaim 
Much credit to their mighty minds, 
Forbearance, do I ask of you. 
 
And do not chide this crippled race 
That, convalescent, tries to stand 
But totters still from slav'ry's blow. 
Tear down your veil of prejudice,
And look ye forth with naked eye 
Upon the field of wounded men. 
See, some do rise above that plain 
Of desolation and despair,
And still go forth with willing hands 
To turn the wheels of progress too, 
In spite of all that was and is. 
EMANCIPATION CELEBRATION 
 
Dear friends, we're gathered here tonight, 
To celebrate a great birth-right; 
Which came to us when Lincoln said 
That bondage must be stricken dead; 
Or else the country great and grand, 
Would totter so it could not stand. 
To him appeared in Spirit bold,
The great George Washington of old, 
Said he, "This conflict cannot last. 
It drains our country's life blood fast. 
Haste Lincoln! set these people free, 
It is not right, it must not be. 
 
So Lincoln we all know so well, 
Did set them free. Could I but tell 
What shouts arose when bonds were broke,
The country trembled at the stroke 
When slav'ry fell. A few remain,
The G. A. R.'s, to tell again 
How on the field of fire and blood 
They risked their lives, and bravely stood 
To help the cause, with all their might. 
Dear friends, they are our guests to-night, 
Since dear old Lincoln is not here, 
They are the next to him most dear. 
 
From slavery forth, without one cent, 
With spirit broke, my people went 
To wander in the world so cold; 
To find a place, and oft were told, 
Your pedigree we cannot trace,— 
You're classed with an unfavored race. 
Forthwith they went with awful taint, 
The nature now I will not paint; 
The chattels of another race. 
O God, 'twas hard to find a place. 
Who says the race has not progressed? 
He doth not know, we've had the test. 
 
Despite these drawbacks ev'ry one,
We're here to tell what we have done,
And say, if some do not advance 
As people do who've had the chance 
Of longer years than we've been free. 
Just reason why and you shall see. 
See what we've done in fifty years! 
Another fifty are my prayers 
The man unborn will yet perceive 
A progress now we can't conceive. 
He to the world will then expose, 
A worthier race and how it rose. 
We've gone part way and I discern 
The light of hope as it doth burn. 
Plod on, my race, to reach the goal; 
The path is rough, but that's the toll. 
Plod on, to get with all our might,
The things we ought with our birthright! 
 
RADIANT WOMAN 
 
I passed among the lowly poor, 
     Within a little street, 
A mother sat within her door, 
     A baby at her feet. 
In speaking of that mother, 
     I cannot say that she 
Had pedigree behind her, 
     The same as you, or me. 
For she was bound in body, 
     (As some are wont to say). 
Her race, not very lofty. 
     Was being crushed that day. 
'Tis sad it is the custom,
     In this enlightened time,
That people, not in wisdom. 
     Are prone to draw a line,— 
And say that human creatures, 
     Because their skin is black,
Because they've ugly features,
     Must all be pushed right back. 
This mother as she sat there, 
     Did open up to me, 
A realm, so full of grandeur, 
     Prom darkness, oh, so free! 
Her face though in its blackness, 
     Was radiant as the sun. 
Her features, plain and homely, 
     Seemed glorious ev'ry one. 
What was this revelation, 
     I asked myself that day? 
That wondrous penetration. 
     That to my soul made way? 
yes, 'twas more than human. 
     I must in truth admit. 
I saw more than the woman 
     Who in the door did sit. 
 
I saw that inward something 
     A-calling out to me,— 
"Look you beyond the body, 
     Divinity you'll see!" 
The look that was so glorious, 
     Transplanted on that face,
Told me a Christ victorious,
     Had in her heart found place. 
  
THE DYING NEGRO 
 
Seems to me in lookin' over yonder, 
     I see the day a-growin' very dark, 
Seems to me while in dis' lan' I wander, 
     No joyful song is heard from sin gin' lark. 
Seems to me some lonesome note is stealin', 
     O'er barren waste, from achin' people's souls. 
Seems to me I hear some lips repeatin' 
     "That sorrow in dis' lan' like waves do roll." 
Seems to me I hear some distant voices 
     Echoin' forth from slav'ry times to me 
 Seems to me they ask me what I sigh for 
     And tells me to be happy 'cause I'm free. 
 
Seems to me I answer an' I tells them 
     That slav'ry's chains are broken off my han's. 
Seems to me those very chains are bindin' 
     My soul so close and closer with their ban's! 
 
Seems to me I hear my people sighin',
     For help, God's help, in dis ungrateful Ian', 
Seems to me I hear my people cryin' 
     ''These burdens Lord are more than we can stan'." 
 
Seems to me the freedom that we cherished 
     Is bein' robbed from out our very lives, 
Seems to me that which we thought had perished 
     Is growin' now to one enormous size. 
 
Seems to me I hear some holy voices, 
     A-chantin' now some heav'nly song to me, 
Seems to me my soul within rejoices,  
     For death at las' has come to make me free !  
THE BLACK MAN'S HOPE 
 
I hear the talk of the white man's hope 
     In the ring and at the poll, 
But never a word of the black man's hope 
     Do I hear as time doth roll. 
Bowed with the weight which slavery left 
     Upon his chattled frame, 
No star of hope comes into view 
     The weight is still the same. 
O prejudice, cursed prejudice, 
     'Tis thou that blights the way,
And makes us feel there is no hope 
     There is no fairer day. 
Thou poisoned venom, prejudice, 
     Who gavest thee thy birth? 
Art bom of devil or of man, 
     How earnest thou on earth? 
I’ve heard it said that some believe, 
     That God so in his love 
Ordained that man be bound to mian, 
     Do you believe the above? 
 
Do you believe such laws are made 
     That blacks should till the soil, 
While other races reign supreme, 
     Removed from all such toil? 
Why, God created all men here 
     Upon one level plane. 
All bodies of the dust were made,  
     To dust must go again.  
Then why should color play such part 
     Upon this mortal earth? 
No man has power to change his skin, 
     WE'RE ACCIDENTS OF BIRTH. 
AN EXHORTATION 
 
Is there no prophet, seer nor bard, 
     At this compelling time, 
To sing a song or say a word. 
     Or even write a line? 
Is there an ear that will not hear, 
     The wails, the groans of men,
Of suckling infants, babes unborn,
     Oh, who will ease their pain? 
 
Is there a mouth that will not speak,
     Of wrongs they do endure, 
No tongues that in a language may 
     Some remedy outpour? 
Speak, oh, ye long dumb mouths, oh speak, 
     And to a people tell 
The burden forced upon you now 
     Makes earth to you a hell. 
 
A battle fierce is raging, 
     Unlike the usual fray, 
‘Tis worse than other conflicts 
     That are fought by night or day. 
Those men at last find succor, 
     The helpless blind and lame, 
But none comes to that woeful depth,— 
     The heart, when full of pain. 
This pain's an awful burden, 
     To trudge on day by day. 
It crushes soul and body 
     And makes indifference play; 
It shoots right to the marrow 
     Of life, its hopes, and oh, 
Threatens the very right to live, 
     Tries manhood to o'erthrow. 
 
O bards, who in the days of yore, 
     Did move a nation's heart,
Who with your great and glorious strain 
     Did still a turbulent mart, 
Come sing again another strain 
     Of duty, and above 
All else, oh, sing that glorious strain, — 
     That wondrous strain of love. 
 
Sing them a wondrous story 
     This burdened race of men, 
Paint it with all the glory that 
     Can come forth from your pen. 
Set it to tuneful melody, 
     As ever man did hear,
So that a race benighted 
     Will sing with heartiest cheer. 
PICTURES 
 I. SLAVERY 
Gaze on this picture of the past, 
See cruel master, whip in hand,
Upon yon slave, whose back is bent, 
Scourge upon scourge he letteth fall. 
“My God, my God!" the slave doth cry, 
"How long shall I these burdens bear?" 
"To work, to work," the master cries, 
"Go fill my coffers with thy brawn." 
Who doth not know, who hath not felt, 
For those who lived in that sad time? 
What is the life of him who slaves,
Whose body is not called his own? 
They bore the stripes, endured the pain, 
With not one murmur but to pray. 
They sang the songs we all do know, 
The songs that we shall sing again. 
These prayers and songs were wafted up, 
And, oh, they were so wondrous sweet,
They reached a throne where sits a Judge 
Who judgeth slow but judgeth well. 
They listened and they heard response — 
"I will repay, I will repay!" 
 
II. WAR 
 
Then discord rose twixt North and South, 
'Twas over slaves, you know it well. 
Came Ab'ram Lincoln to the front, 
A bloody battle to pursue. 
See war in all its dreadful state,— 
A scourge of men these battles are: 
A price was paid so dear in blood,
By North and South in that great war, 
That not a home was left without 
Some loved one gone forevermore. 
A cry was made for volunteers 
Who'll answer it? Ah, you can tell. 
See black men marching to the front, 
With steady step and wondrous stride,
How fearlessly they go to die! 
And yet they say we are afraid 
To risk our lives for a great cause. 
Yet I believe that you or I 
If needed at some future time, 
Will march as proudly to the front 
As they did then in sixty-three. 
 
III. FREEDOM 
 
The war is o'er, the slaves are free, 
They walk abroad as man with man. 
But note the frown upon the brow 
Of yonder man whose skin is fair. 
"I will not walk, as man with man, 
With yonder black," I hear him say, 
"He was not made to cope with me, 
Who rule this land, whose skin is fair."
Then what is this I see unearthed, 
So soon as slavery's debt is paid? 
'Tis prejudice, cursed prejudice, 
Another form of slavery. 
 
IV. LYNCHING 
 
See yonder mob, full fifty strong, 
Hound that poor lad of Negro blood. 
He fleeth to the woods, and oh,
They set the dogs upon his trail. 
At last he's caught, and lo, what then? 
They string him to yon leafless tree,
And to his clothes they put a flame, 
And now he's in eternity. 
 
V. DISCRIMINATION 
 
Not wanted here, not wanted there, 
Such signs go up all o'er the land. 
My God, then are my people free! 
No vote for you, no vote for me. 
Have we not borne the stripes enough,
Our cry goes up,—“How long, how long!" 
 
VI. FUTURE 
 
Let's leave these pictures of the past. 
And pictures of the present time, 
And wander on and on and on,
Unto some great approaching dawn. 
My final picture is this one,
'Tis not with master, whip in hand, 
But it is Black and White, alike,
Holding aloft the stars and stripes. 
They've buried far beneath the sod 
Grim prejudice and all lynch laws, 
And all in one united band,
Proclaim the freedom of the land. 
List, up to heaven there goes a sigh 
Of long restraint, and then a cry,— 
“Praise God we're free, at last we're free." 
NIGHT SONG 
(NEGRO LULLABY) 
I.  
Honey, take yo’res, on yo' Mammy's breas',
See dat light a-fadin' 'mong de pine trees in de wes
Yes, de day is gone, night is comin' on, 
Darksome night mus' come to us before another dawn. 
 
Chorus 
Whippo-will is callin', calhn' to his mate, 
Mockin'-bird is calhn' too. 
Pine trees is a-sighin', babies is a-cryin', 
As the dark-some night is passin' through. 
     Go to sleep, ma little honey, go to sleep, 
     Shut yo' weary eyelid an' don' you weep, 
          Sleep and take yo' res', 
          On yo' Mammy's breas', 
     Night can never harm you here. 
 
II. 
Honey, don' you see, dat it's got to be,
Day an' night, yes, day an' night, until yo' spirit's free,
Den you'll quit ma breas', fer to go an' res' 
Wid Anodder, who can pro-tec' you from harm de bes'! 
PUT AWAY THAT UKELELE AND BRING 
OUT THE OLD BANJO 
 
I.  
Don't you hear old Orpheus calling to you, Alexander Poe? 
He says just quit that ukelele and play on the old banjo, 
 Those Honolulu jingles like the dog has had its day, 
 Go put the faithful banjo down, put the ukelele away. 
     Chorus: 
Way down upon the,—I'm coming, yes, I hear that music, oh,
Put away that ukelele man, and play on the old banjo. 
 
2. 
Put away that ukelele, bring me down the old banjo, 
Sing again for me the tunes I love, Swanee River and Old Black Joe, 
Then play for me those melodies my mother used to hum, 
That between each syncopating note, the banjo went "Tum, tum." 
Chorus: Way down upon the, etc.

FOREWORD
IT is a pleasure and an honor for me to write a brief foreword concerning the remarkable genius of the author of this sunny medley of poems. Even the most casual perusal of these pages will impress the reader with the wide range of thought displayed by the author. Only an inkling, however, is given of his unconquerable spirit. Shut in within four walls by a strange decree of nature for many long years, racked at times by the most excruciating pains, denied free intercourse among his fellow-men and handicapped in a thousand other ways, he has overcome all these and composed these spritely lines.
This book and an earlier one should serve as a ray of light to those whose activity is curtailed by nature. They prove that although a man may become helpless from his shoulders down, he may exceed the wildest dreams of his friends if he has the perseverance and application to develop his latent talents from the shoulders up.
The winning fight of Mr. Ray G. Dandridge, in producing a work of art in the midst of a constant battle with nature, has won for him a prominent place among the poets of the Ohio valley and a commanding position among the literary minded of his race.
Born and reared on Price Hill, educated at the Whittier School, Mr. Dandridge is a true product of Cincinnati. His poems are based for the most part on his reflections on the earlier, active part of his life
 but he has, nevertheless, remained alive to the poetic possibilities of current events.
His poems, "Roosevelt," in which he utilizes the last words of the late ex-President, and "The Heritage" show his deep interest in the affairs of today. His dialect poems are particularly striking and true to life. His poems, "The Poet," quaint, homely but too often true, "To an Unhanged Judas," "Zalka Peetruza," "Red Rose," "Old Glory," "Ease," and "Toil Created" portray a wonderful insight and appreciation of things worth while outside of the intrinsic value of the verse.
The fame of the author has exceeded the limits of his boyhood suburb and his new book will no doubt add many new friends and admirers. I can only say in conclusion that he has my sincerest best wishes for continued success and that the last stanza of his poem "The Poet" will not hold good in his case:
"Who mock his song, deny him bread,
Then sing his praise when he is dead."
 WINSTON V. MORROW.
The Poet and Other Poems
THE POET
The poet sits and dreams and dreams;
He scans his verse; he probes his themes.
Then turns to stretch or stir about,
Lest, like his thoughts, his strength give out.
Then off to bed, for he must rise
And cord some wood, or tamp some ties,
Or break a field of fertile soil,
Or do some other manual toil.
He dare not live by wage of pen,
Most poorly paid of poor paid men,
With shoes o'er-run, and thread bare clothes,
And editors among the foes
Who mock his song, deny him bread,
Then sing his praise when he is dead.
TIME TO DIE
Black Brother, think you life so sweet
That you would live at any price?
Does mere existence balance with
The weight of your great sacrifice?
Or, can it be you fear the grave
Enough to live and die a slave?
O, Brother! be it better said,
When you are gone and tears are shed,
That your death was the stepping stone
Your children's children cross'd upon.
Men have died that men might live:
Look every foeman in the eye!
If necessary, your life give
For something, ere in vain you die.
OLD GLORY
God's placid heavens mother you,
His sunsets blend your bars,
His endless fields of midnight blue
Serve background for your stars.
So near immortal Emblem grand,
Cradled in the sky,
As long as earth and heavens stand,
You will not—shall not die!
A RECALLED PRAYER
Sis Hannah May Liza, so Emphraim sayed,
Stole out 'neaf a sycamo' tree an' prayed
To de Lawd in Hebbin, an' she ast dat He
W'u'd please sen' her a man fo' company.
Her prayah wuz answered; fo' a week wen' 'roun',
De Arch Decon Mordecai Joshua Brown
Ast Sis Hannah w'u'den she share his lot,
His boss an' his buggy, his boa'd an' his cot.
Straight away she etcepted, an' soon dey wor wed,
"Fo' bettah or wussah" de preachah man sed;
An' Hannah wuz happy, she thot dat she knowed
She had a reel he'p-mate to he'p tote de load.
De honeymoon riz, den it sot in its tracks,
W'en Hannah, po' Hannah, 'gan gazin on facks.
De bank book he flourished wuz long ovahdrawn,
An' paymint wuz jue on de close he had on.
De hoss an' de buggy, he ast her to share,
Belonged to his boss-man (Jedge Hinton Sinclair).
His boa'd an' his cot she foun' meagah an' slim,
In fack, his 'hole lot wuzen nuthin' 'cept him.
Den Probitshun cut Jedge's dockit so low
He foun' hisse'f forced to let Mordecai go;
An' seemed dar wuz nary one else roun' de town
Dat had wuk quite suited to Mordecai Brown.
Meanw'ile, Hannah labahed, bofe early an' late,
W'ile Mordecai armed wid pipe, pole an' bait,
Sot down by de ribbah, or loafed in de shade,
Or stood lookin' on w'ile de checkahs wuz played.
Et Barbah Shop sessions he'd freely discuss
Shakespeare, League ob Nations, Stock Markit an' Truss;
Et Church or Class Meetin', comman' in' de flo',
He'd tell ob God's Glory whar man's wuk is o'.
His appetite waxed, an' his drowsiness grew,
'Till eatin' an' sleepin' wuz all he w'u'd do.
Bofe meal time an' bed time he met wid a vim,
But all uddah labahs proved strangahs to him.
Enste'd ob he'p light'nin' po' Sis Hannah's load,
De Decon klum up on her burden an' rode.
Once mo', she stole out, 'near de varie same tree,
An' prayed, "Lawd, please Lawdy! taik dat man frum me."
RED ROSE
I plucked a rose, a red rose rare,
I placed her on a throne
Within my heart; and there I dare
To worship her alone.
An idol, thus, I paid to her
My constant vigil, love, and care.
Upon my knees, I prayed to her,
My whole heart in my prayer.
Alas! my love, my care, my prayer,
Failed! failed to keep my treasure fair.
I saw (my heart filled with despair)
Her drooping head;
Her beauty, grace and fragrance flown,
Her every leaf and petal shorn,
I gazed in silence—and alone—
Upon my dead.
A RESOLUTION
Mah ruddah's brokin, an' mah sail
Wen' ovah bode, in las' night's gale;
Mah bunkah's empty, steam am low,
Ise driftin' wid de undah tow.
Mah neighbah's bark goes skippin' by,
Wid breeze fat sail, 'near clear blue sky;
Seems lak de bes' ob bes' am his,
W'ile mine is all de wust whut is.
But mebbe sumthin', I cain't see,
Maiks mah neighbah envy me:
Purhaps I w'u'd hab differn views
Ef I wuz stan'in' in his shoes.
So, 'ste'd ob grumblin' 'bout mah lot,
I'll do mah bes' wid whut I got;
Kaze He doan ast dat eny man
Do bettah dan de bes' he can.
SONGS AND SMILES
Well-meaning friends often ask,
Am I not weary of my task,
And how I dare give voice to song—
I who have lain thus so long.
Many the times a quizzing thought
Has asked of me why I have sought
To sing my songs, though oft in pain,
And if my songs are not in vain.
To quizzing thought and you, dear friends,
I fear I offer no amends,
Except that I find songs and smiles
Help lessen intervening miles
'Twixt me and yonder peaceful crest,
Where I shall rest.
TRUE FREN
You sez dat ole frens am de best.
I begs yore pawden, deed I do,
Kaze I think he is mighty blest
Who hab a true fren, ole or new.
TO AN UNHANGED JUDAS
Cannibalistic vulture,
Grown fat upon your brother's blood,
The Tide you do not seek to stem
Engulfs you in its flood.
The cords you bind about his hands,
Hold your hands doubly fast;
And when you rend his anchor chain,
Your bark adrift you cast.
The day you snuff his light of hope,
And dim ambition's guiding spark,
You doom yourself to ever grope
In tractless waste of endless dark.
O! blasphemer of sacred trust,
Go hide your dirty, double face!
Far better were you dead at birth
Than live to sacrifice your Race.
Vile cringing cur, unfit to hang,
Live long to writhe in pain
Beneath on-marching feet of those
Who fall—to rise again.
VALUATION
No man can shape his destiny,
Though ardent his desire,
Or shift his heavy load elsewhere,
Should he perchance to tire.
Though weak or mighty he may be,
Though he may "choose and fend,"
The given road allotted him
Is his road to the end.
The plodding soul was born to plod,
The foiler born to foil;
The driver born to wield the rod,
The toiler born to toil.
'Tis not the prestige of your cast
Among the roles of earth,
But how well you do what you do
That demonstrates your worth.
RETRIBUTION
Rent and bleeding,
Upon her knees
She cried, "Mercy!"
The voice of Justice,
Mockingly, inquired,
"What of mercy have you shown?"
Four hundred thousand,
Armless colonists,
Raised nubs—grim evidence.
'ITTLE TOUZLE HEAD
(To R. V. P.)
Cum, listen w'ile yore Unkel sings,
Erbout how low sweet chariot swings,
Truint Angel, wifout wings,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head.
Stop! Stop! how dare you laff et me,
Bekaze I foul de time an' key,
Thinks you dat I is Black Pattie,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head?
O, Honey Lam'! dem sparklin' eyes,
Dat often laffs an' selem cries,
Is sho a God gib natchel prize,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head.
An' doze wee han's so sof' an' sweet,
Mates wid dem toddlin', velvet feet,
Jes to roun' you out, complete,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head.
Sma't! youse sma't ez sma't kin be,
Knows yore evah A, B, C,
Plum on down to X, Y, Z,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head.
De man doan know how much he miss,
Ef he ain't got no neice lak dis;
Fro yore Unkel one mo' kiss,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head!
I wist sum magic w'u'd ellow,
(By charm or craf'—doan mattah how)
You stay jes lak you is right now,
Mah 'ittle Touzle Head.
MEMORIES
I am as fond of fun and jokes
As other real red-blooded folks.
I relish bits of breezy spice,
Within the bounds considered "nice;"
And do not think, because I'm down,
That I must whine and wear a frown.
I love to eat. I love to drink.
I love to be alone and think
Of faded days, and of the girls
Whose mem'ries are a string of pearls.
No matter what the bliss to-day,
To-morrow finds it in decay,
And likewise every sorrow flees,
Leaving only memories.
TO A BIRD
Sweet singer, how I envy you,
Faint, fleeting, speck 'gainst azure hue.
You have gone up to chant your lay,
While I must be content to stay
Below, and gaze, with hungry eyes,
Upon you, soaring t'ward the prize.
ROOSEVELT.
"Put out the light!"
He had no need of man-made glow
With celestial Dawn in sight:
Unflinchingly, we saw him go
Onward, to mount the highest Height.
"Put out the light!"
"Put out the light!"
His noble soul, stranger to fear,
Sought not the guidance of a spark:
His active conscience, ever clear,
Knew little gloom and less of dark.
"Put out the light!"
"Put out the light!"
Apostle of "Preparedness,"
Who lived and died prepared,
Had he not seen a just redress,
Could he—would he have dared
"Put out the light?"
"Put out the light!"
A sacred wreath we hang on high
Upon immortal mem'ry's wall,
To never wither, droop or die,
Until we, too, have heard the call—
"Put out the light!"
SPRIN' FEVAH
Dar's a lazy, sortah hazy
Feelin' grips me, thoo an' thoo;
An' I feels lak doin' less dan enythin';
Dough de saw is sharp an' greasy,
Dough de task et han' is easy,
An' de day am fair an' breezy,
Dar's a thief dat steals embition in de win'.
Kaint defy it, kaint deny it,
Kaze it jes wont be denied;
Its a mos' pursistin' stubbern sottah thin';
Anti Tox' doan neutrolize it;
Doctahs fail to analyze it;
So I yiel's (dough I despise it)
To dat res'less, wretchit fevah
evah Sprin'.
DAYS
Do tell me, where is yesterday?
All-knowing Sage, I dare thee say
Other than it has been cast
Into the maelstrom of the past.
And tell me of to-morrow, Sage,
If thou canst read an unturn'd page,
And, also, something of to-day
That was to-morrow, yesterday.
DECREED
(Matthew—2:15)
Indirectly, out of Africa you came
By His decree; 'twas no miscarried chance
That bade you face despoilers of His name,
Upon the red-run battle fields of France.
Just so, each word, each jot, and every tittle
That He has ever promised or decreed,
No matter how majestic or how little,
Shall follow in the foot steps of His lead.
A BROOK
Reflecting ragged
Flecks of white,
Upon a background blue,
A living, liquid, ribbon
Slips, zig-zag,
Through meadow land.
Creeping, leaping,
Sighing, singing,
Piu Piano
At even flow,
Crescendo!
At the rapids.
TOIL CREATED
Dutiful, underpaid bearer of burden
(Although as oxen your past roles were cast,
And dark the stage whereon your scene was set)
The wearing of the yoke of toil has been your alchemist.
Heights imperceptible, by sheer strength surmounted,
Dire circumstance and hind'ring bars o'ercome,
With sinew taut and stamina unyielding,
Complete, you stand a toil created man.
TO —
Though many are the dreams I dream,
They're born within a single theme.
The same kind voice I ever hear,
Instilling faith, upbraiding fear:
The same consoling smile appears
To snuff my sighs and dry my tears:
And fondest heart, of purest gold,
Is hers whose name I here withold,
And pray naught ever change my theme,
Or wake me from my dream.
SUPPLICATION
(Dedicated to Cincinnati Branch, N. A. A. C. P., and sung to the air, "America")
Dear Lord we come to Thee,
In quest of Liberty,
Thy mercy lend.
We know no better way
Than serve, obey and pray,
Protect us night and day,
Almighty Friend.
Unsheathe Thy vengeful sword,
Cleave us a way, O Lord,
As naught else can.
Let no base foe oppress,
Let no vain thought repress
Our future usefulness
To God and Man.
We have no ancient creed,
We have no glutton's greed
To satisfy.
We seek the lofty height,
Where Justice, Truth and Right,
Condemn oppressor's might,
Like God on High.
May World Democracy
Include equality
For every one.
Father, all-wise and just,
Do as Thou wilt with us,
In Thee, alone, we trust,
"Thy will be done."
FRENSHIP
(To G. B. P.)
I have filched a mite ob time
Fo' de writin' ob dis rhyme.
Seems I c'u'den do a thin' ontwil I'd writ it.
Evah man ain' got a fren'
Dat kin stir his lyrick pen,
An' ain' evah one kin feel
Han' clasp lak de grip ob steel:
Consequently, dey dat kin kin not fo'git it.
Dat prestige ain' ha'f bad a bit,
An' gole is precious, I'll etmit;
But dar's sumpin' in dis worl' a 'hole heap dearah.
It's de knowin' ob a fren'
Dat is yore fren to de en',
Dough de en' en's in a cloud,
Or in a caskit, grave an' shroud,
Yore fren's frenship maiks de gloomy outlook clearah.
OPPORTUNITY
The shackles rend, your hands are free,
You need no longer humb'ly bow
Beneath the lash of tyranny;
Go shape the molten metal now.
Behold! "The Door of Hope," ajar,
And Freedom freely beckoning;
She bids you gaze upon a star,
And veer not from your reckoning!
ZALKA PEETRUZA
(Who was christened Lucy Jane)
She danced, near nude, to tom-tom beat,
With swaying arms and flying feet,
'Mid swirling spangles, gauze and lace,
Her all was dancing—save her face.
A conscience, dumb to brooding fears,
Companioned hearing deaf to cheers;
A body, marshalled by the will,
Kept dancing while a heart stood still:
And eyes obsessed with vacant stare
Looked over heads to empty air,
As though they sought to find therein
Redemption for a maiden sin.
'Twas thus, amid force driven grace,
We found the lost look on her face;
And then, to us, did it occur
That, though we saw—we saw not her.
WEDDAH
It wuz cole, de snow dun drifted
Hi' roun' 'bout de ole barn do';

Fallin' out or obah het.
Seems de weddah nebbah pleases,
W'en we hab it boilin' hot
We cry fo' de kine dat freezes,
Alwuz wantin' whut is not.
But it's cleah beyon' our fixin',
Bofe hab faults an' merits, too,
An' de Seasons dats betwixin'
Duzen las' de 'hole yeah thoo.
EASE
Oh! foolish one in quest of ease,
Do you not know that ease on earth, for men,
Is like unto the "Pot of Gold"
upon the rainbow's end;
A wily "will-o'-the-wisp" who
flees, and flees, and flees,
Not huriedly, but just a step
beyond your grasp—is ease?
BROTHER MINE
Prejudice with venom smote every word and act;
Snuffed was the light of knowledge from your view.
Unbefriended martyr, sole object of attack,
Has your fair brother fairly dealt with you,
Brother mine?
Upon defenseless womanhood he preyed;
Then freely chatteled blood one half his own.
Just punishment has only been delayed;
'Tis written; "Ye shall reap as ye have sown,"
Brother mine.
In doctored balance Justice balanced you;
In your defense her vengeful sword ne'er stirred;
Courts of Law, barring facts, basing guilt on hue,
Condemned you, ere the evidence was heard—
Brother mine.
Your constant prayer that you might prove your worth
For equal right to struggle, live, and die,
So long unheard, unheeded, here on earth,
Found audience in One beyond the sky—
Brother 'mine.
"Vengence is Mine, I will repay!" so saith the Lord.
Thusly assured, rail not at destiny.
To righteousness He promised just reward;
And to the bondman promised Liberty—
Brother mine.
A. L. IMES
Some men go beyond their way
To advertise, in bold display,
The knowledge of the favors they may lend.
Yet, I find one who, if he might,
Would do his best deeds in the night,
And in the darkness bid the matter end.
CENSORED
My Harvah rit me week fo' las',
Dat is, dat's w'en I got it;
He sed, he hardly had de time
'Tween shot an' shell to jot it;
An' dat he had a rail bad cole,
But it wuz gettin' bettah.
Shucks! I disremembah ha'f he rit,
So I'll jes' read his lettah.
"Deah Darlin' Mine: I think ob you
W'ile heah in —" dar it's blotted out.
But dat it twuz sumphin' rail sweet
An' lubin', dar's no doubt.
Den takin' up whar blottin' stop:
"I thanks you fo' de candy,
De sweatah an' de backah, too,
Dey sho wuz fine an' dandy.
"I'spect to see you, Deah, fo' long,
De Capin sed—" ain't dat a doun right sin,
Jes et de inderestin' part,
Dat blottin' starts ergin?
Aldough I frets, I obahlooks
Caze jes' ez lak ez not,
Dem bullits whizzin' right an' lef'
Maik enybody blot.
COLOR BLIND
True I am black not by my will;
I had no choice of hue,
And none was given you.
By His decree our roles we fill.
Red man, Yellow man, Brown man,
You too, man of white,
What cause or right
Have we to emphasize our clan?
The haughty King, of royal birth,
The peasant, craftsman, and the slave,
Stript naked, stand alone on worth,
Beyond the portals of the grave,
Before that Bar where all men find
The Judge of judges color blind.
ARISE
Arise! ye humble undertrodden wight,
Behold, at edge of yonder east,
The blazing Sun of Hope adawn!
Think ye not thou needst ever be
The hireling, or an o'er lord's slave;
For He who makes all men, also made thee,
Of sinew, brain, and bone,
And bade thee cleave a bit of earth
Whereon to stand alone.
BETWEEN LINES
(In a little book P. P.)
Learned Sages,
Scan these pages,
Recognize the wealth they hold!
All those places,
That seems spaces,
Golden memories unfold.
Bord'ring edges
Are the ledges,
Whereon rest my rod and staff;
And there's treasure
Beyond measure,
On the fly leaves, fore and aft.
DECEIT
No venomous cobra's stab e'er stung,
Like nectared lies on a false friend's tongue.
Better by far the deadliest foe
Who does not fail to let you know
He is your foe, nor does it smart
As badly, when he rends your heart.
DE INNAH PART
I 'fess Ise ugly, big, an' ruff,
Mah voice is husky, mannah's gruff;
But, mah gal sed, "Neb mine yore hide,
I jedge you by yore inside side;"
An' sed, dat she hab alwuz foun'
De gole beneaf de surfuss groun'.
She claims dat often rail ruff hides
Am boun' erroun' hi' grade insides;
W'ile sum dat 'pear "sharp ez a tack"
Kinceals a heart dat's hard an' black;
An', to prove her way ob thinkin',
Gibs fo' zample Abeham Linkin.
Ole "Hones' Abe," so lank an' tall,
Worn't no parlah posin' doll:
Yet he stood out miles erbove
Uddah men, in truf an' love.
An' in han'lin' 'fairs of state,
Proved de greates' ob de great.
In makin' great men, Nature mus'
Fo'got erbout de beauty dus',
An' fashun dem frum nachel clay,
De gritty kine, dat doan decay.
But, mos' her time she spent, I know,
Erpon de parts dat duzen show.
AT THE BIER OF HOPE
The night winds drone, in mournful lay,
A solemn requiem o'er the dead.
Lamented Hope of yesterday,
Was there naught you could will instead—
Naught, save a vast uncharted sea
Beset with shoals of misery?
In my heart's blood I dip my pen,
The tears, fast falling, dim my eyes,
A sigh escapes my lips, and then
I strive to rend the binding ties
That stay my hand lest I should write
And, thereby, ease a storm swept mind.
Alas! though I exert my might,
Expressiveness I fail to find.
LOVE
Invisible, saccharined,
Intoxicating stimulant,
I drank of you—drank deep of you—
Until drunk, yea! until
Drunk, drunk indeed.
On sobering I find myself
Unlike the drunkard, blest,
Who sobers with an aching head;
For I have sobered
With an aching heart.
HAHD CIDAH
Wondah whut on earf tiz ails me,
Seems I see mo' outlan'ish t'ings,
Sech ez wagons pullin' hosses,
An' red mens, wid horns an' wings.
Mussy! how dese steps do tremble,
Dey's jes ez loose ez dey kin be,
An' dat do'-knob thinks it's clevah
Playin' "hide an' seek" wid me.
Dar's a dashah in mah stumick,
Churnin', flip! flop! up an' down:
Mah po' achin' head am spinnin',
Whoop-pee-la-la! roun' an' roun'.
Tongue dun swole up thick ez two tongues:
Goo' Lawd! whut is I to do?
'Speck Ise got de eppazutic,
Or dat ah new fangled "Flu."
I is sartin tizent "Goofoo,"
Caze I ain' ett no strangah's grub,
An' Ise bin nowhar, 'cept callin'
On mah hi brown Lady Lub.
We set coatin', me an' Idah,
'Near de arbah, in her yahd,
Holdin' han's an' sippin' cidah
Frum a brown jug, labeled "Hahd."
JUDGE YE NOT
Remember, friend,
Each harsh word spoken
May descend
On poor, heart-broken
Wretch, whose road
Would be the brighter,
If his heavy load
Were lighter.
Perhaps you,
Upon the morrow,
May be smitten through
By sorrow;
Perhaps word
That you now utter,
Echo heard,
Would cause a shudder.
"Judge ye not"
Weak fellow mortal,
Whose dire lot
And open portal
May admit you
(In a measure)
To a view
Bereft of pleasure.
IN FLANDERS FIELDS
(Written after reading "The Appeal," by Lieut. Col. John McCrea; "The Promise," by G. B. Galbreath, and "The Fulfillment,'' by Joseph A. Clark.)
THE HERITAGE
Row on row the crosses stand;
The breeze blown poppies nod
Approval of the gallant band
Asleep beneath the sod,
In Flanders Fields.
No lark is nigh:
Aloft, a plane (man's eagle of the sky)
Is strewing wreaths on those who lie
In Flanders Fields.
No resting soul need wake to weep
For faith mistrusted to our keep:
His heritage is peaceful sleep—
In Flanders Fields.
IN OLE KINTUCKY
Dey greets you wid a nod an' smile,
Way down in Ole Kintucky,
Dat maiks you feel lak life's wuth w'ile
Way down in Ole Kintucky:

An' dar's sum hiddin coppah stills

An' dar's a welcome waitin' you,

FACTS
Triumphant Sable Heroes homeward turning,
Arrayed in medals, bright, and half-healed scars,
Has service, life, and limb been given earning
Trophies, issued at the hand of Mars?
If your sole gain has been these "marks of battle,"
If valient deeds insure no greater claim,
If you are still to be the herder's cattle,
Then ill spilt blood fell short of Freedom's aim.
Democracy means more than empty letters,
And Liberty far more than partly free;
Yet, both are void as long as men, in fetters,
Are at eclipse with Opportunity.
A GRAY DAY
The skies are hung with sullen clouds,
A fine mist chills the air,
And earth is wrapt in heavy shrouds
Of stillness and despair.
The birds that sang, so merrily,
Deserters are to-day;
Once laughing brooks sigh mournfully
'Neath skies of leaden gray.
ETERNITY
Vast realm beyond the gate of death,
Where craven scavengers and kings,
Alike, with passing final breath,
Relinquish claim to earthly things.
Endless, unexplored expanse,
Where souls, bereft of mortal clay,
Wander at will, in peace, perchance—
Perchance in strife, who dare would say?
IN STRIPES
Two rail pert sma't ellicks, fresh frum Smif's Normal School,
Figgahed dey maik sport ob me, played me fo' a fool;
Tuk me to Parkah's Garden, whar dey keeps de Bears,
Elephants, an' Tigahs, Lines an' Billjen Hares.
We seen a Hipinpotomus, we seen a tall Giraff,
An' heaps ob ringtail monkies an' Hyenahs dat laff:
Den nex' we spied a critah astan' in' mouchin' hay,
De boys called him a Zebra frum doun in Africay.
Den dey side glanced each uddah, thor dey had me right,
"Cast dair fly" fo' suckahs an' etspected me to bite.
But 'ste'd, I looked him obah, frum his head to his tail,
An' I seed plain he's jes a hoss, doin' time in jail.
GONE WEST
O.W. D.
I often wonder, Oscar,
How it fares with you;
Do you look down and smile on us,
From that vast realm of blue?
Tell me, Brother, do you hear
The belching cannon's roar?
Does their death-dealing thunder break
Your peace on yonder shore?
I seem to hear you answering,
That toil and pain and woe
And care and strife—ah! yes, and death
Were left behind, below.
SUNSET
Round appearing,
Illuminant fire,
Built in space,
Shedding heat,
Traveling westward;
Your photosphere
Conflicts
With dwindl'ing light
Of stricken day,
At dying hour.
Emerging from
The reek appears
At distant edge of earth,
A straightened rainbow
Reaching far into the sky—
You are an artist, Sun!
TRACIN' TALES
No doubt dat you lak to know jes whut wuz ailin' us,
Why me and Maffew Pleasen'view had dat tremandus fuss;
So I'll just splain, ez bes' I kin, how it dun cure erbout,
An' leab de placin' ob de blame fo' you to figgah out.
Furst, Maffew sed, Wash Dudley tole May Belle Hannah Lee
Sum mighty, mighty ugly tales kincernin' Nance an' me.
Den w'en I goes to Dudley an' ast him wor it so,
He sed, he only ovah heared Jack tellin' Ismah Lowe.
Den I goes straight to Ismah, an' Iss sen's me to Jack,
An' Jack sed his wife got it frum Ann Marildah Black;
Right on to Ann Marildah's I ambles on mah way,
To fine dat she had bin enformed by Belledonah Grey.
Boun' dat I'd hab de truf fo' long, I tuk out once too';
An' soon Ise stan'in', hat in han', et Belledonah's do';
An' w'en I broached her 'bout it, she sed, ob co'se 'twas true,
Caze it cum confidensul frum Maffew Pleasen'view.
A DISAGREEMENT
You say "That man was made to mourn."
Would you have me believe it—
Believe earth holds no recompense
Until death bids me leave it—
Believe there is but misery
And toil on toil, in store for me?
No. I do not, cannot believe,
While heaven smiles above me,
That I was doom'd on earth to mourn
With naught to cheer or love me.
Wise Bard, although your dirge rings true,
I do not agree with you.
EVERYWHERE
How dare you question Him, or doubt,
With proof conclusive all about?
What basis has your faith and hope
If grave and death conclude your scope?
Do you not see, as here you stand,
The working of His Master Hand?
Behold you not in field and stream
Presence of His power, supreme?
He is a solace to the poor
In purse and spirit; He is more.
An all-wise Counsel to the meek;
A place of refuge for the weak;
His Omnipresence fills the air!
Behold Him, doubter, everywhere!
SINGIN' AN' PRAYIN'
De hardes' ob hard rows we hoes
Fo' little pay, de goo' Lawd knows.
Yet we hab kep' de heart to sing
Enspite ob dat ah sort ob t'ing.
Aldough de outlook ain't so bright
An' t'ings doan seem to go jes right,
We still is mighty glad to say
Dat we ain't plum fo'got to pray.
RAIN
The clouds are shedding tears of joy,
They fall with rhythmic beat
Upon the earth, and soon destroy
Dust dunes and waves of heat.
Each falling drop enforcement bears
To river, lake and rill,
And sweet refreshment gladly shares
With wooded dell and hill.
Every flower, bud and leaf,
Each blossom, branch and tree
Distills the rain, 'tis my belief,
To feed the honey bee.
I pity every wretch I find
Who, frowning in disdain,
Is deaf and dumb and also blind
To beauty in the rain.
THE NARCISSUS
Seemingly dead, bent, brown and dried,
Unnoticed on yon shelf, she lay;
Until a voice within her cried,
"Awake! 'tis Ressurrection Day."
A slender blade of palest green
From her inner soul crept out,
Timid, fearful to be seen,
A lone adventurer—in doubt.
Then bolder shoots of deeper hue
Sprang resolutely into view:
And, centered in their midst, appeared
A stem whose head was ever reared
Upward toward the sun and light,
Until at last, in raiment white,
A flower, full blown upon the breeze,
Did freely waft perfume to please—
You and me.
MAH DEPEN'ABLE FREN'
He doan care how po' I am,
Or dat folks calls me "Luckless Sam,"
Or dat Ise black, 'sted white or red,
Ez long ez I pat his ole head,
An' let him scratch his fuzz an' fleas
Erbout de place whar ebb he please.
He's bin wid me thoo thick an' thin;
Stood by mah side w'en mah blood kin
Done turnt me loose to sink or swim,
An' let me tell mah woes to him;
Jes laid his ole head on mah knee
An' good ez sed, depen' on me.
Las' Toosday mo'nin', jes' bout ten,
Dog body-snatchers cot mah fren'
An' put him in de dog lock up,
Long side en onree, mangy pup;
An' dar he lay, paws cross his face,
Ershame to be in sech a place.
Aldough it tuk mah pile, ni' bout,
Doun' I wen' an' bailed him out;
An' dat ole boy jes understood
Ez good ez enybody c'u'd;
Kaze w'en he seen me makin' bail
He 'gan to bark an' wag his tail.
Den, I paid mah las' 'hole dollah
Fo' dem license on his collah,
Fust class, gent'man dog's permit
To let him go what he sees fit,
Thout bein' pestard by de scamps
Dat prey on po' fo' footed tramps.
ONE WORD
If I had mighty wings to fly,
I d soar aloft in youder sky,
And paint with fire, to never die,
One word—Mother!
Then far out on the desert waste,
In glist'ning sands again I'd trace,
So deep that naught could e'er erase,
One word—Mother!
DE DRUM MAJAH
He's struttin' sho ernuff,
Wearin' a lady's muff
En' ways erpon his head,
Red coat ob reddest red,
Purtty white satin ves',
Gole braid ercross de ches';
Goo'ness! he cuts a stunt,
Prancin' out dar in frunt,
Leadin' his ban'.
W'en dat ah whistle blows,
Each man behine him knows
'Zacklee whut he mus' do;
You bet! he dues it, too.
W'en dat brass stick he twirls,
Ole maids an' lub-sick gurls
Looks on wid longin' eyes,
Dey simpley idolize
Dat han'sum man.
Sweet fife an' piccalo,
Bole warblin' sol' an' lo',
Slide ho'n an' saxophones,
Jazz syncopated tones,
Snare drum an' lead cornet,
Alto an' clarinet,
Las', but not least, dar cum
Cymbals an' big bass drum—
O! whut a ban'!
Cose, we all undahstan'
Each piece he'ps maik de ban',
But dey all mus' be led,
Sum one mus' be de head:
No doubt, de centipede
Has all de laigs he need,
But take erway de head,
Po' centipede am dead;
So am de ban'.
PRETTY FLOWER
Truly thou lovest pretty flowers,
For pretty flower, thyself, thou art.
May I, if tenderly I pluck thee,
Make fast thy tendrils to my heart—
Pretty Flower?
And should Fate deem thee answer, pluck me!
Would one of meager courage dare
To place the hand he feels unworthy
Upon a spotless lily, fair,
Pretty Flower?
PURCAUTION
Dey think I is "set" an' "fo'gee,"
An' dey lub to sneer an' laff,
Gaze I duzen fancy black cats
Crossin' cross mah moon-lit paf.
An' dey calls me "supahstitious,
Ignant, emptee headed fool,
Relick ob days, dead an' buried
Befo' man invented school."
Dey doan stop w'en black cats cross 'em;
Aftah sun down, sweeps de flo';
Cum in yore house thoo de parlah;
Go out by de kitchen do';
Hang dair hats erpon de bed-stead;
Sweep dair feets off wid de broom;
Two will sit deysef on one chair,
Dats p'ovidin' dar is room.
Dey doan feah "thirteen" nor "Friday";
Dey puts on de lef' shoe furst;
Lubs to do whut am fo'biddin',
Jes to aggravate de wurst.
Dey duz dair way; I duz mah way;
Many folks hab many mines;
I jes ain't de sort, I reckon,
To defi de bad luck signs.
MY GRIEVANCE
Yes, I admit a grievance.
I also boldly challenge you—
Come stand where I once stood and fell!
I dare say you will do as well.
Yes, I have long been underpaid,
Although my brain and brawn has made
You rich. O! when do I commence
Receiving honest recompense?
Yes, I am lynched. Is it that I
Must without judge or jury die?
Though innocent, am I accursed
To quench the mob's blood-thirsty thirst?
Yes, I am mocked. Pray tell me why!
Did not my brothers freely die
For you, and your Democracy—
That each and all alike be free?
Yes, I am loyal. But how long
Must I subsist on bitter wrong?
How long shall I give smile for blow,
How long! How long! I ask to know?
Yes, I admit a grievance.
I also boldly challenge you—
Come stand where I once stood and fell!
I dare say you will do as well.
KASSEL B'ILDIN'
Hab you evah laid 'wake dreamin'
B'ildin' kassels in de air,
Wid de windahs purtty stain glass,
Marbell hall, and windin' stair;
An' a drive ob snow white pebbells
Runnin' plum up to de stabell,
Cross a lawn, dats green an' lebell
Ez a bran new bilyard tabell?
Ise dun dun dat varie thin', Sah!
An' I wondah kin dar be
Eny uddah foolish creachah
Kassel b'ildin', jes lak me.
But it doan hu't none, I figgah,
An' I fines it mighty fine,
Jes alayin' b'ildin' kassels,
W'en dar's nuthin' on mah mine.
UNFLINCHINGLY
When tabes claims my useless frame,
And I am with my fathers laid,
I want it said that when he came,
I met him—met him unafraid.
Unflinchingly, full-trustingly,
I hope to face his icy breath,
And step into Eternity
To comfort, through the gate of death.
TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE
Through ages down Time's ceaseless span,
An endless, vivid caravan,
His mem'ry wends to ever be
An inspiration to the Free.
Fearless, black, unlettered slave,
From nowhere, sprang in time to save
The freedom of a fault'ring band,
A tremble 'neath a tyrant's hand.
Tricked, trapped, ah, yes, betrayed!
He died a man's death, unafraid;
And dying thus gave proof that he
Was fit to live—eternally.
MASQUERADING
The lips so often frame a smile
While the eyes in salt tears swim:
And heart, repellent cup of bile,
Is filled to kiss the brim.
Oft firm and stern we find a face,
Devoid of outward sign,
A mask before the dwelling place
Of happiness divine.
SANDY
Its bin ni ontoe three years
Since mah Goo' Man, Sandy,
Marched erway, twixt sighs an' tears,
Frum his own Mirandy.
Out yondah on de battle fiel',
Whar de bustin' bullits squeal,
An you often miss a meal,
Wuz mah Goo' Man, Sandy.
Now de smoke am cleahed erway,
An' mah Goo' Man, Sandy,
Is cumin' home dis verah day—
Home to his Mirandy.
Cumin' bac' to co'n fiel's green,
Wid de snap-beans growin' tween,
To de chile he's nevah seen,
An' to his Mirandy.

        <collex:text>Lovely dainty Spanish needle
            With your yellow flower and white,
            Dew bedecked and softly sleeping,
            Do you think of me to-night?
            Shadowed by the spreading mango,
            Nodding o’er the rippling stream,
            Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,
            Do you of the exile dream?
            Do you see me by the brook’s side
            Catching crayfish ‘neath the stone,
            As you did the day you whispered:
            Leave the harmless dears alone?
            Do you see me in the meadow
            Coming from the woodland spring
            With a bamboo on my shoulder
            And a pail sling from a string?
            Do you see me all expectant
            Lying in an orange grove,
            While the swee-swees sing above me,
            Waiting for my elf-eyed love?
            Lovely dainty Spanish needle,
            Source to me of sweet delight,
            In your far-off sunny southland
            Do you dream of me to-night?

        <collex:text>His Spirit in smoke ascended to high heaven.
            His father, by the cruelest way of pain,
            Had bidden him to his bosom once again;
            The awful sin remained still unforgiven.
            All night a bright and solitary star
            (Perchance the one that ever guided him,
            Yet gave him up at last to Fate’s wild whim)
            Hung pitifully o’er the swinging char.
            Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view
            The ghastly body swaying in the sun
            The women thronged to look, but never a one
            Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue;
            And little lads, lynchers that were to be,
            Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.

        <collex:text>Your voice is the color of a robin’s breast,
            And there’s a sweet sob in it like rain—still rain in the night.
            Among the leaves of the trumpet-tree, close to his nest,
            The pea-dove sings, and each note thrills me with strange delight
            Like the words, wet with music, that well from your trembling throat.
            I’m afraid of your eyes, they’re so bold,
            Searching me through, reading my thoughts, shining like gold.
            But sometimes they are gentle and soft like the dew on the lips of the eucharis
            Before the sun comes warm with his lover’s kiss.
            You are sea-foam, pure with the star’s love-lines,
            Not mortal, a flower, a fairy, too fair for the beauty-shorn earth.
            All wonderful things, all beautiful things, gave of their wealth to your birth.
            Oh I love you so much, not recking of passion, that I feel it is wrong!
            But men will love you, flower, fairy, non-mortal spirit burdened with flesh,
            Forever, life-long.

        <collex:text>Alfonso is a handsome bronze-hued lad
            Of subtly-changing and surprising parts;
            His moods are storms that frighten and make glad,
            His eyes were made to capture women’s hearts.
            Down in the glory-hole Alfonso sings
            An olden song of wine and clinking glasses
            And riotous rakes; magnificently flings
            Gay kisses to imaginary lasses.
            Alfonso’s voice of mellow music thrills
            Our swaying forms and steals our hearts with joy;
            And when he soars, his fine falsetto trills
            Are rarest notes of gold without alloy.
            But, O Alfonso! wherefore do you sing
            Dream-songs of carefree men and ancient places?
            Soon we shall be beset by clamouring
            Of hungry and importunate palefaces.

        <collex:text>The dancers have departed, dear,
            And the last song has been sung- ;
            The red-stained glasses mock my gaze
            And the fiddle lies unstrung.
            And I'm alone, alone once more,
            Save for your sweet brown face
            That comes reproachfully to me
            In this unholy place.
            I've kissed a thousand flowers, my own,
            Gone drunk with their perfume;
            But found out, when the madness passed,
            You were the one pure bloom.
            I've come to realise at last
            How awful it may be
            To cut adrift from sacred ties
            And be completely free.
            But life grows many flowers, my love,
            Within its garden wall,
            And passions are the strangest
            And the deadliest of all.

        <collex:text>The Dawn! the Dawn, the crimson-tinted comes
            Out of the low still skies, over the hills,
            New York's fantastic spires and cheerless domes,-
            The Dawn! my spirit to its spirit thrills.
            Almost the mighty city is asleep,
            No pushing-crowd, no tramping, tramping feet;
            But here and there a few cars, groaning, creep
            Along, above and underneath the street,
            Bearing their strangely-ghostly burdens by,
            The women and the men of garish nights,
            Their eyes wine-weakened and their clothes awry,
            Nodding under the strong electric lights.
            On through the waning shadows of New York,
            Before the Dawn, I wend my way to work.

            Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold,
            Far as the eye could see was ghostly white;
            Dark was the night save for the snow’s weird light.
            I drew the shades far down, crept into bed;
            Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead
            Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain,
            Went sorrowing with it across the plain.
            At dawn, behold! the pall of night was gone,
            Save where a few shrubs melancholy, lone,
            Detained a fragile shadow. Golden-lipped
            The laughing grasses heaven’s sweet wine sipped.
            The sun rose smiling o’er the river’s breast,
            And my soul, by his happy spirit blest,
            Soared like a bird to greet him in the sky,
            And drew out of his heart Eternity.

            As they shoulder pick and hoe,
            And I watch their steady walking
            To the quiet plain below.
            O! I see the white stream dashing
            Gay and reckless through the brake,
            O'er the root-entwined rocks washing
            Swiftly, madly to the lake;
            O! I hear the waters falling,
            Flowing, falling, flowing free,
            And the sound of voices calling
            O'er the billows of the sea.

        <collex:text>Heart of the saffron rose,
            Lines of the lily red,
            Gold of the buttercup,
            Dew of the daisies bed,
            Flight of the rising bird
            Luring me to the skies,
            Smile of an evening star
            Playing before mine eyes,
            Rime of the silver morn
            Fair on the green of trees,
            Scent of the coffee blooms
            Waking the drowsy bees;
            Charming and beautiful,
            Rare are these sights to see;
            But more than all and more
            Is your fond heart to me.

        <collex:text>O sweet are tropic lands for waking dreams!
            There time and life move lazily along.
            There by the banks of blue-and-silver streams
            Grass-sheltered crickets chirp incessant song,
            Gay-colored lizards loll all through the day,
            Their tongues outstretched for careless little flies,
            And swarthy children in the fields at play,
            Look upward laughing at the smiling skies.
            A breath of idleness is in the air
            That casts a subtle spell upon all things,
            And love and mating-time are everywhere,
            And wonder to life’s commonplaces clings.
            The fluttering humming-bird darts through the trees
            And dips his long beak in the big bell-flowers,
            The leisured buzzard floats upon the breeze,
            Riding a crescent cloud for endless hours,
            The sea beats softly on the emerald strands—
            O sweet for quiet dreams are tropic lands!

            The ugly corners of the Negro belt;
            The miseries and pains of these harsh days
            By you will never, never again be felt.
            No more, if still you wander, will you meet
            With nights of unabating bitterness;
            They cannot reach you in your safe retreat,
            The city’s hate, the city’s prejudice!
            ‘Twas sudden—but your menial task is done,
            The dawn now breaks on you, the dark is over,
            The sea is crossed, the longed-for port is won;
            Farewell, oh, fare you well! my friend and lover.

        <collex:text>When June comes dancing o’er the death of May,
            With scarlet roses tinting her green breast,
            And mating thrushes ushering in her day,
            And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest,
            I always see the evening when we met─
            The first of June baptized in tender rain─
            And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet,
            Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love’s pain.
            I always see the cheerful little room,
            And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed,
            Sweet scented with a delicate perfume,
            Wherein for one night only we were wed;
            Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute,
            And heard the whispering showers all night long,
            And your brown burning body was a lute
            Whereon my passion played his fevered song.
            When June comes dancing o’er the death of May,
            With scarlet roses staining her fair feet,
            My soul takes leave of me to sing all day
            A love so fugitive and so complete.

            There is a subtle sweetness in the sun,
            The ripples on the stream’s breast gaily run,
            The wind more boisterously by me blows,
            And each succeeding day now longer grows.
            The birds a gladder music have begun,
            The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun,
            From maples’ topmost branch the brown twig throws.
            I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean:
            I know that thou art making ready to go.
            Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green
            Always, and palms wave gently to and fro,
            And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen,
            To ease my heart of its impassioned woe.

            Bare hands to touch, the sparrow’s cheep
            To heed, and watch his nimble flight
            Above the short brown grass asleep.
            Love glorious in his friendly might,
            Music that every heart could bless,
            And thoughts of life serene, divine,
            Beyond my power to express,
            Crowd round this lifted heart of mine!
            But oh! to leave this paradise
            For the city’s dirty basement room,
            Where, beauty hidden from the eyes,
            A table, bed, bureau and broom
            In corner set, two crippled chairs
            All covered up with dust and grim
            With hideousness and scars of years,
            And gaslight burning weird and dim,
            Will welcome me    .  .  .    And yet, and yet
            This very wind, the winter birds,
            The glory of the soft sunset,
            Come there to me in words.

            And we will seek the quiet hill
            Where towers the cotton tree,
            And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
            And works the droning bee.
            And we will build a cottage there
            Beside an open glade,
            With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,
            And ferns that never fade.

            Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.

        <collex:text>The vivid grass with visible delight
            Springing triumphant from the pregnant earth,
            The butterflies, and sparrows in brief flight
            Chirping and dancing for the season’s birth,
            The dandelions and rare daffodils
            That touch the deep-stirred heart with hands of gold,
            The thrushes sending forth their joyous trills,—
            Not these, not these did I at first behold!
            But seated on the benches daubed with green,
            The castaways of life, a few asleep,
            Some withered women desolate and mean,
            And over all, life’s shadows dark and deep.
            Moaning I turned away, for misery
            I have the strength to bear but not to see.

        <collex:text>Last night I heard your voice, mother,
            The words you sang to me
            When I, a little barefoot boy,
            Knelt down against your knee.
            And tears gushed from my heart, mother,
            And passed beyond its wall,
            But though the fountain reached my throat
            The drops refused to fall.
            ‘Tis ten years since you died, mother,
            Just ten dark years of pain,
            And oh, I only wish that I
            Could weep just once again.

        <collex:text>So much have I forgotten in ten years,
            So much in ten brief years! I have forgot
            What time the purple apples come to juice,
            And what month brings the shy forget-me-not.
            I have forgot the special, startling season
            Of the pimento’s flowering and fruiting;
            What time of year the ground doves brown the fields
            And fill the noonday with the curious fluting.
            I have forgotten much, but still remember
            The poinsettia’s red, blood-red in warm December.
            I still recall the honey-fever grass,
            But cannot recollect the high days when
            We rooted them out of the ping-wing path
            To stop the mad bees in the rabbit pen.
            I often try to think in what sweet month
            The languid painted ladies used to dapple
            The yellow by-road mazing from the main,
            Sweet with the golden threads of the rose-apple.
            I have forgotten—strange—but quite remember
            The poinsettia’s red, blood-red in warm December.
            What weeks, what months, what time of the mild year
            We cheated school to have our fling at tops?
            What days our wine-thrilled bodies pulsed with joy
            Feasting upon blackberries in the copse?
            Oh some I know! I have embalmed the days,
            All innocent of passion, uncorrupt,
            At noon and evening in the flame-heart’s shade.
            We were so happy, happy, I remember,
            Beneath the poinsettia’s red in warm December.

        <collex:text>I would be wandering in distant fields
            Where man, and bird, and beast, lives leisurely,
            And the old earth is kind, and ever yields
            Her goodly gifts to all her children free;
            Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding,
            And boys and girls have time and space for play
            Before they come to years of understanding –
            Somewhere I would be singing, far away.
            For life is greater than the thousand wars
            Men wage for it in their insatiate lust,
            And will remain like the eternal stars,
            When all that shines to-day is drift and dust
            But I am bound with you in your mean graves,
            O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.

        <collex:text>I hear the halting footsteps of a lass
            In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall
            Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass
            To bend and barter at desire’s call.
            Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet
            Go prowling through the night from street to street!
            Through the long night until the silver break
            Of day the little gray feet know no rest;
            Through the lone night until the last snow-flake
            Has dropped from heaven upon the earth’s white breast,
            The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet
            Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.
            Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way
            Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,
            Has pushed the timid little feet of clay,
            The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!
            Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet
            In Harlem wandering from street to street.

        <collex:text>Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
            And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;
            Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
            Blown by black players upon a picnic day.
            She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,
            The light gauze hanging loose about her form;
            To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm
            Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.
            Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls
            Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise,
            The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,
            Devoured her shape with eager, passionate gaze;
            But looking at her falsely-smiling face,
            I knew her self was not in that strange place.

            The moaning, groaning cars,
            And the old milk carts go rumbling by
            Under the same dull stars.
            Out of the tenements, cold as stone,
            Dark figures start for work;
            I watch them sadly shuffle on,
            ‘Tis dawn, dawn in New York.
            But I would be on the island of the sea,

            Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing
            Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn,
            And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,
            And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying,
            And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling
            From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea
            That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling

            There, oh there! on the island of the sea,
            There I would be at dawn.
            The tired cars go grumbling by,
            The crazy, lazy cars,
            And the same milk carts go rumbling by
            Under the dying stars.
            A lonely newsboy hurries by,
            Humming a recent ditty;
            Red streaks strike through the gray of the sky,
            The dawn comes to the city.
            But I would be on the island of the sea,

        <collex:text>O you would clothe me in silken frocks
            And house me from the cold,
            And bind with bright bands my glossy locks
            And buy me chains of gold;
            And give me meekly to do my will
            The hapless sons of men:
            But the wild goat bounding on the barren hill
            Droops in the grassy pen.

        <collex:text>Thou sweet-voiced stream that first gavest me drink,
            Watched o'er me when I floated on thy breast,
            What black-faced boy now gambols on thy brink,
            Or finds beneath thy rocks a place of rest?
            What naked lad doth linger long by thee,
            And run and tumble in the sun-scorched sand,
            Or heed the pea-dove in the wild fig tree,
            While I am roaming in an alien land?
            No wonder that my heart is happy never,
            I have been faithless to thee, Sukee River.
            When from my early wandering I returned,
            Did I not promise to remain for aye?
            Yet instantly for other regions yearned
            And wearied of thee in a single day.
            Thy murmurs sound now in my anguished ears,
            Creating in my heart a world of pain;
            I see thee wistful flowing down the years
            And though I pine, afar I must remain:
            No wonder that my feet are faltering ever,
            I have been faithless to thee, Sukee River.
            Though other boys may frolic by thy side,
            I know their merry moods thou dost not heed
            When I, O mother of my soul and bride,
            Lie on strange breasts and on strange kisses feed.
            Sometimes, kind fate permitting me, I dream
            I am floating on thy bosom of deep blue,
            A child again, beloved, unchanging stream;
            But soon I wake to find it all untrue:
            I vowed that never, never would we sever,
            But I've been faithless to thee, Sukee River.

            And Earth’s bowels quake with terror; strange
            and terrible storms break,
            Lightning-torches flame the heavens, kindling
            souls of me, thereunder:
            Africa! Long ages sleeping, O my motherland,

            dawn that is breaking,

            Oh the night is sweet for sleeping, but the shining
            day’s for working;
            Sons of the seductive night, for your children’s
            children’s sake,
            From the deep primeval forests where the crouching
            leopard’s lurking
            Lift your heavy-lidded eyes, Ethiopia! Awake!
            In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new
            dawn that is breaking,
            And its golden glory fills the western skies.

            INTRODUCTION (Alice Dunbar-Nelson) 
            VOLUMES might be written about the manner of presenting the selections in this little volume. Oratorical rules and elocutionary efforts have been written about time out of mind, and it is fairly safe to say that none of them ever made a really good speaker. The one safe guide is one's feelings. Be sure that the selection has become a part of your inner feeling, and the expression, gestures, proper inflections, will come naturally. Stilted gestures, learned by rote, fail to impress an audience, as inflections and modulations learned by rule are mechanical and unpleasant to the hearers.
            Before you begin to learn anything to recite, first read it over and find out if it fires you with enthusiasm. If it does, make it a part of yourself, put yourself in the place of the speaker whose words you are memorizing, get on, fire with the thought, the sentiment, the emotion—then throw yourself into it in your endeavor to make others feel as you feel, see as you see, understand what you understand. Lose yourself, free yourself from physical consciousness, forget that those in front of you are a part of an audience, think of them as some persons whom you must make understand what is thrilling you—and you will be a great speaker.

        <collex:text>Foreword
            What the children read the fathers will believe. What the fathers believe will constitute the ideals of the race. Therefore nothing is more important to the development of any people than the content of those printed pages on which they form their youthful minds. Bishop Spaulding said, "The voices that spoke to me in my boyhood are now speaking through me to the world." Let those voices speak of self-reliance, noble striving, and ambition for high achievement, and the quality of the adult life will generally be of the same character. Let those voices suggest low self-esteem or mediocre life aims, and the later manhood will be correspondingly low in thought, feeling, and conduct.
            So well known is the operation of this principle that the vast machinery of our system of education in America has always revolved about its reading courses. But these reading courses have been almost necessarily one-sided and undemocratic. Devised and executed exclusively by experts of the white race, they have naturally reflected only the ideals of that race. They have set before America and the world only those traditions of heroism, self-sacrifice, delicacy of feeling, high thinking, and noble endeavor which have been exemplified in representative white men and women. The result naturally is a universal and solidified conviction in the minds of all American youth that the progress of the world—industrial, political, intellectual and social—has been exclusively the white man's achievement. Nothing could have been a more reasonable conclusion for the long generations which have been nourished on Livy, Plutarch, Green, Grote, Mommsen, Parkman, Bancroft or Fisk. These have been the historians of the white world just as Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton and Lowell have been its poets, and Thackeray, Eliot, Dickens and Hawthorne its romancers. The massive influence of these great spokesmen has all been on the side of the amazing mind power and outward competency of their exalted race, and their estimation of the white man's superiority has been universally received by public opinion. In vain may you search their pages—those pages upon which all our reading has been founded—for anything other than a patronizing view of that vast, brooding world of colored folk—yellow, black and brown—which comprises by far the largest portion of the human family.
            The results of this one-sided reading have long been very clear to see, and they have been very mischievous. The two most important results alone need mention here. The first is a feeling of contempt, tempered with pity, on the part of the white man 
            everywhere for his colored brother. The second is a disastrous, unconscious acceptance on the part of large masses of the colored races themselves of the estimation placed upon them by their white neighbors. These two conditions in turn have bred those misunderstandings between race groups and those misinterpretations of one race by another that lie at the base of all our horrifying modern war. Exactly as Germans have looked with contempt upon Frenchmen or Englishmen, so the whole white world has viewed the darker races. These darker people have consequently been at a tremendous disadvantage in having little or no recognized literature for the expression of their highest ideals and aspirations, and no channels through which their recognized spokesmen might make known to the world the inner heart of the race. Colored boys and girls have not been reading about heroic black warriors and statesmen, martyrs or saints, though the progress of the world has depended largely upon these. They have not seen often enough even the poor reproductions of world famous works of art wrought by bronze or ebony hands. They do not ponder enough the pages of the black man's romance written by the black novelist. They have not stored their minds with the poetry that has sung its way out of the black man's sorrow and travail and made a place for itself among the lasting monuments of the world's music. And not knowing how much they have to be proud of,  how much to live for, strive for, and die for, colored people in enormous masses plod on wearily in the path of life discouraged and half efficient. Twelve millions of American Negroes in particular are, to use Mary White Ovington's expression, "half men," because they do not know even so much of the nobility and grandeur of the black man's finer traditions as Doctor DuBois has set forth in his stimulating little book "The Negro."
            Surely the highest interests of American democracy and the needs of the war-torn world dictate now that nothing be left undone to awaken to new life, and to call to a high plane of self-reliance and activity, so potent a portion of our population. The great conceptions of liberty, inter-racial and international justice, and of universal democracy are in the air. Now that the insane waste and frightful misery of war are done, the colored races everywhere must be given a just and untrammeled opportunity to contribute all they can to the reconstruction of a new, more liberal and democratic social order.
            It is against this background of the world need that Mrs. Alice Dunbar-Nelson's book is seen to have peculiar significance to the colored race in America. Hers is the first attempt I have known of directly on the part of any Negro to frame a speaker composed entirely of literature produced by black men and women, and about black men and women, and embodying the finest spiritual ideals of the Negro 
            race. The selections that make up this volume will reveal to the colored youth of the land the mind and heart quality of their own representative men and women. The result ought to be a great increase among them of self-reliance and race pride, a wider spread impulse to noble striving and the placing of a very much higher estimation upon the potential abilities of dark complexioned people everywhere. Above all things, it Aught to mean a better understanding between the races in these States because of the truth which this little volume seeks to prove—that the white man has no fine quality, either of heart or mind, which is not shared by his black brother.

        <collex:text>THE SPARROW'S FALL
            Too frail to soar, a feeble thing,
            It fell to earth with fluttering wing;
            But God, who watches over all,
            Beheld that little sparrow's fall.
            'Twas not a bird with plumage gay,
            Filling the air with its morning lay;
            'Twas not an eagle bold and strong,
            Borne on the tempest's wing along:
            Only a brown and weesome thing,
            With drooping head and listless wing;
            It could not drift beyond His sight
            Who marshals the splendid stars of night
            Its dying chirp fell on His ears,
            Who tunes the music of the spheres,
            Who hears the hungry lion's call,
            And spreads a table for us all.
            Its mission of song at last is done,
            No more will it greet the rising sun;
            That tiny bird has found a rest
            More calm than its mother's downy breast
            O restless heart, learn thou to trust
            In God, so tender, strong and just;
            In whose love and mercy everywhere
            His humblest children have a share.
            If in love He numbers ev'ry hair,
            Whether the strands be dark or fair,
            Shall we not learn to calmly rest,
            Like children, on our Father's breast?
            —FRANCES E. W. HARPER.

        <collex:text>A JUNE SONG
            WE would sing a song to the fair young June,
            To the rare and radiant June,
            The lovely, laughing, fragrant June
            How shall her praise be sung or said?
            Her cheek has caught the roses' hue,
            Her eye the heavens' serenest blue.
            And the gold of sunset crowns her head,
            And her smile—ah! there's never a sweeter, I ween,
            Than the smile of this fair young summer queen.
            What life, what hope, her coming brings!
            What joy anew in the sad heart springs
            As her robe of beauty o'er all she flings!
            Old earth grows young in her presence sweet,
            And thrills at the touch of her gentle feet,
            As the flowers spring forth her face to greet.
            Hark! how the birds are singing her praise,
            In their gladdest, sweetest, roundelays!
            The trees on the hillside have caught the glow,
            And the heaven smiles down on the earth below,
            And our radiant June,
            Our lovely, joyous June,
            Our summer queen,
            Smiles, too, as she stands
            With folded hands,
            And brow serene.
            How shall we crown her bright young head?
            Crown it with roses, rare and red;
            Crown it with roses, creamy white,
            As the lotus bloom that sweetens the night.
            Crown it with roses as pink as shell
            In which the voices of ocean dwell.
            And a fairer queen
            Shall ne'er be seen
            Than our lovely, laughing June.
            We have crowned her now, but she will not stay,
            The vision of beauty will steal away
            And fade, as faded the fair young May.
            Ah, loveliest maiden, linger a while!
            Pour into our hearts the warmth of thy smile,
            The gloom of the winter will come too soon.
            Stay with us, gladden us, beautiful June!
            Thou glidest away from our eager clasp.
            They will hold thee fast; and the days to be
            Will be brighter and sweeter for thoughts of thee.
            Our song shall not be a song of farewell,
            As with words of love the chorus we swell.
            In praise of the fair young June,
            Of the rare and radiant June,
            The lovely, laughing, fragrant June.

        <collex:text>WHEN DEY 'LISTED COLORED SOLDIERS
            DEY was talkin' in de cabin, dey was talkin' in de hall,
            But I listened kind o' keerless, not a-t'inkin' 'bout it all,
            An' on Sunday, too, I noticed, dey was whisperin' mighty much,
            Stan'in' all erroun' de roadside, w'en dey let us out o' chu'ch.
            But I didn't t'ink erbout it, 'twell de middle of de week,
            An' my 'Lias come to see me, an' somehow he couldn' speak,
            Den I seed all in a minute whut he'd come to see me fu',
            Dey had 'listed colored soldiers, an' my 'Lias gwine to wah.
            Oh, I hugged him an' I kissed him, an' I baiged him not to go,
            But he tol' me dat his conscience it was callin' to him so,
            An' he couldn't baih to lingah w'en he had a chanst to fight,
            Fu' de freedom dey had gin him, an' de glory of de right.
            So he kissed me, an' he lef' me, w'en I'd p'omised to be true,
            An' dey put a knapsack on him, an' a coat all colo'ed blue,
            So I gin him Pap's ol' Bible f'om de bottom of de draw—
            W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
            But I t'ought of all de weary miles dat he would have to tramp,
            An' I couldn' be contented w'en dey tuk him to de camp.
            W'y my hea't nigh broke wid grievin' 'twell I seed him on de street,
            Den I felt lak I could go an' th'ow my body at his feet.
            Fu' his buttons was a shinin' an' his face was shinin' too,
            An' he looked so strong an' mighty in his coat of sojer blue,
            Dat I hollahed, "Step up, manny!" do' my tho'at was so' an' raw,
            W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
            Ol' mis' cried w'en Mastah lef' heh, young Miss mou'ned her brothah Ned,
            An' I didn't know dey feelin's is de ve'y wo'ds dey said
            W'en I tol' 'em I was so'y. Dey had done gin up dey all;
            But dey only seemed mo' proudah dat dey men had hyeahed de call.
            Bofe my mastahs went in gray suits, but I loved de Yankee blue,
            But I t'ought dat I could sorrer fu' de losin' of 'em too;
            But I couldn' fu' I didn' know de half of whut I saw,
            Twell dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
            Mastah Jack come home all sickly; he was broke fu' life, dey said,
            An' dey lef' my po' young mastah some'r's on de road- side-dead.
            W'en de women cried an' mou'ned 'em, I could feel it thoo an' thoo,
            Fu' I had a loved one fightin' in de way o' dangah, too.
            Den dey tol' me dey had laid him some'r's way down souf to res',
            Wid de flag dat he had fit fu' shinin' daih acrost his breast.
            Well, I cried, but den, I reckon, dat's whut God had called him fu',
            W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.

        <collex:text>O BROTHERS mine, take care! Take care!    
            The great white witch rides out to-night.    
            Trust not your prowess nor your strength,    
            Your only safety lies in flight;    
            For in her glance there is a snare,            
            And in her smile there is a blight.    
            
            The great white witch you have not seen?    
            Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,    
            Like nursery children you have looked    
            For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;            
            But no, not so; the witch appears    
            In all the glowing charms of youth.    
            
            Her lips are like carnations, red,    
            Her face like new-born lilies, fair,    
            Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,            
            She moves with subtle grace and air,    
            And all about her head there floats    
            The golden glory of her hair.    
            
            But though she always thus appears    
            In form of youth and mood of mirth,            
            Unnumbered centuries are hers,    
            The infant planets saw her birth;    
            The child of throbbing Life is she,    
            Twin sister to the greedy earth.    
            
            And back behind those smiling lips,            
            And down within those laughing eyes,    
            And underneath the soft caress    
            Of hand and voice and purring sighs,    
            The shadow of the panther lurks,    
            The spirit of the vampire lies.            
            
            For I have seen the great white witch,    
            And she has led me to her lair,    
            And I have kissed her red, red lips    
            And cruel face so white and fair;    
            Around me she has twined her arms,            
            And bound me with her yellow hair.    
            
            I felt those red lips burn and sear    
            My body like a living coal;    
            Obeyed the power of those eyes    
            As the needle trembles to the pole;            
            And did not care although I felt    
            The strength go ebbing from my soul.    
            
            Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,    
            And heard your laughter loud and gay,    
            And in your voices she has caught            
            The echo of a far-off day,    
            When man was closer to the earth;    
            And she has marked you for her prey.    
            
            She feels the old Antaean strength    
            In you, the great dynamic beat            
            Of primal passions, and she sees    
            In you the last besieged retreat    
            Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,    
            Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.    
            
            O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!            
            The great white witch rides out to-night.    
            O, younger brothers mine, beware!    
            Look not upon her beauty bright;    
            For in her glance there is a snare,    
            And in her smile there is a blight.

        <collex:text>O WHITE little lights at Carney's Point,
            You shine so clear o'er the Delaware;
            When the moon rides high in the silver sky,
            Then you gleam, white gems on the Delaware.
            Diamond circlet on a full white throat,
            You laugh your rays on a questing boat;
            Is it peace you dream in your flashing gleam,
            O'er the quiet flow of the Delaware?
            And the lights grew dim at the water's brim,
            For the smoke of the mills shredded slow between;
            And the smoke was red, as is new bloodshed,
            And the lights went lurid 'neath the livid screen.
            O red little lights at Carney's Point,
            You glower so grim o'er the Delaware;
            When the moon hides low sombrous clouds below,
            Then you glow like coals o'er the Delaware.
            Blood red rubies on a throat of fire,
            You flash through the dusk of a funeral pyre;
            Are there hearth fires red whom you fear and dread
            O'er the turgid flow of the Delaware?
            And the lights gleamed gold o'er the river cold,
            For the murk of the furnace shed a copper veil;
            And the veil was grim at the great cloud's brim,
            And the lights went molten, now hot, now pale.
            O gold little lights at Carney's Point,
            You gleam so proud o'er the Delaware;
            When the moon grows wan in the castering dawn,
            Then you sparkle gold points o'er the Delaware.
            Aureate filagree on a Croesus' brow,
            You hasten the dawn on a gray ship's prow.
            Light you streams of gold in the grim ship's hold
            O'er the sullen flow of the Delaware?
            And the lights went gray in the ash of day,
            For a quiet Aurora brought a halcyon balm;
            And the sun laughed high in the infinite sky,
            And the lights were forgot in the sweet, sane calm.

            As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of your sky?
            Or shall I, with love prophetic, bid you dauntlessly arise.
            Spurn the handicap that clogs you, taking what the world denies,
            Bid you storm the sullen fortress wrought by prejudice and wrong
            With a faith that shall not falter, in your heart and on your tongue!

        <collex:text>IN FLANDERS FIELDS
            AN ECHO
            IN Flanders fields the poppies blow
            Between the crosses, row on row
            That mark the graves where black men lie;
            Their souls, long wafted to the sky,
            Look down upon the earth below.
            E'en while we mourn their loss, we see
            Their brothers hanged upon a tree
            By whom they saved. Their pain fraught cry
            Mounts up to those who stand on high,
            And watch the scarlet flowered sea
            In Flanders fields.
            In Flanders fields they shall not sleep!
            No! For their murdered kin they keep
            A vigil through the day and night,
            'Til God Himself shall snatch from sight
            Such scenes as make our heroes weep
            In Flanders fields.

        <collex:text>I SIT AND SEW
            I SIT and sew—a useless task it seems,
            My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams
            The panoply of war, the martial tread of men,
            Grim faced, stern eyed, gazing beyond the ken
            Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,
            Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath—
            But—I must sit and sew.
            I sit and sew—my heart aches with desire—
            That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire
            On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things
            Once men. My soul in pity flings
            Appealing cries, yearning only to go
            There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe—
            But—I must sit and sew
            The little useless seam, the idle patch;
            Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,
            When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,
            Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?
            You need me, Christ. It is no roseate dream
            That beckons me—this pretty futile seam
            It stifles me—God, must I sit and sew?

            'Mid noon-tide and moon-tide whatever my themes,

            The pipings of skylarks and trills of the wren

            Thy laughter rings out in the vine scented glade,
            As I drink to thy health, Ethiopian maid.
            When sun of the tropics turns westward and dies,
            The magic still lingers in light of thine eyes;
            I mingle my goblet with oil of the palm,
            Where spices hang over and summer smiles warm,
            And there, 'mid the magic of forest and shade,
            I drink thy sweet health, Ethiopian maid.

            The bare-fanged wolves of hunger in the moil

            The hope of hungry thousands, in whose breast
            Dwells fear that you should fail. God placed no dart
            Of war within your hands, but pow'r to start
            Tears, praise, love, joy, enwoven in a crest
            To crown you glorious, brave ones of the soil.

        <collex:text>NAT TURNER
            HE stood erect, a man as proud
            As ever to a tyrant bowed
            Unwilling head or bent a knee,
            And longed while bending to be free:
            And o'er his ebon features came—
            A shadow 'twas of manly shame
            Aye, shame that he should wear a chain
            And feel his manhood withered with pain,
            Doomed to a life of plodding toil,
            Shamefully rooted to the soil!
            He stood erect; his eyes flashed fire;
            His robust form convulsed with ire;
            "I will be free! I will be free!
            Or, fighting, die a man!" cried he.
            Virginia's hills were lit at night
            The slave had risen in his might;
            And far and near Nat's wail went forth,
            To South and East, and West and North,
            And strong men trembled in their power,
            And weak men felt 'twas now their hour.
            "I will be free! I will be free!
            Or, fighting, die a man !" cried he,
            The tyrant's arm was all too strong,
            Had swayed dominion all too long;
            And so the hero met his end,
            As all who fail as Freedom's friend.
            The blow he struck shook Slavery's throne:
            His cause was just, e'en skeptics own;
            And round his lowly grave soon swarmed
            Freedom's brave hosts for Freedom's armed.
            That host was swollen by Nat's kin
            To fight for Freedom, Freedom win,
            Upon the soil that spurned his cry:
            "I will be free, or I will die !"
            Let tyrants quake, e'en in their power,
            For sure will come the awful hour
            When they must give an answer, why
            Heroes in chains should basely die,
            Instead of rushing to the field
            And courting battle ere they yield?
            -T. THOMAS FORTUNE.

Turner was a religious enthusiast and was regarded as a prophet among his people. His "Insurrection" produced wide-spread apprehension among the slaveholders of the South, which was not dissipated wholly for many years after.)

INTRODUCTION 
      It has been the great desire of my heart to scatter sunshine and contribute something 
to the world. 
      Mine has not been a life of ease and pleasure, but toil and service. 
      I have given several years of service in the class room as a teacher and several years as Grand Most Ancient Matron of Heroines of Jericho, traveling and working among my people. 
      Hence it has been mine to observe much. 
      Therefore I am sending this little book out into the world. 
      I can not tell into whose hands this book may fall, but it is my sincere hope that every one who reads it will find something interesting and inspiring. 
                                                                        C. L. M. F. 
THIS BOOK IS LOVINGLY DEDICATED TO MY MOTHER 
POETIC PEARLS 
TO MY MOTHER 
Mother, the queenliest woman on earth, 
Mother, the woman who gave me birth, 
Mother, you made of me all that I am, 
You fashioned my life by your own plan. 
I notice, dear mother, your hair turning gray, 
But your voice is the same as it was yesterday; 
Your eyes are as kind and your smiles are as sweet 
As they were when I knelt years ago at your feet. 
When storms rage around me and troubles roll high, 
As of old, to your sheltering arms I fly; 
You give me advice that I can't get from another, 
Except Jesus, who is there on earth like a mother? 
IT'S HARD TO KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN 
The storm may rage, the wind may blow 
      And beat him to the ground, 
But one of the hardest things on earth to do 
      Is to keep a good man down. 
He may be white, he may be black, 
      He may be red or brown; 
He'll dodge your blow and grow and go, 
      Because you can't keep a good man down. 
Sometimes he can hardly lift his head, 
      Oppression is his crown, 
But when his heart is right God gives him light, 
      And the world can't keep him down. 
Friends may prove false, enemies succeed 
      In building a mighty mound 
Of treachery and slander, 
      But none of these can hold a good man down. 
This is a truth that friend and foe 
      Alike have sought and found, 
Regardless of what comes or go, 
      You can't keep a good man down. 
AFTER THE HONEYMOON 
Said Johnnie Jenkins to his wife: 
      Good Evening, is it late? 
You know it is, she hotly cried, 
      Why now, it's half-past eight. 
Says he, I am awful hungry, Jane, 
      Make haste and fix my supper; 
"Your supper?  Why there's none to fix, 
      Nothing here but bread and butter." 
But where's those groceries, Jane, says he, 
      I bought the other day? 
"Pshaw! You talk like a crazy man, 
      Can fifty cents worth last always?" 
I don't like this way you are acting, Jane, 
      You are entirely too extravagant, 
As late as 'tis, now I must go 
      And hunt a restaurant. 
I am not used to cheap living, John, 
      At home we had a-plenty, 
You know that I had all heart could wish 
      Till I was more than twenty. 
He scratched his head and gave a sigh, 
      While at her he madly stared, 
You waste my labor as if though 
      I was a millionaire. 
Remember I am a poor man's son, 
      What I get comes from my muscle, 
And if things here don't make a change 
      By Jove, you'll have to hustle. 
I thought that when I married you 
      'Twould better my condition, 
But fifty cents a wek is worse 
      Than a preacher on a mission. 
So I can leave you and this hut 
      And go back to my mother; 
Says he: Well, here's your railroad fare, 
      For I am tired of so much bother. 
WHY SLIGHT THE WORKING GIRL? 
I wish some one would tell me 
      Why the working girl is slighted? 
She may be as good as Virgin Mary, 
      But to grand affairs she's not invited. 
She works for an honest living, 
      She appears both clean and neat, 
But when the (so-called) best men meet her 
      They snub her on the street. 
They'll see her coming up the street, 
      They'll stare her in the face, 
Perhaps they'll speak, 
      But to lift their hats they consider it a disgrace. 
Every girl hasn't had the same chance, 
      Some come from humble homes, 
But they are just as pure and womanly 
      As queens upon their thrones. 
Does it make her any smaller 
      Because she must work  and  face the world ? 
If her character is good, don't slight her 
      Because she's a working girl. 
Ofttimes she is a jewel, 
      Sometimes a valued pearl, 
Just give her a chance to prove it, 
      And don't slight her, because she is a working girl. 
THE BULL FROG'S SONG 
On a stormy September morning, 
      When first I heard the song, 
It echoed through the village streets, 
      As if from a mighty throng. 
I caught it from the stable yard, 
      It sounded through my room, 
I hastened up, threw on my gown, 
      As if wrapped in a magic swoon. 
A big frog seemed to sing the bass, 
      Another sang the tenor, 
While dozens rang the alto's part, 
      Hundreds led the soprano. 
I stood there like some one amazed, 
      Till my brain began to tire, 
From listening to this wonderous song. 
      Sung by the woodland choir. 
(This poem was written when the writer was 14 years of age.) 
THE MEANEST MAN ON EARTH 
You may talk about highwaymen 
     And of men of lowly birth, 
But the man who robs a woman 
     Is the meanest man on earth. 
He may steal gold and silver, 
     He may steal jewels rare, 
He may steal crowns and kingdoms, 
     But nothing can compare 
To a man who robs a woman 
     Of all that she holds dear. 
She might be maid or matron, 
     She might be young or old, 
She might be as poor as Lazarus, 
     Or she might have tons of gold, 
She might be of the royalty, 
     Or she might be of humble birth, 
But the man who steals her honor 
     Is the meanest man on earth. 
There is a man who looks for goodness, 
     And then casts it to the wind, 
There is a man who smiles like an angel 
     And his heart is as black as sin, 
He seeks and finds the best home, 
     Where all is joy and mirth, 
He steals the sacred treasure, 
     He is the meanest man on earth. 
This mean man ought to be dealt with 
     By legal and social laws, 
He is more poisonous than the cobra, 
     Like the tiger he has claws, 
Drive him from society, 
     In jail give him a berth, 
Because the man who robs a woman 
     Is the meanest man on earth. 
CANE JUICE AND 'POSSUM 
(Dialect) 
Who is dat out dar knocking? 
     Why, I am fixing to go to bed, 
No, I ain't undressed, 
     But I got my close off, combing my head. 
Say you got sump'n to tell me? 
     Well' won't dat sump'n keep? 
No, I ain't so tired, 
     But I want to go to sleep. 
Didn't quite understan' you, 
     You got cane juice and 'possum, too? 
Whar is you gwine, Sammy? 
     You know I was teasin' to see what you would do. 
You quit cuttin' up out dar, Sam, 
     And come on in dis house; 
You is jest a great big ole sweet baby 
     Out dar trying to pout. 
My, whar did you git dis 'possum? 
     He's jest as fat as butter, 
And dis good old cold sweet cane juice, 
     Right fresh from de gutter? 
Sam, I always did like you, 
     'Cause I knowed dat you liked me, 
And you've proved your love for me tonight 
     By climbin' dat simmon tree. 
And fetchin' me dis 'possum 
     Over here in all dis cole, 
You bet your Jife I'll be your wife, 
     'Cause you is worth your weight in gole. 
LAMENTATIONS OF A DECEIVED WOMAN 
You have robbed me of virtue, 
     You've robbed me of fame, 
You have stolen my innocence 
     And put me to shame; 
Your smiles and your lies 
     Just took hold of my heart 
And forced me from honor 
     And goodness to part. 
Oh, why did I meet you? 
     Oh, why was I born? 
Why didn't I die 
     On that bright July morn? 
When you swore your protection 
     And promised your love, 
I believed you as true 
     As an angel above. 
You plead with your lips, 
     Then you plead with your eyes, 
On your knees you beseeched me 
     In a lover's pure guise; 
With your arms you embraced meta 
     You held me so tight, 
Til I forgot all the world 
     In that moment of delight. 
I loved you, but now I hate you, 
     Look there at my child; 
You deny it your name 
     And the thought drives me wild; 
I am forsakened by friends, 
     I have been driven from home, 
With my child I am an outcast, 
     In this cold world alone. 
O, God, you forgive. 
     Please help me to forgive 
This man who has robbed me 
     Of all that life gives, 
Of beauty and honor. 
     Of joy and of mirth, 
And has made me the most 
     Miserable woman on earth. 
TRIBUTE TO THE BUSINESS MEN OF JACKSONVILLE 
If you ever visit Florida, 
     Pray don't miss Jacksonville; 
It is the place of all places, 
     Where the Negro has climbed the hill.
There is a bunch of business men there 
     Who really make things hum, 
A. L. Lewis., J. H. Blodgett, 
     And Charles H. Anderson. 
W. J. Geter, B. C. Vanderhorst, 
     And W. W. Parker, too, 
Joe James and son and J. S. McLane, 
     And Belton on Florida Avenue. 
There's Abbott with his book store, 
     Walker with his business college, 
Don't forget the People's Drug Store, 
     And Pratt filed with embalming knowledge. 
They have some business women, too, 
     Mrs. Madison Williams on the hill, 
On Broad street Mrs. Kirkpatrick, 
     Mrs. Sumpter and Mrs. McGill.
 
Then come to the professions, 
     Such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, 
They have them by the dozens, 
     And scores of excellent preachers. 
THE NEGRO HAS PLAYED HIS PART 
When the days were cold and dreary, 
       And America's future was looking dark, 
Her black son marched forth with his gun, 
       And boldly played his part. 
He crossed the mighty ocean, 
       He feared neither gas nor poisoned dart, 
He wrote his name on the scroll of fame, 
       And like other men played his part. 
In every war that this country's been 
       Blood dripped from the Negro's loyal heart. 
At Bunker Hill, Ocean Pond, San Juan and Carrizal 
       He certainly played his part. 
Not only is he a fighter, 
       He has a place in poetry, music and art, 
Dunbar, Johnson and Tanner have proven 
       That the Negro has played his part. 
Then he yearned for education 
       Of hand and head and heart, 
Mary Bethune and Booker Washington tell us 
       That in literature he plays his part. 
Today finds him progressive, 
       No more content with that ox cart, 
He motors his ear to his store or hazk 
       And in commerce plays his part. 
America, dear America, 
       Mother of all Americans thou art, 
You need not grieve, your black boy won't leave, 
       He's going to stay and continue to do his part. 
SONG DEDICATED TO THE HEROINES OF JERICHO 
(Tune: America) 
Heroines strong are we, 
Sisters of Masons free, 
     Men of God's love; 
Fighting for truth and right, 
Walking in love's clear light, 
Trusting for strength and might, 
     Our God above. 
Being true, we can not fall, 
He will uphold us all 
     With his strong arm; 
Then let us march and pray, 
Walk with Him day by day, 
He'll safely lead the way, 
     Keep us from harm. 
Heroines strong and bold, 
Like heroines of old, 
     Rahab and Ruth, 
We are a valiant band 
Marching to glory land 
Led by the guiding hand 
     Of Christ the truth. 
EASTER BELLS 
Hark! What sound is this I hear? 
     Such music it foretells, 
The sound is soft, but sweet and clear, 
     It must be Easter bells. 
They ring and tell of Christ the Lord, 
     Who conquered death and hell, 
Then rose up to his blest above, 
     Wonderful Easter bells. 
Sweet bells, your music fills my soul 
     And wraps me in a spell, 
Your wondrous peals like ocean's roll, 
     Oh! magical Easter bells. 
Ring on, sweet bells, 
     Ring loud and clear, 
Help men to understand 
     That Jesus Christ our Saviour dear 
Broke death's cold iron band. 
Tell them "He rose just as He said," 
     Spread it o'er vale and dell, 
The joyful tidings onward spread, 
     Ye heaven sent Easter bells. 
Let every heart rejoice today, 
     And crush in sin's hard shell, 
And raise to heaven a joyous lay, 
     As do these chiming Easter bells. 
Ring on, sweet bells, ring more and more 
     And hold me in your spell, 
Until I reach that shining shore 
     Where rings everlasting Easter bells. 
A JEWEL PURE AND BRIGHT 
Live so that the world will need you, 
     Daily tread the path of light, 
Keep a bag of sunshine with you, 
     Be a jewel pure and bright. 
Sow your seeds of sunshine hourly, 
     They'll lodge in the proper spot; 
And while thus you plant your sunshine 
     You make easier some one's lot. 
If a man, don't be a makeshift, 
     Be a man, stand in the light, 
Do the things that conscience tells you, 
     Show the world that you can do right. 
Never shirk or jump from duty, 
     Walk right in and bear your part, 
Help a brother lift his burden, 
     And ofttimes you heal a bleeding heart. 
If a woman, be a woman, 
     Walk the path of truth and right, 
Crown your life with priceless virtue, 
     And be a jewel pure and bright. 
Don't stop to look for temptations, 
     They'll be thick on every hand ; 
Watch your step and press on forward, 
     For truth and goodness take a stand. 
And while thus you stand on duty, 
     Watch the faces in the line; 
When you see a sister faltering, 
     Catch her, clasp her hand in thine. 
Always keep your bag of sunshine, 
     Sow the seeds both day and night, 
And you'll help to make the world 
     A garden of jewels pure and bright. 
SAVE YOUR PENNIES 
Listen, boys, I want to tell you, 
     While to you I have the chance to speak, 
While you are in the bloom of childhood, 
     While the rose blooms in your cheek, 
Be not idle, be not wasteful, 
     But be diligent instead, 
Save your pennies, they'll make dollars, 
     Listen, boys, to, what I've said. 
Thrift and energy linked with labor 
     Are sure to bring a just reward, 
Round by round "you mount a ladder,” 
     Step by step you cross a road, 
Then let sun rise find you stirring, 
     Let morning breezes fan your head, 
And save your pennies, they'll make dollars, 
     Hear me, for that's what I said. 
If you stand alone, stand in your manhood, 
     Stand for justice and for right, 
Goodness clads a man with honor, 
     Money clothes a man with might; 
Then if you see a brother sinking, 
     Save him, help him lift his head, 
Show that you've a heart within you, 
     Filled with love, that's what I said. 
SATURDAY NIGHT 
(Dialect) 
I jes can't stan' it no longer, 
     I want to ask is you losin' yo' mine? 
Does you t'ink dat I is crazy? 
     Or does you t'ink dat I is bline? 
I kin count money jest as good as you kin, 
     You only gim me eight dollars, 
And try to make me b'l'eve it's ten.
Whut you done wid dem other two dollars, man? 
     You can't fool me, I done heerd 'bout your plan, 
You git it or I'll disgrace you sho, 
     And you won't set on dat deacon's bench no mo. 
You loss it? You nedn't start dat bluff, 
I done heerd dat ole song long enough, 
Every Saddy night you comes up short 
Wid a blame long face and a game o' talk.
De man didn't pay you, or he is out o' town, 
Or wor kgot scarce and dey cut wages down, 
I knows all about it, an' you know whut follers, 
So you jest better git me dem other two dollars. 
How's you gwine ter git it ? I ought to ask you, 
You knows whar it is, an' I does, too, 
But if dat money dont' come in sight, 
Man, you won't sleep, in dis house tonight. 
Whut you say? Now you know I ain't skeered o 'you, 
If I wuz I'd be dead, and buried ,too, 
But dey aint no use o' all dis talk, 
Git me dat money or take your clothes and walk. 
'Cause I can work for myself and chillun, too, 
To take your foolishness, I don't have it to do, 
You found it, eh? Well, I's mighty glad, 
'Cause I jest begin to feel myself gittin' mad. 
ELBOWING 
Please let me pass, I am in a hurry, 
     My gracious, such a great crowd, 
It is now half-past seven, 
     I hear the town clock striking aloud. 
Let you pass? Why, who's holding you? 
     Just elbow your way through the crowd, 
Everybody here is in a hurry, 
     And nobody murmurs aloud. 
If you stand back and wait for a clearing, 
     While everybody else elbows his way, 
You'll never get to your office, 
     You'll stand on this corner all day. 
But I don't like to jostle the ladies, 
     And I don't like to squeeze between men, 
But I must get away from this corner, 
     Hark! I hear the clock striking again. 
Everybody is in a great hurry, 
     No one notices while you stand there, 
Each one elbows his way to a clearing, 
     Each one hurries to get him a share. 
This world is a great busy thoroughfare, 
     To succeed you must elbow your way, 
If you wait for success to come to you, 
     You'll wait there and die in dismay. 
MY BROTHER'S KEEPER 
Yes, I am my brother's keeper, 
     I am to help him bear his load, 
I am to help him bridge the chasm, 
     I am to help him build his road. 
I am to cheer him when he is weary, 
     I am to help him on his way, 
I am to change his tears to gladness, 
     I am to help him turn his night to day. 
When his sky is thick and cloudy, 
     Fringed with darkness, doubt and fear, 
When the world seems black around him, 
     ‘Tis my duty to be near. 
I must lend a ray of sunshine, 
     I must give a word of cheer, 
I must make his pathway brighter, 
     I must make his sky more clear. 
HANNAH 
Say, did you ever see Hannah? 
     She is the prettiest girl in town. 
She is not white, red or yellow, 
     But she is a tantalizing brown. 
Her eyes are like a charcoal, 
     Her teeth like finest pearls, 
Her smiles are like the dew-drops, 
     Her hair, soft, lustrous curls. 
When she goes to church on Sunday 
     She's the center of attraction, 
All eyes are fixed upon her, 
     From the parson to the sexton. 
She is the leader of the choir. 
     You just ought to hear her sing, 
And I believe that you'd agree with me
     That she is an angel without wings. 
When the preacher calls for joiners, 
     Hannah stands up and sings 
"For you I am praying,” 
     Til she makes the welkin ring, 
And even the hardest sinner 
     Can not withstand that voice, 
He rushes to the mercy seat 
     And makes the church his choice. 
You ought to go to Hannah's house, 
     Everything shines like a pin, 
Front room, bed room and kitchen, 
     Alike they all are clean, 
She meets you at the front door, 
     With a smile and gentle manner; 
And it puts your heart to thumping 
     Just to get to speak to Hannah. 
IN LOVING REMEMBRANCE  OF MY FATHER, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE APRIL 15th, 1911 
Dear father, thou hast left us here, 
     In this world of sorrow, pain and crime, 
For thee w eshed the orphan's tear, 
     And God alone our wounds can bind. 
Our love for thee can never die, 
     Thy memory we will e'er adore, 
O, sainted one, watch from on high, 
     Till time shall cease and be no more. 
Watch for the five thou hast left behind, 
     ‘Til death shall bring us all to thee, 
Some day, I do not know the time, 
     We, too, must cross the mystic sea. 
Somewhere beyond "the vale of tears," 
     I do not know just where 'twill be, 
But where God lives through endless years 
     With the I'll spend eternity. 
Sleep on, 0, sainted one, sleep on. 
     We know thou art sleeping with the blest, 
For thy labors thou hast won a crown, 
     So sleep, dear father, take thy rest. 
CHRIST'S PERSON 
(Written for and accepted by the A. M. E. Church Review, October Number, 1917) 
 
     “The fairest among ten thousand altogether lovely" is perhaps the sanest description of the personality of Christ that language can express. 
     Being altogether lovely is snyonymous to being completely lovely, perfect in this, attainment without possible improvement. 
     While being superlatively fair he again transcend 3 the sphere of human conception and soars into the realms of that infinite wisdom reserved only for the Gods, for truly Christ is the Son of God. 
     Science tells us that in the attempted classification of objects or qualities the mind is incapable of comprehension unless there is a comparing object of known characteristics. 
     Since there are no other beings save the Divine Trinity that possess such personal characteristics, all efforts of a description of Christ's personal qualities can but fail. 
     The fall of man in the Garden of Eden through disobedience necessitated the descension of Christ to earth to redeem man 
from his lost state. Preparatory to his coming men were divinely inspired to prophesy the future birth of a promised Messiah. Chief among these was Isaiah, who nine hundred years prior thereto, in an effort to set before the world a true conception of his majesty, thus proclaims: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder. His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. 
     Wonderful beyond human comprehension for the power to know Christ must come from above, for thus said Christ unto Peter when Peter declared thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. "Flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you." Counsellor, a friendly advisor, telling to us what to do, why we should and how to do his command. Even here is he wonderful, for so great and complete is his friendship that he counted his own life not dearer to him than his friends. 
     The mighty God, having power over all creation, in heaven, on earth and over hell. The everlasting Father, unlimited in time, a 
father whose duration outstrips time and eternity. Yet through his matchless love, in perfect obedience, he descnds from his great white throne and became subject to the laws of earth, even to the law of condemnation imposed upon man pursuant to his disobedience, and died the ignominous death of the cross that man might be saved. 
     The Immaculate Christ, in his sublime divinity, is without physical personality, for God is a spirit, possessing a spiritual body, complete in all that is essential in true divinity. 
     Thus may I conclude with this assertion, so pure, so perfect, so holy and divine is Christ that language is incapable of conveying to us a true picture of His personality, nor can human wisdom conceive its wondrous beauty and perfection. 
For beauty there is none like him, 
     For strength there is none so strong, 
His presence drives sin out of us, 
     And turns our grief to song. 
For love, who can with him compare 
     With the great love he has shown ? 
He laid aside his royal crown 
     And descended from his throne. 
He came to earth, He bled and died 
     On rugged Calvarys tree, 
He took the contract, paid the price 
     With His blood and made us free. 
WELCOME ADDRESS DELIVERED TO THE SEVENTH QUADRENNIAL SESSION OF WOMAN'S MITE MISSIONARY SOCIETY, OCT. 15th, 1919. 
Mistress of Ceremonies, Honored Bishop, Distinguished Visitors, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
I am delighted to have this privilege to welcome you here tonight in behalf of the North Jacksonville District. 
     We have not come to tell you of obstacles and sorrows that confront us and thereby make you sad, but we have come with hearts filled with love to bring you greetings and to tell you how welcome you are in our midst and if possible make you glad that you came to the Land of Sunshine and Roses. It is our intention, ladies and gentlemen, to see to it that while you sojourn here among us that your stay be one of pleasure. 
     It cheers the heart of a stranger to recive a cordial welcome. 
     People have been exchanging visits with each other and extending and acepting words of welcome ever since way back in the early ages of the world. 
     When Magda, the Queen of Sheba, visited Solomon, he greeted her with words of welcome, such as she had never heard before. 
     When Ruth left the land of Moab, the land of her nativity and went with her mother-in-law, Naomi, to live in Judah she was welcomed heartily by the people of Judah and doubly "welcomed by Boaz in whose field she gleaned, and who later became her husband. 
     When Esther, the Jewish maiden, who was made Queen of Persia, and who risked her life to enter uninvited the court of Ahaseurus to visit him and to plead for her people, was made to rejoice, because of the welcome accorded her by the king when he extended to her the golden scetper and bade her to make 
her wishes known and that they should be granted even unto the half of his kingdom. 
     We have no kingdom to offer or lay at your disposal, but we have many other things of which we are justly proud and in behalf of the North Jacksonville District I am happy to say to you that to all of these you are welcome. 
     We are glad to have you here to see the wonderful achievements that we have made, morally, intellectually, financially and spiritually. 
     Under the leadership of our distinguished, intelligent, dignified Christian bishop, the Right Revernd John Hurst, the general of the Eleventh Episcopal District, who has been so nobly supported by these gallant, untiring, unselfish, ever-ready presiding elders, pastors and laymen, we have brought things 
to pass and our fondest dreams have been realized, and if you doubt my statements, all that you need to do is to look about you, see this, Mt. Zion Church, see Edward Waters College, see the report for missions and other things, and you will agree with me that you are being welcomed by a great people of a great church in a great district, the greatest district in all Florida, presided over by one of the most scholarly presiding elders in the entire connection in the person of Dr. Daniel M. Baxter. 
     So, again, I want to say to you that: 
You are welcome, yes, indeed, you are, 
Welcome as the morning star 
Was to the wise men of the East 
When they sought for the Prince of Peace. 
You are as welcome as the breeze of May, 
You are as welcome as a summer day, 
You are as welcome as the birds that sing, 
You are as welcome as the flowers of spring. 
We welcome you because you are 
Moral and spiritual guiding stars, 
Lifting others as you climb, 
To heights above sin, shame and crime. 
Because you are helping to mold and make 
Better men and women for humanity's sake, 
Because like giants you've taken a stand 
To fight down wrong where'er you can. 
Because you fear neither heat nor cold, 
Because you are Christians strong and bold, 
Because you've heard the heathen's cry, 
Because you've answered, "Here am I." 
Because you know no east or west, 
Because you are striving to do your best, 
Because you are treading the path our Savior trod, 
Because we are all children of the living God. 
You are welcome to our glad sunshine, 
You are welcome to our corn and wine, 
You are welcome to our milk and honey, 
And you are welcome even to our money. 
You are welcome to our broad, clean streets, 
You are welcome to our bread and meats, 
And if cooked food fails your taste to suit, 
You are welcome to our groves of fruit. 
Oranges, mangoes, lemons, grapes and limes, 
Sugar apples, paupaus and apples called pines, 
Sea grapes, cocoanuts and bananas not a few, 
Alvacado pears, plums and guavas, too. 
To food and shelter, to carriage and car, 
To all that we have you are welcome, yes, you are, 
Now, if there is aught in my welcome left unsaid, 
Charge it not to the heart, please, but charge it to the head. 
Because if each of us had a thousand tongues 
We would gladly welcome you with every one, 
So with hearts as pure as heaven's own dewy 
In Jehovah's name we welcome you.

FOREWORD
NOTHING in the life of the nation has  seemed to me more significant than that civilization which the colored man has built up in the midst of a white society organized against it. The Negro has been driven under all the burdens of oppression, both material and spiritual, to the brink of desperation, but he has always been saved by his philosophy of life. He has advanced against all opposition by a certain elevation of his spirit. He has been made strong in tribulation. He has constrained oppression to give him wings. In such poems as "Armageddon," "The Black Man's Bit," and "Cora," I have desired to exhibit something of this indestructible spiritual quality of my race.
In the others I have wishedmerely to be brought into harmony with currents of thought and feeling common to all humanity. I trust that there may be in all at least an implied appeal to that spirit of human brotherhood by which alone the world must find the path to peace.
For permission to reprint some of these poems I am indebted to "The Crisis," "The Outlook," "The Independent," "Life," and various other publications.

The Wings of Oppression
I have a song that few will sing
In honor of all suffering,
A song to which my heart can bring
The homage of believing
A song the heavy-laden hears
Above the clamor, of his fears,
While still he walks with blinding tears,
And drains the cup of grieving.
I ask not why, I only see
How poor is all our potency,
How soon the wise, the strong, the free
Some deadly bane discloses;
While he whose bread is doubly priced,
By whom all gain is sacrificed,
Keeps near to beauty, near to Christ,
And Socrates and Moses.
The captains and the gilded kings,
With all their marshalled underlings,
Are found to be but puny things,
Impermanent and hollow;
While up through terror, blood and dearth,
Poor men accounted little worth,
Still raise the beacon lights of earth
For truth and faith to follow.
So long as life is steeped in wrong,
And nations cry: “ How long, how long!”
I look not to the wise and strong
For peace and self-possession;
But right will rise, and mercy shine,
And justice lift her conquering sign
Where lowly people starve and pine
Beneath a world oppression.
O sweet is power, dear is ease,
And beauty cannot fail to please,
But mightier far than all of these
Those chastenings of sorrow
By which alone the heart will dare
To mount beyond a world of care
On visions bright beyond compare
Of better things tomorrow.
POEMS OF MY PEOPLE
Armageddon
Written at the outbreak of the world war, just after President Wilson's appeal to the country for a "poise of undisturbed judgment,” — to express the significance to the trammeled millions of colored people the world over, and especially to the American Negro, of that spirit of the times which well nigh destroyed civilization. The poem was originally published in The Crisis under the title, “Die Zeitgeist.”
"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise: and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which arc despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence."— Paul.
"What is all this but a wild fermentation of the spirit, wherefrom, the fiercer it is, the clearer product will one day evolve itself."—Carlyle
BEFORE the whirlwind and the thunder shock,
The agony of nations, and this wild
Eruption of the passionate will of man,
These tottering bastions of mighty states,
This guillotine of culture, and this new
Unspeakable Golgotha of the Christ,
My heart declares her faith, and, undismayed,
I write her prompting—write it in that poise
Of judgment undisturbed to which our Head
Admonishes the nation.
                                But have I
A certain warrant? Does the cannon roar
Above the mangled myriads washed in blood
Upon a hundred fields embolden me
To vent the doctrine of a private heart!
Nay, ask it not, for God hath chosen still
The weak thing, and the foolish, and the base,
And that which is despised to work His will;
And humble men are chartered yet to run
Upon His errands round the groaning sphere.
Not many of the mighty shall be called,
Not many that dispute, not many wise,
That so the prophecy may be fulfilled.
Among the least of men of many strains,
Whose origin outdates the pyramids,
Uncherished of my country — though the blood
Of all my fathers ran to make her free
Known by a name that typifies the slave,
Synonymous with darkness, and by that
Set in the ranks of mortals least esteemed,
I claim no merit save the love of truth,
And care to find for her a lodging- place.
I have been bred and born beneath the stern
Duress and cold inhospitality
Of that environment which prejudice
Fills consciously with bane; and I have sought
Blessed be the God of mercy — at the shrine
Of thought inviolate the wells of peace.
There, fortified and unmolested, long
Have I in contemplation rued the plight
Of all my kind, and reverently aspired
To ponder out our mission, unconvinced
That we are born the dupes of Providence,
To be a nation's burden and her taunt,
Or Ishmaels of an unchosen land.
My quest has been to know the good of life,
And why a race should be, and what endures
Of that which man has called society,
And - last and highest aim of these pursuits
To learn what perfect service, born of throes
Dreadful but purgative, we yet might dare
To offer thee, O country of our hope.
And from these musings — thanks to Him
Whose citadels are stars, with time and space
Their pylons, but Who builds His favored home
Upon the docile trust of lowly hearts
Proceeded comfort, patience to endure,
And strength increasing of a faith sublime
Which neither infidelity in arms,
Nor all the bitter usage of the world
Can e'er avail to tarnish or impair.
For looking out upon the world I saw
No hope for future man in those who stand
Upon the heights of power, save in the tales
Transmitted of their slow decline and fall.
Because they spurn the truth of brotherhood,
And trade in life, and mock the living God
By high contempt of all His humbler sons,
The strong battalions of eternal right
And nature's law make their discomfort sure.
They prove the error of that pride of race
And nation which has been the world's despite,
And unloosed Mammon for a thousand years.
Not all their transient lordship of the earth,
Their cunning in the traffic of the world,
The condescension of their patronage,
Or thundering proclamations of their might,
Can check the springs of pity, while our prayers
Besiege the throne of mercy for their weal.
But looking in upon my stricken peers,
I saw upon their swarthy brows “the gleam;"
I saw the lineaments of hope new-born
For peoples yet to be. O scorn it not,
Ye mighty of all lands, ye that are raised
To glory on the necks of trampled men!
For now within your midst are multitudes
Puissant though despised, meek men of prayer,
Dark, shackled knights of labor, clinging still
Amidst a universal wreck of faith
To cheerfulness, and foreigners to hate.
These know ye not, these have ye not received,
But these shall speak to you Beatitudes.
Around them surge the tides of all your strife,
Above them rise the august monuments
Of all your outward splendor, but they stand
Unenvious in thought, and bide their time.
Because ye schooled them in the arts of life,
And gave to them your God, and poured your blood
Into their veins to make them what they are,
They shall not fail you in your hour of need.
They hold in them enough of you to feel
All that has made you masters in your time
The power of art and wealth, unending toil,
Proud types of beauty, an unbounded will
To triumph, wondrous science, and old law
These have they learned to value and to share.
But deeper in them still is something steeled
To hot abhorrence and unmeasured dread
Of your undaunted sins against the light
Red sins of lust, of envy and of greed,
Of guilty gain extorted from the weak,
Of brotherhood traduced and God denied.
All this have they beheld without revolt,
And borne the brunt in agonizing prayer.
For those deep strains of blood that flow from times
Older than Egypt, whence the dark man gave
The rudiments of learning to all lands,
Have been a strong constraint. And they have dreamed
Of a peculiar mission under heaven,
And felt the force of unexampled gifts
That make for them a rare inheritance
The gift of cheerful confidence in men,
The gift of calm endurance, solacing
An infinite capacity for pain,
The gift of an unfeigned humility
That blinds the eyes of strident arrogance
And bigot pride to that philosophy
And that far-glancing wisdom which it veils,
The gift of feeling for all forms of life,
Of deathless hope in trouble, and of wide
Adaptive power without a parallel
In chronicles of men, and over all,
And more than all besides, the gift of God
Expressed in rhythmic miracles of song.
O these are gifts, I said a thousand times
Richer than Ophir, stronger than the might
Of armament to conquer and to cure
Gifts destined yet to permeate the earth,
To heal it of its mighty heresies,
And all its brutal blasphemy of war.
So viewing all my brothers in distress,
Hindered and cursed and aliens, I have wept
And prayed for them in solitude apart,
That they might know themselves a chosen folk,
Unrecognized but potent, chastened still,
But chartered to be ministers of truth,
To search the depths of spirit, to go forth
To woo and win a perfect self-control,
To breed strong children exercised in prayer,
Shunning as they would death the patterns set
By those who hold the kingdoms and the sway.
So might they with the pregnant years become
New arbiters of social destiny,
New health veins in the body politic,
A high-commissioned people, mingled through
With all the bloods of man, and, counselling
Peace, and the healing grace of brotherhood,
"Have power in this dark world to lighten it,
And power in this dead world to make it live."
When through my being, like a lyre strung,
These winds of temporal occurrence sweep,
I hear a kind of music, high and low,
And ranging from the tortured earth to heaven,
Throbbing with tragic cadence to express
The passing and the coming life of man.
And though the tempests rage and earth be stirred
To her foundations, though the lucid air
Become a menace, and the beauteous world
Be bathed in fire, I am undismayed.
The cataclysmic travail prophecies
The dawn of one world-conscience for all men,
The breaking up of caste and race and creed,
The warfare of all war against itself.
And hence in my low place this living peace
That grows and deepens, while the staggered frames
Of ancient kingdoms reel beneath a weight
Of crimes so vast that genius strives in vain
To compass them in thought: for out of this,
The spirit saith, shall issue other breeds
Soul-burdened like my brothers, and like them
Despised and trammeled, but sent forth to teach
That nothing in the changing world endures
But truth and love and brotherhood and God.
My Race
MY life were lost, if I should keep
A hope-forlorn and gloomy face,
And brood upon my ills, and weep
And mourn the travail of my race.
Who are my brothers? Only those
Who wear my own complexion swart?
Ah no, but all through whom there flows
The blood-stream of a manly heart.
Wherever the light of dreams is shed,
And faith and love to toil are bound,
There will I stay to break my bread,
For there my kinsmen will be found.
Tuskegee
WHEREFORE this busy labor without
Is it an idle dream to which we cling, rest?
Here where a thousand dusky toilers sing
Unto the world their hope? "Build we our best
By hand and thought," they cry, "although unblessed."
So the great engines throb and anvils ring,
And so the thought is wedded to the thing;
But what shall be the end, and what the test!
Dear God, we dare not answer, we can see
Not many steps ahead, but this we know
If all our toilsome building is in vain,
Availing not to set our manhood free,
If envious hate roots out the seed we sow,
The South will wear eternally a stain.
Freedom
O FREEDOM, let thy perfect work be wrought.
In us, the children of a chastened race.
Long, long ago in thy benignant face
Our fathers saw “the gleam.” They meekly brought
Their shackled limbs in faith to thee, and sought
Thy heart with prayer; and thou didst rend apace
The bonds of men who leaned upon thy grace,
Their spirits with a tuneful patience fraught.
We call upon thee now no more in chains
Such as our fathers wore from these we're freed
But clanging still the fetters of the soul,
The liberation of ourselves remains:
"The gleam" we follow weakly, for we need
The Freedom of a sturdy self-control.
Jim Crow
BY what dread logic, by what grand neglect,
Wide as our nation, doth this relic last
This relic of old sterile customs past
Long since into deep shame without respect
Even I whom this contrivance fain would teach
A low submission, pray within my soul
That these my masters may not reap the dole
Of finding remedy beyond their reach.
In lofty mood I mount the reeking box,
And travel through the land. So Terence once
Moved in old Rome, so — wondrous paradox
Moved Esop in old Greece, the dwarf and dunce,
Then I reflect how their immortal wit
Makes the world laugh with mockery of it.
"So Quietly”
News item from the New York Times on the lynching of a Negro at Smithville, Ga., December 21, 1919. “The train was boarded so quietly... that members of the train crew did not know that the mob had seized the Negro until informed by the prisoner's guard after the train had left the town. coroner's inquest held immediately returned the verdict that West came to his death at the hands of unidentified men."
SO quietly they stole upon their prey
And dragged him out to death, so without flaw
Their black design, that they to whom the law
Gave him in keeping, in the broad, bright day,
Were not aware when he was snatched away;
And when the people, with a shrinking awe,
The horror of that mangled body saw,
"By unknown hands!” was all that they could say.
So, too, my country, stealeth on apace
The soul-blight of a nation. Not with drums
Or trumpet blare is that corruption sown,
But quietly — now in the open face
Of day, now in the dark — and when it comes,
Stern truth will never write, "By hands unknown."
Cora
I WOULD that you knew my Cora,
Lithe, high-minded, buoyant maid,
Her face is dusk like the twilight shade,
But her fine teeth gleam, and her eyes are bright
With a heartening mirth and a tender light.
I would that you knew my Cora.
I would you could see my Cora.
Sometimes we walk upon the street
And many a fairer lady meet:
With gay apparel and lofty air
They haven't so much as a glance to spare
For passing dusky Cora.
Then I look over at Cora.
Her step is light, her head is high,
The joy of living is in her eye,
She seems a part of all she sees—
It is one and the same if the ladies please
To look or not to Cora.
Once when I walked with Cora
We hungered in the tedious way
And turned aside for bread, but they
Who kept the place in whispers said
That dusky folk they never fed,
Folk like myself and Cora.
O I would you had then seen Cora.
The surge of pride that filled her heart
Compelled one burning tear to start,
But she brushed it by with a queenly shame,
Nor spoke one word of wrath or blame,
But went forth blithely as she came,
And I went forth with Cora.
To a Caged Canary in a Negro Restaurant
THOU little golden bird of happy song!
A cage cannot restrain the rapturous joy
Which thou dost shed abroad. Thou dost employ
Thy bondage for high uses. Grievous wrong
Is thine; yet in thy heart glows full and strong
The tropic sun, though far beyond thy flight,
And though thou flutterest there by day and night
Above the clamor of a dusky throng.
So let my will, albeit hedged about
By creed and caste, feed on the light within;
So let my song sing through the bars of doubt
With light and healing where despair has been;
So let my people bide their time and place,
A hindered but a sunny-hearted race.
Mater Dolorosa
O MOTHER, there are moments when I know
God's presence to the full. The city street
May wrap me in the tumult and the heat
Of futile striving; bitter winds may blow
With winter-wilting freeze of hail and snow,
And all my hopes lie shattered in defeat;
But in my heart the springtime blossoms sweet,
And heaven seems very near the way I go.
These moments are the angels of that prayer
Which thou has breathed for many a troubled year
With bended knee and swarthy-streaming face" 
Uphold him, Father, with a double care:
He is but mortal, yet his days must bear
The world cross, and the burden of his race.'
The Black Man's Bit
O THERE'S talk from school to pulpit, and the barber's place is rife,
And the shoe shop and the supper table hum,
With the tale of Dixie's black men who have shared the mighty strife
For that freedom of the better time to come.
Every mother's eye is brighter, every father's back is straighter,
And our girls are tripping lightly in their pride,
And by none except a Teuton, or a slacker, or a traitor, 
Will the right to their elation be denied.
They said they were too slow, too dull, too this and that to do it,
They couldn't match the method of the Hun,
And then to arm a million — why, the land would surely rue it
If a million blacks were taught to use a gun.
But right won out, and they went in at all de tractors smiling;
They learned as quick as any how to shoot,
They took the prize at loading ships, and riveting and piling,
And trained a thousand officers to boot.
And when they went 'twas with a boon no others had been bringing,
For whether with a pick or with a gun,
They lightened every labor with a wondrous sort of singing,
And turned the pall of battle into fun.
O the Frenchman was a marvel, and the Yankee was a wonder,
And the British line was like a granite wall,
But for singing as they leaped away to draw the Kaiser's thunder,
The swarthy sons of Dixie beat them all.
And now that they have helped to break the rattling Hunnish sabre,
They'll trail the Suwanee River back again
To Dixie home, and native song, and school and honest labor,
To be as men among their fellow-men.
No special thanks or praise they'll ask, no clapping on the shoulder
They did their bit, and won, and all men know it
And Dixie will be proud of them, and grown à little older,
And wiser, too, will welcome them and show it.

REJOICE, O ancient brothers of the East.
I hear your voices thrill across the seas,
And hail you, too, unto the marriage feast 
Of waking men.
Did not the Japanese
Put on the wedding garments bright and new
Though long denied by silly creeds of skin.
Rise ye, and break the “ cake of custom ” through,
And, at the New World bidding, enter in.
Faint not, O brothers, if the forward way
Must lie through fire and famine, death and blood.
There follow you the kindling sympathies
Of other trammeled millions, and some day
These shall pour forth in swarthy hordes and flood
Some worthy field, and be your staunch allies.
Matto Grosso
In the unexplored fastnesses of Brazil, known as
Matto Grosso, the great South American scientist
and statesman, Rondon, has proved the power of
unafraid democracy to elevate a backward race.
His great work has brought hope and inspiration to
millions of colored people here in the northern continent.
THY fastnesses are like the untried depths
Of the unfathomed soul of man--as dark,
As terrible, as full of healing balm,
With danger lurking where no eye can see,
Trackless and wild, yet docile to the touch
Of sympathy, and pregnant with all good.
The shadows brooding like a guilty thought
About thee bar the long-besieging sun,
And lure the mind to prophecy and fear.
Thou art a mighty mother boasting in
An inexhaustible fecundity.
What breathing, struggling, furtive, feral thing
Hast thou not brought to life! teems
Thy vastness
With such an upward urge of flaming trees,
Of vine and herb and flower and weed and shrub,
Of little swarming insect parasites,
Of fiery creatures bent upon their prey,
Of birds with all the colors God has made,
That nature could herself dream nothing more.
And thou hast bred a race of primal men
A child-like folk. They stand within the doors
Of the great mansion-house of fateful time,
Gazing within the chambers of the past
Where all their kinsmen died in tragedy,
And with a little fleeting smile of hope
As they look out upon the times to come
Surviving naked men, the challengers
Of judgment and of all democracy.
And yet thou art a virgin. Thou dost hold
Thy untouched treasures all inviolate,
Till men with wider knowledge, finer skill,
With passionate devotion, and a faith
That makes it joy to bind their lives to thee
With all their fortunes and unstinted toil,
Shall woo thy heart and win thee to themselves.
Then from thy womb shall spring another breed
Of new-world people teeming to possess
Thy future, to unlock thy nameless stores
And use the fullness of thy virile strength
To build a fair new nation of free men
In justice, mercy, brotherhood and truth.
O wild demesne, thou art a wilderness,
And yet thou art to me a promised land
More wonderful than that which Israel
Sought by the special leadership of God.
For one there is already called to be
More than thy Moses, one who holds the wand
Of modern science that shall make thy voice
Articulate, and link thy largesse up
With all its multiplying benefits,
By open pathways to the waiting world
Rondon, thy bounteous father.
Let me tell
How thy warm southern winds have wafted on
His name to stir our harsher northern clime,
How I, myself, son of a race oppressed,
Have seen afar there in thy tropic sun
His banner flying high with God's good will
Emblazoned bold upon it, and how all
My troubled brothers grasp anew at life
With firmer confidence because of him.
'Tis he, and such as he alone, whose hand
Can mend the riven fabric of the world,
Or use the fragile instruments of peace
In that dread surgery whose end shall be
To lop from off the body of mankind
The cancerous, fetid, tumor-growth of war.
Land of all marvels, I will end my song,
My prayerful song of honor unto thee,
By deep thanksgiving to thy mother soul
For pouring down from forest, hill and glade
Unnumbered multitudes of little streams
And springs that grow to rivers rushing on
To find the sea. Where is the like of these
For number or for meaning! Where is earth
So laved, so watered without ceasing, or
So nurtured into all productiveness?
For ages have those waters run their course
At length unto the ocean, blending there
With all the tides that beat upon the shores
Of every habitable land. In vain
Have they for ages gathered there to sing
That life is one, and man and God are one,
And love and truth and beauty all are one.
Self-Determination
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO
FOUR things we will not do, in spite of all
That demons plot for our decline and fall;
We bring four benedictions which the meek
Unto the proud are privileged to speak,
Four gifts by which amidst all stern-browed races
We move with kindly hearts and shining faces.
We will not hate. Law, custom, creed and caste,
All notwithstanding, here we hold us fast.
Down through the years the mighty ships of state
Have all been broken on the rocks of hate.
We will not cease to laugh and multiply
We slough off trouble, and refuse to die.
The Indian stood unyielding, stark and grim;
We saw him perish, and we learned of him
To mix a grain of philosophic mirth
With all the crass injustices of earth.
We will not use the ancient carnal tools
These never won, yet centuries of schools,
Of priests, and all the work of brush and pen
Have not availed to win the wisest men
From futile faith in battleship and shell:
We see them fall, and mark that folly well.
We will not waver in our loyalty.
No strange voice reaches us across the sea;
No crime at home shall stir us from this soil.
Ours is the guerdon, ours the blight of toil,
But raised above it by a faith sublime
We choose to suffer here and bide our time.
And if we hold to this, we dream some day
Our countrymen will follow in our way.
POEMS OF THE TIMES
A Call to Poets
RISE up from dalliance with little things,
O poets of all lands. Your golden age
Is now, and all the world your heritage.
The nations perish till ye sweep the strings
With re-creative music. He that sings
With power now to calm the peoples ' rage
Will bind the future to his tutelage,
And give the heavy-laden present wings.
Where is your lost dominion? Once ye framed
A heaven of beauty pillared firm in peace,
And ye were called the shepherds of the soul
By what default that high priesthood was shamed?
How did the magic of your music cease
To win the human heart, and keep it whole?
The world is all a wrack and battle-storm.
Stand not abashed while the red warriors break
The heart of Christ, and blundering statesmen quake
In impotence. Build in great verse that norm
By which to mold this chaos back to form.
Let not one line be lawless, lest ye make
A wider wreckage still. Now must ye wake
The lyre of peace with passion deep and warm.
Tell mortals that the tides of night and day,
The dewdrop, and the planet's mighty swing
Nay, life and death itself, must all obey
The eternal harmonies that poets sing,
And that to raise up beauty over war
Is all ye come to earth from heaven for.
The Ships
WHAT heart of man did never glow
To see the great ships come and go,
Or feel what miracles are these
Upon the highway of the seas.
Whenever I go to the harbor shore
The wonder holds me more and more
Until my spirit yearns to cry
Out to the vessels drifting by:
Bold breasters of the wind and tide,
On what far errands do you ride?
Your funnels fume and your engines strain
To speed you over the tided main,
And all the harbor is gay and bright
Where your colors fly and the waves curl white
From many a sturdy-cleaving keel,
But do you ride for woe or weal?
And when the weary course is done,
What good for human kind is won? 
And the stately vessels drifting by
Seem thus to deign a prompt reply:
We herald the fate of human souls
By a thousand ways to a thousand goals,
And set at naught wind, tide and weather
To bring the tribes of the earth together.
Whether the skies are gray or blue
We plough the mounting billows through,
Lest we should seem to give suspense
To the mighty plan of Providence.
For God has said His people all
Are one, and they shall hear the call
Each of the other, and each shall speed
In His good time to the other's need.
And they shall come from northern snows,
From the torrid isle where the monsoon blows,
From the farthest plains and mountain tips,
And all go down to the sea in ships.
And none shall have a gift or skill,
Or any power of mind or will,
Or any good the hand hath wrought,
Or any luring dream or thought
Of truth or beauty yet to be
The graces of humanity,
But we must bear it safe and fast,
Or flash it out from the top of the mast
Upon the pulses of the air
To all the people everywhere.
We carry the tares with the wholesome grain,
And the joy we bear is born of pain,
And death is with us and disease,
And we must fare through crimsoned seas
Till men of every land and race
Shall know each other face to face,
And all shall take and all shall give,
And all shall learn at last to live
And labor for the sovereign good
Of universal brotherhood."
Ode to Patriotism
FAIR goddess, though thy devotees
Are men of every land and tongue,
Thy heart they never yet could please;
And though thy majesty is sung
By statesman, warrior and bard,
Still on thy brow a stern regard
Proves thy disdain, and quickening their fears,
Brings them before thy fane in bitterness and tears.
As when a suitor, plighting all
His troth unto some high-souled maid,
Makes protestations prodigal,
But finds her loftily afraid,
And still reluctant to aver
Like passion, till that love of her
Enters the temple of her purer mind
As homage less for one than for all womankind
So, holier mistress, hast thou shown
Why still we fall on horrid days,
Why our best hopes are overthrown
In spite of all our prayer and praise;
For thou wouldst have our love expand
Beyond mere race or bounded land,
And thou wouldst test our proffered troth to thee
By what we deeply crave for all humanity.
Build up again our broken faith,
Fair deity; unloose the gyves
Of hate; allay the gruesome wraith
Of murderous war; and lead our lives
Back to the peace that springs of love
For man as man, and mounts above
Land, caste, or creed! O teach our wrathful time
That brotherhood is still man's destiny sublime.
The Launching of the Quistconk
E launch more than a ship today.
Down her smooth ways unto the tide
She bears in every seam and stay
A mighty nation's marshalled pride.
Before her stern, majestic hulk
Our distant higher vision sees
Crime, frightfulness and treason skulk
To certain doom on humbled knees.
We launch more than a ship today:
We hear more than our chieftain's word.
The earth, the air, the watery way
Are thronged with millions who are stirred
To will that this good ship shall be,
With all her strength and treasure store,
And all her Christian chivalry,
The herald of a thousand more.
And these shall follow in her wake
In ever quickening degrees,
Until the endless line shall make
That bridge of ships across the seas,
At whose far end the hosts of God
Shall stand with all the power of earth,
To raise up justice from the sod
And give to freedom her new birth.
The Heart of the World
Trope in the sloughs of blood and hate,
The great guns range upon the seas,
But the heart of the world is not in these.
The weary chronicles still tell
How tyranny and tyrant fell,
But the heart of the world, O Lord, how far
From captain, kaiser, king or czar!
The empty pomp of force and pride
Has lived its brutal day and died,
And all the gods of arrogance
Have fled before the winds of chance,
While time and fate conspire to plan
A highway for the rights of man.
And now where toilers feel the sting
Of utter need and suffering,
Where men are tortured from belief,
And women manacled to grief,
Where childhood walks in wild despair,
The heart of all the world is there.
Clemenceau
ON THE ATTEMPT UPON HIS LIFE
Erode on tempests through a span of years
That bridged two generations. Round his name
Blew all the fitful winds of praise and blame:
France heaped on him her plaudits and her sneers.
And he was not deceived - he had his fears
But kept his patriot zeal bright as a flame;
And when upon his land the fire storms came,
France gave him all her trust with grateful tears.
So when the crazed assassin failed, we said:
May the kind will of God preserve him yet.
Far nobler men may rise when he is dead,
But this of him mankind will not forget
When earth shook with the tramping hordes of hell,
He stood across their path, and held it well.
The Founder
TO THE STATUE OF WILLIAM PENN, City HALL,
PHILADELPHIA, WHEN PEACE WAS PROCLAIMED,
NOVEMBER 11, 1918.
SWIFTER than wind the mighty message
That tyranny had fallen, that the crime came
By which the great high traitor of our time
Had fixed upon his race the foulest fame,
And covered the whole earth with dread and shame
And all the spawn of hell's own murk and grime,
Was purged away at last by that sublime
Wrath of the world that rose in freedom's name.
Then long-leashed passion broke upon the air
And shook the city — cries of joy and grief,
Wild, clamorous thanksgiving everywhere
That God had brought mankind again relief,
And never was a people known to be
So caught away in utter ecstacy.
Then lifted I mine eyes to where thy face,
Turned from the lurid night where king and throne
Were sinking with the sun, looked forth alone
Steadfastly to the dawn. Around thy base
The tumult swept, but in that lofty place
Thy form without a motion or a tone,
Stood like a prophet who had long outgrown
The fleeting passions of the human race.
And one calm hand extended seemed to say,
Through travail of the ages, blood and pain,
Freedom indeed is born anew today;
O build ye now the bulwarks of her reign,
Nor dare to dream the shouting triumph won
Can yet avail until her work is done. 
To All Leaders of Men
Three things there are that men will do
Leaders of men, beware!
Your calling and election true
Will shine, if they have faith that you
Their stubborn purpose share.
Men will see men as only men,
O masters, take ye heed!
No one shall hold the rights of ten,
No mortal be divine again
No counsel, pact, or creed.
Men will be bold to follow thought.
O captains, ye shall find
The peoples of the earth distraught
By being merely led and taught,
But now they have a mind.
And men will share the wealth they make
To this of all attend.
The worker for the worker's sake
Will prove his power to give and take,
That ancient greed may end.
Go not to wordy halls of state,
Ye wise that can discern
This threefold tidal pull of fate
That rocks the world — too late, too late
The statesmen stoop to learn.
But through the ways where labor stalks
Portentous with its load,
The soul of God's great future talks,
The genius of His purpose walks,
And there must be your road.
Brixton Prison
A TRIBUTE TO LORD MAYOR MACSWINEY OF
CORK WHO DIED ON A HUNGER STRIKE FOR THE
CAUSE OF IRISH FREEDOM.
THE guard about thy somber walls
May keep a martyr's limbs confined,
But not the dauntless soul that calls
The challenged conscience of mankind.
MacSwiney, wasting in the dark
Forespent of all his manly use,
Transforms a life into the spark
That set the fires of freedom loose.
He would not bend before the rude
Attempt to make his life a lie;
He scorned to taste oppression's food;
He chose to be a man and die.
O Brixton prison, surely thou
Art raised above thy base design:
Thy terrors all are gone, and now
Thou hast become a nation's shrine.
And thou, lord mayor! Now thy rule
Far out from mourning Cork expands:
Thy spirit has become a school
For patriot heroes in all lands.
POEMS OF APPRECIATION
Lines Written in the Alps Above Chamounix
I had one voice almost persuaded me
To yield with sweet surrender all my heart
In fee to endless beauty, here to bide
And count as nothing worth the flight of days.
Nor could I break at will the subtle spell
That hela me, as it hath held many more,
With power that was more than argument.
Forbear attempt at vain expression here!
Poet and painter both alike despair:
A surfeit of all grandeur overwhelms
The boldest gift, and dwarfs imagining.
Here silence, and unutterable thought,
And the blest gift of feeling must suffice.
No monarch could be raised to higher state
Than you or yonder careless shepherd girl
That minds the grazing of the tinkling kine.
Your meanest seat is heather royal-hued
Girdled with nodding berries black and red,
And flaming poppies sated with the sun,
Your carpet satin green, your body-guard
Soft winds that blow a cooling for your brow
To mock fan-bearers at the Sultan's throne.
Dear music shall not fail you: evermore
Upon your ear shall sound the clear flute note
Of dripping water, or the happier tone
Of slender streams that leap from bolder walls
Singing of freedom from the tyrant ice.
Or, nobler still, up from the vale shall rise
The river music of assembled streams
In symphonies of service to the world.
Look down upon that valley: there behold
Sweet homes with human kindness heaven-dowered.
Those husbandmen have not yet pawned their souls
For bagatelles of profit, young men there
Are not yet sickly, and the rosy dames
Bear children that go springing to the fields.
They make their valley plain lie in the sun
Like some rich quilting wonderfully wrought
In squares and angles of productiveness.
Nor is the blessed Christ there travestied
By sterile worship lavish of all forms
And ceremonies, while its devotees
Dishonor still a long-offended God
By lofty scorn of all his humbler sons.
Those reverent men give fearless benison
To Mongol, Semite, African or Turk:
They plant their crucifixes by the road,
Or rear their cherished shrines upon the rocks
As precious tokens and remembrancers
To all men of the Universal Cross.
For proof of God's unfettered pleasure here,
Look up about those summits where he pours
The light of morning round the monstrous ice,
Round frosted peaks, and hanging frigid plains,
Until they shower down a shining joy
Upon thy lifted head, fill full thy soul
With gladness that transfigures all the vale,
And make the terrible a thing to love.
The white refulgence of those argent snows
Shall follow thee throughout the happy day
With images of purity and peace,
And nevermore shalt thou be what thou wert.
Or, if at noon thy heart be prone to droop
For sheer satiety of loveliness,
Or beauty fail of strength, up through some cloud
Soft as etheral eider-down will rise
The nakedness of brazen granite towers
That were the pillars of the primal world;
Eons of fury have they set at naught,
And all the gnawing of the tooth of time:
And these at noon shall be thy ministers
When they hold up to God their gleaming crowns,
And call thy human weakness back to strength.
And O, when downward rides the lordly sun
Behind those summits, richer guerdons wait
To hearten him who lingers to behold.
Then the flushed earth strains up her jeweled head
Towards the red passion of the bending skies;
Then the bright trees, the high green fields, the crags
That pierce the clouds with menace, and the ice
That shines upon them, all are built away
In steep sierras like some glorious stair
For angels mounting towards the face of God.
And when at last the night has brought thee sleep,
Thy couch shall be companioned by some dream
Of what thine eyes have seen and thy heart felt;
And though the thought of never waking more
Steal o'er thy frame, thou shalt be satisfied.
To the Smartweed
THOU art far more to me than blight and bane
Alone, as rustics deem, who thus deny
Thy regal will and martial quality.
Often have I beheld the angered swain
Charge through thy ranks with horse and steel in vain,
And often have I seen the children try
With gleaming blade to make thy banners fly
Till every scion of thy stock was slain.
But when the havoc tarried I have seen
Thy striplings spring again to take the field,
Choke the strong tuber, rout the bean forlorn,
Shade every valued plant with insolent green,
Constrain the earth to their prolific yield,
And wave their purpling tops above the corn.
With plow and chain I saw the husbandman
Tear up thy roots to wither in the heat,
And drag thy foliage down to make a seat
For the brown odorous furrow- crest that ran
Across the mead where thy career began:
But every blade and stalk that met defeat
Rose up transfigured into sheaves of wheat,
And wrought a conquest by a subtler plan.
Ah, then I knew that he is more than blind
And dim of thought who cannot surely see
In thee the symbol of a world of men
Swept down to darkness by the torrid wind
Blown from the caves of fate eternally,
In whom posterity will rise again.
To William James
DEVOTEDLY he watched the silent stream
Of consciousness, and from the shifting brink,
In lucid phrase, taught thousands how to think.
No straightened logic's thrall, he prized the gleam
Of truth in all experience: the dream
To him was precious too. He dared to link
Reality with wonder, and to sink
The plumb of thought down where all mysteries teem.
Where is the light we knew upon his face
The zest for knowledge, searching and intense?
Gone out for aye in darkness deep and strange?
Or do they now at last find scope and place
Where Thales still propounds the elements,
And Heraclitus broods, “ 'Tis only Change?”
To Mrs. Jane B. Taylor
SHALL I compare thee to the winter snow?
So spotless is thy heart, but never cold:
What though thy locks be changed from sunny gold
To silver, still that perfect brow doth glow
With human interest, still thou sayest, “ Go
Straight forward, trust the dream, be strong, and hold
The faith that love, with all its griefs untold,
Is better than the fairest thing we know. "
So when the winter of my days shall fall,
And snow lies white upon the barren ground
Where I have wandered long, and learned the truth
Of life, and drunk the wormwood and the gall,
O let my bosom, full of years, be found
Still bearing the immortal heart of youth.
Two Women
JUST as my wonted task was done
And day was fast declining,
Two women passed, the low red sun
Upon their faces shining.
Their ample cloaks were gathered warm
Against the winter weather;
Their heads were bare, and arm in arm
They crossed the lawn together.
They seemed two spirits to inspire
Even a mortal craven,
For one had hair like a flame of fire,
And one like the wing of a raven.
With springy step, they passed along
In joyous, bright communing,
And in my heart there came a song
I found delight in crooning.
Come forth, O masters, if you may,
And choose, if you are able,
The golden brightness of the day,
Or the deep, deep night in sable.
The Actress
THINK not her days are but an idle show
Of artificial manners, speech and dress,
Or that her meed of honor should be less
Because her heart lives where the footlights glow
Upon the garish scene, with weal and woe
Of mimic passion. Let the happiness
Of her brief hour be full: that bright success
Is purchased far more dearly than we know.
Pity, the wrapt spectators little sense
Her nobler grace! To “hold the mirror up,”
And thereby win the favor of our eyes
Were well; but what applause can recommense
The tempered soul that drains the bitter cup
Of a continual self-sacrifice!
The Piano-Player 
DISTRAUGHT care, I said, Here shall be found
A solace for great losses. Long ago,
One gentle soul could lure away my woe
Upon Beethoven's music; for he crowned
A world of sorrow with a heaven of sound.
Thanks to the genius that has willed it so
Those deathless harmonies again may flow
From out this perforated scroll unwound.'
Then wondrous came the swelling chords, and sweet
The troubled minor strain; but O how changed
From the dear tones that brought my younger heart
A chastened wealth of happiness complete,
When o'er the board her perfect fingers ranged
With such expressive grace that tears would start!
Prevision
FROM THE PORTUGESE OF ALBERTO DE OLIVEIRA
I KNEW thy smile was but a passing spell,
And yet I loved it - O I loved it well.
I loved the radiant meaning of thine eyes,
Knowing that they would fail me, and likewise,
Though breathed upon the wind, I had no choice
But still to love the passion of thy voice.
Now all has vanished - all is ended now
Enchanted voice, enamored glance. In vain
I knew it would be so, and know not how
It can avail me now if I complain.
To a Nobly-Gifted Singer
ALL the pleasance of her face
Telleth of an inward grace;
In her dark eyes I have seen
Sorrows of the Nazarene;
In the proud and perfect mould
Of her body I behold,
Rounded in a single view
The good, the beautiful, the true;
And when her spirit goes up-winging
On sweet air of artless singing
Surely the heavenly spheres rejoice
In union with a kindred voice.
Katerina Breshkovskaya
THOU shalt die in the midst of thy battles, "
They said of this mother of thought,
When she bared to her countrymen, bared to the world,
The evil a tyrant had wrought.
But the tyrant was strong, and his minions,
And they harried her out of the land,
To the blight and the death of the frozen steppes,
And the word she had uttered was banned.
But that word was a fire, and prospered,
And her thought was a wind and a rain,
And it beat on the palace that stood on the sand,
And it fell, and the tyrant was slain.
O who would not fall in such battles,
What death could a mortal prefer,
In the world-girding fight for honor and right,
To the glory of dying like her!
Christmas at Melrose
COME home with me a little space
And browse about our ancient place,
Lay by your wonted troubles here
And have a turn of Christmas cheer.
These sober walls of weathered stone
Can tell a romance of their own,
And these wide rooms of devious line
Are kindly meant in their design.
Sometimes the north wind searches through,
But he shall not be rude to you.
We'll light a log of generous girth
For winter comfort, and the mirth
Of healthy children you shall see
About a sparkling Christmas tree.
Eleanor, leader of the fold,
Hermione with heart of gold,
Elaine with comprehending eyes,
And two more yet of coddling size,
Nathalie pondering all that's said,
And Mary of the cherub head
All these shall give you sweet content
And care-destroying merriment,
While one with true madonna grace
Moves round the glowing fire-place
Where father loves to muse aside
And grandma sits in silent pride.
And you may chafe the wasting oak,
Or freely pass the kindly joke
To mix with nuts and home-made cake
And apples set on coals to bake.
Or some fine carol we will sing
In honor of the Manger-King,
Or hear great Milton's organ verse,
Or Plato's dialogue rehearse
What Socrates with his last breath
Sublimely said of life and death.
These dear delights we fain would share
With friend and kinsman everywhere,
And from our door see them depart
Each with a little lighter heart.
The Metropolitan Tower
LOOK down securely from thy dizzy height,
O soaring tower, upon the little street
Where men below like termites seem to crawl
In insignificance. Thou couldst not fear
Comparison with any mighty pile
From Babel or the pyramids till now.
The clamor and confusion round thy base
Shall never vex thy summit: there the sun
Shall sit while twilight gathers at thy feet.
Thy shoulders mock the straining of the storms,
And if the earth be loyal to her trust,
Old time shall waste his tooth in wasting thee.
Thou art as wonderful to me as Blanc
Or Fiji Yama or Niagara
These are the work of God, but thou of Man.
It is thy privilege to symbolize
In giant form the saving truth of art,
That beauty's handmaid is utility,
And strength their bond of love.
A City Park
THE travail of the world roars like the sea
Throughout the city-traffic, strife and haste
And all the petty trade wherein men waste
The noblest graces of humanity.
The sounding streets are thronged incessantly
With feverish hordes driven and overpaced
By the sharp whips of need, with little taste
Or time for that which life was meant to be.
But here is hope — here is a rescued spot,
Where beauty waits in fountain, grass and flower,
Where children play, and men turn from the hot,
Mad mill of labor for a quiet hour
To feel the cooling wash of the summer breeze,
And glimpse the calm of heaven through the trees.
The Symphony
I THINK there scarcely can be given
Nobler harmonies in heaven;
Seraph harps and voices swelling
Could not be more heart-compelling;
For these instruments have found
All the ministries of sound,
And their shriving tones have won me
Far more good than priests have done me.
What troublous passion-stirring comes
Upon the thunder-rolling drums!
What weakness could withstand the scorns
Blown by the bold courageous horns!
What grace is that the spirit needs
Uncompassed by the lowly reeds,
And who could keep a truce with sins
That heard the pleading violins!
Oh, I was weary when I came
To listen, for the sham and shame
And poverty of mortal fare
Are heavy weights for souls to bear.
But, when I left, a flame of light
Went with me through the solemn night,
I walked in splendor in a place
Large as illimitable space,
Peace through the mists of doubting smiled,
And life and death were reconciled.
The Borglum Statue of Lincoln in the Court House Square, Newark, N. J.
I THINK there is no other monument
Raised up to merit out of brass or stone
So beautiful as this: it stands alone,
Outreaching far the artist's first intent,
By grace of one sweet human incident.
Round all the high, horsed heroes I have known
An undisturbed in difference has grown,
Which neither time nor wonder can prevent.
But he is on the ground, and children play
Upon his knees, and stroke the earnest face
That shines with their caresses, and all day
He is their comfort in the public place:
The rigid bronze itself cannot conceal
That sheltering heart which little children feel.
She Will Come
АFTER a tedious day
Of unavailing toil,
Weary of heart and brain,
Disconsolate and faint,
I seek my friendly couch
For respite and release,
Repeating as I go
“Tomorrow she will come. ”
The darkness and the deep,
Cool silence of the night
Enwrap me, and I dream.
Then in a happy place
Upon a far green hill
The sunlight shines again.
There the warm winds distil
From hyacinth and rose
Their sweet quintessences
To be the breath of life,
There singing streams flow down
From fountains crystalline,
And on their mossy banks
The Nereids and fauns
Dance to the reeds of Pan
In glad abandonment.
There the lithe Oreads
Ply every game and sport
In honor of the trees,
And jocund forests shake
Their ancient sides in mirth.
Color and light and shade,
And all dear harmonies
Of poesy and truth
And fellowship are there.
There the great boon of health
And innocent content
Lead on the grateful hours,
And every heart is free,
And pain and aching thought,
And tedium and care
Are alien enemies.
And when the sun retires
Behind the arras drawn
Across the stage of day,
The night begins a new
Succession of delights
With moon, and golden stars,
And blessed memories
Of music that has ceased,
And a wide heaven of dreams.
Then I awake and say,
“This is the day she comes."
Spring
SWEET are the maiden promises of spring,
Her voice comes wandering like some muted tone
From far-off symphonies, and everything
She wears is but a veiling lightly thrown
Around the form of beauty. She will seem
Demurely chaste and reticent awhile,
But in her eyes is youth's eternal dream
And all the light of passion in her smile.
When the bold sun, her lover, argues down
Her shy reserves, then will her lips confess
Her timorous deep desire, and she will crown
Her fealty with wondrous fruitfulness.
And when her time is done, the earth will praise
Her blithe and rosy breed of summer days.
The Dogwood
IT is a rare delight to see
The snow-bloom of the dogwood tree
All virginal against the sheen
Of April's early budding green.
When violet and buttercup
Their timid heads are lifting up,
When dandelions fringe the pass
And dews have gemmed the tender grass,
He opens to the morning light
His fragrant chalices of white.
He cannot stay: he comes to show
That spring intends the heart shall know
Yet once again the primal worth
Of all the loveliness of earth
The cordial sky, the thought of flowers,
Of friendly trees and singing bowers,
The angel spirits all the day
Around us where the children play,
Fair fields of grain that promise soon
Their cornucopias of June,
And sweet romance that never fails
Of lovers and of bridal veils.
A little term of shade and sun,
And all his ministry is done.
A fitting symbol seemeth he
Of all our fair mortality:
So youth departs; so not for long
Abides the ecstacy of song;
So brief are all the splendors laid
About the dawn; so faces fade;
So dies the moonlight on a stream;
And so is life a little dream.
May Again
AGAIN the southern winds at ease
Caress the blossom-laden trees,
While o'er the heavens gay
Is writ in gold and hues of wine
A brightly blazoned script divine
May comes again, sweet May.
Again what glories wake the dawn,
And how old warrior trouble, wan
And weak, is driven out;
With what clear throats the sparrows sing,
How musical the drone bee's wing,
And how the children shout!
Four walls are all too narrow now
I follow where the sturdy plow
Has turned the fragrant mead,
Where growing green things rise in line
Like soldiers, or where soft-eyed kine
On new-spring grasses feed.
But sweeter than all nature rife
With song and bloom that zest of life
Which fills the spirit up
With joy new-born of homely food
And peace that whispers “ God is good, ”
And overruns my cup.
O what of the dreams that faded fast,
Or the fickle " gleam ” that glanced and passed,
Or the wine that turned to rue.
I hold a wand, as May can vow,
With magic healing, and somehow
The heavens and earth are new.
In coat of hope-and-courage clad,
I am a bold Sir Galahad,
On quests that cannot fail,
For with clear vision now I see
That one who daily walks with me
Holds up the holy Grail.
L'ENVOI
O wonder love, whose tender might
Through checkered years of cloud and light
Has been both balm and goad,
Be thou my May when winters chill,
My Sarras set upon a hill,
The ending of my road.
Summer Magic
SO many cares to vex the day,
So many fears to haunt the night,
My heart was all but weaned away
From every lure of old delight.
Then summer came, announced by June,
With beauty, miracle and mirth.
She hung aloft the rounding moon,
She poured her sunshine on the earth,
She drove the sap and broke the bud,
She set the crimson rose afire,
She stirred again my sullen blood,
And waked in me a new desire.
Before my cottage door she spread
The softest carpet nature weaves,
And deftly arched above my head
A canopy of shady leaves.
Her nights were dreams of jeweled skies,
Her days were bowers rife with song,
And many a scheme did she devise
To heal the hurt and soothe the wrong.
For on the hill or in the dell,
Or where the brook went leaping by
Or where the fields would surge and swell
With golden wheat or bearded rye,
I felt her heart against my own,
I breathed the sweetness of her breath,
Till all the cark of time had flown,
And I was lord of life and death.
Sacred Music at Sea
ARISE, dear music! O'er the rolling waves
Let harmony abound in praise of Him
Whose mighty hand upholds us, and who saves
Our course from erring, though the way be dim.
Tell of the warring waters, and the sky
That calms them on the red horizon's rim,
And how the clouds are shepherded on high
By winds that blow a tribute unto Him.'
Speak, trombone, of the horrid ocean blast,
Cry, cornet, to the finny hordes that swim
Far down where none can fathom, slow or fast,
On errands of sure service unto Him.
Say, baritones and altoes, how the light
Of stars in heaven guides the seraphim,
Till the unshadowed sun dissolves the night
To blaze a golden pathway unto Him.
Sound, drums and tubas, like a thunder storm,
Scream clarionets, like bold sea gulls that skim
The curling billow, on whose awful form
Their daily food is offered up by Him.
Let rippling notes from the small piccolo
Be for the compass tremulous and slim,
But pointing through all gloom the way we go
By laws immutably ordained of Him.
And let the heart of every instrument
Laud the good ship that heeds not any whim
Of wind or flood, but faithful and unspent
Makes for the harbor built of old by Him.
O rise, ye hymns of all the lands that be,
And if for joy mine eyes shall overbrim,
It is that though we all go down to sea
In ships we cannot drift afar from Him.
Vacation End
FROM the charm of radiant faces,
From the days we took to dream,
From the joy of open spaces,
From the mountain and the stream,
Bronzed of sunlight, nerves a-tingle,
Keen of limb and clear of head,
Speed we back again to mingle
In the battle for our bread.
Now again the stern commanding
Of the chosen task is heard,
And the tyrant, care, is standing
Arbiter of deed and word.
But the radiance is not ended,
And the joy, whate'er the cost,
Which those fleeting days attended
Never can be wholly lost.
For we bring to waiting duty,
To the labor and the strife,
Something of the sense of beauty,
And a fairer view of life.
Boys Swimming
THERE scarcely is a finer thing to see
Than lithe lads swimming in a running stream, 
Cleaving the tide with breast-stroke gracefully,
The waters slipping by with wave and gleam.
They make delight of one vast element
Which mankind looked upon so long with fear,
Taught unawares to be self-confident
In venturing a hazardous career.
A Legend of the Easter Children
THE legends say children were first
To be abroad that Easter Day
When morning out of darkness burst,
And angels rolled the stone away.
For children's hearts are quick to feel
The deadening pall of mortal pain,
And children's hearts are first to heal
When light and comfort come again.
And they had loved the Lord Christ's face,
And on His knees had laughed and cried,
And heard Him say the heavenly place
Is where all child-like souls abide.
And they had often heard Him tell
Strong men, by pride and greed defiled,
That they could never please Him well
Till they were humble as a child
And they had heard the tale that grieves
All little hearts: how one so dear
Was nailed upon a cross with thieves,
And tortured with a poisoned spear;
And how the temple's wondrous veil
Was riven by the lightning stroke,
While, mingled with the women's wail,
The earthquake and the thunder broke;
And how there came from northern seas
A terrified brigade of gulls,
Swept on by some unearthly breeze,
To scream above the place of skulls;.
And how black night came down at noon,
And ghosts, from graves that opened wide,
Skulked out beneath a blood-red moon,
When He that loved the children died.
For two long days no girl or boy
In Galilee or Jordan plain
Could laugh or sing, for hope and joy
In every little heart was slain.
But when the earth, that third day morn,
Was flooded with such golden light
As never since the world was born
Had come to dazzle human sight,
Then every child, the legends say,
Knew that the time was at an end,
Knew that the stone was rolled away,
And flew to meet the risen Friend.
And long before the Magdalene
Had reached the empty sepulchre,
Or Peter heard what she had seen,
Or fleet John hastened after her,
The children had gone forth and found
The Master in the garden walk,
And scattered lillies on the ground,
And seen His smile, and heard Him talk.
No child was puny, halt or lame,
Or hungry, or in tatters clad,
But clothed as if in light they came,
And all were whole, and strong, and glad.
They throng along the Kedron rill,
They thread the city through the gates
Straight up to Joseph's garden hill,
Where He that loves the children waits.
They sing, they dance, they climb the trees,
They circle round in ring and file;
They know they cannot fail to please,
And win the guerdon of His smile.
He lifts His hand: “ I bore the pain
Of death for men by sin defiled,
I rise henceforth to live and reign
Lord of the kingdom of the Child."
They vanish, and He stands alone;
And when the women come to weep,
The garden flames with flowers new-blown
The children are at home asleep.
"What makes that garden spot so bright!”
The learned Rabbis stroked their chins;
They knew not yet that love is light,
That knowledge fails where love begins.
But somehow still on Easter morn
The world is beautiful again,
And in each child-like heart is born
Some yearning of good will to men,
Some haunting sense, some happy dream,
Of singing birds, of daffodils,
Of olive branches, or the gleam
Of dew-shine on the Syrian hills.
SONGS
Sweetest, let no cloud of sorrow
Cast a shadow o'er us;
Let no dark foreboding borrow
One bright ray from that tomorrow
Beckoning before us.
Weary waiting, toil and trouble
These shall not confound us.
All the hardship is a bubble:
We can love, and that is double
All the world around us.
Can it matter, sweetest, whether
Days be dull or shining?
If our hearts are knit together,
Summer time or winter weather
Ne'er shall know repining.
Lady, who is richer far
Than titled heirs or princes are?
Who hath quaffed a drink divine
Rarer than the rarest wine?
He to whom your eyes are kind,
He to whom you have a mind,
Who by your proud election sips
The honeyed nectar of your lips.
All through the day I bore the pain
Of following after thee in vain.
All through the night the demons sent me
Dream and fancy to torment me.
Now the hope I built upon
Rises with another sun,
And whatever the toil or pain
I follow after thee again.
Mutatis Mutandis
WHEN my lady goeth fairly,
And her countenance is rarely
Lighted by the things that please her,
Mien and happy mood according
Are themselves the sweet rewarding
Of the kindling eye that sees her.
But when her course is out of measure,
Or some stirring of displeasure
Tints her face with hues that never
Fell on canvas, or from darkling
Troubled brow her eyes are sparkling,
She is lovelier than ever.
POEMS OF THE SPIRIT
A Prayer
O MASTER, let me labor through the day
Quietly, with clear, unswerving
Teach me indifference to praise or blame,
So long as with good conscience I can say
I sought to find the straight and narrow way.
If suddenly the fires of passion flame
About me, let me calm them with that Name
Which in my heart I never could betray.
And when the light fails, and untroubled sleep
Has clothed my senses with its sweet reward,
O give my spirit then a large increase
Of strength for one more day of striving; keep
The gateway of my dreams; and wake me, Lord,
To walk again the manly paths of peace.
A Far Country
BEYOND the cities I have seen,
Beyond the wrack and din, 
There is a wide and fair demesne
Where I have never been.
Away from desert wastes of greed,
Over the peaks of pride,
Across the seas of mortal need
Its citizens abide.
And through the distance though I see
How stern must be the fare,
My feet are ever fain to be
Upon the journey there.
In that far land the only school
The dwellers all attend
Is built upon the Golden Rule,
And man to man is friend.
No war is there nor war's distress,
But truth and love increase
It is a realm of pleasantness,
And all her paths are peace.
Nil Desperandum
OFT when the way I go lies hard and steep
Before me, and I cannot see my goal:
When those dream-kindled hopes wherewith my soul
Lighted the path have failed; when I could weep
To think how slow, unfirm a pace I keep,
How weak my faith, how slight my self-control,
Or will to speed me forward, though the whole
O'er-ripe world-harvest waits ahead to reap;
Oft in these hours I listen to the voice
Of seers and heroes through the ages past,
Who knew at length the metes and bounds of fate,
And always, whatsoe'er their lot or choice,
One clear command they give: Or slow or fast,
Despair not, trust thyself, and trusting, wait.
Ideal
O WHEN I am tossed on the waters of sorrow,
Uncertain and sick, without compass or goal,
With no light for today, and no hope for tomorrow,
And fear is a torture to body and soul;
When fruitless endeavor, or thwarted ambition,
The anguish of loving or physical pain
Brings sobering thoughts of the rapid transition
Of year into year without comfort or gain
It is easy and well from out of that sorrow,
O infinite Goodness, to cry unto Thee
For light for today, and hope for tomorrow,
For guidance and faith on a desolate sea.
But teach me, O Spirit, that harder devotion
When skies are serene and the sailing is fair,
When the haven lies white on the rim of the ocean,
And love is the captain to pilot me there.
For if then I remember to honor and love Thee,
And own that from Thee every blessing is sent,
When the waters of sorrow would gather above me
Thy merciful care shall be quick to prevent.
The Wonder
I MARVEL not to see the works of God.
The mighty river rolling to the sea,
The sunlit mountain crowned eternally
With crystal snow, the earthquake like a rod
Of vengeance, trumpet winds and flowers that nod
In beauty, all the heavenly majesty
These from my childhood up have been to me
Familiar voices saying, " God is God. "
But evermore the wonder grows amain
That we, slight creatures, should ourselves command
The uses and the beauty of the whole
To build a harp, with strings of joy and pain
In endless range, whereon the Master's hand
May strike the music of a human soul.
Watch Night
TIS mystic midnight, and the bell
Cleaves the cold air and tolls away
The haggard year. Alas! no spell
Can lure him on to meet the day.
The new year at the selfsame hour
On winged sandals never slack
Begins his course. Alas! no power
Can hold his flying footsteps back.
Stay not, O heart, for time nor tide,
Nor count the days that now are done,
But spread the wings of purpose wide,
Coeval with the rising sun.
Values
IN God's high heaven and in His earth
These things I hold of matchless worth:
Health and a task, the dreams of youth,
Beauty and law, and love, and truth.
Tyrant Beauty
MY mind is set on earnest days
And nights of quiet sleeping,
But beauty over all my ways
A tyrant watch is keeping.
She haunts me in a lovely face,
By pool and stream she stays me,
Her form in every cloud I trace,
Her starry sky betrays me.
Hers is the mantling down of snow,
Hers is the solemn warning
Of dirges that the north winds blow,
And hers the burst of morning.
She forges all the human ties
That bind me to my neighbor;
She wreathes the laurel crown that lies
Upon the brow of labor.
A golden bird in a budding tree
Pours out his heart in singing
Which tells the more of beauty, he
Or the bud where the sap is springing?
No time or place is left to me
By night or day for resting;
Iler finger points, and I must be
Adventuring and questing.
Let this austere dominion cease,
O beauty, to distress me,
Or grant to me a vast increase
Of power to exp ss thee.
The Three Marys
THAT blessed morn three Marys came
To glorify the Easter scene
Martha's sister, Mary dame,
And the repentant Magadalene.
One by a perfect love was led,
One brought a mother's sore distress,
One wore upon her lovely head
A chastened crown of thankfulness.
And these by loyal suffering
Were made as one in sweet accord,
Through whom the generations bring
Increasing homage to their Lord.
Companionship
I CLOSED the door and turned the key
And spread my book upon my knee,
But though I pondered well that lore,
I ended wanting something more.
I called a comrade friend to share
My quiet room. His speech was fair,
His spirit high, his discourse wide,
But I was still unsatisfied.
Then in the stillness all alone
My soul rose up to claim her own
Inviolable right to be,
O Father, face to face with Thee.
Home is the Heart
MY dwelling place hath ever been
A spirit-builded home within,
And though at whiles I fare apart,
My mistress still is mistress heart.
Sometimes the brazen horn success
Drowns all her tones of tenderness,
And then I goad my will and dream
To win the things that men esteem.
Sometimes the meaning and the end
Of living seems to be a friend,
Whose comprehending kindred mind
Is all the boon I crave to find.
And often, too, where beauty's sign
Appears, I make that standard mine,
While pleasure lifts a luring voice
To rob my will of other choice.
Then honor calls; the give and take
Of combat stirs my soul awake,
Where men through troubled ages long
Clash in the lists of right and wrong.
But what success can be complete?
What perfect friends did ever meet
In fellowship so well inspired
But something more was still desired?
And beauty wanes, and pleasure palls,
And all the pride of honor falls
When carnal strife has claimed her toll
Of ravished limb and tarnished soul.
With clearer vision then I see
Content in these can never be,
And all the folly is disclosed
Of trust in outward things reposed.
And with that lesson I return
To where the lamps of loving burn
Turn home again - and now aright
I walk by an unfailing light.
Compensation
IF only in thine heart there be
Some depth of earnest gratitude
For life's great bounties unto thee,
Though pain will come and fears intrude,
Thou canst not wholly miss the crown
Of those by heaven accounted blessed:
Patience will bring a healing down,
And peace will give the spirit rest.
Certainty
WHAT have I fathomed of life,
What of its medley of strife,
Sorrow and solace profound?
What can we creatures of dust
Stand upon, swear by, and trust,
What my unshakable ground!
This: that though evil be strong,
Goodness prevaileth ere long,
However betrayed or beset;
That he his own spirit doth smother
Who willeth the hurt of another,
And this: that God liveth yet.
In the Still Night
IN the still night there comes to me
The blessed boon of liberty.
From all the cares that chafed and choked,
The spirit is at last unyoked
To seek her heaven, as she ought,
On sturdy wings of fearless thought.
Then come the dreams which through the day
The moil of living shuts away.
Then can the soul her fountains fill,
While all the universe is still,
From streams of quietness that rise
Out of the hills of Paradise.
And I can tell the day was meant
For some design beneficent,
For sweet-imagined sounds I hear,
And forms of beauty hover near
To win me to the perfect trust
That life is good, and God is just,
And permeates His world whereof
The essence and the end is love.
Father Love
ONE unto him does heaven grant to bend
By day and night above the creamy cheek
And dimpled smile of baby. 'Tis the meek,
Sweet privilege of mother to attend
The cradle shrine. There patience without end
Wins her a beauty words can never speak.
Her troubled joy has nothing more to seek
Where life and love in one devotion blend.
For him the roughened world, all day for him
The tyrant task, the tension of the mind.
But toil were vain as any froth or foam,
Were not that hour to come when twilight dim
Brings weariness, and father turns to find
Rest with the blessed angels of his home.
Divine Affinity
'T WERE vain, O God, in me to tell
Thy potency divine:
Omniscience surely knoweth well
How much of me is thine.
As is the steel to the magnet bar,
As to the rose the bee,
The earth to its compelling star,
So am I, God, to Thee.
Learning to Walk
OUR little cherub learned today
To stand alone and make her way.
With faltering will and timid feet
From mother's knee to father's seat.
With many a failure, many a pause,
Now by rebuke, now by applause,
With tears and oft-recurring doubt,
She toiled her little journey out.
And ever as her faith declined,
She strove anew, for there behind
Was mother's sweetly crooned command,
And on ahead her father's hand.
And O, at last when she survived
Her tiny perils and arrived,
What depths of feeling unexpressed
Were stirred within each guardian breast!
We older children of the earth
Have journeyed farther from our birth,
But doubt and pain and dark delay
Attend the journey all the way.
And all our balm for heart or mind
Is merely this, that we shall find,
Before we come to utter harm,
The refuge of a Father's arm.
The Teacher
LORD, who am I to teach the way
To little children day by day,
So prone myself to go astray?
I teach them knowledge, but I know
How faint they flicker and how low
The candles of my knowledge glow.
I teach them power to will and do,
But only now to learn anew
My own great weakness through and through.
I teach them love for all mankind
And all God's ceatures, but I find
My love comes lagging far behind.
Lord, if their guide I still must be,
Oh let the little children see
The teacher leaning hard on Thee.

To the Three for Whom the Book 
Once like a lady 
In a silken dress, 
The serpent might eddy 
Through the wilderness, 
Billow and glow 
And undulate 
In a rustling flow 
Of sinuous hate. 
Now dull-eyed and leaden, 
Of having lost 
His Eden 
He pays the cost. 
He shuns the tree 
That brought him low 
As grown to be 
Domestic; no 
Temptations dapple, 
From leaf to root, 
The modern apple 
Our meekest fruit. 
Dragon and griffin 
And basilisk 
Whose stare could stiffen, 
And the hot breath whisk 
From the overbold 
Braving a gaze 
So freezing cold, 
Who sings their praise 
These latter days? 
That venemous head 
On a woman fair, — 
Medusa’s dead 
Of the hissing hair. 
No beasts are made 
Meet for the whir 
Of that sunken blade 
Excalibur. 
No smithies forge 
A shining sword 
Fit for the gorge 
Of a beast abhorred. 
Pale Theseus 
Would have no need, 
Were he with us, 
Of sword or thread; 
For long has been set 
The baleful star 
Of Pasiphae’s pet, 
The Minotaur. 
Though they are dead, 
Those ancient ones, 
Each bestial head 
Dust under tons 
Of dust, new beasts 
Have come, their heirs, 
Claiming their feasts 
As the old did theirs. 
Clawless they claw, 
Fangless they rend; 
And the stony maw 
Crams on without end. 
Still are arrayed 
(But with brighter eyes) 
Stripling and maid 
For the sacrifice. 
We cannot spare 
This toll we pay 
Of the slender, the fair, 
The bright and the gay! 
Gold and black crown, 
Body slim and taut, 
How they go down 
’Neath the juggernaut! 
Youth of the world, 
Like scythed wheat, 
How they are hurled 
At the clay god’s feet! 
Hear them cry Holy 
To stone and to steel, 
See them bend lowly, 
Loyal and leal, 
Blood rendered and bone, 
To steel and to stone. 
They have forgot 
The stars and the sun, 
The grassy plot, 
And waters that run 
From rock to rock; — 
Their only care 
Is to grasp a lock 
Of Mammon’s hair. 
But you three rare 
Friends whom I love 
(With rhymes to swear 
The depths whereof) 
A book to you three 
Who have not bent 
The idolatrous knee, 
Nor worship lent 
To modern rites, 
Knowing full well 
How a just god smites 
The infidel; 
Three to whom Pan 
Is no mere myth, 
But a singing Man 
To be reckoned with;— 
Witness him now 
In the mist and dew; 
Lean and hear how 
He carols to you: 
"Gather as a flower 
Living to your heart; 
Let the full shower 
Rankle and smart; 
Youth is the coffer 
Where all is hi.; 
All age may offer 
Youth can outbid. 
Blind with your beauty 
The ranks of scorn, 
Take for a duty 
Pleasure; you were born 
Joy to incur. 
Ere the eyes are misted 
With a rheumy blur, 
Ere the speech is twisted 
To a throaty slur, 
Ere the cheeks are haggard 
Ere the prick of the spur 
Finds you lame or laggard, 
Do not demur! 
When Time advances 
Terrible and lone, 
Recall there were dances 
Though they be flown. 
When Death plys the riddle 
To which all are mute, 
Remember the fiddle, 
The lyre and the flute." 
To three who will heed 
His song, nor brook 
That a god should plead 
In vain, a book. 
Tribute 
(To My Mother) 
Because man is not virtuous in himself, 
Nor kind, nor given to sweet charities, 
Save goaded by the little kindling elf 
Of some dear face it pleasures him to please; 
Some men who else were humbled to the dust, 
Have marveled that the chastening hand should stay, 
And never dreamed they held their lives in trust 
To one the victor loved a world away. 
So I, least noble of a churlish race, 
Least kind of those by nature rough and crude, 
Have at the intervention of your face 
Spared him with whom was my most bitter feud 
One moment, and the next, a deed more grand, 
The helpless fly imprisoned in my hand. 
That Bright Chimeric Beast 
(For Lynn Riggs) 
THAT bright chimeric beast 
Conceived yet never born, 
Save in the poet’s breast, 
The white-flanked unicorn, 
Never may be shaken 
From his solitude; 
Never may be taken 
In any earthly wood. 
That bird forever feathered, 
Of its new self the sire, 
After aeons weathered, 
Reincarnate by fire, 
Falcon may not nor eagle 
Swerve from his eerie, 
Nor any crumb inveigle 
Down to an earthly tree. 
That fish of the dread regime 
Invented to become 
The fable and the dream 
Of the Lord’s aquarium, 
Leviathan, the jointed 
Harpoon was never wrought 
By which the Lord’s anointed 
Will suffer to be caught. 
Bird of the deathless breast, 
Fish of the frantic fin, 
That bright chimeric beast 
Flashing the argent skin, — 
If beasts like these you’d harry, 
Plumb then the poet’s dream; 
Make it your aviary, 
Make it your wood and stream. 
There only shall the swish 
Be heard, of the regal fish; 
There like a golden knife 
Dart the feet of the unicorn, 
And there, death brought to life, 
The dead bird be reborn. 
At the Etoile 
(At the Unknown Soldier’s Grave in Paris) 
If in the lists of life he bore him well, 
Sat gracefully or fell unhorsed in love, 
No tongue is dowered now with speech to tell 
Since he and death somewhere matched glove with glove. 
What proud or humble union gave him birth, 
Not reckoning on this immortal bed, 
Is one more riddle that the cryptic earth 
Though knowing chooses to retain unsaid. 
Since he was weak as other men, — or like 
Young Galahad as fair in thought as limb, 
Each bit of moving dust in France may strike 
Its breast in pride, knowing he stands for 
him. 
Two Epitaphs 
1. For the Unknown Soldier (Paris) 
Uknown but not unhonored rest, 
Symbol of all Time shall not reap; 
Not one stilled heart in that torn breast, 
But a myriad millions sleep. 
2. For a Child Still-born 
Here sleeps a spark that never burned, 
A seed not granted spring to bloom, 
A soul whose darkened pathway turned 
From tomb of flesh to dusty tomb. 
To an Unknown Poet 
"Love is enough," I read somewhere; 
Lines some poor poet in his pride 
And poverty wrote on the air 
To ease his heart, and soothe his bride. 
Something in me, child of an age 
Cold to the core, undeified, 
Warmed to my brother bard, this sage; 
And I too leaned upon my pride. 
But pride I found can blind our eyes, 
And poverty is worse than pride. 
Love’s breed from both is a nest of lies; 
And singer of sweet songs, you lied. 
Little Sonnet to Little Friends 
Let not the proud of heart condemn 
Me that I mould my ways to hers, 
Groping for healing in a hem 
No wind of passion ever stirs; 
Nor let them sweetly pity me 
When I am out of sound and sight; 
They waste their time and energy; 
No mares encumber me at night. 
Always a trifle fond and strange, 
And some have said a bit bizarre, 
Say, "Here’s the sun," I would not change 
It for my dead and burnt-out star. 
Shine as it will, I have no doubt 
Some day the sun, too, may go out. 
Mood 
I think an impulse stronger than my mind 
May some day grasp a knife, unloose a vial, 
Or with a little leaden ball unbind 
The cords that tie me to the rank and file. 
My hands grow quarrelsome with bitterness, 
And darkly bent upon the final fray; 
Night with its stars upon a grave seems less 
Indecent than the too complacent day. 
God knows I would be kind, let live, speak fair, 
Requite an honest debt with more than just, 
And love for Christ’s dear sake these shapes that wear 
A pride that had its genesis in dust, — 
The meek are promised much in a book I know 
But one grows weary turning cheek to blow. 
Counter Mood 
Let this be scattered far and wide, laid low 
Upon the waters as they fall and rise, 
Be caught and carried by the winds that blow, 
Nor let it be arrested by the skies: 
I who am mortal say I shall not die; 
I who am dust of this am positive, 
That though my nights tend toward the grave, yet I 
Shall on some brighter day arise, and live. 
Ask me not how I am oracular, 
Nor whence this arrogant assurance springs. 
Ask rather Faith the canny conjurer, 
(Who while your reason mocks him mystifies 
Winning the grudging plaudits of your eyes) — 
How suddenly the supine egg has wings. 
The Wind and the Weather 
Forever shall not burn his tongue 
So glibly after this; 
Eternity was brief that hung 
Upon a passing kiss. 
A year ago no metaphor 
Was rich enough to trace 
A single figure boasting more 
Allurement than her face. 
One spring from then, small change we find 
In him; she still is fair. 
But in the other’s heart or mind 
Neither glows anywhere. 
In the Midst of Life 
BUD bursting from a tomb 
Of dust, this mortal knows 
In winter’s sterile womb 
For your despoiling grows 
What comes to every rose. 
Grass so securely green, 
Sky-climbing corn so tall, 
Know in your length is seen 
What overtowers all: 
The shadow of the fall. 
Yet blossoms with each spring 
Reopen; grasses sprout; 
And jaunty corn stalks fling 
New skeins of silk about. 
Nature is skilled to rout 
Death’s every ambuscade; 
For man alone is poured 
The potion once essayed 
That sharper than a sword 
Destroys both mouth and gourd. 
Deplore, lament, bewail; 
The sword seeks out the sheath; 
Though all things else may fail, 
Two things keep faith; this breath 
A while; and longer death. 
Minutely Hurt 
Since I was minutely hurt, 
Giant griefs and woes 
Only find me staunchly girt 
Against all other blows. 
Once an atom cracks the heart 
All is done and sai.; 
Poison, steel, and fiery dart 
May then be buffeted. 
Never the Final Stone 
Though by the glory of your lady’s face 
The riots of the sun and moon are quelled, 
Yet have the hands that fashioned her some grace 
Whereto perfection was allied, withheld. 
The perfect wooer never speaks the word 
The object of his passion most would hear; 
So does expectance keep her wild feet spurred 
Toward that which ever is no more than near. 
And daily from His lonely mountain-top, 
God sees us rear our Babels on the plain; 
Then with one stone to go, He lets us drop 
That we may want and strive for Him again. 
Light Lady 
They say when virtue slipped from her, 
Awakened by her fall, 
Sin seemed to work a miracle 
And made her soul grow tall. 
Here with her penny papers by, 
We see how well she diced: 
Nothing to do but munch her gums 
And sing the love of Christ. 
And now with alms for what she was 
Men stroke her ragged fur; 
When Death comes down this street, his face 
Will not be strange to her. 
By Their Fruits 
I know a lover when I see one, 
And I can tell the way they fare: 
If those they dote on shed some sun, 
Or blow a cool and languid air. 
Those that are loved, though niggardly, 
Move with a lively foot and ey.; 
The others drag like men who see 
Their day and minute set to die. 
A Miracle Demanded 
This life is like a tree that flourisheth 
With fruit and flower, gay leaf and sprouting twig; 
But pestilence is in the wind’s warm breath, 
And at the roots the worms and mice grow big. 
The gardener, steady in his anxious claims, 
Who prunes for love, he says, and not for wage, 
Than simple care has more disastrous names, 
The most elect: Disease, Death, and Old Age. 
Against such foes how shall a tree prevail 
To curb its consummation in decay, 
And like a tree shall men not strive and fail, 
Unless all wonders have not passed away? 
Renew an ancient vision, Lord, in me: 
Open the young man’s eyes that he may see. 
Tongue-tied 
You ask me why I love her, and you pause 
Magnanimous, that I may make reply 
Handing you deftly parceled every cause, 
Saying with confidence, "Lo, this is why." 
But I am mute as if I had no tongue, 
Without reason as if I had no mind, 
This song the most familiar ever sung, 
Is lost to me like a leaf caught in the wind. 
And so my tongue is tie.; and so you smile 
Not knowing, little lover that you are, 
(Prattling, " ’Twill wear, ’twill last so long a while") 
The poet is compelled to love his star, 
Not knowing he could never tell you why 
Though silence makes inadequate reply. 
Ultima Verba 
Not being in my coffin, yet I know 
What suffocations crowd their breath who go 
Through some mischance alive into the grave; 
Not having any wound at all to shout 
Belief to Thomas who must see or doubt, 
I feel my life blood ebbing wave on wave. 
And yet this knowledge cannot summon strength 
To rend apart the life-impaling length 
Of these strong boards that hold my body down; 
There is no cloth, no cool and radiant stuff 
(Save fashioned by your hand) healing enough 
To staunch this thin red flow in which I drown. 
I am as one knowing what day he dies, 
Who looks in vain for mercy into eyes 
No glints of pity shade, no pardons stir, 
And thinks, "Although the trap by which I span 
This world and that another springs, this man 
Is both my judge and executioner." 
The Foolish Heart 
Be still, heart, cease those measured strokes; 
Lie quiet in your hollow bed; 
This moving frame is but a hoax 
To make you think you are not dead." 
Thus spake I to my body’s slave, 
With beats still to be answered; 
Poor foolish heart that needs a grave 
To prove to it that it is dead. 
A Wish 
I hope when I have sung my rounds 
Of song, I shall have strength to slay
The wish to chirp on any grounds, 
Content that silence hold her sway, 
My tongue not rolling futile sounds 
After my heart has had its say. 
For Helen Keller 
Against our puny sound and sight 
In vain the bells of Heaven ring, 
The Mystic Blossoms red and white 
May not intrigue our visioning. 
For lest we handle, lest we touch, 
Lest carnally our minds condone, 
Our clumsy credence may not clutch 
The under or the overtone. 
Her finer alchemy converts 
The clanging brass to golden-pealed, 
And for her sight the black earth spurts 
Hues never thought there unrevealed. 
Asked and Answered 
How have I found this favor in your sight, 
And will the flame burn steady to the end, 
Until we pass that dark and dangerous bend 
Where there is such a crying need for light; 
Or will it flare up now, flame-clear and bright, 
Sun-like its wealth so far and wide distend 
That nothing will remain for us to spend 
When toll is taken of the dismal night? 
Why should I harrow up my mind like this 
To tarnish with a doubt each golden kiss? 
This is the Day most certainly. This bars 
Us now from any hidden darkness spun. 
Sufficient to the day let be the sun, 
And to the night the spear-points of the stars. 
Two Poets 
I 
"The love-mad lark you sing of swooned," they said, 
"And speared his bosom on a thorn of last 
Year’s rose; cease playing Orpheus; no blast 
You blow can raise Eurydice once dead. 
Our ears are cloyed with songs our fathers heard 
Of how your lady’s face and form were fair; 
Put by your fluting; swell a martial air, 
And spur us on with some prophetic word." 
So, wearying, he changed his tune, and won 
The praise of little men (who needed none)...
But oh to see him smile as when dawn blew 
A trumpet only he could hear, and dew 
He could not brush away besieged his eyes 
At sight of gulls departing from his skies. 
2 
"How could a woman love him; love, or wed?" 
And thinking only of his tuneless face 
And arms that held no hint of skill or grace, 
They shook a slow, commiserative head 
To see him amble by; but still they fed 
Their wilting hearts on his, were fired to race 
Once more, and panting at life’s deadly pace, 
They drank as wine the blood-in-song he shed. 
Yet in the dream-walled room where last he 
Soft garments gathered dust all night and day, 
As women whom he loved and sang of came 
To smooth his brow and wail a secret name. 
A rose placed in his hand by Guinevere 
Was drenched with Magdalen’s eternal tear. 
Not Sacco and Vanzetti 
These men who do not die, but send to death, 
These iron men whom mercy cannot bend 
Beyond the lettered law; what when their breath 
Shall suddenly and naturally end? 
What shall their final retribution be, 
What bloody silver then shall pay the tolls 
Exacted for this legal infamy 
When death indicts their stark immortal souls? 
The day a slumbering but awful God, 
Before Time to Eternity is blown, 
Examines with the same unyielding rod 
These images of His with hearts of stone, 
These men who do not die, but death decree,— 
These are the men I should not care to be. 
A Song No Gentleman Would Sing to Any Lady 
There were some things I might not know 
Had you not pedagogued me so; 
And these I thank you for; 
Now never shall a piquant face 
Cause my tutored heart a trace 
Of anguish any more. 
Before your pleasure made me wise 
A simulacrum of disguise 
Masked the serpent and the dove; 
That I discern now hiss from coo, 
My heart’s full gratitude to you, 
Lady I had learned to love. 
Before I knew love well I sang 
Many a polished pain and pang 
With proper bardic zeal; 
But now I know hearts do not break 
So easily, and though a snake 
Has made them, wounds may heal. 
Self Criticism 
Shall I go all my bright days singing, 
(A little pallid, a trifle wan) 
The failing note still vainly clinging 
To the throat of the stricken swan? 
Shall I never feel and meet the urge 
To bugle out beyond my sense 
That the fittest song of earth is a dirge, 
And only fools trust Providence? 
Than this better the reed never turned flute, 
Better than this no song, 
Better a stony silence, better a mute 
Mouth and a cloven tongue. 
A Thorn Forever in the Breast 
A Hungry cancer will not let him rest 
Whose heart is loyal to the least of dreams; 
There is a thorn forever in his breast 
Who cannot take his world for what it seems; 
Aloof and lonely must he ever walk, 
Plying a strange and unaccustomed tongue, 
An alien to the daily round of talk, 
Mute when the sordid songs of earth are sung. 
This is the certain end his dream achieves: 
He sweats his blood and prayers while others sleep, 
And shoulders his own coffin up a steep 
Immortal mountain, there to meet his doom 
Between two wretched dying men, of whom 
One doubts, and one for pity’s sake believes. 
The Proud Heart 
That lively organ, palpitant and red, 
Enrubied in the staid and sober breast, 
Telling the living man, "You are not dead 
Until this hammered anvil takes its rest," 
My life’s timepiece wound to alarm some day 
The body to its need of box and shroud, 
Was meant till then to beat one haughty way; 
A crimson stroke should be no less than proud. 
Yet this high citadel has come to grief, 
Been broken as an arrow drops its bird, 
Splintered as many ways as veins in a leaf 
At a woman’s laugh or a man’s harsh word; 
But being proud still strikes its hours in pain; 
The dead man lives, and none perceives him slain. 
Interlude 
The Simple Truth 
I know of all the words I speak or write, 
Precious and woven of a vibrant sound, 
None ever snares your faith, intrigues you 
quite, 
Or sends you soaring from the solid ground. 
You are the level-headed lover who 
Can match my fever while the kisses last, 
But you are never shaken through and through; 
Your roots are firm after the storm has passed. 
I shall know nights of tossing in my sleep 
Fondling a hollow where a head should lie; 
But you a calm review, no tears to weep, 
No wounds to dress, no futile breaths to sigh. 
Ever this was the way of wind with flame: 
To harry it, then leave swift as it came. 
Therefore, Adieu 
Now you are gone, and with your unreturning goes 
All I had thought in spite of you would stay; 
Now draws forever to its unawakening close 
The beauty of the bright bandanna’d day. 
Now sift in ombrous flakes and revolutions slow 
My dreams descending from my heady sky. 
The balm I kept to cool my grief in (leaves of snow) 
Now melts, with your departure flowing by. 
I knew, indeed, the straight unswerving track the sun 
Took to your face (as other ecstasies) 
Yet I had thought some faith to me in them; they run 
From me to you as fly to honey, bees. 
Avid, to leave me neither fevered joy nor ache, 
Only of soul and body vast unrest. 
Sun, moon, and stars should be enough; why must you take 
The feeling of the heart out of the breast? 
Now I who dreamed before I died to shoot one shaft 
Of courage from a warped and crooked bow, 
Stand utterly forsaken, stripped of that small craft 
I had, watching with you all prowess go. 
At a Parting 
Let us not turn for this aside to die, 
Crying a lover may not be a friend. 
Our grief is vast enough without that lie; 
All stories may not boast a happy end. 
Love was a flower, sweet, and flowers fade; 
Love was a fairy tale; these have their close. 
The endless chronicle was never made, 
Nor, save in dreams, the ever-scented rose. 
Seeing them dim in passion’s diadem, 
Our rubies that were bright that now are dull, 
Let them not fade without their requiem, 
How they were red one time and beautiful, 
And how the heart where once a ruby bled 
May live, yet bear that mark till it is dead. 
Dictum 
Yea, I have put thee from me utterly, 
And they who plead thy cause do plead in vain; 
Window and door are bolted, never key 
From any ore shall cozen them again. 
This is my regal justice: banishment, 
That those who please me now may read and see 
How self-sustained I am, with what content 
I thrive alike on love or treachery. 
God, Thou hast Christ, they say, at Thy right hand; 
Close by Thy left Michael is straight and leal; 
Around Thy throne the chanting elders stand, 
And on the earth Thy feudal millions kneel. 
Criest Thou never, Lord, above their song: 
"But Lucifer was tall, his wings were long?" 
Revelation 
Pity me, I said; 
But you cried, Pity you; 
And suddenly I saw 
Higher than my own grief grew. 
I saw a tree of woe so tall, 
So deeply houghed with grief, 
That matched with it my bitter plant 
Was dwarfed into a leaf. 
Bright Bindings 
Your love to me was like an unread book, 
Bright-backed, with smooth white pages yet unslit; 
Fondly as a lover, foolishly, I took 
It from its shelf one day and opened it. 
Here shall I read, I thought, beauty and grace, 
The soul’s most high and awful poetry; — 
Alas for lovers and the faith they place 
In love, alas for you, alas for me. 
I have but read a page or two at most, 
The most my horror-blinded eyes may read. 
I find here but a windy tapering ghost 
Where I sought flesh gifted to ache and bleed. 
Yet back you go, though counterfeit you be. 
I love bright books even when they fail me. 
Ghosts 
Breast under breast when you shall lie 
With him who in my place 
Bends over you with flashing eye 
And ever nearing face; 
Hand fast in hand when you shall tread 
With him the springing ways 
Of love from me inherited 
After my little phase; 
Be not surprised if suddenly 
The couch or air confound 
Your ravished ears upbraidingly, 
And silence turn to sound. 
But never let it trouble you, 
Or cost you one caress; 
Ghosts are soon sent with a word or two 
Back to their loneliness. 
Song in Spite of Myself 
Never love with all your heart, 
   It only ends in aching; 
And bit by bit to the smallest part 
   That organ will be breaking. 
Never love with all your mind, 
   It only ends in fretting; 
In musing on sweet joys behind, 
   Too poignant for forgetting. 
Never love with all your soul, 
   For such there is no ending, 
Though a mind that frets may find control, 
   And a shattered heart find mending. 
Give but a grain of the heart’s rich seed, 
   Confine some under cover, 
And when love goes, bid him God-speed. 
   And find another lover. 
Nothing Endures 
Nothing endures, 
Not even love, 
Though the warm heart purrs 
Of the length thereof. 
Though beauty wax, 
Yet shall it wane; 
Time lays a tax 
On the subtlest brain. 
Let the blood riot, 
Give it its will; 
It shall grow quiet, 
It shall grow still. 
Nirvana gapes 
For all things given; 
Nothing escapes, 
Love not even. 
There Must Be Words 
This wound will be effaced as others have, 
This scar recede into oblivion, 
Leaving the skin immaculate and suave, 
With none to guess the thing they gaze upon. 
After a decent show of mourning I, 
As once I ever was, shall be as free 
To look on love with calm unfaltering eye, 
And marvel that such fools as lovers be. 
These are brave words from one who like a child 
Cuts dazzling arabesques on summer ice 
That, kissed by sun, begins to crack and tha.; 
The old assurance dies, only the wild 
Desire to live goes on; any device 
Compels its frantic grasp, even a straw. 
One Day I Told My Dove 
ONE day I told my love my heart, 
   Disclosed it out and in; 
I let her read the ill-writ chart 
   Small with virtue, big with sin. 
I took it from the hidden socket 
   Where it was wont to griev.; 
"I’ll turn it," I said, "into a locket, 
   Or a bright band for your sleeve." 
I let her hold the naked thing 
   No one had seen before; 
And had she willed, her hand might wring 
   It dry and drop it to the floor. 
It was a gentle thing she did, 
   The wisest and the best; 
"The proper place for a heart," she said, 
   "Is back in the sheltering breast." 
Lesson 
I LAY in silence at her side, 
   My heart’s and spirit’s choice; 
For we had said harsh things and cried 
   On love in a bitter voice. 
We lay and watched two points in space, 
   Pricked in heaven, faint and far. 
They seemed so near, but who could trace 
   That width between star and star? 
We lay and watched, and suddenly 
   There was a streak of light, 
And where were two, the eye might see 
   But one star in the night. 
My hand stole out, her hand crept near, 
   Grief was a splintered spar; 
Two fused in one there, did you hear 
   Us claiming kinship, star? 
The Street Called Crooked 
(Le Havre, August 1928) 
"Bon soir, monsieur," they called to me 
   And, "Venez voir nos femmes." 
"Bon soir, mesdames," they got from me, 
   And, "J’ai une meilleure dame." 
"To meet strange lips and foreign eyes 
   I did not cross the foam, 
I have a dearer, fairer prize 
   Who waits for me at home." 
"Her eyes are browner, lips more red 
   Than any lady’s light; 
’Twould grieve her heart and droop her head 
   If I failed her tonight." 
"Bon soir, mesdames; que Dieu vous garde; 
   And catch this coin I throw; 
The ways of life are bleak and hard, 
   Ladies, I think you know." 
A bright and crooked street it gleamed 
   With light and laughter filled; 
All night the warm wine frothed and streamed 
   While souls were stripped and killed. 
The Law That Changeth Not 
Stern legislation of a Persian hand 
Upon my heart, Love, strict Medean writ, 
Must till the end of time and me command 
Obeisance from him who fostered it. 
All other codes may hide their littlest flaw 
Toward which the hopeful prisoner may kneel; 
I come of those who once they write a law 
Do barricade themselves against appeal. 
So stand I now condemned by mine own tort; 
Extenuations? There is none to plead. 
I am my own most ultimate resort; 
There is no pardon for the stricken Mede. 
I turn to go, half valiant, half absurd, 
To perish on a promise, die on a word. 
Valedictory 
No word upon the boarded page 
That once in praise I spoke, 
Would I in bitterness and rage, 
Had I the power, revoke. 
Take them and bind them to your heart, 
With ribbon or with rue. 
An end arrives to all we start; 
I write no more of you. 
Go then, adhere to the vows you make 
Out of a haughty heart; 
No more to tremble for my sake 
Nor writhe beneath the smart 
Of hearing on an alien tongue 
Tolled lightly and in play, 
The bell by which our lives were rung, 
The bell we break today. 
Love ever was the brightest dream 
My pen might seize upon; 
Think not I shall renounce the theme 
Now that the dream is done. 
We are put by, but not the Bow, 
The Arrows, and the Dove. 
Though you and I go down, still glow 
The armaments of love. 
The essence shines devoid of form, 
Passion plucked of its sting, 
The Holy Rose that hides no worm, 
The Everlasting Thing. 
Though loud I cry on Venus’ name 
To heal me and subdue 
The rising tide, the raging flame, 
I write no more of you. 
Rare was the poem we began 
(We called it that!) to live, 
And for a while the measures ran 
With all the heart could give. 
But, oh, the golden vein was thin, 
Early the dark cock crew; 
The heart cried out (love’s muezzin); 
I write no more of you. 
Color 
To Certain Critics 
Then call me traitor if you must, 
Shout treason and default! 
Say I betray a sacred trust 
Aching beyond this vault. 
I’ll bear your censure as your praise, 
For never shall the clan 
Confine my singing to its ways 
Beyond the ways of man. 
No racial option narrows grief, 
Pain is no patriot, 
And sorrow plaits her dismal leaf 
For all as lief as not. 
With blind sheep groping every hill, 
Searching an oriflamme, 
How shall the shepherd heart then thrill 
To only the darker lamb? 
Black Majesty 
(After reading John W. Vandercook’s chronicle of sable glory) 
These men were kings, albeit they were black, 
Christophe and Dessalines and L’Ouverture; 
Their majesty has made me turn my back 
Upon a plaint I once shaped to endure. 
These men were black, I say, but they were crowned 
And purple-clad, however brief their time. 
Stifle your agony; let grief be drowned; 
We know joy had a day once and a clime. 
Dark gutter-snipe, black sprawler-in-the-mud, 
A thing men did a man may do again. 
What answer filters through your sluggish blood 
To these dark ghosts who knew so bright a reign? 
"Lo, I am dark, but comely," Sheba sings. 
"And we were black," three shades reply, "but kings." 
Song of Praise 
Who lies with his milk-white maiden, 
Bound in the length of her pale gold hair, 
Cooled by her lips with the cold kiss laden, 
He lies, but he loves not there. 
Who lies with his nut-brown maiden, 
Bruised to the bone by her sin-black hair, 
Warmed with the wine that her full lips trade in, 
He lies, and his love lies there. 
The Black Christ 
(Hopefully dedicated to White America) 
The Black Christ 
I 
God's glory and my country’s shame, 
And how one man who cursed Christ’s name 
May never fully expiate 
That crime till at the Blessed Gate 
Of Heaven He meet and pardon me 
Out of His love and charity; 
How God, who needs no man’s applause, 
For love of my stark soul, of flaws 
Composed, seeing it slip, did stoop 
Down to the mire and pick me up, 
And in the hollow of His hand 
Enact again at my command 
The world’s supremest tragedy, 
Until I die my burthen be; 
How Calvary in Palestine, 
Extending down to me and mine, 
Was but the first leaf in a line 
Of trees on which a Man should swing 
World without end, in suffering 
For all men’s healing, let me sing. 
O world grown indolent and crass, 
I stand upon your bleak morass 
Of incredulity and cry 
Your lack of faith is but a lie. 
If you but brushed the scales apart 
That cloud your eyes and clinch your heart 
There is no telling what grace might 
Be leveled to your clearer sight; 
Nor what stupendous choir break 
Upon your soul till you should ache 
(If you but let your fingers veer, 
And raised to heaven a listening ear) 
In utter pain in every limb 
To know and sing as they that hymn. 
If men would set their lips to prayer 
With that delight with which they swear, 
Heaven and earth as bow and string, 
Would meet, would be attuned and sing. 
We are diseased, trunk, branch, and shoot 
A sickness gathers at the root 
Of us. We flaunt a gaudy fruit 
But maggots wrangle at the core. 
We cry for angels; yet wherefore, 
Who raise no Jacobs any more.... 
No men with eyes quick to perceive 
The Shining Thing, clutch at its sleeve, 
Against the strength of Heaven try 
The valiant force of men who die; — 
With heaving heart where courage sings 
Strive with a mist of Light and Wings, 
And wrestle all night long, though pressed 
Be rib to rib and back to breast, 
Till in the end the lofty guest 
Pant, "Conquering human, be thou blest." 
As once they stood white-plumed and still, 
All unobserved on Dothan’s hill, 
Now, too, the angels, stride for stride, 
Would march with us, but are denied. 
Did we but let our credence sprout 
As we do mockery and doubt, 
Lord Christ Himself would stand revealed 
In every barren, frosty field 
That we misname the heart. Belief 
In something more than pain and grief, 
In only earth’s most commonplace, 
Might yet illumine every face 
Of wretchedness, every blinded eye, 
If from the hermitage where nigh 
These thousand years the world of men 
Has hemmed her in, might come again 
With gracious eyes and gentle breath 
The still unconquered Lady, Faith. 
Two brothers have I had on earth, 
One of spirit, one of sod; 
My mother suckled one at birth, 
One was the Son of God. 
Since that befell which came to me, 
Since I was singled out to be, 
Upon a wheel of mockery, 
The pattern of a new faith spun; 
I never doubt that once the sun 
For respite stopped in Gibeon, 
Or that a Man I could not know 
Two thousand ageless years ago, 
To shape my profit by His loss, 
Bought my redemption on a cross. 
2 
"Now spring that heals the wounds of earth 
Is being born; and in her birth 
The wounds of men may find a cure. 
By such a thought I may endure, 
And of some things be no less sure. 
This is a cruel land, this South, 
And bitter words to twist my mouth, 
Burning my tongue down to its root, 
Were easily foun.; but I am mute 
Before the wonder of this thing: 
That God should send so pure a spring, 
Such grass to grow, such birds to sing, 
And such small trees bravely to sprout 
With timid leaves first coming out. 
A land spring yearly levies on 
Is gifted with God’s benison. 
The very odor of the loam 
Fetters me here to this, my home. 
The whitest lady in the town 
Yonder trailing a silken gown 
Is less kin to this dirt than I. 
Rich mistresses with proud heads high 
This dirt and I are one to them; 
They flick us both from the bordered hem 
Of lovely garments we supply; 
But I and the dirt see just as high 
As any lady cantering by. 
Why should I cut this bond, my son, 
This tie too taut to be undone? 
This ground and I are we not one? 
Has it not birthed and grown and fed me: 
Yea, if you will, and also bled me? 
That little patch of wizened corn 
Aching and straining to be born, 
May render back at some small rate 
The blood and bone of me it ate. 
The weevil there that rends apart 
My cotton also tears my heart. 
Here too, your father, lean and black, 
Paid court to me with all the knack 
Of any dandy in the town, 
And here were born, and here have grown, 
His sons and mine, as lean and black. 
What ghosts there are in this old shack 
Of births and deaths, soft times and hard! 
I count it little being barred 
From those who undervalue me. 
I have my own soul’s ecstasy. 
Men may not bind the summer sea, 
Nor set a limit to the stars; 
The sun seeps through all iron bars; 
The moon is ever manifest. 
These things my heart always possessed. 
And more than this (and here’s the crown) 
No man, my son, can batter down 
The star-flung ramparts of the mind. 
So much for flesh; I am resigned, 
Whom God has made shall He not guide?" 
So spake my mother, and her pride 
For one small minute in its tide 
Bore all my bitterness away. 
I saw the thin bent form, the gray 
Hair shadowed in the candlelight, 
The eyes fast parting with their sight, 
The rough, brown fingers, lean with toil, 
[illustration]
Marking her kinship to the soil. 
Year crowding year, after the death 
Of that one man whose last drawn breath 
Had been the gasping of her name, 
She had wrought on, lit with some flame 
Her children sensed, but could not see, 
And with a patient wizardry 
Wheedled her stubborn bit of land 
To yield beneath her coaxing hand, 
And sometimes in a lavish hour 
To blossom even with a flower. 
Time after time her eyes grew dim 
Watching a life pay for the whim 
Some master of the land must feed 
To keep her people down. The seed 
They planted in her children’s breasts 
Of hatred toward these men like beasts 
She weeded out with legends how 
Once there had been somewhere as now 
A people harried, low in the dust; 
But such had been their utter trust 
In Heaven and its field of stars 
That they had broken down their bars, 
And walked across a parted sea 
Praising His name who set them free. 
I think more than the tales she told, 
The music in her voice, the gold 
And mellow notes she wrought, 
Made us forbear to voice the thought 
Low-buried underneath our love, 
That we saw things she knew not of. 
We had no scales upon our eyes; 
God, if He was, kept to His skies, 
And left us to our enemies. 
Often at night fresh from our knees 
And sorely doubted litanies 
We grappled for the mysterie.: 
"We never seem to reach nowhere," 
Jim with a puzzled, questioning air, 
Would kick the covers back and stare 
For me the elder to explain. 
As like as not, my sole refrain 
Would be, "A man was lynched last night." 
"Why?" Jim would ask, his eyes star-bright. 
"A white man struck him; he showed fight. 
Maybe God thinks such things are right." 
"Maybe God never thinks at all — 
Of us," and Jim would clench his small, 
Hard fingers tight into a ball. 
"Likely there ain’t no God at all," 
Jim was the first to clothe a doubt 
With words, that long had tried to sprout 
Against our wills and love of one 
Whose faith was like a blazing sun 
Set in a dark, rebellious sky. 
Now then the roots were fast, and I 
Must nurture them in her despite. 
God could not be, if He deemed right, 
The grief that ever met our sight. 
Jim grew; a brooder, silent, sheathed; 
But pride was in the air he breathed; 
Inside you knew an TEtna seethed. 
Often when some new holocaust 
Had come to undermine and blast 
The life of some poor wretch we knew, 
His bones would show like white scars through 
His fists in anger’s futile way. 
"I have a fear," he used to say, 
"This thing may come to me some day. 
Some man contemptuous of my race 
And its lost rights in this hard place, 
Will strike me down for being black. 
But when I answer I’ll pay back 
The late revenge long overdue 
A thousand of my kind and hue. 
A thousand black men, long since gone 
Will guide my hand, stiffen the brawn, 
And speed one life-divesting blow 
Into some granite face of snow. 
And I may swing, but not before 
I send some pale ambassador 
Hot footing it to hell to say 
A proud black man is on his way." 
When such hot venom curled his lips 
And anger snapped like sudden whips 
Of lightning in his eyes, her words, — 
Slow, gentle as the fall of birds 
That having strained to win aloft 
Spread out their wings and slowly waft 
Regretfully back to the earth, — 
Would challenge him to name the worth 
Contained in any seed of hate. 
Ever the same soft words would mate 
Upon her lips: love, trust, and wait. 
But he, young, quick, and passionate, 
Could not so readily conceal, 
Deeper than acid-burns, or steel 
Inflicted wounds, his vital hurt; 
So still the bitter phrase would spurt: 
"The things I’ve seen, the things I see, 
Show what my neighbor thinks of me. 
The world is large enough for two 
Men any time, of any hue. J 
I give pale men a wide berth ever; 
Best not to meet them, for I never 
Could bend my spirit, never truckle 
To them; my blood’s too hot to knuckle." 
And true; the neighbors spoke of him 
As that proud nigger, handsome Jim. 
It was a grudging compliment, 
Half paid in jest, half fair intent, 
By those whose partial, jaundiced eye 
Saw each of us as one more fly, 
Or one more bug the summer brings, 
All shaped alike; antennae, wings, 
And noxious al.; if caught, to die. 
But Jim was not just one more fly, 
For he was handsome in a way 
Night is after a long, hot day. 
If blood flows on from heart to heart, 
And strong men leave their counterpart 
In vice and virtue in their seed, 
Jim’s bearing spoke his imperial breed. 
I was an offshoot, crude, inclined 
More to the eart.; he was the kind 
Whose every graceful movement said, 
As blood must say, by turn of head, 
By twist of wrist, and glance of eye, 
"Good blood flows here, and it runs high." 
He had an ease of limb, a raw, 
Clean, hilly stride that women saw 
With quickened throbbings of the breast. 
There was a show of wings; the nest 
Was too confined; Jim needed space 
[Illustration]
To loop and dip and interlace; 
For he had passed the stripling stage, 
And stood a man, ripe for the wage 
A man extorts of life; his gage 
Was down. The beauty of the year 
Was on him now, and somewhere near 
By in the woods, as like as not, 
His cares were laid away, forgot 
In hearty wonderment and praise 
Of one of spring’s all perfect days. 
But in my heart a shadow walked 
At beauty’s side; a terror stalked 
For prey this loveliness of time. 
A curse lay on this land and clime. 
For all my mother’s love of it, 
Prosperity could not be writ 
In any book of destiny 
For this most red epitome 
Of man’s consistent cruelty 
To man. Corruption, blight, and rust 
Were its reward, and canker must 
Set in. There were too many ghosts 
'Upon its lanes, too many hosts 
Of dangling bodies in the wind, 
Too many voices, choked and thinned, 
Beseeching mercy on its air. 
And like the sea set in my ear 
Ever therejurged the steady fear 
Lest this same end and brutal fate 
March toward my proud, importunate 
Young brother. Often he’d say, 
"’Twere best, I think, we moved away." 
But custom and an unseen hand 
Compelled allegiance to this land 
In her, and she by staying nailed 
Us there, by love securely jailed. 
But love and fear must end their bout, 
And one or both be counted out. 
Rebellion barked now like a gun; 
Like a split dam, this faith in one 
Who in my sight had never done 
One extraordinary thing 
That I should praise his name, or sing 
His bounty and his grace, let loose 
The pent-up torrent of abuse 
That clamored in me for release: 
"Nay, I have done with deities 
Who keep me ever on my knees, 
My mouth forever in a tune 
Of praise, yet never grant the boon 
Of what I pray for night and day. 
God is a toy; put Him away. 
Or make you one of wood or stone 
That you can call your very own, 
A thing to feel and touch and stroke, 
Who does not break you with a yoke 
Of iron that he whispers soft; 
Nor promise you fine things aloft 
While back and belly here go bare, 
While His own image walks so spare 
And finds this life so hard to live 
You doubt that He has aught to give. 
Better an idol shaped of clay 
Near you, than one so far away. 
Although it may not heed your labors, 
At least it will not mind your neighbors’. 
'In His own time, He will unfold 
You milk and honey, streets of gold, 
High walls of jasper...’ phrases rolled 
Upon the tongues of idiots. 
What profit then, if hunger gluts 
Us now? Better my God should be 
This moving, breathing frame of me, 
Strong hands and feet, live heart and eyes 
And when these cease, say then God dies. 
Your God is somewhere worlds away 
Hunting a star He shot astray; 
Oh, He has weightier things to do 
Than lavish time on me and you. 
What thought has He of us, three motes 
Of breath, three scattered notes 
In His grand symphony, the world? 
Once we were blown, once we were hurled 
In place, we were as soon forgot. 
He might not linger on one dot 
When there were bars and staves to fling 
About, for waiting stars to sing. 
When Rome was a suckling, when Greece was young, 
Then there were Gods fit to be sung, 
Who paid the loyal devotee 
For service rendered zealously, 
In coin a man might feel and spend, 
Not marked ‘Deferred to Journey’s End.’ 
The servant then was worth his hire; 
He went unscathed through flood and fire; 
Gods were a thing then to admire. 
'Bow down and worship us,’ they said. 
‘You shall be clothed, be housed and fed, 
While yet you live, not when you’re dead. 
Strong are our arms where yours are weak. 
On them that harm you will we wreak 
The vengeance of a God though they 
Were Gods like us in every way. 
Not merely is an honor laid 
On those we touch with our accolade; 
We strike for you with that same blade!’ " 
My mother shook a weary head — 
"Visions are not for all," she said, 
"There were no risings from the dead, 
No frightened quiverings of earth 
To mark my spirit’s latter birth. 
The light that on Damascus’ road 
Blinded a scoffer never glowed 
For me. I had no need to view 
His side, or pass my fingers through 
Christ’s wounds. It breaks like that on some, 
And yet it can as surely come 
Without the lightning and the rain. 
Some who must have their hurricane 
Go stumbling through it for a light 
They never find. Only the night 
Of doubt is opened to their sight. 
They weigh and measure, search, define, — 
But he who seeks a thing divine 
Must humbly lay his lore aside, 
And like a child believe; confide 
In Him whose ways are deep and dark, 
And in the end perhaps the spark 
He sought will be revealed. Perchance 
Some things are hard to countenance, 
And others difficult to probe; 
But shall the mind that grew this globe, 
And out of chaos thought a world, 
To us be totally unfurled? 
And all we fail to comprehend, 
Shall such a mind be asked to bend 
Down to, unravel, and untwine? 
If those who highest hold His sign, 
Who praise Him most with loudest tongue 
Are granted no high place among 
The crowd, shall we be bitter then? 
The puzzle shall grow simple when 
The soul discards the ways ofjdust. 
There is jio gain in doubt: but trust 
Is our one magic wand. Through it 
We and eternity are knit, 
Death made a myth, and darkness lit. 
The slave can meet the monarch’s gaze 
With equal pride, dreaming to days 
When slave and monarch both shall be, 
Transmuted everlastingly, 
A single reed blown on to sing 
The glory of the only King." 
We had not, in the stealthy gloom 
Of deepening night, that shot our room 
With queerly capering shadows through, 
Noticed the form that wavered to 
And fro on weak, unsteady feet 
Within the door; I turned to greet 
Spring’s gayest cavalier, but Jim 
Who stood there balanced in the dim 
Half-light waved me away from him. 
And then I saw how terror streaked 
His eyes, and how a red flow leaked 
And slid from cheek to chin. His hand 
Still grasped a knotted branch, and spanned 
It fiercely, fondling it. At last 
He moved into the light, and cast 
His eyes about, as if to wrap 
In one soft glance, before the trap 
Was sprung, all he saw mirrored there: 
All love and bounty; grace; all fair, 
All discontented days; sweet weather; 
Rain-slant, snow-fall; all things together 
Which any man about to die 
Might ask to have filmed on his eye, 
And then he bowed his haughty head, 
"The thing we feared has come," he said; 
"But put your ear down to the ground, 
And you may hear the deadly sound 
Of two-limbed dogs that bay for me. 
If any ask in time to be 
Why I was parted from my breath, 
Here is your tale: I went to death 
Because a man murdered the spring. 
Tell them though they dispute this thing, 
This is the song that dead men sing: 
One spark of spirit God head gave 
To all alike, to sire and slave, 
From earth’s red core to each white pole, 
This one identity of soul; 
That when the pipes of beauty play, 
The feet must dance, the limbs must sway, 
And even the heart with grief turned lead, 
Beauty shall lift like a leaf wind-sped, 
Shall swoop upon in gentle might, 
Shall toss and tease and leave so light 
That never again shall grief or care 
Find long or willing lodgement there. 
Tell them each law and rule they make 
Mankind shall disregard and break 
(If this must be) for beauty’s sake. 
Tell them what pranks the spring can play; 
The young colt leaps, the cat that lay 
In a sullen ball all winter long 
Breaks like a kettle into song; 
Waving it high like a limber flail, 
The kitten worries his own brief tail; 
While man and dog sniff the wind alike, 
For the new smell hurts them like a spike 
Of steel thrust quickly through the breast; 
Earth heaves and groans with a sharp unrest. 
The poet, though he sang of death, 
Finds tunes for music in simple breath; 
Even the old, the sleepy-eyed, 
Are stirred to movement by the tide. 
But oh, the young, the aging young, 
Spring is a sweetmeat to our tongue; 
Spring is the pean; we the choir; 
Spring is the fuel; we the fire. 
Tell them spring’s feathery weight will jar, 
Though it were iron, any bar 
Upreared by men to keep apart 
Two who when probed down to the heart 
Speak each a common tongue. Tell them 
Two met, each stooping to the hem 
Of beauty passing by. Such awe 
Grew on them hate began to thaw 
And fear and dread to melt and run 
Like ice laid siege to by the sun. 
Say for a moment’s misty space 
These had forgotten hue and race; 
Spring blew too loud and green a blast 
For them to think on rank and caste. 
The homage they both understood, 
(Taught on a bloody Christless rood) 
Due from his dark to her brighter blood, 
In such an hour, at such a time, 
When all their world was one clear rhyme, 
He could not give, nor she exact. 
This only was a glowing fact: 
Spring in a green and golden gown, 
And feathered feet, had come to town; 
Spring in a rich habiliment 
That shook the breath and woke the spent 
And sleepy pulse to a dervish beat, 
[Illustration]
Spring had the world again at her feet. 
Spring was a lady fair and rich, 
And they were fired with the season’s itch 
To hold her train or stroke her hair 
And tell her shyly they found her fair. 
Spring was a voice so high and clear 
It broke their hearts as they leaned to hear 
In stream and grass and soft bird’s-wing; 
Spring was in them and_they were spring. 
Then say, a smudge across the day, 
A bit of crass and filthy clay, 
A blot of ink upon a white 
Page in a book of gol.; a tight 
Curled worm hid in the festive rose, 
A mind so foul it hurt your nose, 
Came one of earth’s serene elect, 
His righteous being warped and flecked 
With what his thoughts were: stench and smut.... 
I had gone on unheeding but 
He struck me down, he called her slut, 
And black man’s mistress, bawdy whore, 
And such like names, and many more, — 
(Christ, what has spring to answer for!) 
I had gone on, I had been wise, 
Knowing my value in those eyes 
That seared me through and out and in, 
Finding a thing to taunt and grin 
At in my hair and hue. My right 
I knew could not outweigh his might 
Who had the law for satellite — 
Only I turned to look at her, 
The early spring’s first worshiper, 
(Spring, what have you to answer for?) 
The blood had fled from either cheek 
And from her lips; she could not speak, 
But she could only stand and stare 
And let her pain stab through the air. 
I think a blow to heart or head 
Had hurt her less than what he said. 
A blow can be so quick and kind, 
But words will feast upon the mind 
And gnaw the heart down to a shred, 
And leave you living, yet leave you dead. 
If he had only tortured me, 
I could have borne it valiantly. 
The things he said in littleness 
Were cheap, the blow he dealt me less, 
Only they totalled more; he gagged 
And bound a spirit there; he dragged 
A sunlit gown of gold and green, — 
(The season’s first, first to be seen) 
And feathered feet, and a plumed hat, — 
(First of the year to be wondered at) 
Through muck and mire, and by the hair 
He caught a lady rich and fair. 
His vile and puny fingers churned 
Our world about that sang and burned 
A while as never world before. 
Ide had unlatched an icy door, 
And let the winter in once more. 
To kill a man is a woeful thing, 
But he who lays a hand on spring, 
Clutches the first bird by its throat 
And throttles it in the midst of a note; 
Whose breath upon the leaf-proud tree 
Turns all that wealth to penury; 
Whose touch upon the first shy flower 
Gives it a blight before its hour; 
Whose craven face above a pool 
That otherwise were clear and cool, 
Transforms that running silver dream 
Into a hot and sluggish stream 
Thus better fit to countenance 
His own corrupt unhealthy glance, 
Of all men is most infamous; 
His deed is rank and blasphemous. 
The erstwhile warm, the short time sweet, 
Spring now lay frozen at our feet. 
Say then, why say nothing more 
Except I had to close the door; 
And this man’s leer loomed in the way. 
The air began to sting; then say 
There was this branch; I struck; he fell; 
There’s holiday, I think, in hell." 
Outside the night began to groan 
As heavy feet crushed twig and stone 
Beating a pathway to our door; 
A thin noise first, and then a roar 
More animal than human grew 
Upon the air until we knew 
No mercy could be in the sound. 
"Quick, hide," I said. I glanced around 
But no abyss gaped in the ground. 
But in the eyes of fear a twig 
Will seem a tree, a straw as big 
To him who drowns as any raft. 
So being mad, being quite daft, 
I shoved him in a closet set 
Against the wall. This would but let 
Him breathe two minutes more, or three, 
Before they dragged him out to be 
Queer fruit upon some outraged tree. 
Our room was in a moment lit 
With flaring brands; men crowded it— 
Old men whose eyes were better sealed 
In sleep; strong men with muscles steeled 
Like rods, whose place was in the fiel.; 
Striplings like Jim with just a touch 
Of down upon the chin; for such 
More fitting a secluded hedge 
To lie beneath with one to pledge 
In youth’s hot words, immortal love. 
These things they were not thinking of; 
"Lynch him! Lynch him!" O savage cry, 
Why should you echo, "Crucify!" 
One sought, sleek-tongued, to pacify 
Them with slow talk of trial, law, 
Established court; the dripping maw 
Would not be wheedled from its prey. 
Out of the past I heard him say, 
"So be it then; have then your way; 
But not by me shall blood be spilt; 
I wash my hands clean of this guilt." 
This was an echo of a phrase 
Uttered how many million days Gone by? 
   Water may cleanse the hands 
But what shall scour the soul that stands 
Accused in heaven’s sight? 
                           "The Kid." 
One cried, "Where is the bastard hid?" 
"He is not here." 
                 It was a faint 
And futile lie. 
                 "The hell he ain’t; 
We tracked him here. Show us the place, 
Or els...." 
                 He made an ugly face, 
Raising a heavy club to smite. 
I had been felled, had not the sight 
[Illustration]
Of all been otherwise arraigned. 
Each with bewilderment unfeigned 
Stared hard to see against the wall 
The hunted boy stand slim and tall; 
Dream-born, it seemed, with just a trace 
Of weariness upon his face, 
He stood as if evolved from air; 
As if always he had stood there... 
What blew the torches’ feeble flare 
To such a soaring fury now? 
Each hand went up to fend each brow, 
Save his; he and the light were one, 
A man by night clad with the sun. 
By form and feature, bearing, name, 
I knew this man. He was the same 
Whom I had thrust, a minute past, 
Behind a door,— and made it fast. 
Knit flesh and bone, had like a thong, 
Bound us as one our whole life long, 
But in the presence of this throng, 
He seemed one I had never known. 
Never such tragic beauty shone 
As this on any face before. 
It pared the heart straight to the core. 
It is the lustre dying lends, 
I thought, to make some brief amends 
To life so wantonly cut down. 
The air about him shaped a crown 
Of light, or so it seemed to me, 
And sweeter than the melody 
Of leaves in rain, and far more sad, 
His voice descended on the mad, 
Blood-sniffing crowd that sought his life, 
A voice where grief cut like a knife: 
"I am he whom you seek, he whom 
You will not spare his daily doom. 
My march is ever to the tomb, 
But let the innocent go free; 
This man and woman, let them be, 
Who loving much have succored me." 
And then he turned about to speak 
To me whose heart was fit to break, 
"My brother, when this wound has healed, 
And you reap in some other field 
Roses, and all a spring can yiel.; 
Brother (to call me so!) then prove 
Out of your charity and love 
That I was not unduly slain, 
That this my death was not in vain. 
For no life should go to the tomb 
Unless from it a new life bloom, 
A greater faith, a clearer sight, 
A wiser groping for the light." 
He moved to where our mother stood, 
Dry-eyed, though grief was at its flood, 
"Mother, not poorer losing one, 
Look now upon your dying son." 
Her own life trembling on the brim, 
She raised woe-ravaged eyes to him, 
And in their glances something grew 
And spread, till healing fluttered through 
Her pain, a vision so complete 
It sent her humbly to his feet 
With what I deemed a curious cry, 
"And must this be for such as I?" 
Even his captors seemed to feel 
Disquietude, an unrest steal 
Upon their ardor, dampening it, 
Till one less fearful varlet hit 
Him across the mouth a heavy blow, 
Drawing a thin, yet steady flow 
Of red to drip a dirge of slow 
Finality upon my heart. 
The end came fast. Given the start 
One hound must always give the pack 
That fears the meekest prey whose back 
Is desperate against a wall, 
They charged. I saw him stagger, fall 
Beneath a mill of hands, feet, staves. 
And I like one who sees huge waves 
In hunger rise above the skiff 
At sea, yet watching from a cliff 
Far off can lend no feeblest aid, 
No more than can a fragile blade 
Of grass in some far distant land, 
That has no heart to wrench, nor hand 
To stretch in vain, could only stand 
With streaming eyes and watch the play. 
[Illustration]
There grew a tree a little way 
Off from the hut, a virgin tree 
Awaiting its fecundity. 
O Tree was ever worthier Groom 
Led to a bride of such rare bloom? 
Did ever fiercer hands enlace 
Love and Beloved in an embrace 
As heaven-smiled-upon as this? 
Was ever more celestial kiss? 
But once, did ever anywhere 
So full a choir chant such an air 
As feathered splendors bugled there? 
And was there ever blinder eye 
Or deafer ear than mine? 
                         A cry 
So soft, and yet so brimming filled 
With agony, my heart strings thrilled 
An ineffectual reply, — 
Then gaunt against the southern sky 
The silent handiwork of hate. 
Greet, Virgin Tree, your holy mate! 
No sound then in the little room 
Was filtered through my sieve of gloom, 
Except the steady fall of tears, 
The hot, insistent rain that sears 
The burning ruts down which it goes, 
The futile flow, for all one knows 
How vain it is..that ever flows. 
I could not bear to look at her 
There in the dark; I could not stir 
From where I sat, so weighted down. 
The king of grief, I held my crown 
So dear, I wore my tattered gown 
With such affection and such love 
That though I strove I could not move. 
But I could hear (and this unchained 
The raging beast in me) her pained 
And sorrow-riven voice ring out 
Above the spirit’s awful rout, 
Above the howling winds of doubt, 
How she knew Whom she traveled to 
Was judge of all that men might do 
To such as she who trusted Him. 
Faith was a tower for her, grim 
And insurmountable; and death 
She said was only changing breath 
Into an essence fine and rare. 
Anger smote me and most despair 
Seeing her still bow down in prayer. 
"Call on Him now," I mocked, "and try 
Your faith against His deed, while I 
With intent equally as sane, 
Searching a motive for this pain, 
Will hold a little stone on high 
And seek of it the reason why. 
Which, stone or God, will first reply? 
Why? Hear me ask it. He was young 
And beautiful. Why was he flung 
Like common dirt to death? Why, stone, 
Must he of all the earth atone 
For what? The dirt God used was homely 
But the man He made was comely. 
What child creating out of sand, 
With puckered brow and intent hand, 
Would see the lovely thing he planned 
Struck with a lewd and wanton blade, 
[Illustration]
Nor stretch a hand to what he made, 
Nor shed a childish, futile tear, 
Because he loved it, held it dear? 
Would not a child’s weak heart rebel? 
But Christ who conquered Death and Hell 
What has He done for you who spent 
A bleeding life for His content? 
Or is the white Christ, too, distraught 
By these dark sins His Father wrought?" 
I mocked her so until I broke 
Beneath my passion’s heavy yoke. 
My world went black with grief and pai.; 
My very bitterness was slain, 
And I had need of only sleep, 
Or some dim place where I might weep 
My life away, some misty haunt 
Where never man might come to taunt 
Me with the thought of how men scar 
Their brothers here, or what we are 
Upon this jmost accursed star. 
Not that sweet sleep from which some wake 
All fetterless, without an ache 
Of heart or limb, but such a sleep 
As had raped him, eternal, dee.; — 
Deep as my woe, vast as my pain, 
Sleep of the young and early-slain. 
My Lycidas was dead. There swung 
In all his glory, lusty, young, 
My Jonathan, my Patrocles, 
(For with his death there perished these )v 
And I had neither sword nor song, 
Only an acid-bitten tongue, 
Fit neither in its poverty 
For vengeance nor for threnody, 
Only for tears and blasphemy. 
Now God be praised that a door should creak, 
And that a rusty hinge should shriek. 
Of all sweet sounds that I may hear 
Of lute or lyre or dulcimer, 
None ever shall assail my ear 
Sweet as the sound of a grating door 
I had thought closed forevermore. 
Out of my deep-ploughed agony, 
I turned to see a door swing free; 
The very door he once came through 
To death, now framed for us anew 
His vital self, his and jio other’s 
Live body of the dead, my brother’s. 
Like one who dreams within a dream, 
Hand at my throat, lest I should scream, 
I moved with hopeful, doubting pace 
To meet the dead man face to face. 
"Bear witness now unto His grace"; 
I heard my mother’s mounting word, 
"Behold the glory of the Lord, 
His unimpeachable high seal. 
Cry mercy now before Him; kneel, 
And let your heart’s conversion swell 
The wonder of His miracle." 
I saw; I touched; yet doubted him; 
My fingers faltered down his slim 
Sides, down his breathing length of limb. 
Incredulous of sight and touch, 
"No more," I cried, "this is too much 
For one mad brain to stagger through." 
For there he stood in utmost view 
Whose death I had been witness to; 
But now he breathed; he lived; he walked; 
His tongue could speak my name; he talked. 
He questioned me to know what art 
Had made His enemies depart. 
Either I leaped or crawled to where 
I last had seen stiff on the air 
The form than life more dear to me; 
But where had swayed that misery 
Now only was a flowering tree 
That soon would travail into fruit. 
Slowly my mind released its mute 
Bewilderment, while truth took root 
In me and blossomed into light: 
"Down, down," I cried, in joy and fright, 
As all He said came back to me 
With what its true import must be, 
"Upon our knees and let the worst, 
Let me the sinfullest kneel first; 
O lovely Head to dust brought low 
More times than we can ever know 
Whose small regard, dust-ridden eye, 
Behold Your doom, yet doubt You die; 
O Form immaculately born, 
Betrayed a thousand times each morn, 
As many times each night denied, 
Surrendered, tortured, crucified! 
Now have we seen beyond degree 
That love which has no boundary; 
Our eyes have looked on Calvary." 
No sound then in the sacred gloom 
That blessed the shrine that was our room 
Except the steady rise of praise 
To Him who shapes all nights and days 
Into one final burst of sun; 
Though with the praise some tears must run 
In pity of the King’s dear breath 
That ransomed one of us from death. 
The days are mellow for us now; 
We reap full fields; the heavy bough 
Bends to us in another land; 
The ripe fruit falls into our hand. 
My mother, Job’s dark sister, sits 
Now in a corner, prays, and knits. 
Often across her face there flits 
Remembered pain, to mar her joy, 
At Whose death gave her back her boy. 
While I who mouthed my blasphemies, 
Recalling now His agonies, 
Am found forever on my knees, 
Ever to praise her Christ with her, 
Knowing He can at will confer 
Magic on miracle to prove 
And try me when I doubt His love. 
If I am blind He does not see; 
If I am lame He halts with me; 
There is no hood of pain I wear 
That has not rested on His hair 
Making Him first initiate 
Beneath its harsh and hairy weight. 
He grew with me within the womb; 
He will receive me at the tomb. 
He will make plain the misty path 
He makes me tread in love and wrath, 
And bending down in peace and grace 
May wear again my brother’s face. 
Somewhere the Southland rears a tree, 
(And many others there may be 
Like unto it, that are unknown, 
Whereon as costly fruit has grown). 
It stands before a hut of wood 
In which the Christ Himself once stood — 
And those who pass it by may see 
Nought growing there except a tree, 
But there are two to testify 
Who hung on it... we saw Him die. 
Its roots were fed with priceless blood. 
It is the Cross; it is the Rood.

THE OLD SHORE ROAD 
 
 The old shore road is shady 
 
 And the old shore road is cool, 
 And often I stop by the wayside 
 
 When driving my old black mule; 
 And on my way to heaven 
 
 When heavy is my load, 
 The Lord Almighty done take me 
 
 Along the old shore road. 
 
 This old mule that I'm driving 
 
 He go up many a hill, 
 And long he tug on the traces 
 
 And pull with a right good will; 
 But now he's in the stable 
 
 And empty is my load, 
 For the Lord above done take me 
 
 Along the old shore road. 
 
 And the air is like a garden 
 
 And the air is pure and sweet, 
 And my legs are getting rested 
 
 And my shoes don't hurt my feet; 
 And I travel on delighted 
 
 Without a whip or goad, 
 For the Lord done make it easy 
 
 Along the old shore road. 
 
 I watch the big white breakers 
 
 Come rolling on the shore, 
 But they can't harm this n*****. 
 
 Whose days are nearly o'er; 
 Along life's lingering highway 
 
 I am on to that abode, 
 Where the Lord done say my place is 
 
 Along the old shore road. 
 
 I know they call this heaven 
 
 The milk and honey land. 
 Where the Lord am gwine to meet me 
 
 And take me by the hand; 
 But all I want in heaven 
 
 Is a place to rest my load, 
 And a place to drive my mule in 
 
 Along the old shore road. 
 
Plantation Pieces, Camp Meeting Songs 
 
 MAMMY AND ME 
 
 Whose face is smiling 
 When her face I see, 
 
 No one but Mammy 
 Mammy and me. 
 
 Who sees the flower 
 The sky and the tree, 
 
 No one but Mammy 
 Mammy and me. 
 
 Who sings the songs 
 
 Of the wind and the bee, 
 No one but Mammy 
 
 Mammy and me. 
 
 Who calls me black 
 As I laugh in my glee, 
 
 No one but Mammy 
 Mammy and me. 
 
 And who sleeps together 
 
 Who can it be, 
 But this pickaninny 
 
 And Mammy and me. 
 
 RING THAT BELL 
 
 Ring that bell Elijah 
 
 And open wide the door, 
 
 Oh ring that bell Elijah 
 
 And ring that bell once more. 
 
 I want my folks to hear it 
 I want my folks to know, 
 
 There is a place to go to 
 
 And the bell tells where to go. 
 
 Oh ring that bell Elijah 
 And open wide the door. 
 
 Oh ring that bell Elijah 
 
 And ring that bell once more. 
 
 WHAT YOU GWINE TO DO 
 
 What you gwine to do, dear friends, 
 
 What you gwine to do. 
 When the Lord his flaming angel sends 
 
 And asks your soul of you; 
 And if your soul is not prepared 
 
 To meet the judgment too, 
 What you gwine to do, dear friends, 
 
 What you gwine to do. 
 What you gwine to do, dear friends, 
 
 What you gwine to do, 
 When all the graves give up their dead 
 
 Before your frightened view; 
 And when the Lord appears on high 
 
 In all his anger too, 
 The Lord have mercy on your soul 
 
 For what you gwine to do. 
 
 SEND THAT CHARIOT DOWN 
 
 Lord my soul is waiting 
 Soon the trump will sound. 
 
 Lord don't keep me waiting 
 Send that chariot down. 
 
 Send that chariot down Lord 
 Send that chariot down. 
 
 Lord don't keep me waiting 
 Send that chariot down. 
 
 I saw a big white angel 
 The angel made a sound, 
 
 I know it brought the message 
 Send that chariot down. 
 
 And when the day is breaking 
 And when the day rolls round, 
 
 You will find me waiting 
 Send that chariot down. 
 
 ON THE ROAD TO CHARLESTON 
 
 On the road to Charleston 
 
 I met a darky coon, 
 Driving on to Charleston 
 
 Beneath a summer noon; 
 He whistled and he shouted 
 
 These snatches of a tune, 
 Upon the road to Charleston 
 
 Beneath the summer noon. 
 
 I started out this morning 
 
 To go to market town, 
 To sell a load of cotton 
 
 For my neighbor, Mr. Brown; 
 The road is like an arrow 
 
 And measured by the rule, 
 It was only forty paces 
 
 But a million for a mule. 
 
 I might get there tomorrow 
 
 I might get there tonight. 
 The way this mule am going 
 
 Am sure a sorry sight ; 
 I'm jerking on the bridle 
 
 And whipping like a fool. 
 But what's the use of talking 
 
 To a turtle like a mule. 
 
 I've got to go to market 
 
 I've got to go to town, 
 I've got to sell this cotton 
 
 For my neighbor, Mr. Brown; 
 It's just around the corner 
 
 Beyond the little school, 
 A half a dozen paces 
 
 But a million for a mule. 
 
 WHERE THE COTTON USED TO GROW 
 
 Dinah my heart is weeping 
 
 Dinah my heart is sad, 
 Dinah 'twould make me happy 
 
 Dinah 'twould make me glad; 
 Once more while I'm living 
 
 Once more there to go. 
 Back to dear old Dixie 
 
 Where the cotton used to grow. 
 
 Dinah no more I'm weeping 
 
 Dinah no more I'm sad, 
 Dinah my heart is happy 
 
 Dinah my heart is glad; 
 For the good Lord tells me 
 
 And the Lord must know, 
 We're going back to Dixie 
 
 Where the cotton used to grow. 
 
 RABBIT IN THE POT 
 
 Yum ! Yum ! Yum ! 
 
 What is it I got? 
 Nothing but a rabbit 
 
 And a rabbit in the pot. 
 
 Yum ! Yum ! Yum ! 
 
 But that fire am hot, 
 And that's the way to keep it 
 
 With a rabbit in the pot. 
 
 Yum ! Yum ! Yum ! 
 
 I know a savory spot, 
 It is a rabbit cooking 
 
 And a rabbit in a pot. 
 
 Yum! Yum! Yum! 
 
 And if I had a yacht, 
 I wouldn't go a sailing 
 
 With that rabbit in the pot. 
 
 Yum! Yum! Yum! 
 
 But don't it take a lot 
 Of waiting, waiting, waiting 
 
 For a rabbit in a pot. 
 
 Yum ! Yum ! Yum ! 
 
 What a joy I got, 
 I guess I'm going crazy 
 
 With that rabbit in the pot. 
  
 
 THE OLD STEAMBOAT 
 
 Sambo went to market 
 
 To sell a little pig, 
 He had a dozen chickens 
 
 And he had a balky rig; 
 He got down near the river 
 
 With his chickens and his shoat, 
 Toot! Toot! goes the whistle 
 
 Of the old steamboat. 
 
 His mule he got excited 
 
 And started on a run, 
 And sped along the highway, 
 
 Like a bullet from a gun ; 
 Scattered were the chickens 
 
 And scattered was the shoat, 
 Toot! Toot! frightened by the whistle 
 
 Of the old steamboat. 
 
 And Sambo started clubbing 
 
 That critter of a mule, 
 Until he had him humbled 
 
 And looking like a fool; 
 And then he caught the chickens 
 
 And then he caught the shoat. 
 Toot! Toot! frightened by the whistle 
 
 Of the old steamboat. 
 
 LILY SNOWDROP 
 
 They called her Lily Snowdrop 
 
 Because she dressed in white, 
 But Lily was a negress 
 
 And such a monstrous sight; 
 The fat was on her biceps 
 
 The fat was on her arms, 
 And fatty was her wrinkles 
 
 And fatty was her charms. 
 
 And talk about your blackness. 
 
 No blackness of the night 
 Could equal Lily Snowdrop 
 
 When she was dressed in white; 
 And someone seeing Lily 
 
 Said, bless her giant soul. 
 If I had two Lily Snowdrops 
 
 I'd have a ton of coal. 
 
 THE MINSTREL MAN 
 
 The minstrel man has come to town 
 All the gentlemen please sit down, 
 Why does a chicken — and then he began 
 Haw! haw! haw! the minstrel man. 
 
 The minstrel man he wears a vest 
 Just like a sunset in the west, 
 Mr. Tambo — and then he began 
 Haw! haw! haw! the minstrel man. 
 
 The minstrel man has a funny face 
 
 And a big sunflower in its place, 
 
 And the smile is broad in the lily white ban' 
 
 Of this haw! haw! haw! minstrel man. 
 
 The minstrel man is on the end 
 
 Or in the middle of the minstrel men, 
 
 And who is happier in all the Ian' 
 
 Than this ragtime, jazz, jazz, minstrel man. 
 
 MISTAH JONES 
 
 Mistah Jones went courting 
 
 Went courting sporty too. 
 He always carried a flower 
 
 And a razor in his shoe; 
 The flower am for my lady 
 
 Said Mistah Jones so spare, 
 And the razor am for any niggah 
 
 Who happens to be there. 
 
 Mandy was his sweetheart 
 
 A most engaging miss, 
 Who seemed all light and sunshine 
 
 And who seemed all joy and bliss; 
 But when I think of that razor 
 
 And of that miss so fair, 
 I wouldn't want to call on Mandy 
 
 When Mistah Jones is there. 
 
 OLD JIM CROW 
 
 Old Jim Crow went walking 
 
 Went walking do\vn the street, 
 He had a clumsy manner 
 
 And he had big clumsy feet; 
 But when he started dancing 
 
 And dancing Juba too, 
 You never saw such prancing 
 
 As old Jim could do. 
 
 He cavorted through the two-step 
 
 He cavorted up and down, 
 He scrambled through the one-step 
 
 And tumbled round and round; 
 And wherever there is dancing 
 
 The dancing old and new, 
 You never saw such dancing 
 
 As Old Jim Crow did do. 
 
 The bobolink and the blackbird 
 
 They looked on in amaze. 
 To see the funny jumping 
 
 Of Jim Crow and his ways; 
 And to this day in Dixie 
 
 They say it's very true. 
 There is no more such dancing 
 
 As Old Jim Crow could do. 
 
 THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO THERE 
 
 The darkies shout and the darkles sing 
 The Lord he is my heavenly King, 
 And when I die on an angel's wing 
 That's why I want to go there. 
 
 I want to go there, I want to go there, 
 I want to go there, I want to go there, 
 I want to go there, I want to go there, 
 That's why I want to go there. 
 
 I want to go there on a Sunday morn 
 I want to hear Massa blow his horn, 
 I want to see the blackbirds in the corn 
 That's why I want to go there. 
 
 I want to go where there is no snow 
 I want to go where the daisies grow, 
 I want to go where I can go 
 That's why I want to go there. 
 
 I want to hear the flipping of the angel's wing 
 I want to see Jesus and my King, 
 I want to shout and I want to sing 
 That's why I want to go there. 
 
 I want to go there for the judgment day 
 I want to hear the darkies sing and pray, 
 I want the jubilee to start right away 
 That's why I want to go there. 
 
 FIDDLIN' JOE 
 
 Playing fiddles Sah is fine 
 
 And I will show you how I play mine, 
 
 At the dances where I go 
 
 Said a darky Fiddlin' Joe. 
 
 First you rosin up your bow 
 Then you fix your fiddle so, 
 Tuck your fiddle under your chin 
 And that's the way you first begin. 
 
 Scrape and scrape, and scrape the strings 
 Till that blamed old fiddle sings, 
 But don't forget the way you begin 
 Is to tuck your fiddle under your chin. 
 
 Back and forth you rub the bow 
 
 Up and down you make it go, 
 
 But the way you first begin 
 
 Is to tuck your fiddle under your chin. 
 
 Make that catgut squeal and howl 
 Saw that fiddle near your jowl, 
 But to do all this you first begin 
 By tucking your fiddle under your chin. 
 
 Up and down you let it rave 
 Bend that bow just like a wave, 
 But don't forget when you first begin 
 To tuck your fiddle under your chin. 
  
 
 Old Dan Tucker and the 'Downs 
 These am the tunes that go the rounds, 
 And all seem sweeter when you begin 
 With that fiddle under your chin. 
 
 And when the dance is nearly through 
 I give a flourish one or two, 
 But I always play when I first begin 
 By tuckin' mah fiddle under mah chin. 
 "BURY MAH BANJO BY MAH SIDE" 
 
 Rastus sang and Rastus played 
 All the tunes that ever were made, 
 But he had one tune that was his pride 
 "Bury mah banjo by my side." 
 
 He played the dances and the fairs 
 He played his banjo everywheres, 
 And people laughed and people cried 
 At "Bury mah banjo jjy mah side." 
 
 At last old Rastus he got sick 
 
 And off he went to heaven quick. 
 
 And in the grave where his bones reside 
 
 They buried his banjo by his side. 
 
 THE OLD COLORED MINISTER 
 
 Old and gray and bowed with years 
 The old colored minister in the church appears, 
 And he raises his eyes, and he raises his hand 
 And the congregation rise, and the congregation 
 
 stand, 
 And the minister preach, and the minister pray 
 World without end from day to day. 
 
 And he tells the story of the long lost sheep 
 And his hearers smile, and his hearers weep. 
 And the congregation rise, and the congregation 
 
 stand ; 
 And the congregation sing with the book in the hand ; 
 And the minister preach, and the minister pray 
 World without end from day to day. 
 
 And the old and young, and the young and old 
 
 Hear from his lips those words of gold. 
 
 And the congregation rise, and the congregation 
 
 stand ; 
 And they feel the clasp of his trembling hand ; 
 And the minister preach, and the minister pray 
 World without end from day to day. 
 
 And he preaches the sermon over the dead 
 And he says the words that makes them wed, 
 And the congregation rise, and the congregation 
 
 stand ; 
 Doing the will of the Lord's command, 
 And the minister preach, and the minister pray 
 World without end from day to day. 
 
 And he heals the wound and he dries the tear 
 
 And he comforts the sorrow and the fear, 
 
 And the congregation rise, and the congregation 
 
 stand ; 
 The happiest church in that happiest land ; 
 And the minister preach, and the minister pray 
 World without end from day to day. 
 
 'WAY DOWN SOUTH IN GEORGIA 
 
 Come to the land of the golden moon 
 Come to the land where the darkies croon 
 
 'Way down south in Georgia 
 
 In Georgia — in Georgia 
 There's where I was born, on a Sunday morn 
 
 'Way down south in Georgia. 
 
 Come to the land of the Dixie rose 
 
 Come to the land where the cotton grows — 
 
 'Way down south in Georgia. 
 
 In Georgia — in Georgia 
 There's where I was born, on a Sunday morn 
 
 'Way dow^n south in Georgia. 
 
 Come to the land where they sing and dance 
 Come to the land where the maids entrance 
 
 'Way down south in Georgia 
 
 In Georgia — in Georgia 
 There's where I was born, on a Sunday morn 
 
 'Way down south in Georgia. 
  
 
 THE CHARIOT FORD 
 
 We came to a river 
 
 Too wide to cross, 
 And we couldn't, and we couldn't 
 
 And we couldn't get across; 
 And they sent for a chariot 
 
 The river to ford. 
 And they came right away 
 
 With a chariot ford; 
 But oh, good Lord, 
 
 How can I afford, 
 To ever get across 
 
 In a chariot ford. 
 
 The river am wide 
 
 And the river am deep, 
 And I want to get across 
 
 Where I can sleep; 
 And the Lord he came 
 
 And the Lord he smiled, 
 And he said, my chillun, 
 
 The waters am mild; 
 So take your place 
 
 And hurry up aboard, 
 For a good old ride 
 
 In the chariot ford. 
 
 So when you come to Jordan 
 
 And you can't get across, 
 Never mind chillun 
 
 There's a way to cross; 
 The Lord am good 
 
 And the Lord am kind, 
 And a way over Jordan 
 
 He am sure to find; 
 And keep right on 
 
 In the promise of the Lord, 
 And wait till you come 
 
 To a chariot ford. 
 
 THE WHITE ANGELS 
 
 Mammy, am the angels always white? 
 Lisped a little chile one bedtime night, 
 And the Mammy answered in affright 
 Hush ! my chile, and say good night. 
 
 Mammy why am the angels always white? 
 Said the little chile one bedtime night. 
 And the Mammy answered in affright 
 Hush ! my chile, and say good night. 
 
 For if the angels am always white 
 I'll never be an angel in your sight, 
 And the Mammy answered in affright 
 Hush ! my chile, and say good night. 
 
 BULLFROG PONE 
 
 Down by the gum tree 
 
 Sitting on a log, 
 Croaking all the evening 
 
 Lived a big frog. 
 
 Along came a n***** 
 Who picked up a stone, 
 
 With visions of a supper 
 And a bullfrog pone. 
 
 The frog saw the n***** 
 
 And the frog saw the stone, 
 
 But he wasn't quite ready 
 For a bullfrog pone. 
 
 He made a great dive 
 
 And he made a great splash. 
 
 And good bye n***** 
 To that bullfrog hash. 
 THE n***** AND THE MULE 
 
 Hee! Hee! Hee! 
 
 Haw! Haw! Haw! 
 I'm laughing like a jackass 
 
 And I'm laughing like a fool. 
 For down in Alabama 
 
 It always is the rule, 
 That where you see a n***** 
 
 You will always see a mule. 
 
 Hee! Hee! Hee! 
 
 Haw! Haw! Haw! 
 I'm laughing like a jackass 
 
 And laughing like a fool, 
 'Tis taught in every college 
 
 And taught in every school, 
 That where you see a n***** 
 
 You will always see a mule. 
 
 THE WILD EYED COON 
 
 Ah done got a razor 
 
 Ah done want to sell. 
 Ah done needs the money 
 
 Ah doan' feel so well; 
 
 The fo'ks all say ahm crazy 
 And they take me for a loon, 
 
 But ah wouldn't sell a razor 
 To a wild eyed coon. 
 
 Ah may be looking shabby 
 But ah done know mah biz, 
 
 Fo' I hear that Rastus saying 
 He am gwine to get his; 
 
 The fo'ks all say ahm crazy 
 And they take me for a loon, 
 
 But ah wouldn't sell a razor 
 To a wild eyed coon. 
 
 HARD TIMES COME AGAIN NO MORE 
 
 How happy are the darkies 
 As they sing this chorus o'er, 
 Hard times come again no more. 
 The cabin has a shutter 
 And the cabin has a door; 
 Hard times come again no more. 
 There's a curtain in the window, 
 And a carpet on the floor, 
 Hard times come again no more. 
 There's plenty in the cupboard 
 And there's credit at the store; 
 Hard times come again no more. 
 And they sing aloud their praises, 
 For the blessing ever more 
 That hard times, hard times 
 Come again no more. 
 
 JONAH AND THE WHALE 
 
 The ark is coming up the road. 
 Said Hannah Jordan, with a load, 
 And I guess I'll get aboard 
 Before that river I have to ford ; 
 And besides said Hannah pale 
 I don't like that Jonah Whale, 
 And if that ark done try to balk 
 Ah can jes' get out and walk. 
 
 THE PLACARD 
 
 Who wants to buy, I want to sell 
 A swayback mule sound and well, 
 Warranted broke and does not kick, 
 Willing to work and never sick; 
 And Sambo read and scratched his head 
 And pondered long and then he said. 
 The man that wrote that no kick rule 
 Is talking bull and not a mule. 
 
  GIN 
 
 Rastus to the Doctor went 
 
 With a lot of ills and not a cent, 
 
 And this is the way he told the physician 
 
 How he felt in his condition ; 
 
 Ah can't sleep and ah can't eat 
 
 And ah can't stand upon mah feet, 
 
 Mah tongue am hot mah feet am cool 
 
 And ah done feel jes' like a fool; 
 
 The doctor heard his mournful cries 
 
 The doctor saw his bleary eyes, 
 
 Saw his symptoms and grimaces, 
 
 Saw the effects and the traces; 
 
 And raising his finger in the air 
 
 Knde him heed his warning there, 
 
 Foh 3'ou done got, said Doctor Grin, 
 
 A very bad case of Niggrr Gin. 
 
 THE DARKY 
 
 A piece of night and for his eyes 
 Two clouds from out the morning skies, 
 And for his mouth and for his laugh 
 A water-melon cut in half ; 
 Live today and lack tomorrow 
 All of joy and naught of sorrow, 
 Half a homily, half a joke 
 There's your darky, there's your smoke. 
 
 THAT HOUN' DAWG 
 
 That houn' dawg, said Rastus Jones, 
 Done send a chill through all mah bones, 
 Ahm jes' a walking round and round 
 And I always shiver when I hear that houn'. 
 He bays at the moon, and he bays at the tree, 
 He bays at the shadow and he bays at me, 
 Ahm jes' a walking round and round 
 But I got to shiver when I hear that houn'. 
 
 TOTIN' ALONG 
 
 Old black Joe went ambling along 
 
 And old black Joe has a happy old song, 
 
 The hill is long that I got to climb 
 
 But I'll keep on climbing all the time; 
 
 And all you got to do when the world goes wrong 
 
 Is to keep on totin', totin' along. 
 
 The burden is heavy that my back must bear 
 
 But the Lord done keep me in His care, 
 
 And the Lord is good and the Lord is kind 
 
 And rest and shade I am sure to find; 
 
 And all you got to do when the world goes wrong 
 
 Is to keep on totin', totin' along. 
 
 OH LORD NOT ME 
 
 Who stole the woodpile and the axe? 
 
 Who turns the turtles on their backs? 
 
 Who had some chickens in some funny looking sacks ? 
 Oh Lord, not me. 
 
 Who went fishing and stepped on a toad? 
 Who saw a bat fly over the road ? 
 Who didn't have a rabbit's foot when the hen crowed ? 
 Oh Lord, not me. 
 
 ANTE-BELLUM 
 
 Ante-Bellum I knew her well 
 
 And Parson Jones began to tell 
 
 The virtues of an old black Mammy 
 
 Who had a son whose name was Sammy, 
 
 Who had a niece whose name was Ethel 
 
 Who went to Sunday school in Bethel; 
 
 And so the Parson strung his lyre 
 
 Until he proved himself a liar, 
 
 For Ante-Bellum means befoh' 
 
 All that trouble called the wah. 
 
 THE CAKE WALK 
 
 Just see them darkies walking 
 Just watch the steps they take, 
 
 For the darkies all are walking 
 And walking for that cake. 
 
 The feathers on them ladies 
 Was something fine and grand, 
 
 And every colored gentlemen 
 Had a flower in his hand. 
 
 Such strutting and such perking 
 No peacock bird could make, 
 
 Like them happy darkies 
 
 When walking for that cake. 
 
 What cared they for dem tight shoes? 
 
 What if their corns did ache? 
 They am just too happy 
 
 Walking for that cake. 
 
 And Rastus scraped the fiddle 
 And Rastus called the turns, 
 
 And the way that fiddle whistled 
 He sure his money earns. 
 
 All hands on the carpet. 
 
 Every one go in pairs, 
 Step lively round the corners 
 
 And look out for dem chairs. 
 
 Up and down the parlor 
 
 I thought their necks would break, 
 The way them darkies held their heads 
 
 Walking for that cake. 
 
 SOUTHERN LULLABY 
 
 There is a Southern lullaby 
 
 And I'm going to sing the tune, 
 
 Big eye — bright eye 
 Shining like the moon. 
 
 I heard it on the Swanee 
 
 In the merry month of June, 
 
 Big eye — bright eye 
 Shining like the moon. 
 
 And I was watching Hannah 
 As she ladeled with a spoon, 
 
 Big eye — bright eye 
 Shining like the moon. 
 
 And she was softly cooing 
 The music of the croon, 
 
 Big eye — bright eye 
 Shining like the moon. 
 
 For down in Alabama 
 'Tis the asset of the coon, 
 
 Big eye — bright eye 
 Shining like the moon. 
  
 
 POMPEYS' PLEA 
 
 Tide me over the winter, 
 
 Tide me over the snow, 
 Send me back to Georgia 
 
 Where the winds don't blow; 
 I don't like the winter, 
 
 I don't like the cold. 
 For I'm only a poor old n***** 
 
 Who's growing very old. 
 
 The crow he got his feathers 
 
 In the wing and tail, 
 But scanty are my garments 
 
 And my shoes are frail; 
 So send me back to Georgia 
 
 Where the winds don't blow, 
 For I'm only a poor old n***** 
 
 Who has nowheres to go. 
 
 THEN YOU'LL COME BACK TO DIXIE 
 
 You said good bye to Dixie, 
 
 You bade her your adieu. 
 You left the blackbirds singing 
 
 And you left the skylarks too; 
 But when the north winds gather 
 
 And tumble round their snows. 
 Then you'll come back to Dixie 
 
 Where the sweet magnolia grows. 
 
 The snowy fields of cotton 
 
 And the sunny fields of corn, 
 No longer could enchant you 
 
 To the place where you was born; 
 But when your heart grows weary 
 
 And you sigh to see the rose, 
 Then you'll come back to Dixie 
 
 Where the Swanee river flows. 
 
 CORNFIELDS 
 
 The cornfields, the cornfields 
 
 Waving in the air. 
 Waving in the sunshine 
 
 And waving green and fair; 
 How I love the cornfields 
 
 How I love to go 
 Back to Louisiana, 
 
 Where the cornfields grow. 
 
 The comfieUs, the cornfields 
 
 I never can forget, 
 And often in my fancy 
 
 I am toiling in them yet; 
 And when my days are over 
 
 I want my soul to go 
 Back to Louisiana, 
 
 Where the cornfields grow. 
 
 BEFO' DE WAH 
 
 I was bo'n Sah in a cabin, 
 A cabin very small, 
 It didn't have a chimney 
 And it didn't have a hall; 
 But it had a big sunflower 
 
 Growing round the door. 
 And this was long ago, Sah, 
 
 Long befo' de wah. 
 Long befo' the wah, Sah, 
 Long befo' de wah. 
 The darkies they were singing, 
 The banjos they were ringing, 
 Down in old Virginia 
 Long befo' de wah. 
 
 I was bo'n down in the Souf, Sah, 
 Upon a little farm. 
 The days were bright and sunny 
 And the nights were bright and warm ; 
 The rabbit and the turtle 
 Would come around the door. 
 And this was long ago, Sah, 
 Long befo' de wah. 
 Long befo' de wah, Sah, 
 Long befo' de wah, 
 Down in old Virginny 
 I was a pickaninny, 
 Long befo' de wah, Sah, 
 Long befo' de wah. 
 
 WHAT FOH I DUNNO 
 
 I done get arrested 
 
 What foh, I dunno. 
 I wasn't near that hen house 
 
 When that rooster crow; 
 I didn't see that rooster 
 
 When that rooster crow, 
 But I done get arrested 
 
 What foh, I dunno. 
 
 I done get arrested 
 
 What foh, I dunno. 
 I wasn't near that wood pile 
 
 When dem breezes blow; 
 I didn't see that wood pile 
 
 When dem breezes blow, 
 I done get arrested 
 
 But what foh, I dunno. 
 
 SERENADE 
 
 Smiling moon, rising soon 
 Over the hills, over the rills 
 
 And I'm thinking of my Dinah, 
 And the smiling silvery moon. 
 
 Smiling moon, silvery moon 
 All the flowers, scent the bowers 
 
 And I'm thinking of my Dinah, 
 And the smiling silvery moon. 
 
 Smiling moon, silvery moon 
 
 Twitter the birds, low the herds 
 
 And I'm thinking of my Dinah, 
 And the smiling silvery moon. 
 
 Smiling moon, silvery moon 
 The nights ajar, I see the star 
 
 And I long to be with Dinah, 
 And the smiling silvery moon. 
 
 DINAH 
 
 Dinah! Dinah! I see Dinah there. 
 Dinah ! Dinah ! Dinah I declare 
 All the boys are jealous 
 
 See them pull their hair. 
 When my Dinah's coming 
 
 And I see Dinah there. 
 
 Dinah ! Dinah ! just see Dinah's hair. 
 Dinah ! Dinah ! Dinah is so fair, 
 All the boys are jealous 
 
 They could almost swear, 
 When my Dinah's coming 
 
 And I see Dinah there. 
 
 DINAH MINE 
 
 Dinah! Dinah is my gal. 
 You can have your Sue or Sal, 
 But the one that pleases me 
 Is my Dinah that you see. 
 
 Dinah! Dinah! Dinah mine. 
 Her eyes sparkle, her eyes shine, 
 And where a gal so choice and fine 
 Like my Dinah, Dinah, mine. 
 
 She is plump and she is fair 
 With coal black eyes and coal black hair, 
 And on her hand she is going to wear 
 A big gold ring that I'll put there. 
 
 Dinah! Dinah! Dinah mine. 
 Her eyes sparkle, her eyes shine. 
 And where a gal so choice and fine 
 Like my Dinah, Dinah mine. 
 
 MANDY'S PARTY 
 
 Mandy gave a party 
 
 The fame of which was wide, 
 And Mandy did the cooking 
 
 For that was Mandy's pride; 
 There were chickens, there were possums, 
 
 There was hoe cake and a boar, 
 And Mandy says I'm coming 
 
 When I lock that kitchen door. 
 
 The smell of all that kitchen 
 
 Pervaded every room, 
 Just like a sweet potato 
 
 In sweet potato bloom ; 
 The dancers all were merry, 
 
 The revelry galore, 
 And Mandy says I'm coming 
 
 When I lock that kitchen door. 
 
 And Mandy in the kitchen 
 
 Was busy as the bees, 
 Baking crispy biscuits 
 
 And shelling juicy peas; 
 The call went round for Mandy 
 
 And went round more and more 
 But Mandy says I'm coming 
 
 When I lock this kitchen door. 
 
 At last the supper's ready, 
 
 At last the work is done, 
 And raging fast and furious 
 
 Went on the n***** fun ; 
 The coons began to grumble 
 
 And the coons began to jaw, 
 But Mandy says I'm coming 
 
 When I lock this kitchen door. 
 
 For Mandy knew them n*****s 
 
 And Mandy knew them coons, 
 She knew them possums baking 
 
 Would start them n***** croons; 
 So* let them n*****s holler. 
 
 Said Mandy with a roar. 
 And tell them coons I'm coming 
 
 When I lock this kitchen door. 
 
 AUNT JEMIMA 
 
 Aunt Jemima laughed so loud 
 She looked just like a thunder cloud, 
 Her mouth would open like a door 
 And then there came an awful roar ; 
 It used to all the babies wake, 
 It used to all the ceiling shake. 
 And I'm laughing, laughing yet 
 At Aunt Jemima's cheeks so wet. 
 
 SHUFFLIN' FEET 
 
 There's music in the banjo, 
 
 There's music soft and sweet, 
 When playing in the evening 
 
 To rest the weary feet; 
 And when the banjo's playing 
 
 And playing soft and sweet, 
 I can't keep from shufflin' 
 
 From shufflin' these old feet. 
 
 The rheum am in my fingers 
 
 And the rheum am in my feet, 
 And I can only hobble 
 
 When I go along the street ; 
 And when the harps of Zion 
 
 Send out their tones so sweet, 
 I can't keep from shufflin' 
 
 From shufflin' these old feet. 
 
 WHEN I GET OVER THE RIVER 
 
 When I get over the river, 
 
 That river deep and wide, 
 How great will be my pleasure. 
 
 How great will be my pride ; 
 The angels will be standing 
 
 For every one to see, 
 And when I get over the river 
 
 Moses will meet me. 
 
 When I get over the river 
 
 And reach old Jordan's shore, 
 I want to see my loved ones 
 
 That all have gone before; 
 And there amid that gathering 
 
 For every one to see 
 Moses w'xW be standing 
 
 And waiting there for me. 
 
 UNCLE TOM 
 
 Uncle Tom is singing 
 
 And singing soft and low, 
 His hair is almost silvered 
 
 And his steps are very slow ; 
 And still he keeps on singing 
 
 As he treads among the gorse, 
 One more ribber, one more ribber 
 
 One more ribber to cross. 
 
 The day is bright and cheerful 
 
 The sky shows not a cloud, 
 And Uncle Tom keeps singing 
 
 In the vineyard with the crowd; 
 And still he keeps on singing 
 
 With all his vocal force, 
 One more ribber, one more ribber 
 
 One more ribber to cross. 
 
 FOLK SONG 
 
 White folks, white folks 
 Want to shine, 
 Drink a lot of whiskey, 
 Drink a lot of wine; 
 And white folks, white folks 
 Don't take it ill, 
 Ef when you talk — 
 I done keep still. 
 
 White folks, white folks 
 You am proud. 
 You done talk big 
 And you done talk loud ; 
 And white folks, white folks 
 Don't take it ill, 
 Ef when you talk — 
 I done keep still. 
 
 White folks, white folks 
 Make a lot of noise. 
 Talk about their pleasures. 
 Talk about their joys; 
 And white folks, white folks 
 Don't take it ill, 
 Ef when you talk — 
 I done keep still. 
 
 White folks, white folks 
 Where am your brains, 
 Doing all these things 
 Fo' yo' pains; 
 And white folks, white folks 
 Don't take it ill, 
 Ef when you talk — 
 I done keep still. 
 
 THE POOR WHITE MAN 
 
 The poor white man. 
 The poor white man, 
 Living up north 
 In a cold white land; 
 Never saw a banjo 
 Or heard a n***** band, 
 And I'd rather be a n***** 
 Than a po' white man. 
 The poor white man, 
 The poor white man, 
 Never saw a possum 
 Or a possum in a pan. 
 Never had a chicken 
 Or a razor in his hand, 
 And I'd rather be a n***** 
 Than a po' white man. 
 
 POSSUM PIE 
 
 Carve that possum, Hannah 
 
 Carve that possum soon, 
 For the pan am ready 
 
 And here am the spoon; 
 Carve him in de quarters, 
 
 Carve him in de thigh, 
 And carve that possum, Hannah 
 
 Foh a possum pie. 
 
 Carve that possum, Hannah 
 
 Carve the fat and lean, 
 For that meat am the juiciest 
 
 That I have ever seen; 
 Carve him in de quarters. 
 
 Carve him in de thigh, 
 And carve that possum, Hannah 
 
 Foh a possum pie. 
 
 THE GRINNING n***** MAN 
 
 When you make a hoe cake 
 
 You w^ant to make it quick. 
 Stir it in the basin 
 
 And stir it with a stick; 
 Bake it in the oven. 
 
 Bake it in a pan. 
 And then just watch the antics 
 
 Of that grinning n***** man. 
 
 When you eat a hoe cake 
 
 You want to eat it hot, 
 Take it from the oven 
 
 And eat it on the spot; 
 Hold it in the middle, 
 
 Hold it in your han' 
 And then just watch the antics 
 
 Of that grinning n***** man. 
 
 I'M THERE 
 
 Every different n***** 
 
 Has a different taste, 
 You can see it in their manner, 
 
 You can see it in their face; 
 Some might want a turtle. 
 
 Some might want a bear. 
 But when you say rabbit 
 
 I'm there. 
 
 Possum is too juicy, 
 
 Chicken is too dry, 
 Watermelon lovely 
 
 When they take the eye; 
 Some might want a turkey, 
 
 Some might want a hare, 
 But when you say rabbit 
 
 I'm there. 
 
 THE DARKY'S PRAYER 
 
 Oh, Massa of all Massas 
 
 Where the ribber Jordan flows, 
 Where the darkies all am welcome 
 
 In their poor and ragged clothes; 
 Dis darky am a pleading, 
 
 His lips done move in prayer, 
 And help a poor old n***** 
 
 Till he done get there. 
 
 I ask no more of Massa 
 
 Than Massa give to me, 
 He made my labor plenty 
 
 And he made my labor free; 
 The vi^ay am long and weary, 
 
 The load am hard to bear, 
 And help a poor old n***** 
 
 Till he done get there. 
 
 For all of Massa's kindness 
 
 And Massa's ways to men, 
 My heart am full of glory 
 
 And my lips will say amen ; 
 But Jordan and the shadows 
 
 Are sometimes hard to bear. 
 And help a poor old n***** 
 
 Till he done get there. 
 
 OLD BLACK JOE 
 
 Old Black Joe went hobbling, 
 Went hobbling down the street, 
 
 Rags upon his shoulders 
 And rags upon his feet. 
 
 He told a simple story 
 
 That I would have you know, 
 The gospel of the toiler 
 
 And the gospel of the hoe. 
 
 Bo'n down in the Souf, Sah, 
 
 Bo'n befo' de wah, 
 I never knew my Mother 
 
 Nor what my life was for. 
 
 They talk about the bible 
 And where I've got to go, 
 
 But I couldn't learn the bible 
 When I had to learn the hoe. 
 
 And when I get to heaven 
 Where any weeds done grow, 
 
 I guess the Lord will take me 
 If I show the Lord my hoe. 
 
 And as a finite judgment 
 On creeds and things below, 
 
 I want no better argument 
 Than old Black Joe. 
 
 WE'LL ALL GO TO HEAVEN WHEN 
 WE DIE 
 
 Chillun don't worry, 
 
 Chillun don't fret, 
 When the sky am dark 
 
 And the ground am wet; 
 The Lord am good 
 
 And we've only got to try 
 And we'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die. 
 
 We'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die, 
 We'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die; 
 The Lord am good 
 
 And we've only got to try, 
 And we'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die. 
 
 Look to the east 
 
 And look to the west, 
 And look to the place 
 
 That you think best; 
 For somewhere in the heaven 
 
 There's a rainbow in the sky, 
 And we'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die. 
 
 We'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die, 
 We'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die; 
 For somewhere in the heaven 
 
 There's a rainbow in the sky, 
 And we'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die. 
 
 The night may come 
 
 And the day be late, 
 And all you got to do 
 
 Is to trust and wait ; 
 So chillun don't weep 
 
 And chillun don't sigh, 
 For we'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die. 
 
 We'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die, 
 We'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die; 
 So chillun don't weep 
 
 And chillun don't sigh. 
 For we'll all go to heaven 
 
 When we die. 
 
 WHEN THJE LORD SAY COME 
 
 Glory, Hallelujah! 
 
 To the blood of the lamb, 
 I've got a new song 
 
 And the song is a psalm ; 
 Get out of the way, 
 
 Get off the track. 
 Get off old devil — 
 
 Get off my back; 
 The Lord am a comin' 
 
 For I hear the big drum 
 And I'm gwine up to heaven 
 
 When the Lord say come. 
 
 Glory, Hallelujah! 
 
 To the blood of the lamb, 
 Glory, Hallelujah! 
 
 What a saint I am; 
 That old devil — 
 
 He gave me a frown. 
 But I turned to that devil 
 
 And I knocked him down; 
 I'm gwine to Canaan 
 
 And Canaan gwine to hum, 
 When I see the Lord comin' 
 
 And the Lord say come. 
 
 THE DARKY DRUM AND FIFE CORPS 
 
 The darky drum and fife corps 
 
 Is marching on parade, 
 The avenue is crowded 
 
 And the favorite tune is played ; 
 And the pride of all that company 
 
 Was not the major tall — 
 But it was the big bass drummer 
 
 And his little sheepskin ball. 
 
 Boom, boom, boom ! 
 
 Boom, boom, boom! 
 Bumpety, bumpety. 
 
 Boom, boom, boom ; 
 See those elbows flying : 
 
 Dispersing every gloom, 
 Bumpety, bumpety, 
 
 Boom, boom, boom. 
 
 The darky drum and fife corps 
 
 Is marching on parade, 
 The windows all are opened 
 
 By the smiling man and maid; 
 And the pride of all that company 
 
 Was not the major tall — 
 But it was the big bass drummer 
 
 And his little sheepskin ball. 
 
 WHILE JORDAN'S IN THE WAY 
 
 Roll on, thou fiery pillar 
 
 Roll on, roll on your way, 
 Roll on in the night time 
 
 And roll on in the day ; 
 The Lord am all around us. 
 
 It cannot come this way, 
 Oh Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 While Jordan's in the way. 
 
 Roll on, thou fiery pillar 
 
 Roll on, roll on your way. 
 It cannot touch the righteous 
 
 Who to the Lord will pray; 
 It cannot touch the holy, 
 
 It cannot come this way. 
 Oh Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 While Jordan's in the way. 
 
 CANAAN 
 
 Canaan thou art lovely, 
 
 Canaan of my dreams, 
 Thy mountains and thy valleys. 
 
 Thy woodlands and thy streams; 
 Canaan's over the river, 
 
 Canaan's very near; 
 I can't go to Canaan 
 
 But the Lord sends Canaan here. 
  
 
 Cooling are thy waters, 
 
 Thy pastures rich abound, 
 Thy flocks and fleece are legion 
 
 And always to be found; 
 Canaan's over the river, 
 
 Canaan's very near; 
 I can't go to Canaan 
 
 But the Lord sends Canaan here. 
 
 PUSH DEM CLOUDS AWAY 
 
 Elijah I is coming, 
 
 I'se coming in the morn, 
 Fse coming in a hurry 
 
 And I'se coming to the horn; 
 So get the chariot ready, 
 
 I'se coming there to stay. 
 And when you see me comin' 
 
 Oh push dem clouds away. 
 
 The Jordan am a rollin' 
 
 And smoky am the plain, 
 And I'se afraid of lightnin' 
 
 And I'se afraid of rain; 
 So when you see me comin' 
 
 I'se coming there to stay, 
 So have that chariot ready 
 
 And push dem clouds away. 
 
 CHRISTMAS AM A COMIN' 
 
 All the day long — 
 
 I worry and fret, 
 Something goes wrong 
 
 That I cannot forget 
 But go away raincloud, 
 
 Go away fly — 
 Christmas am a comin' 
 
 And I ain't going to cry. 
 
 All the day long — 
 
 I worry and fret, 
 Something gwine to happen 
 
 Or I get in debt. 
 But go away trouble 
 
 Go away sigh — 
 Christmas am a comin' 
 
 And I ain't going to cry. 
 
 Christmas am a comin', 
 
 Comin' on the way, 
 Christmas am a comin' 
 
 And tomorrow am the day. 
 There's a possum in the cellar 
 
 And a porker in the sty — 
 Christmas am a comin' 
 
 And I ain't going to cry. 
 
 THE BREAK DOWN 
 
 My old wagon, chillun, 
 Isn't verj' sound, 
 It been a good old wagon 
 But it done broke down. 
 
 The axle's out of order 
 And the wheels won't go round, 
 It been a good old wagon 
 But it done broke down. 
 
 It trundled in the cotton 
 And it trundled into town, 
 It been a good old wagon 
 But it done broke down. 
 
 And now I have to sell it 
 To my neighbor, Mr. Brown, 
 It been a good old wagon 
 But it done broke down. 
 
 And I hope a better master 
 My poor old wagon's found, 
 For it been a good old wagon 
 Before it done broke down. 
 
 DEM SHOES 
 
 Look here n***** at my feet, 
 Ain't them lovely and ain't them sweet? 
 Ah jes' bought 'em, they're only two's 
 And ah gave a dollar for dem shoes. 
 Look here n***** what you see, 
 All dem folks done look at me. 
 Glory! Glory! I need the blues 
 For I'se too happy in dem shoes. 
 
 THE OLD MULE'S TAIL 
 
 That old mule's tail 
 
 Am a swinging to and fro, 
 Swinging like a pendulum 
 
 And swinging high and low. 
 And I thought it was a windstorm 
 
 And I thought it was a gale 
 When riding with my Dinah 
 
 And that old mule's tail. 
 
 That old mule's tail 
 
 Am a swinging to and fro, 
 Swinging when I'm coming 
 
 And swinging when I go. 
 And I thought he was a threshing 
 
 And I thought it was a flail 
 When riding with my Dinah 
 
 And that old mule's tail. 
 
 THE GOOD, GOOD NEWS 
 
 Go away hunger — 
 
 Knockin' on the door, 
 Go away cold wind 
 
 Come around no more. 
 Tell all your folks 
 
 The good good news — 
 Moses am a comin' 
 
 And we'll all have shoes. 
 
 Barefoot in the summer — 
 
 Barefoot in the cold. 
 Barefoot when you're married 
 
 And barefoot when you're old. 
 But tell all the folks 
 
 The good good news — 
 Moses am a comin' 
 
 And we'll all have shoes. 
 
 THE SONG OF DAVID 
 
 David was a great big King — 
 Sing a song of David, 
 
 His crow^n was gold, and so was his ring- 
 Sing a song of David. 
 
 He took a stone and he took a sling — 
 Sing a song of David, 
 
 And a great big giant down he bring — 
 Sing a song of David; 
 
 Oh glory to the heavenly King 
 Singing the song of David. 
 
 SOMETHING FOR THE BLUES 
 
 I met a yaller n***** 
 
 And he was looking very sad, 
 And he told me of his sorrow 
 
 And the feelings that he had; 
 He wasn't lacking money 
 
 And he wasn't lacking news, 
 But still he wanted something 
 
 That was something for the blue§, 
  
 
 Something for the blues, 
 
 Something for the blues, 
 He was wanting something, 
 
 Something for the blues; 
 It might have been a possum 
 
 Or it might have been new shoes, 
 But he was wanting something 
 
 That was something for the blues. 
 
 Just then there started playing 
 
 A minstrel n***** band, 
 And it was playing Dixie 
 
 Way down in Dixieland ; 
 And that n***** very happy 
 
 Began to shout and muse, 
 The band is playing something 
 
 That is something for the blues. 
 
 Something for the blues, 
 
 Something for the blues. 
 He was wanting something, 
 
 Something for the blues; 
 It might have been a possum 
 
 Or it might have been new shoes, 
 But he was wanting something 
 
 That was something for the blues. 
 
 DIXIE FAR AWAY 
 
 I hear the banjos playing 
 
 And I hear the banjos ring, 
 I hear the darkies dancing 
 
 And I hear the darkies sing; 
 And my heart is ever longing 
 
 For that ne'er forgotten day, 
 When I was down in Dixie 
 
 In Dixie far away. 
 
 The essence of Ole Virginny 
 
 And the fancy buck and wing, 
 The banjos still are playing 
 
 While the darkies dance and sing; 
 My steps are slow and feeble 
 
 And my hair is turning gray, 
 But my heart is ever longing 
 
 For the Dixie far away. 
 
 REFRAINS 
 
 I want to be an angel 
 Dwelling in the sky, 
 
 I want to be an angel, 
 An angel when I die. 
  
 
 Daniel and the lion 
 
 In the lion's den, 
 I want to be like Daniel 
 
 In the lion's den. 
 
 I want to be Elijah 
 
 And have a saint's reward, 
 I want to be Elijah 
 
 Elijah of the Lord. 
 
 GLORY 
 
 I met old Satan walking 
 
 And Satan wanted to know, 
 All about my business 
 
 And where I was going to go; 
 And I told old Satan smiling 
 
 When he wanted to know my name, 
 Oh, I told him, Hallelujah! 
 
 That Glory was my name. 
 
 And now when I go walking 
 
 Old Satan don't come near, 
 He knows I am converted 
 
 And that my skirts are clear; 
 And when old Satan smiling 
 
 Wants to know your name, 
 Oh tell him, Hallelujah! 
 
 That Glory is your name. 
 
 SATAN AND THE SHEEP 
 
 The Lord he is our Shepherd 
 And we're the Lord's black sheep, 
 Cut along old Satan 
 Cut along bo-peep. 
 
 A wolf got in among us 
 When we were fast asleep, 
 Cut along old Satan 
 Cut along bo-peep. 
 
 But the Lord he sent to guard us 
 An angel in our sleep, 
 Cut along old Satan 
 Cut along bo-peep. 
 
 And now we praise the Shepherd 
 That we are still his sheep, 
 Cut along old Satan 
 Cut along bo-peep. 
 
 HOT CORN 
 
 Hot corn! hot corn! 
 
 Hot corn, good and hot, 
 Hot corn on the fire 
 
 And hot corn in the pot; 
 Come and get your hot corn 
 
 Come and get it, and 
 You won't begrudge the nickel 
 
 To the hot corn man. 
 
 Hot corn ! hot corn ! 
 
 Hot corn, good and hot, 
 Hot corn on the fire 
 
 And boih'ng in the pot; 
 Just you try that hot corn — 
 
 Just you try it, and 
 You won't begrudge the nickel 
 
 To the hot corn man. 
 
 Hot corn! hot corn! 
 
 Hot corn, good and hot, 
 Hot corn on the fire 
 
 And steaming in the pot; 
 There's the salt and pepper — 
 
 Eat it where you stand, 
 And you won't begrudge the nickel 
 
 To the hot corn man. 
 
 Hot corn! hot corn! 
 
 Hot corn from the south, 
 Growing in the garden 
 
 And melting in the mouth. 
 See me shuck that hot corn — 
 
 See me shuck it, and 
 You won't begrudge the nickel 
 
 To the hot corn man. 
 
 WHEN YOU GET BACK TO DIXIE 
 
 I'm going back to Dixie, 
 
 My heart is so forlorn, 
 I'm going back to Dixie, 
 
 To Dixie in the morn; 
 And when you get back to Dixie, 
 
 To Dixie fond and true, 
 Tell all my friends in Dixie 
 
 That I am coming too. 
 
 I'm going back to Dixie, 
 
 To Dixie and the corn, 
 I'm going back to Dixie, 
 
 For I was Dixie born; 
 And when you get back to Dixie 
 
 And Dixie's skies so blue. 
 Tell all my friends in Dixie 
 
 That I am coming too. 
 
 THE OLD BLACK MULE 
 
 Whoa dar, Snowball, 
 
 You old black fool, 
 Said old Tom the driver 
 
 To his old black mule. 
 
 Your harness am easy 
 And your load am light, 
 
 So quit your kicking 
 And all that spite. 
 
 I done got my troubles 
 With dem dar wheels. 
 
 Without keeping out of 
 The reach of yo' heels. 
 
 And den such manners 
 
 I nebber did see, 
 Your feet am a showing 
 
 Their corns to me. 
 
 You ain't an angel 
 
 And you can't fly. 
 So quit your kicking 
 
 Dem heels so high. 
 
 You am so homely 
 
 And so forlorn, 
 A pity poor Snowball 
 
 You ebber was born. 
  
 
 I jes' done gib you 
 
 All yo' oats, 
 And you get frighten' 
 
 At dem steamboats. 
 
 But that am the market 
 
 Whar this cotton am gwine, 
 And say, Mr. Snowball, 
 
 Whar you gvvine? 
 
 And whar am the money 
 For to pay the rents? 
 
 And say, Mr. Snowball, 
 Whar am yo' sense? 
 
 Ah done declare, 
 
 Mah gooodness grace, 
 
 If dat old Snowball 
 Done bus' a trace. 
 
 And jes' for dat 
 
 An' breakin' dem hames, 
 I done call you 
 
 All dem names. 
 
 See dat Snowball, 
 See dat mule. 
 
 Whoa dar. Snowball, 
 You big ole fool. 
 
 You'll get a good supper 
 And j^ou'll get a good bed, 
 
 So quit that fooling 
 
 Or I'll break your head. 
 
 And the mule thinking wisely 
 
 Of Tom and his quip, 
 Went off sedately 
 
 To the touch of his whip. 
 
 And sitting by the wayside 
 Of the thicket and the pool, 
 
 I heard Tom lecture 
 His Old Black Mule. 
 
 SPINDLES 
 
 Dat ole Spindles was a mule, 
 A graduate of every mule school. 
 Golly! golly! how dat feels — 
 Look out Spindles fo' dem heels. 
 
 He kick at the fly, an' he kick at the moon. 
 He kick too late, an' he kick too soon — 
 And golly! golly! how dat feels — 
 'Ware ole Spindles, 'ware dem heels. 
 
 Ef yo' want to kick, an' kick so high — 
 Just push dem clouds out from de sky 
 But golly! golly! how it feels — 
 To get in touch wif Spindles' heels. 
 
 LICKIN' THE GOAT 
 
 I saw a big n***** 
 
 Butting a mule, 
 He butted him hot 
 
 And he butted him cool; 
 And I heard him say 
 
 As he took off his coat, 
 "You might lick a n***** 
 
 But you can't lick a goat." 
 
 He butted him black 
 
 And he butted him blue, 
 And he almost butted 
 
 That mule in two; 
 And I heard him say 
 
 As he put on his coat, 
 "You might lick a n***** 
 
 But you can't lick a goat." 
 
 The mule he stand 
 
 And the mule he feel 
 Jes' like a prisoner 
 
 When he steal; 
 And he ought to know better 
 
 When he leave his cote. 
 Not to go fooling 
 
 With a Billy Goat. 
 
 GRACIOUS HOW THAT CHILE 
 DONE GROW 
 
 Gracious! how that chile done grow, 
 Said a snowball white as snow, 
 To a sunflower all aglow — 
 Gracious how that chile done grow. 
 Once it was so wee and small 
 
 Now it is so big and tall, 
 
 I am like a mite below — 
 
 Gracious ! how that chile done grow. 
 
 LAMENTING THE CORN 
 
 Rastus limped along the street, 
 Something the matter with his feet, 
 He wheezed, he shuffled and he grunted 
 Just like a boar by hunters hunted ; 
 And to a friend who asked the reason 
 Of such distress in such a season, 
 Rastus all his pity scorns 
 And simply tells about his corns; 
 My corns am big, my corns am hot 
 And corns am all mah feet has got, 
 And if these corns doan' stop their achin' 
 Ah'U surely think mah feet am bakin'; 
 And as I heard his lamentations 
 I thought of cornfields and plantations. 
 For Rastus had a pair of feet 
 Not often seen upon the street; 
 And if his corns hurt to their size 
 I don't wonder at his cries. 
  
 
 MAMMY I LOVE YOU 
 
 Mammy I love you, 
 With your red bandanna, 
 And Chloe or Hannah, 
 Mammy I love you. 
 
 Mammy I love you 
 With your face so vv^rinkled, 
 And your rings that tinkled, 
 Mammy I love you. 
 
 Mammy I love you, 
 Jemina or Dinah, 
 My heart will shrine her. 
 Mammy I love you. 
 
 Mammy I love you. 
 The Blacker the better, 
 With your iron fetter, 
 Mammy I love you. 
 
 Mammy I love you, 
 With your kinky hair, 
 And your feet so bare, 
 Mammy I love you. 
 
 THE GENTLEMEN OF THE BONES 
 
 Be seated merry gentlemen, 
 
 The minstrel show is on, 
 The coons are in regalia 
 
 And their dancing shoes they don ; 
 And then you hear announcing 
 
 In the most alluring tones, 
 Mr. Sam is tambo 
 
 And Mr. Tarn is bones. 
 
 The sunflowers are in blossom, 
 
 The sunflowers are in bloom. 
 And sweet the balmy incense 
 
 That floats around the room; 
 They dance just like the crickets 
 
 Would dance upon the stones. 
 But there's nothing like the playing 
 
 Of the gem'men with the bones. 
 
 They do the jig and tw^o-step, 
 
 They do the fancy reel, 
 They're dancing with the toe-step 
 
 And dancing with the heel; 
 Up and down they're rolling, 
 
 You can almost hear the groans. 
 And see the eyelids quivering 
 
 Of the gem'men with the bones. 
 
  
 They never stop for succor, 
 
 They never pause for rest, 
 The show devolves upon them 
 
 And they're giving up their best; 
 The tambos tinkle merrily 
 
 And sweet the banjo's tones, 
 But there's nothing like the playing 
 
 Of the gem 'men of the bones. 
 
 THE MISSISSIPPI 
 
 Roll on, Mississippi — 
 
 Roll on, wide and deep, 
 I see the shadows coming 
 
 And I see the shadows creep; 
 There are windings there are turnings, 
 
 There's the shallow and the ford. 
 Rush by, river, rush by — 
 
 Rush by to the Lord. 
 
 Roll on, Mississippi — 
 
 Roll on, between your banks. 
 There are cabins in your forests 
 
 And cornfields on your flanks ; 
 The darkies' work is over, 
 
 At rest the hoe and gourd. 
 Rush by, river, rush by — 
 
 Rush by to the Lord. 
 
 ANGEL SOUND THAT TRUMP 
 
 Angel! sound that trump, 
 
 That great good day proclaim, 
 
 When I shall stand before the Lord 
 And hear his blessed name. 
 
 Angel! sound that trump, 
 And sound it loud and clear, 
 
 Which tells the judgment day is come 
 And Christ the Lord is here. 
 
 And angel sound that trump! 
 
 For I want to hear the sound, 
 Which tells the Lord is near at hand 
 
 And Moses done come round. 
 
 DON'T YOU WANT TO GO ALONG 
 
 A mighty tide is rising 
 
 And it's rising very fast. 
 And the ark is ready waiting 
 
 And it's waiting to the last; 
 It's going down the river, 
 
 Don't you want to go along? 
 And there's room for every sinner 
 
 If you'll only go along. 
 
 The tide is on the river 
 
 And the tide is on the shore, 
 And the ark is rocking, rocking 
 
 Like it never did before; 
 It's going down the river. 
 
 Don't you want to go along? 
 And there's room for every sinner 
 
 If you'll only go along. 
 
 THE GOLDEN STAIR 
 
 When I go up that golden stair 
 Them golden slippers I am gwine to wear. 
 And all my friends will be waiting there 
 When I go up that golden stair. 
 
 That golden stair, that golden stair, 
 When I go up that golden stair. 
 Them golden slippers I am gwmt to wear 
 When I go up that golden stair. 
 
 Moses will be waiting there 
 
 And Canaan show its face so fair. 
 
 And them golden slippers I am gwine to wear 
 
 When I go up that golden stair. 
 
 That golden stair, that golden stair, 
 When I go up that golden stair, 
 Them golden slippers I am gwine to wear 
 When I go up that golden stair. 
  
 
 DOWN UPON THE LEVEE 
 
 Down upon the levee 
 The moon is all aglow, 
 
 Down upon the levee 
 Where the coons all go. 
 
 The river seems to slumber 
 So peaceful is its flow, 
 
 Down upon the levee 
 Where the coons all go. 
 
 There goes a dusky maiden 
 With her banjo and her beau, 
 
 Down upon the levee 
 Where the coons all go. 
 
 There is music, there is dancing 
 With the fiddle and the bow, 
 
 Down upon the levee 
 Where the coons all go. 
 
 And if I was in Dixie 
 
 The first place I would go, 
 
 Would be down upon the levee 
 Where the coons all go. 
 
 RAGTIME 
 
 Ragtime, ragtime, 
 
 That am a happy time, 
 Down around the levee 
 
 In the evening time; 
 The banjos am a playing 
 
 And the feet begin to chime, 
 Down around the levee 
 
 In the evening time. 
 
 Ragtime, ragtime. 
 
 That am a happy time, 
 Down around the levee 
 
 In the evening time; 
 The fiddles am a playing 
 
 And the song begins to chime, 
 Down around the levee 
 
 In the evening time. 
 
 Ragtime, ragtime, 
 
 That am a happy time, 
 Down around the levee 
 
 In the evening time ; 
 The boys are bright and jolly 
 
 And the girls are just sublime, 
 Down around the levee 
 
 In the evening time. 
 
 RASTUS JOHNSON'S IDYL TO HIS MULE 
 
 Git ap, git ap, 
 
 You lazy old mule, 
 You never went to college 
 
 And you never went to school; 
 You haven't any manners 
 
 And you're nothing but a fool, 
 Git ap, git ap. 
 
 You lazy old mule. 
 
 Git ap, git ap, 
 
 You lazy old mule, 
 I could hit you with a hammer 
 
 And hit you with a stool; 
 You never keep a promise 
 
 And you never keep a rule. 
 Git ap, git ap. 
 
 You scalawag mule. 
 
 Git ap, git ap, 
 
 You lazy old mule, 
 I done a lot of swearing 
 
 Since I had that mule; 
 You're nothing but a nuisance 
 
 And you're nothing but a fool, 
 Git ap, git ap. 
 
 You lazy old mule. 
 
 Git ap, git ap, 
 
 You scandalous old mule, 
 I'll never get to heaven 
 
 If I drive that mule; 
 You're nothing but a n***** 
 
 And you're nothing but a fool, 
 And Rastus Johnson ended 
 
 His idyl to his mule. 
 
 DOING THE BEST HE CAN 
 
 The mule he got a very big load 
 
 And he go up the hill, 
 And he pull, and pull, and pull, and pull 
 
 But that wagon done keep still; 
 The driver start to get his whip, 
 
 The mule he saw his hand, 
 And he say to that driver, hold that whip 
 
 Foh ahm doing the best ah can. 
 
 You might help lighten up mah load 
 
 By walking up this hill. 
 You might done let me rest a bit 
 
 When I done do your will. 
 The flies done bite me mos' to death, 
 
 Mah shoes burn in the sand. 
 And when you start to use that whip 
 
 Ahm doing the best ah can. 
 
 WHEN THE COONS ALL COME AROUND 
 
 Down in old Virginia 
 
 My father had a farm, 
 The nights were long and lovely 
 
 And the days were bright and warm; 
 And of all the grinning faces 
 
 That ever made a sound, 
 You ought to hear the laughing 
 
 When the coons all came around. 
 
 The morning had its labor, 
 
 The cotton fields their share, 
 And evening had its pleasure 
 
 When we were gathered there; 
 And of all the fancy jumping 
 
 That ever stirred the ground, 
 You ought to see the dancing 
 
 When the coons all came around. 
 
 And dulcet was the music 
 
 And dulcet were the tones, 
 And dulcet was the banjo 
 
 And dulcet were the bones; 
 And of all the happy hours 
 
 That ever did abound. 
 That happiest were the happiest 
 
 When the coons all came around. 
 
 GLORY! HALLELUJAH! 
 
 When I die I want to go 
 
 With all the darkies that I know, 
 
 Glory! Hallelujah! 
 
 Moses come and take my hand 
 Lead me to that better land, 
 Glory! Hallelujah! 
 
 Over the river, over the ford, 
 Over the darkness to my Lord, 
 Glory! Hallelujah! 
 
 Let me then my Jesus see, 
 Let him smile his smile on me. 
 Glory! Hallelujah! 
 
 Let the bells of heaven ring, 
 Let the angels start to sing, 
 Glory! Hallelujah! 
 
 My old Mammy I shall see, 
 Ephraim too will welcome me, 
 Glory! Hallelujah! 
 
 For when I die I want to go 
 With all the darkies that I know. 
 Oh Glory Hallelujah! 
  
 
 MANDY 
 
 I know a buxom 
 
 And Mandy's her name, 
 Her eyes are like opals, 
 
 Her teeth are the same; 
 Her lips are like rubies 
 
 Now scarlet now flame, 
 I know a buxom 
 
 And Mandy's her name. 
 
 I know a buxom 
 
 And Mandy's her name, 
 From magnolia and moonlight 
 
 And Dixie she came; 
 Her voice is like music. 
 
 Her smile is the same, 
 I know a buxom 
 
 And Mandy's her name, 
 
 THE n***** 
 
 The Lord He made the n***** 
 And He made him in the night, 
 
 He made him for the sunshine 
 And He made him for the light. 
 
 He took a piece of cotton 
 And He stuck it in his eye. 
 
 And you'll always see a n***** 
 Like a cloud roll by. 
 
 The Lord He made the n***** 
 And He made him in the night, 
 
 He made him for the sunshine 
 And He made him for the light. 
 
 He made him in a hurry 
 
 And He made him to be heard, 
 And you'll always hear a n***** 
 
 And he's singing like a bird. 
 
 A REAL GOOD TIME 
 
 "There's going to be a party," 
 
 Said Mr. Jackson Jones, 
 A rather swarthy gentleman 
 
 And almost skin and bones; 
 "There'll be music, there'll be dancing. 
 
 There'll be chicken fat and prime, 
 And sharpen up your razors 
 
 Fo' a real good time. 
 
 "Ahm going to that party, 
 
 And ahm going to meet a coon. 
 
 And settle a lil' argument 
 Right in that party room; 
 
 There'll be music, there'll be dancing, 
 There'll be chicken fat and prime, 
 
 A.nd bring along your razors 
 Fo' a real good time." 
 
 TAKE THAT FIDDLE ALONG 
 
 Old Moses he am calling, 
 
 He am calling me away, 
 I hear it all the night time 
 
 And I hear it all the day. 
 
 I don't mind this here journey, 
 
 It will not be for long, 
 But when I take this journey 
 
 I want my fiddle along. 
 
 I ain't got much to leave you, 
 
 I gave my soul away, 
 But that fiddle was my company 
 
 Through many a weary day. 
 
 And when I go to heaven, 
 
 It will not now be long, 
 I'll leave all else behind me 
 
 But I want that fiddle along. 
 
 The ague and the rheumatiz 
 Have done got in my bones, 
 
 And the only medicine that I know 
 Am that ole fiddle's tones. 
 
 And when the harps and seraphs 
 
 Are where they all belong. 
 Oh then I'll be so happy 
 
 To have that fiddle along. 
 
 I know its old and wormy 
 
 And the bow and strings not strong, 
 But while I am in heaven 
 
 I want that fiddle along. 
 
 And mebbe that ole Moses 
 When I tune up a song, 
 
 Will say I'm glad old Ephraim 
 You took that fiddle along. 
 
 GWINE AWAY FOR CHRISTMAS 
 
 Dear friends I'se got to tell you, 
 
 I'se got to tell the news, 
 Fse gwine away for Christmas 
 
 And I'se gwine to have new shoes. 
 
 The Lord he saw me walking 
 And the Lord he says to me, 
 
 Just come and see me Christmas 
 And see what you will see. 
 
 And the Lord done give his blessing 
 And the Lord done give his hand, 
 
 And he make Ole Dinah happy 
 To see that Christmas land. 
 
 So I'se gwine away for Christmas, 
 Gwine to that happy shore, 
 
 I'se gwine away for Christmas 
 And I won't come back no more. 
 
 THE PARSON'S SERMON 
 
 "Brethren and Sistern," said Parson Jones, 
 
 Raising his voice to its loudest tones, 
 
 "The collection box am a gwine aroun' 
 
 And some of that noise has a funny soun'; 
 
 It am just like a beggar with his pleas and groans, 
 
 The thanks am many and so am the bones. 
 
 "Some fo'ks I know am quite so mean 
 
 The collection box am nebber seen, 
 
 But whar there's money lost and foun' 
 
 There's them n*****s nosin' aroun' ; 
 
 I doan' want, I done tole you befo' 
 
 And keep your ban's off the pahsons door. 
 
 "The Lawd done love a cheerful giver, 
 
 The Lawd done love, but it make me shiver, 
 
 How it gwine to be without a cent 
 
 A pahson gwine to preach and pay his rent ; 
 
 Ef you tell me, can tell me true 
 
 What am the meaning of dem I. O. U. 
 
 "Aigs am aigs, and shells am shells 
 
 An' weddin' bells am weddin' bells, 
 
 But I done say this pahson am through 
 
 With fricassed liver, and roustabout stew; 
 
 It's time for the pahson to have a chicken dinner 
 
 And for that chicken I'll forgive that sinner." 
 
 Early next morning on the parson's stoop 
 There hung a fat pullet from a neighbor's coop, 
 And written on a paper in a tremulous print 
 Was this transcript of the parson's hint: 
 Here am the chicken for the pahson's dinner 
 And it's up to the pahson to save that sinner. 
 
 THE COTTON FIELDS OF GEORGIA 
 
 The fields are bright, and the fields are white 
 
 Down on the old plantation, 
 And the darkies chant, and the darkies pant 
 
 Some lullaby incantation ; 
 And the blossoms blow, and the blossoms grow 
 
 And the fields are all in order, 
 And down the row — the darkies go, 
 
 In the cotton fields of Georgia. 
 
 The blackbird swings, and the blackbird sings 
 
 His morning incantation, 
 And the hawthorn white, is a cheery sight, 
 
 Dov/n on the old plantation; 
 And the blossoms blow and the blossoms grow 
 
 And the fields are all in order, 
 And down the row — the darkies go, 
 
 In the cotton fields of Georgia. 
 
 RIGHT AWAY 
 
 I sent a message 
 
 To the Lord on high, 
 To find me a place 
 
 In the big blue sky; 
 I called to an angel 
 
 And gave him my note, 
 And the angel went away 
 
 In a cloudy boat ; 
 And what do you think 
 
 The Lord done say, 
 Come up chillun 
 
 Right away. 
 
 Right away chillun, right away, 
 Come up chillun, right away. 
 
 I asked the Lord 
 
 When we were alone, 
 To give me a place 
 
 On the big white throne; 
 For I saw Daniel 
 
 And I saw John, 
 All with the robes 
 
 Of the angels on ; 
 The Lord he smile 
 
 And the Lord he say. 
 Come up chillun 
 
 Right away. 
 
 Right away chillun, right away, 
 Come up chillun, right away. 
 
 THE FIERY FURNACE 
 
 The fiery furnace am burning hot 
 And burning hot in every spot. 
 And where am the sinner gwine to turn 
 When the fiery furnace burn and burn. 
 
 The fiery furnace am so red — 
 The flames jump up right over your head 
 And where am the sinner gwine to turn 
 When the fiery furnace burn and burn. 
 
 The devil stands beside that fire 
 While the flames go shooting higher, 
 And where am the sinner gwine to turn 
 When the fiery furnace burn and burn. 
 
 The fiery furnace am down below 
 Where all the sinners have got to go, 
 And where am the sinner gwine to turn 
 When the fiery furnace burn and burn. 
 
 And when I die, Oh Lord! I pray, 
 Keep me away from that place that day, 
 For where am the sinner gwine to turn 
 When the fiery furnace burn and burn. 
  
 
 PICKANINNY POMPEY 
 
 Pickaninny Pompey 
 
 Smiling meek and bland, 
 Says "Good morning, Massa, 
 
 I'se cum sah for the can. 
 
 "Mammy is a milking, 
 The milk is in the pan, 
 
 And Mammy says go hurry 
 And get the Massa's can." 
 
 And Pickaninny Pompey 
 Wonder eyed and bland, 
 
 Saj's "Good morning, Massa" 
 As I watch him stand. 
 
 I like this little Pompey 
 And so I take his hand, 
 
 And say to little Pompey 
 "Cum Sah when you can." 
 
 RASTUS JOHNSON 
 
 Rastus Johnson was a coon, 
 
 Holy smoke what eyes! 
 As big as any shining moon 
 
 Shining in the skies; 
 Eyes all big and glorious, 
 
 Eyes that would surprise. 
 And if you doubt he is a coon 
 
 Just you see dem eyes. 
 
 Rastus Johnson was a coon, 
 
 Holy smoke what eyes! 
 As bright as any shining moon 
 
 Shining in the skies; 
 Eyes all big and glistening, 
 
 Eyes that would surprise, 
 And if you doubt he is a coon 
 
 Just you see dem eyes. 
 
 THE PICKANINNY BAND 
 
 Rastus is a crying — 
 
 He hurt his lil' hand. 
 And that's the way they start it, 
 
 This pickaninny band, 
 
  
 And Hannah wants some hoe cake, 
 The hoe cake in the pan, 
 
 And then you hear a solo 
 From the pickaninny band. 
 
 And Caesar Alexander 
 
 Is a quarreling in the sand, 
 
 Another active member 
 Of the pickaninny band. 
 
 And all day long and evening 
 
 From Beersheba to Dan, 
 They're playing and parading, 
 
 This pickaninny band. 
 
 THAT OLD FLY 
 
 That old fly done pester me — 
 
 Go w^ay dar and let me sleep, 
 
 I hear him buzz and I hear him creep — 
 
 Go way dar and let me sleep ; 
 
 You suah done make the angels weep — 
 
 Go way dar and let me sleep, 
 
 You bite the horse and you bite the sheep — 
 
 Go way dar and let me sleep, 
 
 And for the land's sake I don't want to die 
 
 Boddered to death by that old fly. 
 
 THE LIABILITY 
 
 Old Uncle Mose was explaining in detail 
 
 High finance to his friend Mr. Quail, 
 
 "An asset am this," said old Uncle Mose 
 
 Pointing with pride to his tattered clothes; 
 
 "It's what you have, and what you got — 
 
 Cash in hand and on the spot, 
 
 And a liability am what you owe — 
 
 And you have no money for that debt to show; 
 
 It am just like a chicken, that you want to borrow 
 
 And liability says come around to morrow." 
 
 "Am that a liability?" says suspicious Mr. Quail. 
 
 "If that's a liability so am the jail." 
 
 THE MENU 
 
 The African Methodist Episcopal churches 
 
 Were having a picnic on the birches, 
 
 And Rastus Johnson to show his friends 
 
 His razor from his hip unbends; 
 
 An officer saw the hostile act 
 
 And thought a row was on in fact, 
 
 So without his intervention 
 
 He thought it best to simply mention 
 
 The menu of the eats done say 
 
 No smoked beef or hash today. 
 
 BALM OF GILEAD 
 
 Can you imagine a cabin small 
 Without a kitchen or a hall? 
 And baking in a possum pan ; 
 A possum in the possum land ; 
 And gathered round it with their croons 
 With tyes, as big and bright as moons, 
 A bunch of grinning pickaninnies — 
 Hannahs, Chloes, Dinahs, Minnies; 
 And then the mutual exclamation 
 Half in phrensy and elation. 
 Golly see that possum Iliad 
 That am suah a balm of Gilead. 
 
 THE ALLIGATOR 
 
 Whenever you see a n***** 
 
 With a little mouth. 
 Running north 
 
 And running south. 
 And with a cavern 
 
 Like an extinct crater. 
 That isn't a n***** 
 
 That's an alligator. 
 
 THE BANJO 
 
 The banjo, banjo, banjo bring, 
 Let the banjo, banjo ring. 
 For my spirit only sings 
 When the banjo, banjo rings. 
 
 The banjo, banjo bring. 
 
 Let the banjo, banjo ring. 
 
 Then I'm crowned among the kings 
 
 When the banjo, banjo rings. 
 
 BRUSH DEM TEARS AWAY 
 
 The darkies weep and the darkies pray. 
 Brush, oh brush dem tears away, 
 Bring in a chicken on a tray, 
 Brush, oh brush dem tears away. 
 
 And then a big watermelon in the same way, 
 Brush, oh brush dem tears away. 
 And when they are through you will hear them say 
 All dem tears am brushed away. 
 
 WHEN THE GOLDEN TRUMPETS 
 SOUND 
 
 When the golden trumpets sound 
 Where will your soul be found, 
 Standing around, standing around, 
 When the golden trumpets sound. 
 When the golden trumpets sound 
 Where will my soul be found. 
 With the crowned, with the crowned, 
 When the golden trumpets sound. 
 
 RASTUS' FATE 
 
 Rastus Johnson had a cough 
 And his demise was not far off, 
 He called the doctor, called the nurse 
 And said, "My cough is getting worse"; 
 The doctor cautioned rest and quiet 
 And put a ban on Rastus' diet, 
 No more chicken no more pie 
 "Stop!" said Rastus with a sigh, 
 "No more chicken, no more pie? 
 Go away doctor let me die." 
 
 THE WHANGDOODLE BAND 
 
 1 went to hear a parson preach 
 
 A sermon in a church, 
 And all the coons were gathered round 
 
 Wherever they could perch. 
 
 The parson preached about a trump 
 And cymbals clang and bang, 
 
 Until the carpets took a jump 
 And all the rafters rang. 
 
 But Hannah Jones commenced to snore 
 When listless dropped her hand, 
 
 And that immediately started off 
 The whole whangdoodle band. 
 
 And brother Thomas with his bass 
 
 Essayed to lead the score, 
 Until it seemed a storm had broke 
 
 And muffled in its roar. 
 
 And Ephraim Squires solos played 
 
 In such astounding tunes. 
 The echoes traveled to the skies 
 
 And floated to the moons. 
 
 And so it went from flute to flute, 
 
 From cornet to the drum, 
 You thought the I^ird was surely here 
 
 And all liis kingdom come. 
  
 
 I never heard, I never saw 
 
 A parson get so mad, 
 He exasperated all the good 
 
 And eulogised the bad. 
 
 The parson shouted and he raved 
 And clenched it with his hand, 
 
 The Lord have mussy on the souls 
 Of that whangdoodle band.

 MASSA'S GONE AWAY 
 
 Massa's gone away, 
 
 Massa's gone away, 
 I smell it in the clover 
 
 And I smell it in the hay; 
 The cocks don't crow so loudly. 
 
 The mules don't seem to neigh, 
 And everything is lonely 
 
 Since Massa's gone away. 
 
 The honey-suckle lingers 
 
 Around my cabin door, 
 But gone it all its sweetness 
 
 And all its bloom is o'er; 
 And everywhere I wander 
 
 My footsteps seem to say, 
 How lonely is the homestead 
 
 Since Massa's gone away. 
 
 SLAVERY DAYS 
 
 Slavery days, slavery days, 
 They are gone with all their ways. 
 Gone the hound and gone the hoe, 
 Gone the labor and the woe; 
 Gone the hardship and the curse. 
 Gone the better and the worse, 
 And our hearts are full of praise 
 For the last of slavery days. 
 Slavery days, slavery days, 
 They are gone with all their ways. 
 Gone the block and gone the lash, 
 Gone the blow and gone the gash; 
 Gone the pillar and the chain. 
 Gone the stigma and the pain, 
 And our hearts are full of praise 
 For the last of slavery days. 
 
 MELON TIME IN GEORGIA 
 
 The stars begin to twinkle. 
 
 The stars begin to shine. 
 What makes those optics kindle, 
 
 What makes those optics shine? 
 And when you see them kindle 
 
 And when you see them shine, 
 It's melon time in Georgia 
 
 And there's melons on the vine. 
 
 The stars begin to twinkle. 
 
 The stars begin to shine. 
 With ecstasy they kindle, 
 
 With ecstasy they shine; 
 And when you see them kindle 
 
 It always is the sign, 
 It's melon time in Georgia 
 
 And there's melons on the vine. 
 
 THE STEAMBOAT RIDE 
 
 All aboard the Natchez, 
 
 All aboard the Lee, 
 All aboard for Vicksburg, 
 
 Or Memphis, Tennessee: 
 They're tugging on the hawser 
 
 And tugging on the tide 
 And it's all aboard the steamboat 
 
 For a steamboat ride. 
 
 Now she blows the whistle 
 
 And now she blows the steam, 
 Now she's on the river 
 
 And going down the stream: 
 They're going down the river 
 
 And running with the tide 
 And it's all aboard the steamboat 
 
 For a steamboat ride. 
 
 Now they're in the current 
 
 And racing like a team, 
 Smoking are the funnels 
 
 And busy is the beam: 
 They're going down the river 
 
 And going with the tide 
 And it's all aboard the steamboat 
 
 For a steamboat ride. 
 
 The darkies trim the cotton 
 
 And the darkies trim the corn; 
 They're piling on the fuel 
 
 And the whistle is the horn : 
 Going down the river 
 
 Like snowy swans they glide 
 And it's all aboard the steamboat 
 
 For a steamboat ride. 
 
 Merry blow, the whistles, 
 
 Merry ring the bells; 
 ChurniHg are the paddles 
 
 And foamy are the swells: 
 And going down the river 
 
 Running with the tide, 
 What a glorious feeling 
 
 On a steamboat ride.

 MY RUBY RED ROSE 
 
 My rose is a red rose 
 
 A rose you can see, 
 'Tis the rose of the garland 
 
 They call Tennessee. 
 
 Her eyes are like diamonds 
 The diamonds that shine, 
 
 And her lips are like corals 
 And the pearls they entwine. 
 
 The damasks of the morning 
 Ere the sun hath arose. 
 
 Are seen in the bosoms 
 Of my ruby red rose. 
 
 My rose is a red rose 
 
 A rose you can see, 
 'Tis the rose of the garland 
 
 They call Tennessee. 
 
 DIXIE SO DEAR 
 
 There's a little log cabin in Dixie, 
 
 In Dixie, in Dixie so dear. 
 And often I think of the sunflower 
 
 And often I wish I was near; 
 There's a river that flows just beside it, 
 
 There's a wood that is open and clear, 
 And often I wish I was in it — 
 
 In Dixie, in Dixie so dear. 
 
 The face of my mother before me 
 
 The children at play on the floor. 
 Are things that I often remember 
 
 And things that I often adore ; 
 The lark has a nest in the wildwood. 
 
 The voice of the cushat is near, 
 And often I wish I was in it. 
 
 In Dixie, in Dixie so dear. 
 
 MY PRETTY CREOLE BELLE 
 
 My pretty Creole belle — 
 
 How like a rose you smell — 
 
 Thou hast a charm, my heart to balm, 
 
 My pretty Creole belle. 
 
 By the deep lagoon — 
 
 And the light of the moon — 
 
 I am coming soon, I am coming soon, 
 
 My pretty Creole belle. 
 
 My pretty Creole belle — 
 
 How can thy charms I tell — 
 
 Thy soul broAvn eyes, they fervid dyes, 
 
 My pretty creole belle. 
 
 My pretty creole belle — 
 Could love devotion tell — 
 I'd sigh for you, I'd die for you, 
 My pretty creole belle. 
 
 FOAH O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING 
 
 Old Dixy was a bondman 
 
 Down in Dixie land, 
 Down in dear old Dixie, 
 
 Dixie, Dixie land ; 
 And early in the morning 
 
 When daylight lit the bush, 
 I seem to see old Dixy 
 
 A crooning with the thrush. 
 
 'Tis foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 And the sun begins to shine. 
 The clover am in blossom 
 
 And the leaf am on the vine; 
 'Tis foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 And the bird am in the tree, 
 And foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 Am just the time for me. 
 
 The snow has long since whitened 
 
 Old Dixy's head and hands, 
 Down in dear old Dixie, 
 
 Dixie's, Dixie's lands; 
 And early in the morning 
 
 When daylight lights the bush, 
 I seem to hear old Dixy 
 
 A crooning with the thrush. 
 
 *Tis foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 And the wash am on the line, 
 The sheep have gone to pasture 
 
 And the milkmaid calls the kine; 
 'Tis foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 And yonder flies the bee, 
 And foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 Am just the time for me. 
 
 And I have pictured Dixy 
 
 Somewhere in some land, 
 I hope it will be Dixie, 
 
 Dear old Dixie land; 
 When the dawn is ever radiant 
 
 And its splendor gilds the bush. 
 And old Dixy sits a crooning 
 
 And warbling with the thrush. 
 
 *Tis foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 And the bird is in the tree, 
 But Massa says a bondman 
 
 I must no longer be; 
 The Lord bress dear ole Massa 
 
 For he done set me free. 
 But foah o'clock in the morning 
 
 Am good enough for me. 
 
 IF CHICKENS WERE CROWS 
 
 If crows were chickens 
 
 What a feast I'd have, 
 Even if dem crows 
 
 You would have to halve; 
 I'd have dem fedders 
 
 For to make mah bed, 
 And I'd wear dem fedders 
 
 All over mah head. 
 
 And in de mawning 
 
 When ah wanted to snore, 
 You wouldn't hear dem crows 
 
 With their caw! caw! caw! 
 But if chickens were crows 
 
 Ah done hoi' mah breath, 
 For if chickens were crows 
 
 Ah done starve to death.

 CHICKENS 
 
 The parson man was praying 
 
 And praying long and loud, 
 And praying to dem n*****s 
 
 In that congregation crowd; 
 The parson man am hungry 
 
 And the church rent must be found, 
 So don't forget these prayers 
 
 When the basket comes around. 
 
 And each and every n***** 
 
 With pity in his eyes, 
 Fingered in his pockets 
 
 And turned them to the skies; 
 You heard the benediction 
 
 And the ticking of the clock, 
 When someone shouted chickens 
 
 And stampeded all the flock. 
 
 THE EAGLE AND THE ROOSTER 
 
 The eagle is a dandy bird 
 
 He sits upon his perch, 
 Just like a flock of pigeons 
 
 In the belfry of a church; 
 But when that eagle starts to scream 
 
 And flap his wings in air. 
 Excuse me fob a minute 
 
 But I'd rather not be there. 
 
 The rooster is a dandy bird, 
 
 He sits upon his perch 
 Just like a handsome lady 
 
 In the bosom of her church; 
 And when that rooster starts to crow 
 
 And flap his wings in air, 
 Excuse me fob a minute 
 
 But I'd rather then be there. 
 
 DOWN IN GEORGIA 
 
 I saw an aged negro, 
 
 His hair as white as snow, 
 And he was pondering deeply 
 
 The days of long ago ; 
 His thoughts were running backward 
 
 His eyes bent to the ground, 
 And he was murmuring Georgia 
 
 And Missus walking around. 
 
 And as I saw him brooding 
 
 Beneath an old oak tree, 
 It needed no great urging 
 
 To bring his past to me; 
 I saw him in the cotton. 
 
 The cotton row on row, 
 I saw him in the cornfield 
 
 And I saw him with the hoe. 
  
 
 I saw the old plantation 
 
 A home to him no more, 
 A cabin small and homely 
 
 And children round the door; 
 And flowers wreathing roses 
 
 And breathing sweets around, 
 And this was down in Georgia 
 
 And Missus walking around. 
 
 I know he was a bondman, 
 
 His flesh still lacked the pound, 
 For he was murmuring Georgia 
 
 And Missus walking round; 
 He whistled and he shuffled — 
 
 Some joy was breaking ground, 
 Or why did he mention Georgia? 
 
 And Missus walking round. 
 
 JUBA 
 
 Juba am the music — 
 
 I always like to hear, 
 'Tis music to my feelings, 
 
 And music to my ear. 
 I may be feeling lonesome 
 
 Without a reason for 
 But when I hear that Juba 
 
 I done cry no moah. 
 
 I haven't any banj( 
 
 I haven't any bow, 
 But I doan' need a fiddle 
 
 To make my Juba go. 
 I may be feeling lonesome 
 
 Without a reason for 
 But when I hear that Juba 
 
 I done cry no moah. 
 
 GWINE TO THE BALL 
 
 Gwine to the ball, Liz, 
 
 Gwine to the ball? 
 You will be a belle, Liz, 
 
 You are fair and tall; 
 You will be a belle, Liz, 
 
 With your eyes of brown, 
 And you will be a belle, Liz, 
 
 In 5'our buckram gown. 
 
 Gwine to the ball, Liz, 
 
 In your buckram gown? 
 You will be a belle, Liz, 
 
 With your eyes of brown, 
 You will be a belle, Liz, 
 
 You are fair and tall, 
 Gwine to the ball, Liz, 
 
 Gwine to the ball. 
 
 GWINE TO SEE MY GAL 
 
 Rastus had a rival 
 
 For Miss Matilda's hand. 
 He played the second fiddle 
 
 In the Ethiopian band; 
 And Henry started singing 
 
 As he gave his bow a whirl — 
 Tomorrow am a coming 
 
 And I'm gwine to see my girl. 
 
 And Rastus heard him singing 
 
 And Rastus saw his smile, 
 And that roused Rastus' anger 
 
 And that roused Rastus' bile; 
 And Rastus started singing 
 
 As he soaked him on the head — 
 Tomorrow am a coming 
 
 And you am gwine to be dead. 
 
 n*****ING AROUND 
 
 "Good morning, Marse Henry 
 
 How am the little chile?" 
 Said Rastus Johnson softly 
 
 And with a n***** smile; 
 Now Rastus wanted something 
 
 He wanted Henrys hound, 
 And that's the way a n***** 
 
 Comes n*****ing around. 
 
 With money in his pockets 
 
 And clothes upon his back, 
 You can always tell a n***** 
 
 By the way a n***** acts; 
 They guffaw like a donkey 
 
 And when you hear that sound, 
 You always know the n***** 
 
 Has been n*****ing around. 
 
 THE HORNET AND THE BEE 
 
 Hear that hornet buzzing, 
 
 See that hornet fly. 
 He don't make no honey, 
 
 He don't want to try; 
 He am just a torment 
 
 And it am plain to me, 
 The hornet am the dog whip 
 
 And the black man am the bee. 
  
 
 Dat old hornet's buzzing 
 
 Always in my ear, 
 I hear him when I'm distant 
 
 I hear him when I'm near; 
 All the time he's buzzing 
 
 And it am plain to me, 
 The hornet am the dog whip 
 
 And the black man am the bee. 
 
 He come round a buzzing 
 
 And he sing a tune, 
 But that tune ain't roses 
 
 Nor the silvery moon ; 
 Keep away old hornet 
 
 Don't you dare sting me, 
 For the hornet am the dog whip 
 
 And the black man am the bee. 
 
 THE TWO MASTERS 
 
 I had two good masters — 
 Said Rastus Johnson Snow, — 
 
 I had two good masters 
 
 As you would want to know. 
 
 They never shouted flog him, 
 
 See he idle stands, 
 But they always cheered me — 
 
 These two good old hands. 
 
 I always did my duty 
 
 When working with the hoe, 
 And round about my labor 
 
 They always with me go. 
 
 I drove the mules all morning 
 And ploughed the cotton lands. 
 
 And happy was the master 
 Of these two old hands. 
 
 Massa Right was gentle, 
 
 Massa Left was kind. 
 And what the other did do 
 
 The other didn't mind. 
 
 The Lord was good to Moses, 
 He obeyed the Lord's command, 
 
 And I bless the Lord Almighty 
 For dem two old hands. 
  
 
 HAUL THAT WOODPILE DOWN 
 
 Blow dem whistles, steamboat, 
 
 Blow dem long and loud. 
 For I want to see the smoke steam 
 
 And I want to see the cloud ; 
 And when you blow dem whistles 
 
 Blow dem so they sound, 
 For I want to hear dem whistles 
 
 Haul that woodpile down. 
 
 Haul that woodpile down, 
 Haul that woodpile down, 
 
 The darkies they are singing 
 As they go round and round ; 
 
 Singing to dem whistles, 
 Haul that woodpile down. 
 
 Blow dem whistles, steamboat, 
 
 Blow dem loud and long, 
 Blow dem like a siren 
 
 And blow dem like a song, 
 And when you blow dem whistles 
 
 Blow dem so they sound; 
 For I want to hear dem whistles 
 
 Haul that woodpile down. 
  
 
 Blow dem whistles, steamboat, 
 
 Blow dem loud and clear, 
 Blow dem for the distant 
 
 And blow dem for the near; 
 And when you bldw dem whistles 
 
 Blow dem so they sound, 
 For I want to hear dem whistles 
 
 Haul that woodpile down. 
 
 Blow dem whistles, steamboat, 
 
 Blow dem like a horn, 
 Blow dem for the cotton 
 
 And blow dem for the com; 
 And when you blow dem whistles 
 
 Blow dem so they sound, 
 For I want to hear dem whistles 
 
 Haul that woodpile down. 
 
 NO MOON TONIGHT 
 
 Rastus likes to sing a song 
 That doesn't take him very long. 
 The buck and wing and pigeon wing 
 You often hear him chirp and sing; 
 And Mandy Lee and Dinah dear 
 Will linger on your listening ear, 
 But his favorite sweet and trite 
 Is that song, No Moon Tonight. 
 
 GOOD BYE LIZA JANE 
 
 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 I hope the sun will shine, 
 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 I hope the day is fine; 
 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 You won't see me again, 
 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 Good bye Liza Jane 
 Good bye Liza Jane 
 
 Good bye Liza Jane 
 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 Good bye to Liza Jane.

 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 Good bye Liza Jane; 
 Good bye Liza Jane 
 
 Good bye Liza Jane, 
 When I go back to Dixie 
 
 Good bye Liza Jane. 
 
 DID YOU SEE ME 
 
 I went riding in a great big car — 
 
 Did you, did you, did you see me? 
 I was smoking a very fine cigar — 
 
 Did you, did you, did you see me? 
 
 All of the girls were waving their hans' 
 
 And hidin' their smiles behin' their fans 
 
 And I was pityin' dem po' white mans. 
 
 Did you, did you, did you see me. 
 
 I went walking with Eliza Jane — 
 
 Did you, did you, did you see me? 
 Wore a gold ring and a big gold chain, 
 
 Did you, did j'ou, did you see me? 
 All of dem coons they had to stare — 
 When they saw me with Eliza there 
 And for their frowns what did I care, 
 Did you, did you, did you see me. 
 
 I got acquainted with Doctor Jones — 
 Did you, did you, did you see me? 
 Good morning, Mr. Sam, in his blandest tones, 
 
 Did you, did you, did you see me? 
 All the people looked, when he took my han' 
 And wondered to themselves who am that man 
 But I jes' enjoyed the situation an' — 
 Did you, did you, did you see me. 
 
 THE CHARIOT MAN 
 
 I saw a chariot waiting — 
 
 A chariot big and bright, 
 The horses all had wings on 
 
 And the harness all was white; 
 I got aboard that chariot 
 
 And happy was my pride, 
 When I was in that chariot 
 
 And Jesus by my side. 
 
 The driver man was Jesus 
 
 The driver man was God, 
 And soon we got to heaven 
 
 Along the heavenly road; 
 I got down from the chariot 
 
 And happy was my pride, 
 To think I had been riding 
 
 With Jesus by my side. 
 
 WHEN I GET THERE THAT DAY 
 
 I'm gwine to heaven, on the judgment day — 
 I'm gwine to heaven, in the good old way, 
 And come all the rivers, and come all the floods, 
 Come all the fires, and come all the bloods; 
 They can't stop the shouting in my soul 
 When I get there that day. 
 
 It won't be long and it won't be far 
 
 Before I reach those gates ajar, 
 
 And come all the rivers, and come all the floods. 
 
 Come all the fires, and come all the bloods; 
 
 They can't stop the shouting in my soul — 
 
 When I get there that day. 
 
 KEEP THAT CHARIOT ROLLING 
 
 The judgment day am coming, 
 
 I feel it near at hand, 
 When before the Lord Almighty 
 
 We all have got to stand; 
 So Elijah tell the angels 
 
 And tell them too this day. 
 To keep that chariot rolling 
 
 And rolling down this way. 
 
 Then w ill the thunders rattle 
 
 And lightnings light the sky, 
 Then will the sinners tremble 
 
 Before that mighty eye; 
 So Elijah tell the angels 
 
 And tell them too this day. 
 To keep that chariot rolling 
 
 And rolling down this way. 
 
 OLD JOHN BROWN 
 
 Old John Brown 
 
 He set me free, 
 Old John Brown 
 
 Done this for me. 
 Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 To the snow white lamb! 
 Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 What a wretch I am. 
 
 Old John Brown 
 
 He started the war, 
 Old John Brown 
 
 What a sword he wore. 
 Glory Hallelujah 
 
 To the blood of the lamb! 
 Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 What a wretch I am. 
 
 Old John Brown 
 
 Came marching along. 
 He saw me weeping 
 
 And he heard my song, 
 He washed my sins 
 
 In the blood of the lamb ! 
 Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 What a saint I am. 
 
 DOWN ON THE OLD PLANTATION 
 
 'Tis the early dawn and the early morn, 
 You hear the mule and you hear the horn, 
 You hear the wind and the rustle of the corn 
 Down on the old plantation. 
 
 The cabin smoke is rising high, 
 The pigs are grunting in the sty, 
 The early birds begin to fly 
 Down on the old plantation. 
 
 The river flows a silvery trail. 
 The flowers scent the dewy gale. 
 There goes the milkmaid with her pail 
 Down on the old plantation. 
 
 The cotton is white and the corn is green 
 And over the hoe the darkies lean, 
 The song is sung and the smile is seen 
 Down on the old plantation. 
 
 The night is bright and the river gleams 
 Beneath the moonlight's silvery beams, 
 And amid such scenes the darky dreams 
 Down on the old plantation. 
 
 THE MULE 
 
 I sing in simple language — 
 
 The virtues of a beast, 
 On whom the praises languish 
 
 And on whom the idyls cease ; 
 A paragon of patience 
 
 The best j'ou ever saw, 
 He may not be a beauty — 
 
 But he's honest to the core. 
 
 Just hitch him to a mountain — 
 
 And tap him with the whip, 
 And you'll see that mountain rolling 
 
 And you'll see that mountain slip; 
 And all he wants is fodder 
 
 And a bedding in the straw, 
 And he may not be a beauty — 
 
 But he's honest to the core. 
 
 Up the hill, and down the hill 
 
 He'll amble with his load. 
 But you must urge him gently 
 
 And don't use too much the goad; 
 And if he stoops to folly — 
 
 What is his balking for? 
 But a protest to his master 
 
 That he's honest to the core. 
 
 Handsome is, as handsome does — 
 
 May do for kings and queens, 
 Or when you're driving tandem 
 
 Where fashion struts and preens; 
 But when you're ploughing stubble 
 
 Or hauling guns in war, 
 There's nothing like his muleship 
 
 So honest to the core. 
 
 As homely as the thistle 
 
 On which he loves to feed, 
 How humble is his portion 
 
 And how glorious is his deed ; 
 And everywhere he travels 
 
 It is the common law, 
 He may not be a beauty 
 
 But he's honest to the core. 
 
 LIVING HIGH 
 
 Ahm living high, ahm living high. 
 
 Ah can almost touch the sky, 
 
 Where was you Rastus, when you was living high? 
 
 Up in a tree with a hound close by ; 
 
 Ahm living high, ahm living high — 
 
 Go way chile, I want to fly. 
 
 Where was you Rastus, when you was living high? 
 
 Up in a tree with a hound close by. 
 
 REFRAINS 
 
 Those Moses men, those Moses men, 
 Those Moses men of God, 
 
 Oh ! glory to those Moses men. 
 Those Moses men of God. 
 
 Roll that stone, roll that stone, 
 
 Roll that stone away, 
 Roll that stone, roll that stone. 
 
 Oh! roll that stone away. 
 
 The glory man, the glory man. 
 
 Dwelling in the sky. 
 Oh! I want to see that glory man 
 
 Dwelling in the sky. 
 
 DEM GOLDEN BELLS 
 
 Oh dem bells, dem golden bells 
 
 Ringing, ringing, flinging, flinging, 
 
 All my soul is singing, singing 
 When I hear dem golden bells. 
 
 Oh dem bells, dem golden bells 
 
 Sounding, sounding, pounding, pounding 
 Zion ! Zion ! they are crying 
 
 When I hear dem golden bells. 
 
 1J5 
 
 SINIA 
 
 Take me Lord, and take me quick, 
 My heart is sad, my soul is sick, 
 I want to get off, Sinia, Sinia — 
 I want to get off at Sinia. 
 
 Hurry Lord, for here I come, 
 Sound the trumpet, boom the drum, 
 I want to get off, Sinia, Sinia — 
 I want to get off at Sinia. 
 
 THE HALLELUJAH TRAIN 
 
 The hallelujah train is almost ready, 
 We're bound for Canaan and the Lord, 
 
 And when you hear those bells a ringing — 
 Get aboard, get aboard. 
 
 We're going through a land of honey, 
 Where angel voices praise the Lord, 
 
 And when you hear those angels singing — 
 Get aboard, get aboard. 
 
 There is no stopping by the wayside 
 There's only one wide river to ford, 
 
 And when you hear those voices calling 
 Get aboard, get aboard. 
  
 
 WHERE IS MY DINAH? 
 
 Where is my Dinah? 
 
 Why does she hide? 
 Why is she absent 
 
 From her honey's side? 
 
 Where is my Dinah? 
 
 When was she aroun' ? 
 There is my Dinah 
 
 In her bran' new gown. 
 
 Where is my Dinah? 
 
 Where can I find, 
 The one that makes me happy 
 
 The one that is so kind ? 
 
 Where is my Dinah? 
 
 I just heard a soun', 
 There is my Dinah 
 
 In her bran' new gown. 
 
 Where is my Dinah? 
 
 Where can she be? 
 Why does she wander 
 
 All alone from me? 
 
 Where is my Dinah? 
 
 At last, at last, I've foun', 
 There is my Dinah 
 
 In her bran' new gown. 
 
 POSSUM JUICE 
 
 White folks, white folks 
 
 Wear a long face, 
 They am never happy 
 
 Like the black race; 
 I could tell mah troubles 
 
 But what am the use? 
 Thinking of that possum 
 
 And that possum juice. 
 
 Ah ain't got no money. 
 
 Ah can't pay mah rent, 
 My feet am heavy, 
 
 My back am bent; 
 Ah could tell mah troubles 
 
 But what am the use? 
 Thinking of that possum 
 
 And that possum juice, 
 
 Satan say I'se wicked, 
 
 Satan say I die, 
 Satan doan' know me, 
 
 Satan done lie; 
 I is very happy 
 
 But what am the use? 
 Thinking of that possum 
 
 And that possum juice. 
 
 COME ALONG CHILLUN 
 
 A very nice angel 
 
 In very nice clothes, 
 Asked me a question 
 
 And what do you suppose? 
 Come along, chillun 
 
 The ark is on the way, 
 Get aboard, chillun, 
 
 Get aboard today. 
 
 A very nice angel 
 
 In very nice clothes. 
 Asked me a question 
 
 And what do you suppose? 
 The judgment am a coming 
 
 Coming on the way. 
 Come along, chillun, 
 
 Come along today. 
 
 THE PROMIS' LAN' 
 
 A poor old n***** worn and gray. 
 Looking for a place to rest and pray, 
 Moses come and take him by the hand, 
 Moses am that promised land. 
 
 Milk and honey now he eat 
 And rest he found for his poor feet, 
 For Moses take him by the hand 
 And Moses am that promised land.

 ELIJAH RING THAT BELL 
 
 I heard the good Lord calling, 
 
 I heard the good Lord say, 
 Elijah stands a waiting 
 
 To show me on my w-ay; 
 I do not fear the journey 
 
 All through the night and day 
 When I know Elijah's waiting 
 
 To show me on my way. 
 
 Elijah! Elijah! Elijah! ring that bell, 
 
 Elijah! Elijah! Elijah! ring that bell, 
 
 I'm going over the river, but when I cannot tell; 
 
 Oh! oh! Elijah! Elijah! ring that bell. 
 
 My soul is ready waiting 
 
 To go and see my Lord, 
 I do not fear his anger, 
 
 I do not fear his sword ; 
 He called me on my journey 
 
 And he told me not to stay, 
 And he said the angel Elijah 
 
 Would show me on my way. 
 
 Elijah! Elijah! Elijah! ring that bell, 
 Elijah! Elijah! Elijah! ring that bell, 
 I'm going over the river, but when I cannot tell, 
 Oh! oh! Elijah! Elijah! ring that bell. 
  
 
 PHAROAH 
 
 Pharoah was a monarch, 
 
 Pharoah was a king, 
 He wore a silken girdle 
 
 And he wore a golden ring; 
 He had a lovely daughter 
 
 As lovely as could be, 
 He couldn't catch Moses 
 
 And he can't catch me. 
 
 Pharoah was a monarch, 
 
 Pharoah was a king, 
 He wore a silken girdle 
 
 And he wore a golden ring; 
 He couldn't stop the waters, 
 
 He couldn't cross the sea, 
 He couldn't catch Moses 
 
 And he can't catch me. 
 
 ALL RIGHT MOSES I'LL BE THERE

 A great big treat in store for me, 
 Let the day be foul or fair. 
 All right Moses I'll be there. 
 
 Moses done tell me, I am gwine to see 
 Something the Lord has in store for me. 
 Let the day be foul or fair. 
 All right Moses I'll be there. 
  
 
 FORTY ACRES AND A MULE 
 
 Forty acres and a mule — 
 
 A little warm a little cool, 
 
 A little cabin and a floor, 
 
 A little flower round the door; 
 
 A little well, a little tree, 
 
 A little sky for all to see, 
 
 A little porker in a pen, 
 
 A little rooster and a hen; 
 
 Some sweet potatoes and a yam, 
 
 A big fat possum and a ham, 
 
 And why should Sambo want to roam 
 
 From that fohty and that home? 
 
 Forty acres and a mule, 
 A little cabin and a school. 
 Pickaninnies on the floor 
 And a Mammy watching o'er; 
 A patch of clover and of wheat, 
 A honey hive of honey sweet, 
 A field of cotton and of corn, 
 A blackbird singing in the morn ; 
 A little cloud, a little rain, 
 A little road, a little lane, 
 And wouldn't Sambo be a fool 
 To leave that fohty and that mule? 
 
 CAROLINE 
 
 Virginny am some pumpkins 
 An' Marylan' divine, 
 
 But dey can't hold a candle — 
 Down in Caroline. 
 
 George Washington, President, 
 He made the people shine, 
 
 But gib me Marse Pinckney — 
 Down in Caroline. 
 
 The breezes seem more softer — 
 The air seems more like wine, 
 
 The friends and counsels dearer 
 Down in Caroline. 
 
 And when my days are over 
 Beneath some spreading pine, 
 
 I want to meet the judgment — 
 Down in Caroline. 
 
 So sang darky David — 
 Trimming bush and vine. 
 
 And singing with the skylark 
 Down in Caroline. 
 
 THE JUDGMENT MORN 
 
 The judgment day is coming, 
 
 Hark! the trumpet's sound, 
 Wake up sleepers, wake up 
 
 When Gabriel comes around; 
 Take away that banjo 
 
 On that judgment morn, 
 For I'd like to be old Gabriel 
 
 Blowing on that horn. 
 
 Hark! the trumpet's blowing. 
 
 Hark! the trumpets' sound. 
 Get up sleepers, get up 
 
 When Gabriel comes around ; 
 Take away that banjo 
 
 On that judgment morn, 
 For Ed like to be old Gabriel 
 
 Blowing on that horn. 
 
 THE DARKIES' JUBILEE 
 
 It am coming, it am coming, 
 
 It am coming very soon, 
 I can hear it in the thunder, 
 
 I can see it in the moon ; 
 All the darkies will be waiting. 
 
 All the darkies will be free. 
 For the coming of the Saviour 
 
 And the darkies' jubilee. 
 
 It am coming, it am coming, 
 
 It am coming on the way, 
 I can hear it in the night time, 
 
 I can hear it in the day; 
 Moses will be past grand master 
 
 And our friends we all will see, 
 When the Saviour gives the greeting 
 
 At the darkies' jubilee. 
 
 ROLL ON, JORDAN, ROLL 
 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll on. 
 
 Roll on, deep and wide, 
 Roll on in your power — 
 
 Roll on in your pride; 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll on, 
 
 There is glory in my soul, 
 Roll on, Jordon, roll on — 
 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll. 
 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll on. 
 
 Roll on, night and day, 
 Roll on in your glory — 
 
 Roll on in your way; 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll on. 
 
 There is glorj- in my soul. 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll on, 
 
 Roll on, Jordan, roll.

 There the folks am fine and grand, 
 Heart to heart and hand to hand

 Down in Dixie darky land. 
 
 Lovely is the lovely night. 
 There the stars are pure and white, 
 And the moon is always bright 
 DoAvn in Dixie darky land. 
 
 WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN 
 
 My heart is happy, 
 
 My heart is glad, 
 Dinah makes me happy, 
 
 Dinah makes me glad; 
 Her hair is curly. 
 
 Her eyes are brown, 
 And I'm going to meet her 
 
 When the sun goes down. 
 
 Many are the maidens, 
 
 Many are their charms, 
 But of all the maidens 
 
 Dinah only charms; 
 Her teeth are pearlj'^. 
 
 Her cheeks are brown. 
 And I'm going to meet her 
 
 When the sun goes down. 
 
 Moonlight on the water, 
 
 Moonlight on the stream, 
 That is Dinah laughing 
 
 Like a rippling beam; 
 Soon the night is coming. 
 
 Soon the stars will crown, 
 And I'm going to meet her 
 
 When the sun goes down. 
 
 DINAH COME WITH ME 
 
 Dinah I am calling, 
 
 Dinah do you hear? 
 For the shades are falling 
 
 And the night is near; 
 Come with me, Dinah, 
 
 Dinah, come with me. 
 By the light of the moon, Dinah, 
 
 Dinah, come with me. 
 
 Dinah I am calling, 
 
 Dinah do you hear? 
 Though the night is falling 
 
 Dinah do not fear ; 
 Come with me, Dinah, 
 
 Dinah, come with me, 
 By the light of the moon, Dinah, 
 
 Dinah, come with me. 
 
 MY LITTLE BLACK EYED CHLOE 
 
 The moon is on the river 
 
 And the moon is on the stream 
 And there is one I'm thinking of 
 
 And of whom I often dream; 
 Her eyes are like the blossoms 
 
 Of the hyacinths when they blow, 
 And I call her, yes I call her 
 
 My little black eyed Chloe. 
  
 
 The stars begin to twinkle 
 
 And the stars begin to gleam, 
 And still of Chloe I'm thinking 
 
 And still of Chloe I dream; 
 And no flower in the garden 
 
 Does ever sweeter grow, 
 More sweeter than the sweetness 
 
 Of my little black eyed Chloe. 
 
 WHERE THE WOODBINE GROWS 
 
 Down in Alabama 
 
 Among the dusky Chloes, 
 Down in Alabama 
 
 Where the woodbine grows; 
 There lives a pretty maiden 
 
 As sweet as any rose, 
 Down in Alabama 
 
 Where the woodbine grows. 
 
 Her face is like the olive, 
 
 Her eyes are like the snows, 
 Down in Alabama 
 
 Where the woodbine grows; 
 And I'm going to wed her 
 
 And wed her with the rose, 
 Down in Alabama 
 
 Where the woodbine grows. 
 
 MANDY'S SOLILOQUY 
 
 The Lord almighty mighty 
 
 Have mercy on my soul, 
 Just hear them n*****s praying, 
 
 Just see them eyeballs roll; 
 And when I see them n*****s 
 
 And hear them n*****s pray, 
 I surely think the Lord am gwine 
 
 To strike them dead some day. 
 
 There's n***** Rastus Johnson, 
 
 He am a funny coon, 
 He loves to go a roving 
 
 When the cloud am on the moon; 
 And they do say Rastus Johnson 
 
 When he begins to pray. 
 Must surely tempt the good great Lord 
 
 To strike him dead some day. 
 
 And as for that Jim Henry 
 
 I see upon his knees, 
 The Lord have mercy on my soul 
 
 To see such coons as these ; 
 For when I see them n*****s 
 
 And hear them n*****s pray, 
 I surely think the Lord am gwine 
 
 To strike them dead some day. 
 
 THE OLD BANJO 
 
 Take me back to Dixie — 
 
 To Dixie let me go, 
 And let me hear the music 
 
 Of the old banjo. 
 
 I've been away from Dixie 
 But sweet the echoes grow, 
 
 Of Dixie in the evening 
 And the old banjo. 
 
 So take me back to Dixie — 
 The Dixie that I know, 
 
 For I want to hear the music 
 Of the old banjo. 
 
 I long to be in Dixie — 
 
 In Dixie with the hoe, 
 And hear the darkies playing 
 
 The old banjo. 
 
 And although my hair is whitened 
 
 And heavy is my toe, 
 I still can dance a shuffle 
 
 To the old banjo. 
 
 And when I get to heaven 
 How great will be my woe, 
 
 If I cannot hear the playing 
 Of the old banjo. 
 
 SONGS OF DIXIE 
 
 There are songs of Dixie 
 
 That everybody knows, 
 I wish I was in Dixie 
 
 And where the Swanee flows; 
 But the song I like in Dixie 
 
 Is not the river's foam, 
 But a cabin in the clearing 
 
 And home sweet home. 
 
 I want not Massa's mansion, 
 
 His oxen or his sheep, 
 But oh I want a cabin 
 
 Where I can rest and sleep ; 
 For the song I love in Dixie 
 
 Is not the river's foam. 
 But a cabin in the clearing 
 
 And home sweet home. 
 
 A PLAINTIVE MELODY 
 
 Massa got chickens, Massa got shoats, 
 Massa got cornfields, Massa got oats; 
 Massa got a n*****, n***** got a hoe, 
 Working, working, everywhere you go. 
 
 Massa got chillun, Massa got clothes, 
 Massa got fire, Massa got those; 
 Massa got a n*****, n***** got a hoe. 
 Working, working, everj^vhere you go. 
 
 Massa got oxen, Massa got a plough, 
 Massa got cotton, cotton grow now, 
 Massa got a n*****, n***** got a hoe, 
 Working, working, everywhere you go. 
 
 Massa got a Sunday, Massa got a God, 
 Massa got a heaven, Massa got a rod; 
 Massa got a n*****, n***** got a hoe. 
 Working, working, everywhere you go. 
 
 THE SUNFLOWER 
 
 There's a flower in the garden — 
 
 A flower that I know, 
 It has a golden glory 
 
 And it has a golden glow; 
 Shiny are its features 
 
 And golden is its hair, 
 And it is the happy sunflower 
 
 That I see there. 
 
 There's a flower in the garden — 
 
 A flower big and bright, 
 The glory of the morning 
 
 And the splendor of the night; 
 Radiant are its features 
 
 And its face is fair, 
 And it is the happy sunflower 
 
 That I see there. 
 
 HOE CAKE SONG 
 
 The dinner time was passing 
 
 And waiting was the ham, 
 The possums had been eaten 
 
 And ready was the jam; 
 The coons began to grumble, 
 
 There must be some delay, 
 For what made them darkies grumble, 
 
 And what made them darkies say: 
 Ah doan' want no dumplings. 
 
 No raisin cake or pound, 
 But when you jes' get ready 
 
 Pass that hoe cake round. 
 
 They cared not for the coffee 
 They cared not for the coffee. 
 They only wanted hoe cake 
 
 With every course between; 
 And feasting on the luscious 
 
 Or breaking bread with Kings, 
 Was nothing to the hoe cake 
 
 Of which their longing sings: 
 Ah doan' want no dumpligs. 
 
 No raisin cake or pound, 
 But when you jes' get ready 
 
 Pass that hoe cake round. 
 
 THE WEDDIN' GOWN 
 
 Mandy Johnson wears a smile — 
 What makes Mandy pleased the while? 
 There are rumors in the town — 
 Mandy has a weddin' gown. 
 
 The stripes are big, and the stripes are red 
 And there is a hood to fit the head : 
 And they say no queen or crown 
 Ever was like Mandy 's gown. 
 
 There were laces there were beads — 
 There were velvets there were seeds: 
 And from the girdle hanging down 
 Was a blue ribbon on the gown. 
 
 Mandy learned to stitch and sew — 
 To make that gown to please her beau: 
 And he declared did Mistah Brown 
 There never was such a weddin' gown. 
 
 Before the parson Mandy stands 
 Holding her honey's horny hands, 
 And their blushes soft and brown 
 Were spread all over that weddin' gown. 
 
 There was a party and a dance — 
 And soft the whispering and the glance. 
 And the song that most went round 
 Was glory, glory, to that gown. 
 
 THE CATFISH FRY 
 
 The n*****s down in Dixie 
 
 They have a lot of fun, 
 With fishing in the rivers 
 
 And sleeping in the sun; 
 And if you want a n***** 
 
 To roll his n***** eye, 
 Just you tell that n***** 
 
 Of a n***** catfish fry. 
 
 That chicken and that pone cake 
 
 And that melon on the vine, 
 Can never hold a candle 
 
 To a catfish on a line; 
 And when the fire's waiting 
 
 And the fat is spouting high, 
 There's bound to be a n***** 
 
 And a n***** catfish fry. 
 
 The Lord he made the honey 
 
 And the Lord he made the bee, 
 And the Lord he made the catfish 
 
 And he made the catfish free ; 
 And there's nothing down in Dixie 
 
 That will better please your eye, 
 Than to see a n***** fooling 
 
 With a n***** catfish fry. 
 
 A hundred or a dozen — 
 
 It is all the same to Mose, 
 There is languor in his manner, 
 
 There is langour in his clothes; 
 But just you watch that n***** 
 
 And just you watch his eye, 
 When you see that n***** fooling 
 
 With that n***** catfish fry. 
 
 WHEN MASSA BLOWS THAT HORN 
 
 Blow that horn old Massa 
 
 Blow it for the dawn, 
 Blow it for the cotton 
 
 And blow it for the corn; 
 Blow it for the cabin — 
 
 See the day is born, 
 And the darkies must be waking 
 
 When Massa blows that horn. 
 
 The hounds begin their baying 
 
 The birds all come around. 
 The mules they are neighing, 
 
 The weather vane turns round; 
 Blow it for the cabin — 
 
 See the day is born. 
 And the darkies must be waking 
 
 When Massa blows that horn. 
 
 THE ROOSTING ROOSTERS 
 
 Rastus has a banjo, 
 
 It only has a string, 
 Hear old Rastus playing, 
 
 Hear old Rastus sing; 
 The night is dark and stormy 
 
 And the wind goes rushing by, 
 As he chants upon the chorus 
 
 Why dem roosters roost so high. 
 
 Roost away old rooster, 
 
 Roost upon that limb, 
 When ah wants to git you 
 
 Ah won't have to swim; 
 But some night 3'ou'll be roosting 
 
 With your wing across your eye 
 And then you'll be a rooster 
 
 With dem roosters in the sky. 
 
 Ah know j^ou fear the tempest, 
 
 Ah know j^ou fear the rain, 
 Ah know dem foxes prowling 
 
 Done give you lots of pain; 
 But some night you'll be roosting 
 
 With your wing across your eye. 
 And then you'll be a roosting 
 
 With dem roosters in the sky. 
 
 THE GOLDEN CROWN 
 
 I'm on the road, the heavenly road — 
 
 That leads to the heavenly gate, 
 And the crossroads wind, and the crossroads lead 
 
 And I haven't got long to wait; 
 My back is bent and my feet are worn — 
 
 And my head is almost bare, 
 But that golden crown, am a coming down 
 
 When I get ready to wear. 
 
 When I get ready, when I get ready — 
 
 When I get ready to wear, 
 That golden crown, am a coming down 
 
 When I get ready to wear. 
 
 The road is long, and the road is hard — 
 
 And dangers oft beset. 
 But I dry my eyes with a heavenly smile 
 
 Whenever they get wet; 
 And the crossroads wind, and the crossroads lead 
 
 And the briers tear and tear, 
 But that golden crown, am a coming down — 
 
 When I get ready to wear. 
 
 When I get ready, when I get ready — 
 
 When I get ready to wear, 
 That golden crown, am a coming down 
 
 When I get ready to wear.

 WHEN THE TIDE TURNS ROUND 
 
 Steamboat start dem paddles, 
 
 Start dem paddles round, 
 I want to go to Memphis 
 
 For I am homeward bound. 
 I done come from Georgia 
 
 But the boat done get aground 
 And I'm gwine back to Memphis 
 
 When the tide turns round. 
 
 Steamboat start dem paddles. 
 
 Start dem paddles round, 
 I can't wait no longer — 
 
 Till I hear that sound. 
 My cabin home is calling, 
 
 I hear the horn and hound 
 And I'm gwine back to Memphis 
 
 Wlien the tide turns round. 
 
 THE HOE DOWN 
 
 Tell all the n*****s to get out their hoes — 
 And come right away in their every day clothes. 
 There's going to be a hoe down, down the rows. 
 Hoe down, hoe down, hoe. 
 
 Hoe down n*****s, don't stand around — 
 Massa am coming with a whip and a hound. 
 Hoe to the bottom, and hoe to the top — 
 For the cotton got to grow, and the n***** mustn't 
 stop. 
 
 i6i 
 
 Mandy and Mose are down the row 
 And close behind comes old black Joe — 
 Down to the fence and back they go — 
 Hoe down, hoe down, hoe. 
 
 Hoe down n*****s, hoe down quick — 
 Hoe down the weeds where they done grow thick, 
 The sun am hot and the n***** might drop — 
 But the cotton must grow, and the n***** musn't 
 stop. 
 
 THE ROUSTABOUT 
 
 The steamboat's on the river 
 
 Or the steamboat's in the dock, 
 It is early in the morning 
 
 Or it's nearly four o'clock; 
 And the roustabout is singing 
 
 As the steamboat whistle blows. 
 For he's always with the steamboat 
 
 Where the steamboat goes. 
 
 The steamer tugs the hawser 
 
 Or the steamboat tugs the tide, 
 Just like a mettled racer 
 
 That is eager for a ride; 
 And the roustabout is singing 
 
 As the steamboat whistle blows. 
 For he's always with the steamboat 
 
 Where the steamboat goes. 
 
 WHEN THE WASH AM OUT 
 
 Glory Hallelujah! 
 
 Hallelujah evermore, 
 I've been down to Jordan — 
 
 To Jordan's cleansing shore ; 
 And one thing you can be sure of 
 
 And make no bones about, 
 You needn't come around, old debbil 
 
 When the wash am out. 
 
 When the wash am out, 
 
 When the wash am out, 
 
 You needn't come around, old debbil 
 
 When the wash am out. 
 
 Once I was so sinful 
 
 And once I was so vile. 
 My conscience never was stricken 
 
 By any joy or smile; 
 But I've been down to Jordan 
 
 And that is why I shout, 
 You needn't come around, old debbil 
 
 When the wash am out. 
 
 When the wash am out. 
 
 When the wash am out, 
 
 You needn't come around, old debbil 
 
 When the wash am out. 
 
 DIAMONDS 
 
 Some folks they like diamonds, 
 
 Diamonds big to wear, 
 Diamonds in their bosoms 
 
 And diamonds in their hair; 
 But I could be so happy 
 
 Yum! Yum! 
 If I only had a chicken 
 
 In mv finger and my thumb. 
 
 The diamonds some folks are wearing 
 
 Are scandalous to see, 
 They have diamonds for their breakfast 
 
 And diamonds for their tea; 
 But I could be so happy 
 
 Yum ! Yum ! 
 If I only had a chicken 
 
 In my finger and my thumb. 
 
 There's that old Rastus Johnson, 
 
 He got a diamond ring, 
 As big as any war club 
 
 Of any African king; 
 But I would be so happy 
 
 Yum ! Yum ! 
 If I only had a chicken 
 
 In my finger and my thumb. 
 
 THE OLD MEWL 
 
 Pickaninnies cra\\ ling 
 
 Round about the floor, 
 Ducks and chickens hopping 
 
 In and out the door; 
 And happy is the darky 
 
 And he has a jewel, 
 With Hannah in the garden 
 
 And that old mewl. 
 
 Rabbits in the bushes, 
 
 Possums in the tree. 
 Honey in the locust 
 
 Come and get me; 
 And happy is the darky 
 
 And he has a jewel, 
 With Hannah in the garden 
 
 And that old mewl. 
 
 MOONLIGHT 
 
 A moonlight night in Dixie, 
 
 A moonlight night to dream. 
 Moonlight on the savannahs 
 
 And moonlight on the stream ; 
 And when thinking of my childhood 
 
 My heart abundant goes, 
 Back to sunny Dixie 
 
 Where the sweet magnolia grows, 
  
 
 A moonlight night in Dixie, 
 
 A moonlight night to dream, 
 Moonlight with its glimmer 
 
 And moonlight with its gleam; 
 And when thinking of my childhood 
 
 My heart in fondness goes, 
 Back to sunny Dixie 
 
 Where the Swanee river flows. 
 
 THE SUN DO MOVE 
 
 The world am round 
 
 And the world am flat. 
 And we'll let it go — 
 
 On its way at that ; 
 "But praise the Lawd 
 
 For I can prove," 
 Said old brother Jasper, 
 
 "That the sun do move.' 
 
 Joshua made — 
 
 The sun stand still. 
 While he fought the fight 
 
 On the holy hill ; 
 "But praise the Lawd 
 
 For I can prove," 
 Said old brother Jasper, 
 
 "That the sun do move."

 THE COLORED CHILDREN'S 
 CATECHISM 
 
 Who made the land? 
 
 And who made the sea? 
 Who made the black man? 
 
 And who made him free? 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the land, 
 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the sea, 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the black man 
 
 And Abraham Lin'cum made him free. 
 
 Who made the day? 
 
 And who made the night? 
 Who made the black? 
 
 And who made the white? 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the day, 
 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the night, 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the black 
 
 And Abraham Lin'cum made the white. 
 
 Who made the hands? 
 
 And who made the mouth? 
 Who made the north? 
 
 And who made the south ? 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the hands, 
 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the mouth, 
 Abraham Lin'cum made the north 
 
 And Abraham Lin'cum made the south. 
  
 
 WHEN THE STEAMBOAT COMES 
 ALONG 
 
 Captain blow the whistle — 
 
 Captain blow it long, 
 For I want to hear the whistle 
 
 When the steamboat comes along. 
 
 Captain blow the whistle 
 
 Let it sing a song — 
 For I \\ant to hear the whistle 
 
 When the steamboat comes along. 
 
 The tide is running seaward — 
 And the tide is running strong, 
 
 But I want to hear the whistle 
 
 When the steamboat comes along. 
 
 The driftwood and the sand bar 
 They sound the signal gong. 
 
 And you always hear the whistle 
 When the steamboat comes along. 
 
 So Captain blow the whistle — 
 And Captain don't be long, 
 
 For I want to hear the whistle 
 
 When the steamboat comes along.

FOUR SEAS 
 
 THE ROADWAY 
    
 There are hill roads and dale roads, 
     And roads that bind and twist; 
 Some wide roads and cramped roads 
     Which many souls have missed. 
 There are blind roads and night roads 
     That lead to where we fall. 
 The long road's a hard road 
     But the best road after all. 
 
 Some good roads, some bad roads 
     Are roads of dust and grime; 
 Some rest roads and toil roads, 
      Then some that lead to crime. 
 The best road's the west road 
     Which becks with quiet call. 
 The straight road, though hard road. 
     Is the best road after all. 
 
 There's a love road and a hate road; 
     And this last road trails to hell. 
 There's a cool road; a clean road 
     That leads by friendship's well. 
 But the best road is the west road 
     That calls us one and all. 
 'Tis a bright road—a right road 
     And—the one road after all. 
 
 THE FOUR SEAS ARE BROTHERS 
 
 The four seas are brothers. 
     Thus the age old legend runs. 
 And the kinship shows 
 In each wind that blows 
      From the poles to tropic suns. 
 
 The four seas are brothers 
     To the folk who dwell ashore; 
 For the tide that sweeps 
 Over shoals and deeps 
      Is the same in sigh or roar. 
 
 The four seas are brothers 
    Whether North, East, South or West. 
 For their fountain head 
 Is the common bed 
     Where the bones of wreckage rest. 
 
 The four seas are brothers. 
     And ne'er shall be more parts. 
 And a man is a man 
 Despite pride or ban, 
      Matters not from whence he starts. 
 
 FAY TIME ON THE MOOR 
 
 When the harvest moon is spraying 
     Stubbled fields with silvered dew; 
 When the night wind cool is playing 
     With the willow and the yew, 
 When the leaves lisp songs entrancing 
     Echo-voiced from valley's floor 
 Then the elfin folk are dancing, 
     And 'tis fay time on the moor. 
 
 Leaping where the shades are deepest; 
     Racing where the moonbeams fall; 
 Tumbling where the bluffs are steepest 
     There's wild revelry for all. 
 All the night birds hear their whispers 
     Sky and dell is magic floor, 
 Where they chatter, laugh or lisper 
     During fay time on the moor. 
 
 When the night is still and calmest, 
     And dull mortal earth doth sleep; 
 Where the katydid's the psalmist 
     There the fairy faces peep. 
 Harvest moon its silver sprinkling, 
     O'er the valley's rolling floor; 
 Those who listen soon hear tinkling, 
     Feet of fairies on the moor. 
 THE TRIAL OF CHRIST 
 
 The great Sanhedrin sat in state 
 Grim jurors, pawns of grimmer fate. 
 Their robed splendor richly shown 
 Gave proof of power, each his own. 
 The ablest of their kind were there; 
 Though guides of justice—worldly fair—. 
 Gray-visaged men of vast renown 
 Discoursing wisdom, sagely grown, 
 Sat side by side with potentate; 
 With mitred priest and magistrate. 
 Through high-arched, fluted corridors 
 A motly crowd surged from the doors; 
 A curious mingled, awe-bound crowd 
 Whose whispered mouthings rumbled loud, 
 From wall to wall and dome to dome 
 Till wafted to each city home. 
 Long ere the session had begun 
 One fact each mind did fairly stun; 
 From street to street, from lip to lip 
 The fated news began to slip; 
 Old mothers in the market place, 
 And toddling maids with lisping grace, 
 Paused 'midst their toils to ponder on 
 That truth the air each bore upon; 
 Across the yards the gossips ran, 
 A-thrilled to tell whatever each can 
 Of that, to them, eventful day 
 That would all earthly nations sway; 
 "They’re trying Christ! They're trying Christ! 
 The Nazarene whose head is priced." 
 And down the ages comes the cry 
 Which ever comes and ne'er will die; 
 Until the human heart has learned 
 The lamp of truth though lowly burned 
 Will rise with purifying flame 
 And cause all ills to hide in shame. 
 Thus as the word was passed along 
 The news was intoned like a song. 
 Straight to the portals from each throat 
 The cry was borne in grief and gloat: 
 “They're trying Christ, the Nazarene, 
 Him who hath all our sinning seen." 
 Those godly ones whom love had saved 
 Wept 'midst their prayers while others raved. 
 All knew that wronged would be the Just. 
 For who could in such manhood trust? 
 Where prejudice and pride hold sway 
 The truth can have but briefest stay. 
 At last there came a word that thrilled 
 Those loyal hearts whom love had filled: 
 "Make way for Christ! He comes this way! 
 The Christ is being tried this day." 
 And down the centuries the cry 
 Peals from a conscience stricken sky, 
“Make way for Christ! He comes this way! 
 Heed ye whom greeds have led astray." 
  Then through the throngs 'midst which he passed 
 Came cheers and groans and hisses fast. 
 Till silence gripped each human jaw 
 At sight of God before man's law; 
 Weak puny men who failed to see 
 Divinity that set them free. 
 They in their ignorance blaspheme 
 That one who moved to act in dream 
 Gave hfe and by that living taught 
 The noblest lesson truth has sought. 
 He stood alone while in his face 
 Was shown benignest love and grace. 
 "Make way for Christ!—the rabble's shout— 
 "Make way for Christ! " Hearts echo out. 
 And while his soul is filled with pain 
 They clear a path, but lean and crane 
 Their necks that they might freely see 
 The man of God who'd make them free. 
 Straight up the temple steps he goes 
 To shoulder all of human woes; 
 Nor pauses till he stands before 
 The Pilate who in mind is sore 
 To know that he his Christ must try; 
 God who is Master—earth and sky. 
 Now in the judgement hall they stood, 
 The Pilate and the man of good. 
 The charges made, the questions asked; 
 The venom bold accusers masked; 
 Still, Pilate judged Christ without fault, 
 And would foul persecution halt. 
 But they were bent on having blood 
 From him who 'gainst extortions stood, 
 And all the hosts of people stirred  
 With love's new doctrine which they heard. 
 They feared the God of Truth and Right 
 Would shear them of their power and might. 
 Christ stood before the judgement bar 
 And named for Pilate, kingdoms far 
 More valued than the wealth of men, 
 As true today as true 'twas then. 
 Thus Pilate bending from his throne 
 Ruled he'd an irksome duty done 
 When he announced with mien austere 
 Those words betokening his fear: 
 "I know no law by which to try 
 This most just man." "No, No," they cry. 
 "We'll crucify the Christ and rid 
 Ourselves of one whose teachings bid 
 The poor throw off the yoke of class 
 For kingdoms that will come to pass, 
 In which the right and truth prevail, 
 Where every grasp of self will fail; 
 Who stirreth up, those whom we feel 
 Beneath us, to unholy zeal,
 And makes a mockery of laws
 That have for ages won applause." 
 With Christ delivered to their hands 
 They marched with blaring trumpet bands 
 To that deserted, lonely hill 
 Where custom gave them right to kill; 
 And there upon a cross, made bold 
 To slay the man who truth them told. 
 And from that hill comes down the years 
 Mid battle clashings, groans and tears: 
 “Make way for Christ! He comes this way! " 
 Heart's echoes shout the cry today. 
 "Make way for Christ! Away! Away! 
 Ah ye of earth turn not away. 
 Why crucify by wrongs and greeds  
 The one who stands above all creeds? 
 All who have hearts behold the way 
 That points for earth a newer day. 
 
 SOLACE 
 
 Shadows are climbing over the hill, 
 And where they lengthen earth becomes still; 
 Soothed to its slumber—lulled to repose— 
 By whispered zephyr kissing a rose. 
 
 Home thoughts are teeming, soothing the soul— 
 Still grow the surgings where tempests roll. 
 Daylight is ending—quiet—serene— 
 O'er all heart longings draping a screen. 
 
 Where are the triumphs won thro' the day? 
 Only their memories dimmingly stay. 
 Some of them cheering—some full of gloom 
 Clinging—regretful—drifting to doom. 
 
 Only the solacing comforting thought 
 Ghosts of v£.in moments, how eagerly caught. 
 As I look backward o'er sun-blistered road 
 That I have lightened some other one's load. 
 
 Shadows are climbing ending the day, 
 Leaving a trailing—this is life's way. 
 Soon I will slumber—sink to repose— 
 Freed of all worries—couched next yon rose. 
 
 GATHERING DRIFTWOOD 
 
 Gathering driftwood down by the sea, 
 Driftwood that's tossed about under the lea; 
 Flotsam—the sport of each incoming wave, 
 Plucked as it comes from a spume-covered grave; 
 Dried by the bhst'ring of Time's summer sun, 
 Whirled out of brine where foam eddies are spun; 
 Wreckage—storm-ripped—from some proud sailing ship. 
 Bark that has ended its last thrilling trip, 
 Now nought but driftwood that's caught from the sea— 
 Driftwood that's gathered up—coming to me. 
 
 Gathering driftwood down by the sea, 
 Thoughts from life's ocean come floating to me. 
 Many a bark that starts breasting the wave 
 Splinters to flotsam with tears for its grave; 
 Tossed on Eternity's sand dunes at last, 
 Gathered as flame food out of the past, 
 Brightens, a beacon, ere ship falls apart 
 Flickers out courage to some failing heart. 
 Though 'tis but driftwood out of the sea. 
 Tossed up by trouble's waves—out of life's sea. 
 
 Gathering driftwood down by the sea. 
 Echoes of broken hearts come up to me. 
 Battered and tossed by the waves of no hope, 
 Stagnating souls who in fog of doubt grope;
 
 Rended asunder by winds of ill will, 
 Crushed 'gainst the rocks where rude evils all spill; 
 Come from Eternity—come with a groan— 
 Come with a dolorous, cavernous moan; 
 Tenderly gathered in sympathy's arms— 
 Driftwood remaining—but driftwood that warms. 
 
 THE YEARS OF YOUTH 
 
 Oh, give me back the years of youth! 
     Those days of faith undaunted, 
 When lie knew nothing save of truth— 
     The years no sorrow haunted; 
             When friends we knew 
             Were real and true, 
 And ne'er false values flaunted. 
 
 Oh, give me back the years of youth!  
     That like swift rushing river 
 Too quickly flowed for any ruth 
     Yet seemed to glide forever; 
             When heart was strong,
             Filled with glad song 
     That prompted each endeavor. 
 
 Oh, give me back the years of youth! 
      When courage marched with beauty; 
 Nor feared to bear the shield of sooth — 
     When right waged wars for duty. 
             Those days though gone 
             Return anon 
 And cheat death of his booty. 
 
 LAUREL'S EYES 
 
 When Laurel's laughing wide blue eyes 
     Turned smilingly on me, 
 The world forgot its pains and sighs 
     In gladsomeness set free. 
 Promethean thongs that heart enchained 
     Where soul-dark ravens fed, 
 All fell away while sprays that pained 
     Left waves of love instead. 
 When Laurel's tender deep blue eyes 
     Lift smilingly to me, 
 No orb there is that Hghts the skies 
     But hides its gleam to flee. 
 Go tell the world life never dies; 
     Hope rides eternal—free— 
 When Laurel's loving deep blue eyes 
     Lift tenderly to me. 
 
 TO NEW ENGLAND 
 
 I love you, old New England! 
     From 'Roostook down to the Sound 
 Thy rude, rough headlands, shores and vales 
     To me are sacred ground: 
         Where heroes fought 
         And freedom bought: 
 And truth is guide to thought. 
 
 I love you, fair New England! 
     From border line to the sea. 
 I treasure every snow-kissed hill; 
     They're God-built shrines to me: 
         Where bards have sung 
         In world-loved tongue, 
 Where right her mantle's hung. 
 
 I love you, fond New England! 
     From Long Lake down to the Sound! 
 Thy bosom cradles noble names 
     Whom lasting mem'ry's bound. 
         Where sabres clashed; 
         War's thunders crashed; 
 Where hopes are never dashed. 
 
 God keep you, loved New England! 
      From 'Roostook down to the Sound; 
 Always in van of cause that's right 
     May you be ever found. 
         Firm Beacon be, 
         Light to life's sea 
 Thou land of liberty! 
 
 MISSIONARIES 
 
 They found a heathen on an isle across the sea.  
     The isle was fair and full of riches too. 
 They sent one holy man the heathen's soul to free— 
     The mission man took truth beyond the blue. 
 
 The mission man soon called on friends for help. 
     Aid came to him—a mighty battleship— 
 They took the island's wealth of gold and kelp 
     To pay the gospel cruiser's hostile trip. 
 
 The missionary's duties now are at an end. 
     He did his work completely—did it well. 
 The heathen's now a shackled slave to vice—and penned. 
     They took his home—and sent his soul to hell. 
 
 A LITTLE WHITE HEARSE 
 
 A little white hearse 
     At somebody's door— 
 And some cottage or mansion 
     Is saddened and poor. 
 
 A little white hearse 
     In somebody's street — 
 And stilled is the patter 
     Of two little feet. 
 
 Ah, little white hearse 
     Ah, why did you call? 
 And why should you covet 
     This jewel of all? 
 
 Oh, little white hearse 
     Though heart you have pained; 
 And earth's lost a cherub, 
     God's heaven has one gained. 
 
 AFTERWARD 
 
 After the earthquake stillness reigns; 
     Following storm is peace. 
 After your losses come your gains— 
     And dreams that hearts release. 
 After the evil comes the good 
     Whatever the road men trod. 
 After our sins we wear the hood 
     When conscience talks with God. 
 
 Following hatred then comes love; 
     After our grief come smiles. 
 And if we face to skies above 
     We see naught but life's worthwhiles. 
 
 Straight is the way that trails the turn; 
     After the frost—the fire. 
 Hope that has overturned sorrow's urn 
     Will surely the soul inspire. 
 
 After we've wounded a heart we grieve; 
     What we receive—we give. 
 After we punish we then relieve— 
     After we die—we live. 
 
 After we fail we struggle on; 
     After we fall we rise, 
 Sure that we'll see when the night has gone—
     God's sun in the morning skies. 
 
 ONE BY ONE 
 
 One by one the days are going. 
     One by one the moments flee. 
 Like a stream that's ever flowing;  
     Flowing to Eternity. 
 
 One by one our tasks we're ending. 
     One by one we sigh and sleep; 
 Lashed by fate's decree unbending 
     Balked ambitions make us weep. 
 
 One by one life's miles we're tracing, 
     Sometimes halting lest we fall: 
 One by one time's impress tracing 
     Till we answer toil's last call. 
 
 One by one heart seeds we're planting 
     Whether soil be rich or poor. 
 Good deeds growing, Heaven's will granting, 
     Will enfertile all earth's moor. 
 
 One by one are blessings given 
     With our ills, to teach us life 
 Gives us naught if we've not striven 
     To plant love in fields of strife. 
 
 One by one the days are growing. 
     One by one the moments flee. 
 And they bear us scarcely knowing 
     Swiftly to eternity. 
 
 GOING HOME TO REST 
 
 When I was a Lid, when the earth ne'er was sad. 
     From my window ere dayhght was born, 
 Forsaken by sleep, back from dreams that were deep 
     I'd come called by heralds of morn. 
 As the sky tinted pale beyond earth's outer rail 
     And then changed to a yellowish chrome 
 I'd see the stars blink and then silently sink 
     Into hght and go twinkling off home. 
 
 Then the grass by the door was with dew silvered o'er. 
     'Twas a fairyland trove to behold,
 Till the sun with his rays recolored the grays 
     And each blade seemed to drip molten gold. 
 Then I chuckled in glee that the fairies for me 
     Had provided such magical sight. 
 Till the sun came o'er hills and soon sipped up the rills 
     With his thirsty and harsh cruel light. 
 
 But the thought brought me cheer though the day became drear, 
     That the stars and the dew on the grass. 
 Were but guards from the sky while we slumbering lie, 
     Where the light of the ages will pass; 
 Who when work hours are done they depart one by one 
     To the land of the fairy and gnome—. 
 And just like the stars when death lowers the bars 
     I shall silently steal away home. 
 
 TO A TINY HAND 
 
 A soft yet pulsing bit of flesh and bone; 
     So dainty that slight pressure would it crush, 
 And yet 'tis strong enough to lead me on 
     Safe thro' all paths where brooding dangers push. 
 A tiny hand—placed trustingly in mine 
     To guide two toddling, stumbling feet aright. 
 Who's guide along our way thro' night and shine? 
     I lead and yet I follow soul of white. 
 
 A tiny hand! What trust in me is placed! 
     What blind unerring faith in me is shown! 
 How can I e'er be false when I am faced 
     With such a trust this hand puts in mine own. 
 
 A tiny hand—'tis mine to lead along 
     The worldly paths whereon our footsteps trod. 
 I lead? Ah no, tho' I admit I'm strong 
     That hand leads me and links my soul with God. 
 
 Who has not thrilled at touch of baby hand 
     And thereat willed to lead a better life? 
 Who has not joined the host from magic land 
     And dreamed of trust and faith less strife? 
 
 CONSOLATION 
 
 There's always a sun somewhere in the sky
     No matter how hard it rains. 
 Joy has an echo for every heart's sigh 
     And solaces all our pains. 
 There's always a wee bit of hope in the soul 
     Despite all the gloom that shows; 
 And never do storm clouds over us roll 
     But a fair wind finally blows. 
 
 There's always a blessing a-trailing each curse 
     That low bows the head in grief. 
 Life always balances better and worse; 
      The long journeys average the brief. 
 
 Always we'll find there's some love in the heart, 
     While Time sweetens bitterest hate, 
 And swings fortune's circle each new day to start, 
     So why not be patient and wait? 
 
 Today we are living; our song we intone 
     Then depart; yield to others our place. 
 The door betwixt death and birth's only a stone 
     On which a few markings we trace. 
 Yet if such impressions as we leave behind 
     Can aid those who follow our tread, 
 What tho' we've passed on? Those still coming will find 
      We're living each day tho' we're dead. 
 
 Let's walk in the sunshine along with the gloom 
     And face life as heroes face death. 
 Go boldly to duties whate'er be our doom 
     Till summoned by Him who gives breath. 
 
 A WISH 
 
 When your joys are of the sweetest 
     And your heart is Hght and free; 
 When your griefs are skimming fleetest, 
     Love, one moment think of me. 
 
 I'd not ask you to remember 
     Me when hfe is dull and drear; 
 When your hopes are but an ember 
     From a cold and vanished year; 
 
 Sorrow's far too bleak a burden 
     To retain in memory's hall. 
 Friendship has no greater guerdon 
     Than to happiness recall. 
 
 So, when roses scent the twilight 
     Air with ling'ring dew damp breath, 
 Please remember me as eye-bright 
     Faith remembers until death. 
 
 CHLOE'S LAMENT 
 
 The turtle dove is moaning for 
     Its mate from yonder tree; 
 "I wonder why my errant love 
     Comes never back to me." 
 Its cooing plaint makes sad my heart 
     And dulls my breast with woe. 
 For who can fill with gladsome thrill 
     Souls that great sorrow know? 
 
 The sighing fir is whispering 
     To every lazing breeze 
 That sweeps along o'er turquoise sky, 
     "Love feels but never sees." 
 Eyes sometimes weep; joys can't all keep, 
      Clouds drift and come again. 
 Love that's unmindful of its hurts 
     Will lasting love remain. 
 
 Ah, turtle dove, thou mournest for 
     Thy mate who's flown away. 
 While he, unmindful of his troth 
     On some far bough doth sway. 
 My love too's careless of his oath. 
      He's left me grieved — alone. 
 Where once his lips laid soft caress 
     Mind grief has placed its stone. 
 
WELCOME HOME 
 
 Welcome home!   Ah what words sweeter 
     Can there come to cheer the soul! 
 Welcome home!   The pulse beats fleeter 
     As we near the sunset’s goal. 
 
 Hills behind are tinted golden 
     While there beckon from the gloam, 
 Arms that with'ring never grow olden 
     But bid us fond welcome home. 
 
 Sweetest music ever wafted 
     On the air or o'er the foam, 
 Are the words that love has drafted 
     When the heart says, welcome home! 
 
 Tenderness and pent up yearning 
     Follow loved ones who may roam, 
 Till their steps with heart are turning 
     Back to hear sweet, welcome home! 
 
 CHEER UP, LITTLE LOUISE 
 
 Today may be dark, or be cold, or be drear. 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 With nothing but trouble in offing or near, 
      Cheer up, Little Louise. 
 As long as a warm heart beats in the breast; 
 So long as the sunset presages rest, 
 What comes tomorrow is ever the best, 
      Cheer up, little Louise. 
 
 Love never leaves noble souls in despair, 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 A smile always blots out the trace of a tear 
      Cheer up, little Louise. 
 So long as a song echoes sweet in the soul, 
 As long as good friendship is heart's fairest goal 
 Will happiness bring us its comforting stole, 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 On the moss verdant bank of the swift Edisto, 
     Cheer up, httle Louise. 
 We plighted our troth, you and I, long ago.  
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 The starHght reflected from sky o'er that stream 
 Was naught to the love light that shed its bright beam 
 On me as I whispered my heart's gift (sweet theme), 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 
 The birds have all feathered and flown from the nest, 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 And soon you and I will be taking our rest, 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 There's one little cherub yon sleeping alone 
 Of him one reminder is left us—a stone, 
 And memories that sweeter grow till we are gone. 
     Cheer up, little Louise. 
 
 WHEN THE SAP COMMENCES RUNNING 
 
 When the sap commences running 
      In the maple and the pine; 
 Nature's robes turn green with sunning; 
     Soft and tender sprout and spine, 
 There's a verve to all that's living 
     Filing souls with thoughts divine 
 When the sap commences giving 
     In the maple and the pine. 
 
 Spring comes prancing o'er the hillside, 
     Dull gray winter hastes away, 
 Changing green is every rillside; 
     Warm-breathed zephyrs romp and play. 
 Then heart-hopes start skyward running. 
     Love gives courage every sign 
 When the sap commences running 
     In the maple and the pine. 
 
 When the shoots are green and tender 
     On each tree and shrub and vine; 
 When the grasses long and slender 
     Leap to greet the warm sunshine 
 Youth shows bravery, nothing shunning 
     'Tis no season to repine, 
 When the sap commences running 
     In the maple and the pine. 
 
 OH, FADED FLOWER 
 
 Oh, faded flower! 
Oh, vanished hour! 
     Both useless now and gone. 
 No fragrance left. 
 A friend bereft 
     Sings in regretting tone. 
 
 Gone from the earth, 
 Forsaking mirth,
     You mingle with the past; 
 Where all we love,
 Life's treasure trove 
     Finds resting place at last. 
 
 Once breathing sweet. 
 One's passing fleet, 
     In mem'ry leaving trace. 
 Once thou wert fair, 
 Time's jewel rare 
     Who can thy value place? 
 
 Can there be friends 
 When loving ends? 
    Where is the heart's relief? 
 When soul is bowed 
 'Neath sorrow's cloud, 
     Can Memory be brief? 
 
 Oh, faded flower! 
 Oh! vanished hour! 
     Could you but come again, 
 Love would love still 
 And life's hour fill. 
     Heart would forget its pain. 
 I SAW YOU 
 
 I saw you as I passed last night, 
     Framed in a sky of gold; 
 And through the sun's fast pahng light 
     You seemed a queen of old, 
 Whose smile was light to all the world 
     Against the crowding dark. 
 And in my soul a song there purled— 
     Re-echoed by the lark. 
 
 I saw you as I passed last night, 
     Your tresses burnished gold, 
 While in your eyes a happy bright 
     Gleam of your friendship told. 
 And I went singing on my way; 
     On, on into the dark. 
 But in my heart still shone the day,
     And still—still sang the lark. 
 
 DESTINY 
 
 In endless shifting cycle each life doth ever whirl 
 Till Time's Eternal ocean absorbs its rush and purl. 
 
 We go from birth to slumber; pass through earth's grinding mill, 
 Just grains of wheat—thro' crushers—then blown as fate's winds will. 
 
 We come from God at morning and in his daylight burn, 
 Gasp, sigh and blink till evening, then back to God return. 
* * *
 In endless shifting cycle each life doth ever whirl. 
 Soon Time's eternal ocean absorbs its rush and swirl. 
 
 QUESTING 
 
 A bird, a song,—and a leafing shrub 
     Sprayed with sun-balm from the sky; 
 Near silver stream whose ripples gleam 
     And a gray road's running by, 
  Trailing away where summers play. 
      Who could resist?   Not I. 
 
 A book—a friend—and a happy heart 
     On a beck'ning shady lane, 
 Where verdant croft is pillow soft; 
     The roving soul's domain! 
 Ah, life is sweet where pagan feet 
     May scamper or remain. 
 
 A bird—a song—and a leafing shrub! 
     Then, vagabond, my thought 
 Goes jaunting by where echoes sigh 
     And bees their homes have wrought; 
 Goes 'neath the blue, a-seeking you 
     Where airs with love are fraught. 
 
 TRAVELING 
 
 O'er the trees the sun is sinking, 
     Daylight's fading—almost gone. 
 From the dark the stars are twinkling; 
     Soon my journey will be done. 
 
 Stout my courage was at morning, 
     With my hopes fixed in the sky. 
 Now, with knowledge that I'm lorning 
     Every breath's a soul worn sigh. 
 
 Travel-stained I am—and weary. 
     Torn by bramble thorns of hate; 
 And the hours at times were dreary; 
     Now I'm near to home-oped gate. 
 
 Up the slope that years have measured 
     Slow and footsore I have trod. 
 Whate'er good cheer came I treasured 
     As my blessings sent from God. 
 
 Hard I've tried to face each duty 
     Life has taught me was a task, 
 Set to give my soul its beauty; 
     No fate's favor did I ask. 
 
 Through the trees the sun is setting 
     And the day is almost o'er— 
 Landscape's draped in twilight's netting— 
     Soon comes night.—Good night! No more. 
 
 REMARK 
 
 Why hath Dame Nature wrought such freaks 
     To blight us with foul breath? 
 Earth's brightest minds she taints and streaks 
     Nor purifies till death. 
 REFLECTION 
 
 As a reaper mows the yellowed grain 
 And naught save stubbles there remain 
 To tell us what fair nature bore; 
 So death us mortals soon lays low 
 While only here and there still show 
 A trace of human deeds—no more, 
 To mark the path of those who trod 
 The rugged slopes from earth to God. 
 
 TO O. M. J. 
 
 Oh friend of mine, what can I say, 
     When words such weaklings are; 
 To make less halting this my lay 
     To friendship's fairest star? 
 If your eyes mirror out your soul 
     Then I see hidden there, 
 As minutes into hours roll, 
     Gifts rich beyond compare. 
 
 Few have the art of knowing when 
     Life needs a friendly tear; 
 To drop on gloom its pearl, and then 
     Give courage where there's fear. 
 Yet Nature hath thee full endowed 
     With sympathy supreme. 
 Oh, may I share it till—head bowed— 
     I sleep, at last, and dream. 
 
 Tho' winds will blow on other days 
     There'll be no hours like these; 
 When youth's sun thro' life's summer plays 
     Love lilts on every breeze. 
 Were I but just one wish allowed 
     Before my hour supreme, 
 I'd ask your friendship, till—head bowed— 
     I sleep, at last,—and dream. 
 
 EVENING THOUGHTS 
 
 The sun, which touched the hills with twilight kiss, 
     Fast draws about the fields his robe of night. 
 While I trudge on my way lest I shall miss 
     The path 'long which bright plays the window light. 
 
 A vapor mounts toward the stars with westward swing, 
     Adrift in wraith-like shapes across the ground. 
 Each seems a human impulse on the wing 
     To some celestial haven homeward bound. 
 
 A childish, plaintive wail comes on the breeze 
     In duet with a mother's lullaby. 
 One—fretful, sobbing voice (impatience seeking ease). 
     One—soothing soft, like love's caressing sigh. 
 
 How mem'ry flashes back along the way 
     To lowly cottage whence at rush of morn,
 Home leash did fret me while love sought my stay. 
     How might I've saved me wound of hedge and thorn! 
 
 The noisy barnyard flocks beseek their perch 
     With many squawk and sputter of complaint; 
 With flapping wing and gutt'ral sigh they lurch 
     E'er lapsing into silent night's restraint. 
  
 We are but plumed cocks who strut and crow 
     Then grumbling fold our wings at close of day. 
 Or, like the garden buds that swell and grow, 
     We sprout, develop, ripen and decay. 
 
 I look back on the path through travel's woods 
     Where trace the true and false steps men have made. 
 Some paid the price yet ne'er received the goods; 
     But, gained or lost, perforce were satisfied. 
 
 Not satisfied perhaps but kenning fate 
     Whose strict decree had willed this as their mete, 
 Contentment took life's loss to compensate 
     And casting down their arms deemed work complete. 
 
 Could they have battled with renewing strength 
     'Gainst every swinging, swaying push of tide, 
 They would have learned to know the truth at length; 
     Stout hand at helm, ships will the storms outride. 
 
 Too soon for some did end their ruling power. 
     For some Time's clock ne'er ceased to tick in pain. 
 The sands for some too soon ran out their hour,
     The glass was emptied and upturned again. 
 
 How fared those weakling souls benumbed to right? 
     Who walks with low minds never will be wise; 
 For hordes of vanities will in pit darkness fight 
     Since envy hath naught else but cruel eyes. 
 
 Who dares be sage nor heeds the fickle breeze, 
     The swaying, shifting clamor of the crowd, 
 Will some day find he's worlds to give him ease 
     While heads of empires at his feet are bowed. 
 
 To tread the highways where God's noble walk 
     We need no weighty load of troublous pelf; 
 To stand unharmed while round it evils stalk 
     A virtue needs no other guard but self. 
 
 Than join the mob that screeching demons are 
     Nor hurl a challenge at hfe's ills that cry, 
 Far better 'tis to stand alone at honor's bar 
     And strive to master or to bravely die. 
 
 Tho' robust throat may with the loudest howl, 
     He cannot lead who ne'er has known restraint. 
 Tho' pseudo penitence affect to wear the cowl 
     The surplice does not always hide a saint. 
 
 There is no hour when we are paused and still. 
     All worlds move in majestic ordered way; 
 A seething, restless swerve to mighty will 
     Through cycles, seasons, on through night and day. 
 
 We think of world as just our little sphere 
     And preen ourselves with pompousness and pride. 
 Ten thousand other worlds wot not we're here 
     Tho' through a vast expanse of Universe we glide. 
 
 We are but silhouettes of souls that play 
     Where many long gone noonday suns have shown. 
 We crawl about Time's moulds for one brief day. 
     At night we silent vanish and are gone. 
 
 The sands that sweep o'er life's eternal plain 
     Are scarce disturbed so lightly do we dance. 
 Sometimes the game is such we'd e'er remain 
     But night entombs us in our final manse. 
 
 So much we gather on the path of life 
     From reading milestones, both the new and old; 
 From glimpsing wrecks of other days and strife 
     Ere Time has wrapped them in oblivion's mantle fold. 
 
 God matches men to fit with each new need. 
     He gives a voice to raise 'gainst every wrong. 
 He shapes a hero ever when heroic deed 
     Has need of champion with heart that's strong. 
 
 So, matters not how far off course we drift, 
     In storm true reckoning's regained by star. 
 Not always do we win though race we swift; 
     Not by what speed we run, but ye, how far. 
 
 The sun has touched the hills with twilight kiss 
     And drawn about the fields his robe of night. 
 I shall not falter lest the way I miss. 
     The lamp of hope must ne'er be dim but bright. 
 
 WHAT THE VIOLET HEARD 
 
 A violet waked in its winter bed 
     ‘Neath coverlet of snow. 
 O-o-oh! it shivered then tucked its head 
     As it heard the north wind blow— 
 O-o-oh! but it's cold! 
 
 Soon April's smiles drove the snow away 
     And the earth was warm again. 
 When the robins sang their joyous lay 
     Sighed the violet to the rain, 
         A-a-ah, earth's dehght! 
 
 Her heart was glad when she saw the sun 
     As the South wind gently blew. 
 Soon a bud unfurled—a perfumed one— 
     To a wind-lisped, "I love you, 
         Oh sweet spring bloom." 
 
 Then a youth passed by and the bud espied 
     'Twas his gift to a maid he knew. 
 Guess what the violet heard when she sighed 
     As he whispered of faith true. 
     'Twas, ''I love you." 
 
 TO V— A— 
 
 A nightingale with a heavy heart 
     Sat mute in treetop high. 
 His soul was sad—he'd lost his art 
     Till he heard sweet violet's sigh. 
 Her perfumed breath gave him content 
     For he knew that fragrance rare 
 Was meant in tenderness for him 
     Though worlds in it might share. 
 
 He lifted up his soul in song; 
    The night sky felt the thrill, 
 And paused in rapture—lingered long 
     On each full-throated trill. 
 And as with violet and with bird 
     So 'tis, my friend, with thee. 
 Thy tender way and sympathy 
     Doth make what song's in me. 
 
 LINES TO A PICTURE 
 
 She whose image thou dost bear, 
 Likeness of my friend so fair, 
 With me grew from childhood's year 
 To the age and form you wear. 
 She and I once playmates were 
 And, tho' time some scenes may blur 
 Yet I treasure as subhme 
 Memories of that happy time, 
     Long ago, long ago. 
 
 Years agone our lives were rift; 
 Fate, relentless, cruel, swift, 
 Made us on and onward drift. 
 Yet no lot could from me lift 
 That bright scene on memory's wall 
 Which seems fairest of them all. 
 In which, laughing or in tears,
 We went tripping through the years, 
     She and I; she and I. 
 
 She, perhaps, may never know 
 All my fortunes, joy and woe. 
 Should she not, e'en be it so— 
 To my grave with me 'twill go, 
 That I love her and adore 
 Her, my idol, evermore. 
 Till death yields me to my dream? 
 This my secret, sacred theme 
     Evermore, evermore. 
 
 Image of my friend, so true, 
 Tho' I talk alone to you, 
 Yet our hearts those times renew; 
 And along Hfe's path we strew 
 Flowers, faded, yet they bring 
 Fancies that thro' years still cling. 
 As I climb life's rocky slope, 
 They shall cheer me, bid me hope—
     Ever hope. Ever hope. 
 
 WHEN THE TIDE GOES OUT 
 
 When the tide goes out from the shore and me 
     With its sad repeated sigh, 
 It tells of graves of ships and men, 
     Those whose bones deep resting lie; 
 Stout barks—brave men—who ventured out 
     Where the spume and white caps play; 
 Who dared to sail in calm and gale 
     And who scorned the sheltered bay. 
 
 When the tide goes out it carries hope 
     For the sailor's safe return,
 To the home and heart in a sure retreat 
     Where the love-bright beacons burn. 
 Yet hopes are dashed and ships are brashed. 
     For the sea is never still. 
 And some who go on the tide's outflow 
     Come back—some never will. 
 
 When the tide goes out from the shore—leaves me 
     Alone with its doleful sigh, 
 The thought takes form that a sloop I guide 
     Over life's waves low and high. 
 So my sails I'll trim, let my lights not dim 
     As we breast the spume and foam. 
 May my bark's keel make white path in its wake
     That may guide some kin craft home. 
 
 WALKING HOME WITH MARY 
 
 We left the singing school that night 
     Myself—my heart—and Mary. 
 The whole world seemed a palace bright 
     Built by some moon-made fairy. 
 We trudged across the fallow field, 
     Myself—my hopes—and Mary. 
 She wouldn't talk—my soul appealed— 
     My tongue was quite contrary. 
 
 We reached the stile by Adam's brook,
     When I, to help her over, 
 Reached out—her hand in mine I took—
     The air was sweet with clover. 
 'Twas such a wee small dainty hand 
     From wrist to tip of finger, 
 I swear it never had been planned
     That mine should o'er it linger. 
 
 Perhaps I held it much too long. 
     I cannot quite remember. 
 In truth but for the catbird's song
     I'd say 'twas in September. 
 And as she was about to trip 
     As light as any fairy, 
 O'er the last step there was a slip 
     And—in my arms fell Mary. 
 The moon looked from behind a cloud 
     And there I was—with Mary, 
 With my heart thumping quick and loud 
     I 'ad palsy temporary. 
 I couldn't let the lady fall 
     Though tempted to be chary. 
 There's nothing more I can recall— 
     'Cept that—I married Mary. 
 
 PROMISES 
 
 Someone made a promise 
     When promises were true, 
 And skies were filled with sunshine. 
     Now, was that someone you? 
 Someone made a promise 
     And vowed it ne'er to rue. 
 But then the fields were golden 
     And all the sky was blue. 
 
 The rainbow is a promise 
     Yet rainbows all soon fade. 
 So who can keep unbroken 
     The vow of youth or maid? 
 
 THE EVENING STAR 
 
 There's a bright star gleaming in the evening sky— 
     Where the sunbeams tint the slope; 
 And it sends a word from its haven high— 
     Twinkling message spelling hope. 
 
 There's a fair star shimm'ring in the western sky, 
     With a cheering, warming light, 
 That portends a shifting in conditions nigh 
     When all wrongs will bow to right. 
 
 There's a lone star hanging in the sunset sky. 
      It the treetops sails above 
 And it glimmers warmer as we mortals sigh. 
     To sad heart it speaks of love. 
 
 There's a bright star swinging in the west warm sky. 
     In the path that worlds have trod. 
 And it fills the souls that o'er troubles cry 
     Till they lift their eyes to God. 
 
 THE FATES 
 
 Clotho sits and spins a thread, 
     Silken, soft and fine; 
 Thus hfe starts the years to tread—
     Over down and spine. 
 
 Atropos the weaving does 
     And, as is her mood, 
 Life takes happiness or woe; 
     Evil shape or good. 
 
 Lachesis bends near the wheel 
     Cruel,—without tears, 
 Till, when life doth glory feel 
     Then she plies her shears. 
 
 BROTHERS 
 
 They bind his feet; they thong his hands 
 With hard hemp rope and iron bands. 
 They scourge his back in ghouhsh glee; 
 And bleed his flesh;—men, mark ye—free. 
 They still his groans with fiendish shout, 
 Where flesh streams red they ply the knout. 
 Thus sons of men feed lust to kill 
 And yet, Oh God! They're brothers still. 
 
 They build a pyre of torch and flame 
 While Justice weeps in deepest shame. 
 E'en Death in pity bows his head, 
 Yet 'midst these men no prayer is said. 
 They gather up charred flesh and bone— 
 Mementos—boasting brave deed done. 
 They sip of gore their souls to fill; 
 Drink deep of blood their hands did spill. 
 
 Go tell the world what men have done 
 Who prate of God and yet have none; 
 Think of themselves as wholly good, 
 Blaspheme the name of brotherhood; 
 Who hearken not as brothers cry 
 For brother's chance to five and die. 
 To keep a demon's murder tryst 
 They'd rend the sepulcher of Christ. 
 
 LITTLE 
 
 Work a little, play a little, 
     Little time we may. 
 Laugh a little, cry a little, 
     Life can't all be gay. 
 
 Hope a little, grope a little, 
     Pathway flat or steep;
 Sing a little, groan a little, 
     Soon we'll fall asleep. 
 
 Love a little, hate but little 
     Lest by hate we fall. 
 Lift each neighbor's load a little,
     Great deeds grow from small.

PREFACE 
 
 DEAR READER, 
 
 The enormous sales of "Poetic Pearls" has inspired me to send to you "Nuggets of Gold", "Poetic Pearls" met with such popular favor until I've received some very beautiful letters complimenting them. 
 
 We give a few extracts below: 
 
 Rev. John A. Gregg A. M., D. D. President of Wilberforce University says: 
 
 'Poetic Pearls' is a very fine contribution, Tarn very much pleased with it. 
 
 Rev. J. C. Caldwell, ex-secretary Allen Christian Endeavor League, says: 
 
 The book is a contribution to the literature of our race. 
 
 Hon. Charles H. Anderson, Capitalist and banker, says: 
 
 This book is entitled to a place in a class with the best poems of the world. 
 
 Rev. John W. Jones, Associate Editor of The Fla. Times Union, says: 
 
 "Poetic Pearls" scatters sunshine and point out ten shining points on the checkered pathway of life. 
 
 Madame Victoria Clay Haley, says: 
 
 I feel sure that much inspiration will be gained by the reading of these pages. The first two selections alone are worth the price of the book. 
 
 Rev. Arthur L. James, pastor First Baptist Church, Roanoke, Va., says: 
 
It is not only production of literary merit, but it is soul deep in its rich contributions toward helping the world to become sweeter, kinder, safer and happier. 
 
 Major R. R. Jackson, Chicago Alderman and Major General of Knights of Pythias, says: 
 
 The book is a jewel. You are the uncrowned queen of literary art. 
 
 Dr. S. G. Baker, Editor of "The Messenger", says: 
 
 This production places Madame Figgs in the school of poets, and should be read by all. 
 
 I hope that "Nuggets of Gold" will inspire you as does a golden nugget when dropped into your palm, and meet your kind approval as does "Poetic Pearls". 
 
 C. L. M. F. 
MY NUGGETS OF GOLD 
 
 I own three golden nuggets. 
  Two boys and a girl; 
 Who fondly call me mother ; 
  I'm the happiest woman in the world. 
 
 I loved them ere they knew me, 
  I prayed that they might live; 
 As their little brown arms entwined me, 
  I gave all that I could give. 
 
 A mother's love and sympathy; 
  A mother's joy and tears ; 
 A mother's heart — felt interest, 
  And above all, a mother's prayers. 
 
 I heard their childish laughter, 
  I joined them in their play; 
 I kissed their cuts and bruises; 
  I wiped their tears away. 
 
 God has let me keep my nuggets, 
  Til now they are lumps of gold ; 
 I pray that He will refine them, 
  And when life is over take them into his fold. 
A PRAYER 
 
 1 
 
 Father of the fatherless, 
  Friend of the poor, 
 Husband for the widow, 
  Open hopes' door. 
 
 2 
 
 Thou hast heard us pray 
  In days gone by; 
 Hear us now Father; 
  Heed Thou our cry. 
 
 3 
 
 Thou art Almighty, 
  We know Thou art God, 
 All men are thy children, 
  Their Mother the sod. 
 
 4 
 
 Thou didst lead Israel 
  From Egypt's dark land, 
 Lead us Father; 
  Grant us thy hand. 
 
 5 
 
 Make America safe for Democracy, 
  Safe for black as well as other men; 
 Hear us Father, 
  We beg thee — Amen. 
LIFE 
 
 1 
 
 A moment of pleasure, 
  An hour of pain, 
 A day of sunshine, 
  A week of rain, 
 A fortnight of peace, 
  A month of strife, 
 These taken together 
  Make up life. 
 
 2 
 
 One real friend 
  To a dozen foes, 
 Two open gates, 
  'Gainst twenty that's closed, 
 Prosperity's chair, 
  Then adversity's knife; 
 These my friends 
  Make up life. 
 
 3 
 
 At daybreak a blossom, 
  At noontime a rose, 
 At twilight 'tis withered, 
  At evening 'tis closed. 
 The din of confusion, 
  The strain of the fife, 
 These with other things 
  Make up life. 
 
 4 
 
 A gmile, then a tear, 
  Like a mystic pearl, 
 A pause, then a rush 
  Into the jriad whirl, 
 A kiss, then a stab 
  From a traitor's knife; 
 I think that you'll agree with me, 
  That this life. 
 
 LOVE 
 
 Something that makes you feel 
  Like a fool half the time. 
 Something that makes you act 
  Like a mule when he's blind. 
 Something over which you have 
  Absolutely no control, 
 Something that makes your blood hot, 
  And then it makes it cold. 
 
 2 
 
 Something that dulls your senses, 
  And then sometime make them keen 
 Something that makes you kind and sweet, 
  But sometimes makes you mean. 
 Something that makes the eyes soft. 
  And makes the heart beat fast. 
 Something that clings to memory 
  In the ctiy of the past. 
 
 3 
 
 Something that's high and holy, 
  Then sometimes it's mean and low, 
 But it will make you leap through fire, 
  It will make you wade through snow, 
 It will make you cross the ocean, 
  It will make you mount the air; 
 It will make you cross the desert; 
  It will make you curse and swear. 
 
 4 
 
 Something that makes you happy, 
  Then sometimes it makes you sad. 
 Something that makes you beetter, 
  Then semotimes it makes you bad. 
 It was this that made Adam 
  Have to leave his Eden home, 
 And 'twas this that made Ahasuerus 
  Bring Esther to his throne. 
 
 5 
 
 Something that's high as heaven, 
  Something deeper than a well. 
 Something so mysterious 
  That wise men fail to tell. 
 It makes of you a lion, 
  Then it makes of you a dove 
 This mysterious thing I speak of 
  Is, LOVE, love. 
 
 WHOA MULE 
 (Dialect ) 
 
 1 
 
 Whoa mule; aint you got no sense? 
  Keep jammin dis cart up to dis fence 
 Don't you know you'll break it down? 
  You's de biggest fool mule in dis town. 
 
 2 
 
 Anybody dat looks at you 
  Can see you is country thru and thru 
 A city mule has got some sense 
  You never see him jammin de fence. 
 3
 
 When his boss says to him "be still" 
  He, stops right then and obeys his will 
 He gently turns his head around 
  To see if his boss is on the ground. 
 
 4 
 
 He stands up jes where he is placed 
  He looks a street car in de face 
 He winks at autos passing by 
  From motorcycles he will not shy. 
 
 5 
 
 I know you've seen a car befo, 
  Don't you hear me keep saying whoa!! 
 I'll take dis stick and bust yo hide, 
  You act so daw-gonned country-fied. 
 
 6 
 
 Now when I get up from my seat, 
  You stand bolt upright on yo feet; 
 And let these city mules find out, 
  That you are not a country clout. 
 
 7 
 
 Mule, are you really trying to pout, 
  Or are you trying to pitch me out? 
 The mo I talk to you bout sense; 
  The mo you jams into this fence. 
 
 8 
 
 You think that you'll have some fun, 
  But mule, my business you can't run; 
 I'll tell you when I want to go, 
  Stand up I tell you ; I mean whoa ! ! 
ROLLING WATERS 
 
 1 
 
 Rolling waters, tell me true, 
  Just how long you've dashed and rolled 
 Rolling waters deep and blue, 
  Really are you very old? 
 
 2 
 
 Rolling waters, I know you. 
  Yet, of you I am so afraid; 
 Tell me of the things you do 
  Tell me of the graves you've made. 
 
 3 
 
 Then the waters answered me, 
  "I was here ere God made man
 The God of heaven named me "Sea" 
  And called your place of abode, land. 
 
 4 
 
 Upon my bosom fishes play, 
  Upon my bosom storms do ride 
 Within my bowels treasurers lay 
  That I swallowed with fiendish pride 
 
 5 
 
 I swallow ships, I swallow men; 
  I give them a bed upon my floor 
 To sleep and never wake again 
  Til time shall cease and be no more 
 
 6
 
 Man is to rule all things on land, 
  Man can tame the lion bold; 
 But I wish man to understand 
  That o'er me, he has no control. 
 
 7
 I leap, I dash, I rise and fall, 
  I allow your ships to ride my foam; 
 At times I am a chasm then a wall; 
  I obey God and God alone. 
 
 8 
 
 All men to me are just the same, 
  I treat the rich as I do the poor, 
 I care not for their wealth or fame 
  They are men to me and nothing more, 
 
 9 
 
 I leap, I dash, I rise and fall 
  I allow your ships to ride my foam.; 
 I heed nobody's cry or call, 
  I obey God and God alone. 
 
 THE NEGRO'S UPWARD FLIGHT 
 
 1 
 
 As the eagle soars skyward 
  Each day in her flight 
 The Negro soars upward 
  From darkness to light. 
 
 2 
 
 He has flown from his cabin 
  His banjo and pranks 
 To position and honor 
  To title and rank. 
 
 3 
 
 His brother in white 
  Is no longer his peer 
 He is the equal of any man 
  Found anywhere. 
 
 4 
 He left slavery's shore 
  And for knowledge he sought 
 Today he is a giant 
  In the city of thought. 
 
 5 
 
 He is not begging for favors 
  Along so called social lines 
 He wants equal rights 
  For this only, he pines. 
 
 6 
 
 He's a citizen in peace 
  He is a soldier in the war's din 
 But he asks for the treatment 
  That is given to other men. 
 
 WE ARE MARCHING 
 
 1 
 
 We are marching, truly marching 
  Can't you hear the sound of feet? 
 We are fearing no impediment 
  We have never known defeat. 
 
 2 
 
 Like Job of old we have had patience, 
  Like Joshua, dangerous roads we've trod 
 Like Solomon we have built out temples. 
  Like Abraham we've had faith in God. 
 
 3 
 
 Up the streets of wealth and commerce, 
  We are marching one by one 
 We are marching, making history, 
  For ourselves and those to come. 
 
 4 
 
 We have planted schools and churches. 
  We have answered duty's call. 
 We have marched from slavery's cabin 
  To the legislative hall. 
 
 5 
 
 Brethren can't you catch the spirit? 
  You who are out just get in line 
 Because we are marching,, yes we are marching 
  To the music of the time. 
 
 6 
 
 We are marching, steady marching 
  Bridging chasms, crossing streams 
 Marching up the hill of progress 
  Realizing our fondest dreams. 
 
 7 
 
 We are marching, truly marching 
  Can't you hear the sound of feet? 
 We are fearing no impediment 
  We shall never know defeat. 
 
 SIGNS 
 
 If a black cat cross your way, 
  You'll have bad luck all day. 
 If you meet a cross-eyed man, 
  You might as well change your plan. 
 If your left eye jumps, 
  You are going to have some awful bumps. 
 If you strike your right foot big toe, 
  Into trouble you are bound to go. 
 If you put your hat on the bed, 
 Disappointments are ahead. 
 If there's an itching of the right hand, 
  You'll get a letter from a man. 
 If the left hand itch its funny, 
  But youll surely get some money. 
 If you dream of the dead, 
  Rain is not far ahead. 
 
 THE BLACK QUEEN 
 
 All hail! this honest dusky maid, 
   Let all others prostrate fall; 
 Bring forth the international diadem, 
   And crown her queen of all. 
 
 In all pure womanly qualities, 
   She stands serene and tall, 
 Way up above the average, 
   This makes her queen of all. 
 
 She's not a sluggard at any place, 
   She answers duty's call 
 Come all ye people, small and great, 
   And crown her queen of all. 
 
 She stands bolt upright by her men, 
   She will not let them fall, 
 Now for her valor, tip your hat, 
   And crown her queen of all. 
DEAR OLD HOME OF MINE 
 
 1 
 
 Tis true I've moved far from you 
  Into another cline 
 But there is no place just like you 
  Dear old home of mine. 
 
 2 
 
 I've made many new friends 
  They invite me out to dine 
 There are no friends like home friends, 
  Dear old home friends of mine. 
 
 3 
 
 I love your smiling waters 
  I love your sun kissed clime 
 I love your vales and meadows 
  Dear old home of mine. 
 
 4 
 
 I love your grassy meadows 
  I still hear the whispering pine 
 I fancy that I hear song-birds singing 
  In that dear old home of mine. 
 
 5 
 
 At night I dream of old friends, 
  With love their faces shine 
 The smiles and hand shakes thrill 
  In that dear old home of mine. 
A TEMPERANCE POEM 
 
 1 
 
 Temperance is a holy cause; 
  It teaches naught but love, 
 The God who rules the universe 
  Indorses it above. 
 
 2 
 
 The wine cup is dangerous, 
  It makes you from good breeding part, 
 It drags you down to ruin, 
  And takes possession of your heart. 
 
 3 
 
 I wouldn't be a drunkard's wife 
  I hate the maddening cup, 
 It taints your morals, wrecks your life; 
  And drinks your senses up. 
 
 4 
 
 Oh Temperance, Temperance wonderous name 
  That reaches men in every clime 
 That lifts them from their walks of shame 
  And makes them walk in paths sublime. 
 
 5 
 
 Great God protect the Temperance cause; 
  Shelter it neath thy mighty wing; 
 Defend those who uphold its laws, 
  So of sweet Temperance they might sing. 
NANCY 
 
 1 
 
 Nancy is a nurse sir 
  She's just as fine as silk 
 She is always bright and smiling, 
  But she insists on giving you milk, 
 Says she, "It's the doctor's orders" 
  That you shall have no meat: 
 She fills you with the liquid 
  While the chicken she does eat. 
 
 2 
 
 She opens wide your mouth sir, 
  And your temperature she takes, 
 Then she writes down something funny 
  In a booklet that she makes 
 Just to show the doctor 
  How well you are thriving 
 And to impress upon him greatly, 
  To obey him she is striving. 
 
 3 
 
 You can tell when the doctor's coming 
  Nancy sticks clown her hair 
 Then she paints and powders her face sir 
  Until she is beautiful and fair 
 She bathes your face and gently rubs 
  The wrinkles from your cheek 
 She says: "now dearie lie quite still 
  And to doctor do not speak." 
 
 4 
 
 She warns you "now be careful" 
  Be quiet as a mouse 
 Look wise and smile quite cheerful 
  The doctor's in the house" 
 To keep you from telling doctor 
  That ail the chicken she did eat 
 She tells him that you are delirious 
  And strange things do repeat. 
 
 5 
 
 Nancy really knows her business, 
  She is loving clean and neat 
 She will nurse you back to life sir, 
  But your goodies she will eat. 
 She will read you fairy stories, 
  She'll take you to the land of Fancy 
 While she eats your chicken, cream and cake, 
  This mystifying Nancy.

 Until I reach that "Perfect Day", 
  I will trust in Jesus.

 THE MURDERER 
 
 1 
 
 John Jones and Fred Pratt had a falling out ; 
  It was all about Nellie Brown; 
 Nell liked Jones better than she did Pratt, 
  So of course she turned Pratt down. 
 
 2 
 
 Says Pratt: "Miss Brown, Jones is a thief, 
  He served three years on the gang ; 
 He is only a common rousta bout; 
  Pardon me for such slang. 
 
 3 
 
 I know for when my father was County 
  Judge, he sentenced Jones three times; 
 Once for stealing a box of hams, 
  Once for stealing a dime 
    And the third time for stealing a little 
    girl not past the age of nine". 
 
 4 
 
 Now this was a malicious lie ; 
  Nell unlike most girls could see 
 So she said " you are a coward Pratt 
  To speak such words to me". 
 
 5
 
 "Father says that John is a gentleman 
  And I think he ought to know 
 For they were in business together 
  In the Klondike Eleven long years or more 
 
 6 
 
 "And further more I want to tell you 
  To save contention and strife 
 That with a heart filled with love 
  I have promised to be no other than John Jone's wife. 
 
 7 
 These words sank deep into Pratt's mean soul, 
  Thought he, "It shall never be 
 Before he shall marry the girl I love 
  I'll send his soul to eternity". 
 
 8
 
 Pratt knew the road that Jones used 
  When he went to see Miss Brown, 
 He hid himself behind the trees, 
  Just outside the town. 
 
 9 
 
 Jones came walking along slowly, 
  Thinking "to-morrow Nell will be my bride" 
 When suddenly Pratt sprang 
  From the shrubery by his side. 
 
 10 
 
 He felled Jones with a bludgeon; 
  Then stabbed him to the heart, 
 Then dragged his body from the road 
  To a safe place in the dark. 
 
 11 
 
 He crept back through the shrubery, 
  He fled into his home; 
 But the eyes of God were upon him; 
  He felt he was not alone. 
 
 12 
 
 Next day the constable sought him 
  And confronted him with his crime; 
 "You were seen" he told the murderer 
  "By eyes more keen than mine". 
 
 13 
 
 The day that they had the trial, 
  Nell's face was calm but firm; 
 Neath her searching gaze Pratt faltered ; 
  Like a worm he did squirm. 
 
 14 
 
 The Judge gave out this sentence, 
  "You shall hang 'til you are dead" 
 They marched the prisoner outside, 
  To the gallows he was led. 
 
 15 
 
 He knelt in meditation; 
  "Forgive me God," he said. 
 He drove a dirk into his own heart; 
  At the sheriff's feet he fell dead. 
THE PICNIC 
 
 1 
 
 We had a wonderful time at the picnic; 
  Everybody in town was there. 
 We sang and played and frolicked 
  Til our music filled the air. 
 
 2 
 
 Joe Brown was there with his sister ; 
  And Ned was there with his gal 
 Yes Sam was there with Mirandy; 
  Pete Jenkins he brought Sal. 
 
 3 
 
 Parson Jones he brought the widow 
  A leanin on his arm, 
 You could see that he was frightened ; 
  But he tried to look quite calm. 
 
 4 
 
 The young folks started dancing ; 
  Parson lifted his glasses and said, 
 "Suppose we don't do that children 
  Let's have the grand march instead". 
 
 5 
 
 "Good" came a chorus of voices, 
  Let the parson lead the march ; 
 The parson walked out boldly, 
  But his face was as white as starch. 
 
 6 
 
 The marchers walked out gracefully, 
  Each couple took its place; 
 Phil Tomkins gave the orders 
  With perfect ease and grace. 
 
 7 
 
 The band was playing Dixie, 
  The parson looked left then right, 
 His partner had gotten away from him, 
 And was almost out of sight. 
 
 8 
 
 You know the widow can't see well ; 
  And she grabbed Joe Bown by the arm 
 Thinking that twas the parson 
  Who was holding her by his charm. 
 
 9 
 
 Parson got Joe Brown's sister, 
  And she's gay young thing; , 
 When he found himself she had him 
  Actually cutting the pigeon wing 
 
 10 
 
 The young folks caught the spirit, 
  But when the parson tried to stop; 
 His feet refused to help him, 
  So on the floor he fell ker'flop 
 
 11 
 
 Now by him falling suddenly, 
  It made us all fall down ; 
 And my slipper heels were caught 
  In the wig of Fannie Brown. 
 
 12 
 Well say, did she look funny? 
  Everybody began to laugh; 
 Her head looked like an apple 
  When it is split in half. 
 
 13 
 I couldn't get my slipner 
  From the tangles of that hair; 
 Imagine me a limping 
  Around with my right foot bare. 
 
 14 
 
 We finally found our places 
  And got back into line; 
 But child I want to tell you 
  We had one jolly time. 
 
 THAT EASTERN STAR 
 
 (Sacred) 
 
 1
 
 That star of joy and hope 
  That star of love divine 
 That star of light and peace and life 
  That shines for all mankind. 
 
 2 
 
 Our star reminds of Him 
  Who died on Calvary's tree 
 Whose blood can cleanse from every sin 
  And make the bondsman free. 
 
 3 
 
 That star shone through the past 
  It will shine for years to come 
 Its beams have led us through the blast 
  Its beams will lead us home. 
 
 4 
 Dear guiding star above 
  Of thee, to thee we sing 
 Lead us with the rays of love 
  While to thy points we cling. 
 
SMILE, WORK AND SING 
 
 Smile and the world grows better, 
  Smile and upon gloom put a fetter, 
 Smile and open friendships letter; 
  Smile, Smile, it's a deal of fun. 
 
 Work and the task grows lighter 
  Work, and your sun shines brighter 
 Work, and your grip grows tighter 
  On success, and you're sure to win. 
 
 Sing and you help your brother, 
  Sing, you lift the cloud for another 
 Sing and evil thoughts you smother 
  From the recesses of your heart.

        <collex:text>Georgia Douglas Johnson, "Bronze." 
Poems. 1922.
Foreword by W.E.B. Du BOIS
Those who know what it means to be a colored woman in 1922 — and know it not so much in fact as in feeling, apprehension, unrest and delicate yet stern thought — must read Georgia Douglas Johnson’s Bronze. Much of it will not touch this reader and that, and some of it will mystify and puzzle them as a sort of reiteration and over-emphasis. But none can fail to be caught here and there by a word — a phrase — a period that tells a life history or even paints the history of a generation. Can you not see that marching of the mantled with
   "Voices strange to ecstasy?" 
Have you ever looked on the “twilight faces” of their throngs, or seen the black mother with her son when
   "Her heart is sandaling his feet?" 
Or can you not conceive that infinite sorrow of a dark child wandering the world:
   "Seeking the breast of an unknown face!" 
I hope Mrs. Johnson will have wide reading. Her word is simple, sometimes trite, but it is singularly sincere and true, and as a revelation of the soul struggle of the women of a race it is invaluable.
W. E. B. Du BOIS. New York, August 4, 1922.

Sonnet to the Mantled
And they shall rise and cast their mantles by,
Erect and strong and visioned, in the day
That rings the knell of Curfew o'er the sway
Of prejudice — who reels with mortal cry
To lift no more her leprous, blinded eye.
Reft of the fetters, far more cursed than they
Which held dominion o'er human clay.
The spirit soars aloft where rainbows lie.
 
Like joyful exiles swift returning home —
The rhythmic chanson of their eager feet.
While voices strange to ecstasy, long dumb.
Break forth in major rhapsodies, full sweet.
Into the very star-shine, lo! they come
Wearing the bays of victory complete! 
Sonnet to Those Who See But Darkly
 
Their gaze uplifting from shoals of despair
Like phantoms groping enswathed from the light
Up from miasmic depths, children of night,
Surge to the piping of Hope's dulcet lay,
Souled like the lily, whose splendors declare
God's mazèd paradox — purged of all blight.
Out from the quagmire, unsullied and fair.
 
Life holds her arms o'er the festering way,
Smiles, as their faith-sandalled rushes prevail,
Slowly the sun rides the marge of the day.
Wine to the lips sorely anguished and pale;
On, ever on, do the serried ranks sway
Charging the ultimate, rending the veil. 
Brotherhood
Come, brothers all!
Shall we not wend
The blind-way of our prison-world
By sympathy entwined?
Shall we not make
The bleak way for each other's sake
Less rugged and unkind?
O let each throbbing heart repeat
The faint note of another's beat
To lift a chanson for the feet
That stumble down life's checkered street.
Let Me Not Lose My Dream
Let me not lose my dream, e’en though I scan the veil
with eyes unseeing through their glaze of tears,
Let me not falter, though the rungs of fortune perish
as I fare above the tumult, praying purer air,
Let me not lose the vision, gird me. Powers that toss
the worlds, I pray!
Hold me, and guard, lest anguish tear my dreams
away!
Let Me Not Hate
Let me not hate, although the bruising world decries my peace,
Gives me no quarter, hounds me while I sleep;
Would snuff the candles of my soul and sear my inmost dreamings.
Let me not hate, though girt by vipers, green and hissing through the dark;
I fain must love. God help me keep the altar-gleams that flicker wearily, anon,
On down the world’s grim night!
Calling Dreams
The right to make my dreams come true
I ask, nay, I demand of life,
Nor shall fate’s deadly contraband
Impede my steps, nor countermand.
Too long my heart against the ground
Has beat the dusty years around,
And now, at length, I rise, I wake!
And stride into the morning-break !
Desire
Ope! ye everlasting doors, unto my soul’s demand,
I would go forward, fare beyond these dusty boulevards,
Faint lights and fair allure me all insistently
And I must stand within the halls resplendent, of my dreams.
Sorrow Singers
Hear their viol-voices ringing
Down the corridor of years,
As they lift their twilight faces
Through a mist of falling tears!
The Cross
All day the world’s mad mocking strife,
The venomed prick of probing knife,
The baleful, subtle leer of scorn
That rims the world from morn to morn,
While reptile-visions writhe and creep
Into the very arms of sleep
To quench the fitful burnished gleams:
A crucifixion in my dreams!
Prejudice
These fell miasmic rings of mist, with ghoulish menace bound,
Like noose-horizons tightening my little world around,
They still the soaring will to wing, to dance, to speed away.
And fling the soul insurgent back into its shell of clay:
Beneath incrusted silences, a seething Etna lies.
The fire of whose furnaces may sleep — but never dies!
Laocoon
This spirit-choking atmosphere
With deadly serpent-coil
Entwines my soaring-upwardness
And chains me to the soil,
Where’er I seek with eager stride
To gain yon gleaming height,
These noisesome fetters coil aloft
And snare my buoyant flight.
O, why these aspirations bold,
These rigours of desire.
That surge within so ceaselessly
Like living tongues of fire?
And why these glowing forms of hope
That scintillate and shine,
If naught of all that burnished dream
Can evermore be mine?
It cannot be, fate does not mock,
And man’s untoward decree
Shall not forever thus confine
My life’s entirety,
My every fibre fierce rebels
Against this servile role,
And all my being broods to break
This death-grip from my soul!
Moods 
My heart is pregnant with a great despair
With much beholding of my people’s care,
‘Mid blinded prejudice and nurtured wrong,
Exhaling wantonly the days along:
I mark Faith’s fragile craft of cheering light
Tossing imperiled on the sea of night,
And then, enanguished, comes my heart’s low cry,
“God, God! I crave to learn the reason why!”
Again, in spirit loftily I soar
With winged vision through earth’s outer door.
In such an hour, it is mine to see,
In frowning fortune smiling destiny!
Hegira
Oh, black man, why do you northward roam, and leave
all the farm lands bare?
Is your house not warm, tightly thatched from storm,
and a larder replete your share?
And have you not schools, fit with books and tools the
steps of your young to guide?
Then what do you seek, in the north cold and bleak,
‘mid the whirl of its teeming tide?
I have toiled in your cornfields, and parched in the sun,
I have bowed ‘neath your load of care,
I have patiently garnered your bright golden grain, in
season of storm and fair.
With a smile I have answered your glowering gloom,
while my wounded heart quivering bled.
Trailing mute in your wake, as your rosy dawn breaks,
while I curtain the mound of my dead.
Though my children are taught in the schools you have
wrought, they are blind to the sheen of the sky,
For the brand of your hand, casts a pall o’er the land,
that enshadows the gleam of the eye.
My sons, deftly sapped of the brawn-hood of man, self-
rejected and impotent stand,
My daughters, unhaloed, unhonored, undone, feed the
lust of a dominant land.
I would not remember, yet could not forget, how the
hearts beating true to your own.
You’ve tortured, and wounded, and filtered their blood
‘till a budding Hegira has blown.
Unstrange is the pathway to Calvary’s hill, which I
wend in my dumb agony,
Up its perilous height, in the pale morning light, to
dissever my own from the tree.
And so I’m away, where the sky-line of day sets the
arch of its rainbow afar,
To the land of the north, where the symbol of worth
sets the broad gates of combat ajar!
The Passing of the Ex-Slave
Swift melting into yesterday,
The tortured hordes of ebon-clay;
No more is heard the plaintive strain,
The rhythmic chaunting of their pain.
Their mounded bodies dimly rise
To fill the gulf of sacrifice,
And o’er their silent hearts below
The mantled millions softly go.
Some few remaining still abide.
Gnarled sentinels of time and tide.
Now mellowed by a chastened glow
Which lighter hearts will never know.
Winding into the silent way,
Spent with the travail of the day,
So royal in their humble might
These uncrowned Pilgrims of the Night!
The Octoroon
One drop of midnight in the dawn of life’s pulsating stream
Marks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its gleam;
Forevermore her step she bends insular, strange, apart —
And none can read the riddle of her wildly warring heart.
The stormy current of her blood beats like a mighty sea
Against the man-wrought iron bars of her captivity.
For refuge, succor, peace and rest, she seeks that humble fold
Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are purest gold.
Aliens
(To You — Everywhere! Dedicated)
They seem to smile as others smile, the masquerader’s art
Conceals them, while, in verity, they’re eating out their heart.
Betwixt the two contending stones of crass humanity
They lie, the fretted fabric of a dual dynasty.
A single drop, a sable strain debars them from their own,-—
The others — fold them furtively, but God! they are alone.
Blown by the fickle winds of fate far from the traveled mart
To die, when they have quite consumed the morsel of their heart.
When man shall lift his lowered eyes to meet the moon of truth,
Shall break the shallow shell of pride and wax in ways of ruth,
He cannot hate, for love shall reign untrammelled in the soul,
While peace shall spread a rainbow o’er the earth from pole to pole.
Concord
Nor shall I in sorrow repine,
But offer a paean of praise
To the infinite God of my days
Who marshals the pivoting spheres
Through the intricate maze of the years,
Who loosens the luminous flood
That lightens the purlieus of men,
I shall not in sorrow repine
To break the eternal Amen!
The Mother
The mother soothes her mantled child
With incantation sad and wild;
A deep compassion brims her eye
And stills upon her lips, the sigh.
Her thoughts are leaping down the years,
O’er branding bars, through seething tears,
Her heart is sandaling his feet
Adown the world’s corroding street.
Then, with a start she dons a smile
His tender yearnings to beguile.
And only God will ever know
The wordless measure of her woe.
Maternity
Proud?
Perhaps— and yet
I cannot say with surety
That I am happy thus to be
Responsible for this young life’s embarking.
Is he not thrall to prevalent conditions?
Does not the day loom dark apace
To weave its cordon of disgrace
Around his lifted throat?
Is not this mezzotint enough and surfeit
For such prescience?
Ah, did I dare
Recall the pulsing life I gave,
And fold him in the kindly grave!
Proud?
Perhaps — could I but ever so faintly scan
The broad horizon of a man
Swept fair for his dominion —
So hesitant and half-afraid
I view this babe of sorrow!
Black Woman
Don’t knock at my door, little child,
I cannot let you in.
You know not what a world this is
Of cruelty and sin.
Wait in the still eternity
Until I come to you,
The world is cruel, cruel, child,
I cannot let you in!
Don’t knock at my heart, little one,
I cannot bear the pain
Of turning deaf-ear to your call
Time and time again!
You do not know the monster men
Inhabiting the earth.
Be still, be still, my precious child,
I must not give you birth!
"One of the Least of These, My Little One"
The infant eyes look out amazed upon the frowning earth,
A stranger, in a land now strange, child of the mantled-birth;
Waxing, he wonders more and more; the scowling grows apace;
A world, behind its barring doors, reviles his ebon face:
Yet from this maelstrom issues forth a God-like entity.
That loves a world all loveless, and smiles on Calvary!
Shall I Say, "My Son, You're Branded?"
Shall I say, “My son, you’re branded in this country’s pageantry,
By strange subtleties you’re tethered, and no forum sets you free?”
Shall I mark the young lights fading through your soul-enchannelled eye,
As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of your sky?
Or shall I, with love prophetic, bid you dauntlessly arise.
Spurn the handicap that clogs you, taking what the world denies,
Bid you storm the sullen fortress wrought by prejudice and wrong
With a faith that shall not falter, in your heart and on your tongue!
My Boy
I hear you singing happily,
My boy of tarnished mien,
Lifting your limpid, trustful gaze
In innocence serene.
A thousand javelins of pain
Assault my heaving breast
When I behold the storm of years
That beat without your nest.
O sing, my lark, your matin song
Of joyous rhapsody,
Distil the sweetness of the hours
In gladsome ecstasy.
For time awaits your buoyant flight
Across the bar of years.
Sing, sing your song, my bonny lark,
Before it melts in tears!
Guardianship
That dusky child upon your knee
Is breath of God’s eternity;
Direct his vision to the height —
Let naught obscure his royal right.
Although the highways to renown
Are iron-barred by fortune’s frown,
‘Tis his to forge the master-key
That wields the locks of destiny!
Utopia
God grant you wider vision, clearer skies, my son,
With morning’s rosy kisses on your brow;
May your wild yearnings know repose,
And storm-clouds break to smiles
As you sweep on with spreading wings
Unto a waiting sunset!
Little Son
The very acme of my woe,
The pivot of my pride,
My consolation, and my hope
Deferred, but not denied.
The substance of my every dream,
The riddle of my plight,
The very world epitomized
In turmoil and delight.
Benediction
Go forth, my son,
Winged by my heart’s desire!
Great reaches, yet unknown,
Await
For your possession.
I may not, if I would.
Retrace the way with you,
My pilgrimage is through,
But life is calling you!
Fare high and far, my son,
A new day has begun.
Thy star-ways must be won!
Credo
I believe in the ultimate justice of Fate;
That the races of men front the sun in their turn;
That each soul holds the title to infinite wealth
In fee to the will as it masters itself;
That the heart of humanity sounds the same tone
In impious jungle, or sky-kneeling fane.
I believe that the key to the life-mystery
Lies deeper than reason and further than death.
I believe that the rhythmical conscience within
Is guidance enough for the conduct of men.
Promise
Through the moil and the gloom they have issued
To the steps of the upwinding hill,
Where the sweet, dulcet pipes of tomorrow
In their preluding rhapsodies trill.
With a thud comes a stir in the bosom,
As there steals on the sight from afar,
Through a break of a cloud’s coiling shadow
The gleam of a bright morning star!
The Suppliant
Long have I beat with timid hands upon life’s leaden door,
Praying the patient, futile prayer my fathers prayed before,
Yet I remain without the close, unheeded and unheard,
And never to my listening ear is borne the waited word.
Soft o’er the threshold of the years there comes this counsel cool:
The strong demand, contend, prevail; the beggar is a fool!
Hope
Frail children of sorrow, dethroned by a hue,
The shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through,
The world has its motion, all things pass away.
No night is omnipotent, there must be day.
The oak tarries long in the depth of the seed,
But swift is the season of nettle and weed.
Abide yet awhile in the mellowing shade.
And rise with the hour for which you were made.
The cycle of seasons, the tidals of man
Revolve in the orb of an infinite plan.
We move to the rhythm of ages long done,
And each has his hour — to dwell in the sun!
Cosmopolite
Not wholly this or that,
But wrought
Of alien bloods am I,
A product of the interplay
Of traveled hearts.
Estranged, yet not estranged, I stand
All comprehending;
From my estate
I view earth’s frail dilemma;
Scion of fused strength am I,
All understanding,
Nor this nor that
Contains me.
Fusion
How deftly does the gardener blend
This rose and that
To bud a new creation,
More gorgeous and more beautiful
Than any parent portion,
And so,
I trace within my warring blood
The tributary sources,
They potently commingle
And sweep
With new-born forces!
Perspective
Some day
I shall be glad that it was mine to be
A dark fore-runner of a race burgeoning;
I then shall know
The secret of life’s Calvary,
And bless the thorns
That wound me!
When I Rise Up
When I rise above the earth,
And look down on the things that fetter me,
I beat my wings upon the air.
Or tranquil lie,
Surge after surge of potent strength
Like incense comes to me
When I rise up above the earth
And look down upon the things that fetter me.
Faith
The faint lose faith
When in the tomb their all is laid,
And there returns
No echoing of weal or woe.
The strong hope on,
They see the clods close over head,
The grass grow green.
No word is said.
And yet —
A little world within the world
Are we,
Daily our hearts’ high yearnings fade,
Are buried!
New ones are made, —
Are crucified!
And yet —
We Face the Future
The hour is big with sooth and sign, with errant men at war,
While blood of alien, friend, and foe imbues the land afar,
And we, with sable faces pent, move with the vanguard line.
Shod with a faith that Springtime keeps, and all the stars opine.
Soldier
Though I should weep until the judgment,
How would it serve —
Brave men are fighting, women speed them,
‘Tis a day
Of crucial conflict!
My son, sometimes it seems I’d rather hold
You safe beneath my heart
Than send you forth!
But lo! The sun is red and weaker children go!
Though I should weep until the judgment.
How would it serve!
I’ll close my eyes and smile, O Son of Mine,
Your cause is kingly!
Step proud and confident, worthy your mother;
Be firm and brave, O Son of Mine, be strong.
For terror waxeth,
Speed swift away.
Though I should weep until the judgment . . .
Homing Braves
There’s music in the measured tread
Of those returning from the dead
Like scattered flowers from a plain
So lately crimson, with the slain.
No more the sound of shuffled feet
Shall mark the poltroon on the street,
Nor shifting, sodden, downcast eye
Reveal the man afraid to die.
They shall have paid full, utterly
The price of peace across the sea,
When, with uplifted glance, they come
To claim a kindly welcome home.
Nor shall the old-time daedal sting
Of prejudice, their manhood wing.
Nor heights, nor depths, nor living streams
Stand in the pathway of their dreams!
Taps
They are embosomed in the sod,
In still and tranquil leisure,
Their lives they’ve cast like trifles down,
To serve their country’s pleasure.
Nor bugle call, nor mother’s voice.
Nor moody mob’s unreason,
Shall break their solace and repose
Through swiftly changing season.
O graves of men who lived and died
Afar from life’s high pleasures,
Fold them in tenderly and warm
With manifold fond measures.
Peace
Peace on a thousand hills and dales,
Peace in the hearts of men
While kindliness reclaims the soil
Where bitterness has been.
The night of strife is drifting past,
The storm of shell has ceased.
Disrupted is the cordon fell,
Sweet charity released.
Forth from the shadow, swift we come
Wrought in the flame together.
All men as one beneath the sun
In brotherhood forever.

The Widening Light
("But above all comes the New Spirit." CRISIS.)
 
A sound of muttering, faint and far and low—
A sound of stirring restlessly about—
A harsher note and frequently a shout—
Of red defiance? not of peace I trow;
Oh, self deceived and blind who do not know
The meaning of this unaccustomed rout!
Do you not feel the frenzy? Can you doubt
The triumph of Race Hatred's overthrow?
The moving millions of the darker clan
Have wakened to Jehovah's ancient cry—
Not stunted, greedy, boastful, pale-faced man
Omnipotent is—"verily none save I!"
And piercing the dark clouds of dreadful night
Behold! they greet the light, the light, The Light! 
A Toast to Africa (Christmas 1920)
From a goblet of rarest and richest red gold,
Encrusted with jewels of value untold,
All flowing and glowing with nectar of wine,
Distilled from the spirits of souls sweet and fine
As these sons and daughters whose deeds I rehearse,
With zeal all-consuming, though halting my verse—
I drink to my Race on this epochal morn,
Remembering the Christ-child who came lowly-born,
Was despised, crucified and rejected of men,
But now to whom honor and glory Amen! 
Mothers of America
A sonnet celebrating the heroism and valor of the women 
of America, black and white , in the Great War 
for world democracy, 1917-1918
 
Ye, Queen, who bear the birth-pangs of a world,
To whom the nations in this hour of stress,
For succor look, and for the ruth to bless,
Ye, great, whose fondled darlings, combed and curled,
Are in the shell-torn, foreign trenches hurled,
To stay the hellish Hun, who else would press,
The cup of degradation and distress,
To lips of men with freedom's flag unfurled--
Ye valiant mother-band who gladly gave,
The first-fruits of your riven wombs to save,
The world from horrors darker than the grave,
Ye are the Brave, who in your country's need
Did sow the trenches with your Precious Seed--
The greatest gift of war, and valor's noblest deed.
To Phyllis Wheatley (First African Poetess)
No! Not like the lark, didst thou circle and sing,
High in the heavens on morn's merry wing,
But hid in the depths of the forest's dense shade,
There where the homes of the lowly were made,
Thou nested! Though fettered, thou frail child of night,
Thy melody trilled forth with naive delight;
And all through the throes of the night dark and long,
Earth's favored ones harkened thy ravishing song,
So plaintive and wild, touched with Africa's lilt;
Of wrong small complaint, sweet forgiveness of guilt--
Oh, a lyric of love and a paean of praise,
Didst thou at thy vespers, Dark Nightingale, raise;
So sweet was the hymn rippling out of the dark,
It rivalled the clear morning song of the lark. 
Frederick Douglass
(In honor of the centenary of his birth—February 1817-1917.)
 
A century of mighty thoughts has passed,
Of mighty deeds and Merlin-magic years,
Since first his infant wail assailed the ears
That knew not how prophetic was the blast!
Then swiftly sped the years into the vast
Store-house of time! The bitter vale-of-tears
Was vanquished, and the dark abyss-of-fears;
The thing, transformed, became a Soul at last!
Search noble history's most stirring page,
And tell what life excelled his in the race;
Trace deeds of daring men in every age
And say if one out-rivalled this dark face.
Great Douglass--slave and fugitive and Man,
With the immortal host, thou art in the van! 
L'Envoi
O poet, with thy soul-wrought visionings,
O prophet, with thy wise philosophies,
O poet-prophet, prophet-poet, Come
Again to our low dwelling-places! Come
And bring the balm of healing on thy tongue!
Oh, wash us clean with fresh Aprilian showers,
Re-light the altar candles of our souls! 
William Stanley Braithwaite
(To William Stanley Braithwaite upon his visit to Washington, D. C., April, 1916)
 
An Appreciation 
 
He came like John of old to all proclaiming
The Bread of Life; to our starved senses bringing
The breath of April in his offerings!
The resurrection of our better selves
Commanded he: the spirit-half of our
Dual existence, called he back to life;
Revived in us the ancient thirst for Truth,
The search for Beauty 'long the dusty ways
And sordid places of our journeyings.
Like John he came to our world-wilderness
The real from the false to separate;
The Light to set before our stumbling feet!
And some whose ears had long been deaf to Truth,
Whose hearts thro' greed had hardened into stones,
Were purified, revived and lifted up
By the persuasive magic of his song. 
To Howard University
(Semi-Centennial Celebration, March, 1917)
 
The pall of battle scarce had passed away,
Hearts yet were hot with hate and hard with greed,
When some love-kindled spirit hid the seed,
Whose spreading branches shelter us today;
Beloved Mother, you for whom we pray,
Be fortified to meet our every need,
At your full breasts the hungry children feed,
Nor turn a single thirsting soul away!
What hath God wrought in fifty years! we've crossed
The Valley-of-Humiliation: then
Advancing up the Hill-of-Progress, tossed
A Challenge to the world of other men.
And reaching out for all that's manhood's due
Our thanks go winging up to God--and You!
Paul Laurence Dunbar
(Upon reading the Introduction to "Lyrics of Lowly Life" 
by William Dean Howells)
 
The beetling night was fading toward the dawn,
When strange, weird sounds smote subtly on the ear
Of one far up the heights, who paused to hear
The song of him, who doggedly pressed on
From that low vale whence Hope seemed almost gone.
Persistently the sound rose loud and clear
Surcharged of times with radiating cheer--
Of times with sadness of a soul in pawn.
 
The hearthside lyrics trickled from his heart,
With simple melody and baffling art!
A traveller above called down the slope
And Dunbar answered, "Comrade! now I hope!"
One white, one black, but one in spirit, they
Symbolic are of God's Eternal Way! 
Within the Veil
And ye, who view life darkly thro' a veil
At length shall read its riddle face to face!
The hidden springs of beauty and the grace
Of fuller living, wait beyond this trail
Blood-stained and steep: there stands the Holy Grail
Whose healing waters shall the woes efface,
Of plodding pilgrims, who still seek the place
Where men of every race shall say, "All hail!"
To this broad shrine, we too shall bring our gift
Of joyous laughter, song and loyal love;
And rank on rank still surging up, we'll lift
Hosannahs to the God-of-Worlds, above!
His listening ear will catch our minor, sweet,
Making the concord of the spheres complete! 
A Dream of Democracy
Depressed in spirit and harassed by thought
Of war, and all its festering, foul brood,--
Grim death, gaunt suffering and loathsome food--
I fell into a trance, being much o'er-wrought:
A vision marvelous my fancy caught!
Afar upon the Mount of Ages, stood
Old Father Time; and from his hands a flood--
(Increased by countless putrid streams that brought
Debris of all earth's cruelty and crime,
Intolerance, injustice, rape and wrong,
Until the putrefaction, stench and slime
Befouled the universe) swept swift along,
And lost itself in a deep crystal sea,--
The cleansing Ocean of Democracy. 
Peril
As, when some filthy sore grows menacing,
Polluting all the currents of pure air,
Dispersing its vile atoms everywhere—
While with death-poisoned tentacles they cling,
To our hearts' treasuries, devouring,
And laying waste the temples of our care,—
The surgeon with blade kind but firm lays bare
And cuts away the flesh, foul, festering:—
So must the learned doctors of the State
Relentlessly cut the leprous sore
Of prejudice! else will they find too late,
Its rank corruption eating thro' the core
Of human brotherhood! Grim germs of Hate,
Razing our kingdom with titanic roar! 
Soul-Growth
(Upon the lack of opportunity afforded the Negro)
 
Atom of God! spark of the Infinite!
Illimitable thy majestic sway,
Where influences salutary play,
Thy powers to unfold to utmost height!
Potential gods, all, all who strive aright,
Defended from the pompous world's array
Of hostile forces, dragging to decay
Ideals of highest honor, truth and right:
Nurtured by rain and shine the queenly rose
In sheltered garden to perfection grows;
But on the desert, without loving care,
Is left to perish miserably there.
So with the Soul! if faith and culture fail,
"'Twill grow deformed and choked within the veil"! 
Negro Players on Broadway
Behold! a Star is trembling in the East,
Whose pale light heralds a triumphant day,
The greatness of whose promise none can say,
Nor who the guest of honor at the feast,
When from the thrall of prejudice released,
Men see the Soul behind the Veil of Clay.
Then brother recognizing brother, may
Divine that least is great and great is least.
 
A beacon in the wilderness, O Star,
With ox-like eyes we note your lureful gleam.
And Star, so faintly shining from afar,
With God-like faith we watch the widening stream
Of light! Ho, Christ has come! the perfect day
In glory breaks never to pass away! 
The Goal
("To make the world safe for democracy ")
 
Exalted goal! Oh, coveted ideal,
Which but to contemplate, causes to steal
Within the heart, the sting of ecstasy!
Oh, fateful words! Oh, potent prophecy,
Which yet shall make entrenched wrong to reel
And stagger from the place of power—to feel
The odium of men, outraged, set free!
Tho' now the words are empty, void of life,
And soothly uttered to allay the strife
And discontent with which the world is rife,
These words shall yet become a fervent creed,
And vivified to meet The Peoples' need,
Shall fructify into heroic deed. 
Race-Hate 
What infamies have been condoned, O Hate,
What sin, what guilt, what horrors in thy name!
Such bestial revelries which else would shame
The darkest heathen in his virgin state!
Yet know that judgment on thine acts doth wait,
And Time will write with pen of leaping flame
The ghastly story—how thou didst defame
God's living temples—craven, crafty Hate!
For thou hast none deceived, not e'en thyself,
Thy bloody hands are raised for power and pelf!
Hath not the lesson of the Ages taught,
Thy seeming triumphs are too dearly bought?
Cold seas of blood convulse thy coward heart;
Already crushed, defeated, doomed thou art! 
Silent Protest Parade
Were you there? Did you see? Gods! wasn't it fine!
Did you notice how straight we kept the line,
As we marched down the famous avenue,
Silent, dogged and dusky of hue,
Keeping step to the sound of the muffled drum,
With its constantly recurring tum—tum, tum—
Tum—Tum—Tum—Tum—Tum;
Ten thousand of us, if there was one!
As goodly a sight as this ancient sun
Has ever looked upon!
 
      Youth and maid
Father, mother—not one afraid
Or ashamed to let the whole world know
What he thought of the hellish East St. Louis "show,"
Orgy—riot—mob—what you will,
Where men and e'en women struggled to kill
Poor black workers, who'd fled in distress from the South
To find themselves murdered and mobbed in the North.
 
We marched as a protest—we carried our banner,
On which had been boldly inscribed every manner
Of sentiment—all, to be sure, within reason—
But no flag—not that we meant any treason-
Only who'd have the heart to carry Old Glory,
After hearing all of the horrible story,
Of East St. Louis? and never a word,
From the nation's head, as if he'd not heard
The groans of the dying ones here at home,
Though 'tis plain he can hear even farther than Rome.
 
Oh, yes, I was there in the Silent Parade,
And a man (he was white) I heard when he said,
"If they had music now, 'twould be great!"—
"We march not, sir, with hearts elate,
But sad; we grieve for our dark brothers
Murdered, and we hope that others
Will heed our protest against wrong,
Will help to make our protest strong."
 
Were you there? Ah, brothers, wasn't it fine! 
The children God bless 'em headed the line;
Then came the mothers dressed in white,
And some my word! 'twas a thrilling sight
Carried their babies upon their breast,
Face tense and eager as forward they pressed,
With never a laugh and never a word,
But ever and always, the thing they heard
Was the tum—tum—, tum, tum, 
Of the muffled drum—tum, tum, tum!
 
And last the black-coated men swung by,
Head up, chest firm, determined eye—
I was so happy, I wanted to cry.
As I watched the long lines striding by,
(Ten thousand souls if there was one)
And I knew that "to turn, the worm had begun,"
As we marched down Fifth Avenue unafraid
And calm, in our first Silent Protest Parade! 
Little Mother (Upon the Lynching of Mary Turner)
Oh, tremble, Little Mother,
For your dark-eyed, unborn babe,
Whom in your secret heart you've named
The well-loved name of "Gabe."
 
    For Gabriel is the father's name,
    And the son is sure to be
    "Just like his father!" as she wants
    The whole, wide world to see!
 
But tremble, Little Mother,
For your unborn baby's fate;
The father tarries long away
Why does he stay so late?
 
    For dark the night and weird the wind,
    And chilled the heart with fear!
    What are those hideous sounds and cries
    Each instant drawing near?
 
Oh, tremble, dark-faced mother,
At the dreadful word that falls
From lips of pale-faced demons,
As the black man pleads and calls.
 
    For they're dragging Gabe, at a stout rope's end,
    And they say, "She is bound to tell!"
    Something she knows not a thing about,
    Or they'll "Give her the same as well!"
 
Oh, tremble, helpless mother!
They're beating down the door,
And you'll never feel the father's kiss,
Or the stir of the baby more.
    Oh, the human beasts were ruthless,
    And there upon the ground,
    Two bodies--and an unborn babe--
    The ghastly morning found.
    
    
    Deceived
To war I gave my first-born, debonair
And over-flowing with the joy of life!
His heart was empty of all thought of strife--
He dreamed of radiant life devoid of care.
 
When next Columbia called I gave--I gave--
My little lad, my babe, my youngest-born,
Full of the light and promise of the morn,
And ready his beloved land to save.
 
These two I gave, my first-born and my last,
The Alpha and Omega of my love's dream,
So rudely shattered by war's lurid gleam
My all into her seething cauldron cast!
 
Whose--whose the condemnation then, if I
Shame the false lips that lured them with a lie?
The Black Draftee From Dixie
(Twelve Negro soldiers who had served overseas were
lynched upon their return to their homes in the South)
 
Upon his dull ear fell the stern command;
And tho' scarce knowing why or whither, he
Went forth prepared to battle loyally,
And questioned not your faith, O Dixie-land!
 
And tho' the task assigned were small or grand,--
If toiling at mean tasks ingloriously,
Or in fierce combat fighting valiantly,--
With poise magnificent he took his stand!
 
What tho' the hero-warrior was black?
His heart was white and loyal to the core;
And when to his loved Dixie he came back,
Maimed, in the duty done on foreign shore,
Where from the hell of war he never flinched,
Because he cried, "Democracy," was lynched.
Tercentenary of the Landing of Slaves at Jamestown 1619-1919
Upon the slaver's deck, a motley band
Of blacks looked out upon the boundless main,
Knowing with anguished hearts that ne'er again
Their feet, with pride, would press their native land;
Theirs thenceforth to obey the rude command
Of masters, wielding cruel lash and chain,
Wringing three centuries of toil and pain
From helpless slaves!--Then waved war's magic wand,
And, at the sign, up rose twelve million men--
A brave, patriotic host, of great power,
To serve America in her crucial hour;
Titanic power, to bless or curse; for when
Pent wrong, injustice and oppression break,
Vesuvius-like, the heart of earth they shake!
Tomorrow
("Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand")
 
Tomorrow! magic word of promise rare,
What witchery inheres in thy sweet name,
Inspiring wild ambition, naught can tame,
To conquer failure--here or otherwhere;
The rosy rapture thou dost ever bear
Upon thy brow, is but the beacon-flame--
The luminous lodestone, luring on to fame
And high endeavor! Simple friend, beware
The fool who says, "Tomorrow--never comes";
For opportunities like bursting bombs
Shall blast the walls that limit us Today.
And all, who wish within its scope to stay.
Time has no end save in eternity
Of which Tomorrow is the prophecy.
Futility
(To be a Negro in America!)
 
To feel emotion struggling and to need
O Christ, the power to speak the pregnant word,
That o'er these earthly thunders might be heard
And flame the souls of men to glorious deed--
 
To know the spirit's urge to rise and lead
The "hosts that sit in darkness"--to be stirred
To light a world, by wrong dimmed and blurred,
To cry aloud against the groveling greed
Of men, with faces ominous and pale,
Who stultify the souls of darker men,--
All this to see, to know, to feel and then--
And then, ignoble, shameful word, to fail,
Because convention spurns my human cry,
Because, oh, luckless fortune, I am I!
Our Women of the Canteen
Who shall tell the story of our women of the canteen?
Our women, golden, dusk and brown
Ministering in France to our brave boys,
Our brave, black boys
Fighting in Flanders!
Our stevedores in France unloading the ships,
Building the roads in Picardy,
That world-democracy might be a dream come true!
Was a soldier broken, dazed and exhausted by the hell of war?
Was his heart breaking with thoughts of home?
Did he yearn hungrily for mother, wife or sister?
 
Then would come these women
Dusk and gold and brown,
And with the tender, ministering hand of mother,
Or with the camaraderie of sister
Or the soul-sympathy of an understanding wife,
These dark women of the canteen
Would mirror to our boys
A bit of home, in France,
Heartening them for a return to the trenches,
And to the building of the roads,
And the unloading of the ships.
Oh, who shall sing the glory
Of our women of the canteen!
The Freedman
Aged and broken and helpless,
Sapped with the toil of years,
Dumbly he questions the future,
Haunted and shaken with fears.
 
Slowly he searches the sad past;
Naught does he find there to shame
Faith of his heart--he was loyal,
But whose was the treason the blame?
 
Blindly he faces Life's problems;
Where are his children? full five
Filial sons strove and labored;
He knows not if one be alive!
 
Meekly he ponders, he wonders,
Why, in God's name, he should be
Adrift without rudder or compass,
Sore-smitten with age, on Life's sea.
 
Vainly he questions the Power
Almighty, that sweeps us along,
The lonely ones sighing and crying,
The mighty rejoicing with song.
 
Aged and broken and helpless,
Sapped with the toil of the years,
Dumbly he questions the future
Haunted and shaken with fears.
An Easter Message
Now quivering to life, all nature thrills
At the approach of that triumphant queen,
Pink-fingered Easter, trailing robes of green
Swishingly o'er the flower-embroidered hills,
Her hair perfumed of myriad daffodils:
Upon her trembling bosom now is seen
The frail sweet lilies with their snowy sheen
As sprightly she o'ersteps the springtime rills.
To black folk choked within the deadly grasp
Of racial hate, what message does she bring
Of resurrection and the hope of spring?
Assurance their death-stupor is a mask--
A sleep, with elements potential rife,
Ready to burst full-flowered into life! 
Shrines
Each heart bows low before some cherished shrine!
Westminster Abbey with its sainted dead
Is hallowed ground where millions yet shall tread;
Love rears the Taj Mahal of rare design,
And wondrous beauty wrought in every line;
To Rome and Athens other hosts have led,
And where the great Napoleon makes his bed;
The faithful dream of ancient Palestine.
Some seek the home of poet, martyr, seer,
Of ruler, beggar, saint or cavalier,
According as these lives have left impress
Upon the soul of man, his life to bless.
Each heart bows low before some cherished shrine
The bitter cross where John Brown hung is mine.
Like You
Like you, He came unknown and poor,
And closed to Him was every door.
His race, like yours, was held in scorn,
Like yours, was humble and forlorn.
Like you, He was of men despised!
(So deeply was the King disguised.)
The Roman rulers heeded not
The manger-cradle,--His rude cot.
But Wise Men watching in the East
Knew, the greatest is often least.
They followed His Star, brought priceless things,
Bowed low and worshipped the King of Kings!

APPEAL
 
Three centuries beneath your haughty heel,
Humble and ignorant, debased and poor,
Like mendicants before your Temple-door,
The potentates of earth have seen us kneel.
With guileless art we made our mute appeal,
And tho' you scorned and spurned us, tried the more
To love and serve you better than before.
Your children we have nursed, your evening meal
Set forth: your crops have reaped, your acres tilled,
Your burdens borne, your enemies have killed;
We've given of our brawn unstintingly,
And of our brain, when so you'd let it be.
Remembering all, how can you lynch and hate,
And with our quivering clay, your passion sate?
 
II
DEMAND
 
Torn from our heritage against our will,
And here detained by blood-hound and by lash,
From dawn to darkness driven by "po' white trash,"
The onerous tasks to do,--the soil to till,
Helping your dream of empire to fulfill--
Thro' blood-baptism and the clanging clash
Of war, and its swift clarifying flash--
The present finds us citizens (tho’ nil
Our rights and powers in the common state)--
Who with the volume of Niagara's roar
And strength with which her giant waters pour,
Demand, with vigor which shall not abate
All the prerogatives which are our due
Without regard to race or creed or hue.
 
Ill
WARNING
 
The Law that spins these toy-top worlds in space,
Divides the opaque darkness from the day,
Directs the shining of each solar ray,
Guides and controls the stellar chariot-race,
And holds the whirling universe in place--
Altho' no particle may stop or stay--
This Law immutable, you may not sway,
Or modify, or alter by your grace!
Unfailingly the tides of ocean flow,
The giant oaks and modest pansies grow,
Inexorably following the deed
Comes without haste and without pause, the meed.
A tiny tendril creviced in the rock,
In time will burst apart a granite block.
Old Ironsides!
(Formerly the estate of Commodore Stewart, commander of vessel of the same name, and famous in the Civil War; now a school for the training of Colored Youth)
 
Old Ironsides! Historic spot so fair,
Whose generous-spreading acres beckon, where
In silent beauty sweeps the Delaware,
I love you!
 
High on your bluff commanding
I looked afar,
And saw in retrospect the place where war
Dark, grim and terrible
Forced Washington and his brave men
Barefoot across the icy flood,
Fighting for independence!
'Twas liberty for which they fought--
Relief from tyranny they sought--
These heroes whom I sing.
 
Around this hallowed spot there cling,
E'en yet soul-stirring memories,
Of those who walked your paths!
Have not these groves re-echoed to the cry
"Before we bend to tyrants, we will die!"
Brave souls who wrought ofttimes perchance in pain,
Yet not one agony endured in vain!
 
Time has destroyed "The Mansion" utterly,
And here the walk has crumbled to decay;
Upon that knoll, rank grows the shrubbery,
And if one glances yonder, there one sees
The avenue of old wild-cherry trees--
Dim vestiges of former glory!
Now gone are those who labored, hoped and loved;
Yet their indomitable spirit lives,
And to these dark-faced children gives
The moving inspiration!
 
Today I note your busy crowded halls,
Filled with those youths whom learning calls
To higher destinies!
The noisy workshop sounds again
To tune of hammer, saw and plane,
As earnest effort moulds to shape
The useful things that go to make
Man's lot more comfortable.
 
If to be striving--contented in the work,--
Which none would think to shirk,--
If to love nature and her beauties rare,
Here bountifully spread with careless care,
If to be drinking at the fount
Which makes men wise,
And all-encircling the cerulean skies--
If these things make the heaven for which man sighs,
Then here, Old Ironsides, is paradise!
The Flight
Away down south in Dixie-land
The place where they were born,
Where grows the cotton, silver-white
Tobacco, cane and corn--
 
I see your beauty, feel your charm;
I knew your ancient lure
For those dark earth-sprites, who for you
Did pain untold endure!
 
But now the cabin lonely stands
Beneath the spreading tree;
The old plantation echoes not
The weird slave-melody!
 
Gone! all are gone! how strange it seems!
I miss their gleaming eyes--
Their loud guffaws, whose hearty ring
Floats lightly to the skies.
 
What do they seek? Where have they fled?
Why do they roam afar?
They go to find the Promised Land,
With gates of Hope ajar.
 
Where schools stand ready to impart
The precious Rule of Three;
And high ambition may be served
To even the last degree.
 
Where aspiration soars aloft,
And self-respect may grow;
Where none would limit nor confine
The man who wants to know.
 
O Southland, that they loved so well,
The time will come when you
Wishing them back, will learn the truth
That faithful friends are few!
Weeds
The little house in which I live looks out
Upon a garden, where I love to walk,
Or sit and dream and listen to the talk
Of others, moving restlessly about.
Sometimes the echo of a merry shout,--
Again the raucous tones of those who mock,
Of those who yield and e'en of those who knock,
Inflame my heart, or chill my soul with doubt.
 
These human plants within the garden growing
Are they the fruit, the sample of the sowing?
And the stink-weeds that flourish wildly there,
Are they as well the objects of His care?
Of malice, envy, hate and strife, God knows
Injustice is the rankest weed that grows.
The Gift
A priceless gift within your hand is laid,
A jewel fashioned by the Master's art;
No fleck or flaw bedims its perfect heart,
More precious than are emeralds—opals--jade.
This gift, for which gold never can be paid,
Is freely given by a Friend, whose part
It is to teach its magic--to impart
A knowledge of the why the gift was made.
Possession of this talismanic gift,
Like old Aladdin's wonder-lamp, will lift
Earth mortals high as heaven, rightly used;
But doom to Stygian darkness, if abused.
'Tis yours to will what picture shall appear:
The gift, a pure, unsullied, glad New Year!
Respite
At close of day, I couch me at my ease
In solitude, far from dull mammon's roar,
And let the rain of thought upon me pour
In showers, hard or soft as they may please:
Sometimes like gentle patter, thro’ the trees,
Of joyous rains of spring, they touch the core
Of my parched self, reviving flowers of yore--
Pansies and sweet forget-me-nots, to tease
Old memories! sometimes a torrent breaks
Raging with fiendish fury 'til it shakes
My world of dreams wrecking my castles there,
Leaving my gardens desolate and bare,
When, from life's gilded pleasures shut away,
I seek my lonely couch at close of day.
The Birth of a Nation
Stay! vain, deluded man!
Know not you never can
Attain unto your high estate and rich,
While holding your dark brother in the ditch?
 
Hold! rash, misguided fool!
Why will you be the tool
Of passions, devilish, ignoble, base,
Wherein no God-like action one can trace?
 
Traducer of a race,
You, who are fair of face,
Stop! lest the children of a darker hue
In love, shall prove superior to you!
 
O, brother, pause! reflect!
Each cause has its effect,
This is the law: your acts or soon or late,
Will reap a bounteous harvest,--hate for hate.
Prayer for Deliverance
Father omnipotent,
God of the universe,
Thou Great Jehovah,
            We humbly beseech Thee!
 
Harken our loud lament,
See Thou our naked need,
Heed Thou our earnest prayer,
            Witness our tears!
 
Father, the enemy
Stealeth our lives away,
Feedeth us bitter bread,
            Abaseth our pride!
 
O God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob,
Of saints and of prophets,
            Our trust is in Thee!
 
Scourge him who scoffeth us--
Useth us despitefully--
Stealeth our substance
            Thy vengeance, we pray!
 
O Thou who knowest all,
O Thou who seest all,
O Thou who rulest all,
            Flay and spare not!
            
            
            Vanitas
He breathlessly pursued the dream of Fame
Spurred on by a desire insatiate,
To win a place secure and make a name
Renowned! Thus daily striving, soon and late
He wrought; but ever as he closer came
The goal receded: then with quickened gait,
Disdaining aught of censure or of blame,
He gained the height he sought with heart elate!
Oh, blessed height which he had seen afar,
Thro' gloom and sunshine, thro' distress and pain,
But ever luring, guiding as the star
Of hope, or as the rainbow after rain:
When lo! the sacred Temple-door was barred
Against his tarnished, craven soul, sin-scarred!
Moods
Daybreak in the meadow      
            and the song of the lark in the sky;
All my hopes are winging and soaring
            --so high, so high!
 
Nightfall in the forest
            and the nightingale's sobbing song;
All my hopes are dead and the darkness
            --so long, so long! 
            
            
            
            To ------
Dear friend of mine whose magnet-heart
Hath joined mine own to thee,
Where'er with changing years thou art
Or near or far from me.
 
O friend of mine, I'd have thee know
How dear I hold thy worth!
Thy sweet companionship, I vow
O'ertops the gauds of earth.
 
Dear friend of mine, this faithful thought
May joy and solace be,--
Not separation, death, no! Naught
Can change my love for thee!
Son
We wandered through the meadow, green and cool,
My romping, joyous little son and I.
Bright was the rippling stream and we, withal,
So gay, we noted not the flying hours
'Til suddenly the sun had set, and gray,
Dim shadows o'er the earth began to creep.
 
No longer now he sang in childish glee,
Or sought the modest flower in cranny hid;
But close beside me walked in sober mood,
His hand close-clasped in mine; then coaxingly,
"Tis dark, dear father; please, sir, take me home!"
 
My little son to manhood now has grown;
No longer fears he shadows dim and gray;
In fearlessness of youth, he braves the dark,
But I, who know the dangers of the dark
And all the ills which do in darkness lurk,
 
Am fearful, lest he stumble and so fall
Into the pit: but when Life's Day is done,
When burst all the bubbles he has chased,
And creeping come the shadows of the night,
Do Thou, dear Father, hold his trembling hand
And through the darkness lead him gently Home.
Friendship
Not by the dusty stretch of days
Slow-gathering to lengthening years
            We measure friendship's chain,
But by the understanding touch,
The smile, the soul-kiss, yea, the tears
            That ease the load of pain.
Abandonment
I want to sail out on the flood-tide of life,
To the uttermost reaches of self;
Forgetting the petty conventions of men,
And the scramble for power and pelf.
 
I want to sail out to the Island-of-Love,
And couch myself there on your breast,
To be soothed by your passionate viol-sweet voice,
And lulled by its music to rest.
 
I want to be warmed by the sun of your smile,
Refreshed by the rain of your tears,
Content in the clasp of your compassing arms,
As we drift down the tide of the years.
 
I want to float out on the ebb-tide of life,
As mutely the death watch you keep,
And feel the quick pulse of your quivering lips
As I fall in the last dreamless sleep.
Tears
The World today is sad,
No light is in her eye,
How cold and pale she seems!
The dull, gray ashes on her lips
Choke back the rippling thrills of glee
That yesterday, a joyous river flowed.
Why does she weep incessantly--
With now and then a momentary lull
Succeeded by an outburst
More terrific?
I wonder if her heart like mine,
Pent and restrained,
Is sometimes full beyond control!
Then comes the torrent, merciful,
Relieving, cleansing, purging,
And washing free of care and dross,
The Soul left clean and purified.
Quest
My goal out-distances the utmost star,
Yet is encompassed in my inmost Soul;
I am my goal--my quest, to know myself.
To chart and compass this unfathomed sea,
Myself must plumb the boundless universe.
My Soul contains all thought, all mystery,
All wisdom of the Great Infinite Mind:
This to discover, I must voyage far,
At last to find it in my pulsing heart.
Loss
            But yesterday
The wealth of all the world
Did not exceed in value the great gift
That heaven to me did send:
            Today
The humblest beggar in the land
Is infinitely richer than am I,
For I have lost--a friend.
Entreaty
O, thou, who art more fair than words can tell
Or a fond lover's nimble fancy paint,
May I not come to thee, where thou dost dwell
With hope that thou wilt heed my mournful plaint?
O, Iove, thou canst not choose but tender be,
Knowing my every heart-beat is for thee!
Together
O, come, Love, let us take a walk,
Down the Way-of-Life together;
Storms may come, but what care we,
If be fair or foul the weather.
 
When the sky overhead is blue,
Balmy, scented winds will after
Us, adown the valley blow
Haunting echoes of our laughter.
 
When Life's storms upon us beat
Crushing us with fury, after
All is done, there'll ringing come
Mocking echoes of our laughter.
 
So we'll walk the Way-of-Life,
You and I, Love, both together,
Storm or sunshine, happy we
If be foul or fair the weather.
Sunday on Grasmere Lake
It was that sweet time we call the twilight hour,
On peaceful Grasmere Lake we idly rowed:
Before us, matchless beauty lay revealed
In sky and hill and gently sloping wood.
 
The myriad thoughts that to our lips came thronging
We could not speak, but all entrancéd sat
While at our boat in tender rhythmic cadence
The laughing, dancing wavelets softly tapped.
 
No scene in all creation could be sweeter!
The tiny cloud that o'er the hill-top hung,
The quiet vale, the brown dove-cote * half hidden
Would fire to song even the most halting tongue.
 
Small wonder that the poet was inspired
To sing of this fair spot he loved so well!
Not Bobbie Burns nor yet the Bard of Avon
Could of his haunts a lovelier story tell.
 
Then suddenly in voice deep and subdued
One began the "Ode" of Wordsworth's to repeat,
"On Immortality," thus ending fitly
A holy day with holy joy complete.
Life and Death
            Life 
 
I saw the candle brightly burning in the room!
The fringéd curtains gracefully draped back,
The windows, crystal clear!
Upon the generous hearth
Quick Wit and bubbling Laughter
   Flashed and danced,
   Sparkled and pranced,
And music to the glowing scene lent cheer.
It was a gracious sight,
So full of life, of love, of light!
 
            Death 
 
Then suddenly I saw a cloud of gloom
Take form within the room:
A blue-grey mist obscured the window-panes
And silent fell the rout!
Then from the shadows, came the Dreaded Shape,--
The candle flickered out!
God
I know a lot of folk who think
That God
Is just a great, big tub
Of Grub.
Descanting on His bounty
They will measure
His prodigal treasure
By so many
"Head o' hogs," "bushel o' grain" or "barr'l o' potatoes!"
 
But to me 
God is the lily's dream,
The low, sweet note
In the thrush's throat--
The sun-beam's glory by a dew-drop caught!
He is the mighty tide
Gripping old ocean's side--
The mountain's thought!
Spring
Spring, thou wilful, changeful maid,
Venturesome, yet half afraid
King Winter to defy,
Come, with all thy airs and graces,
Perfumes sweet and flower-laces;
When he thy rare beauty faces,
He, of love, will die.
Poetry
What is poetry?
A thought of beauty--truth,
An emotion rife with ruth—
With love!
All rhythmically expressed,
Carefully groomed--exquisitely dressed.
Ecstasy
Your eyes star-worlds of beauty are,
My long road blazing from afar,
                        Sweet Emily!
 
The essence of the rose's musk
Bathes your wine-lips as through the dusk
                        They summon me!
 
The downy pillows of your breast,
Sweet Eden where my soul would rest
                        Eternally!
Compensation
In my infinity of loss
I seek to find the gain,--
The tender glance, the word of love,
The kiss divine--in vain!
No priceless gem of memory,
But ah! the pain, the pain!
Egyptian Sphinx
Inscrutable and awe-inspiring Sphinx,
Inimitable and immortal, whose
Majestic head of massed and matted kinks
Constrains alike the savant and the muse
To marvel at thy muted mystery!
What age-long memories thy face betrays!
What moving visions thou hast seen--dost see!
Thou art the symbol that, to present days,
The ancient years indubitably links!
Wherever men their righteous voices raise
Such deeds of grandeur to extol and praise,
The Sons of Africa, who builded thee,
Through us shall swell the song of jubilee:
And matchless thou shalt stand, imperial Sphinx.
Beautiful Hands
To a Skilful Surgeon 
 
Not perfectly moulded, not smooth and cold
Suggesting the touch of senseless gold,
But warm and pulsing hands, tenderly
Thrilling the wealth of a heart to me.
 
Hands that are willing and busy and warm;
Hands that are eager to shelter from harm;
Hands that are capable--potent indeed,
Quickly outstretched to another's need.
 
Ready and restful hands, loving and strong,
But soothing and soft as a lullaby song;
Hands with the magic given suffering to ease;
Oh, who would not worship such dear hands as these!
Lincoln
Upon the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial at 
Washington, May 30, 1922 
 
Son of the people, softly, sweetly rest!
Thy universal heart felt all the woes
Of mankind! They only were thy foes
Who hated right--who loved the evil best:
How hard man's cruelty upon thee pressed,
Thy deeply-lined and tragic visage shows!
Thy great soul-agony, only God knows,
When this great Union's fate was put to test!
But trusting in Jehovah's power to guide,
Nor caring if the whole world should deride,
With granite will, thou stoodst the Right beside.
Thus from the lowly cabin thou didst climb
To hallow this memorial sublime,
And men shall love thee to the end of time.
Old Ocean and the Shore
Lovers in Three Moods 
 
I
 
Smiling, big and full of joy,
I saw Old Ocean rush upon the Shore:
With wide-spread arms
He caught her to his heart.
I heard him chuckle softly to himself;
I saw his fingers stroke her sea-weed hair;
He kissed and kissed and kissed again
Her lush, responsive lips!
   And she who had been pale and cold 
   Grew warm and dimpled at his touch. 
 
II
 
I saw Old Ocean sullen, moody, mad;
The Shore stretched out her shell-like hands in vain;
No bubbling laughter greeted her sad ear;
He offered no caress.
He glowered at her, grumbling through his teeth!
Oh, he was dark and sinister!
He would not look upon her, waiting, wan!
   God! I could better bear his blows 
   Than this indifference! 
 
Ill
 
I heard Old Ocean warring in his wrath!
He shook and slashed and swore with fury!
With heavy fists he beat upon the Shore;
He tore her hair;
He screamed and raged;
He bruised her tender, shining flesh;
He gripped her with the strength of many giants,--
Shrieking—lashing—kicking--
Until at length, his jealous fury spent,
He sank exhausted in her waiting arms!
   " ‘Tis well," the Shore said softly, 
   "For he loveth much."
   
   The New Year
The New Year comes--fling wide, fling wide the door
Of Opportunity! the spirit free
To scale the utmost heights of hopes to be,
To rest on peaks ne'er reached by man before!
The boundless infinite let us explore,
To search out undiscovered mystery,
Undreamed of in our poor philosophy!
The bounty of the gods upon us pour!
Nay, in the New Year we shall be as gods:
No longer apish puppets or dull clods
Of clay; but poised, empowered to command,
Upon the Etna of New Worlds we'll stand--
This scant earth-raiment to the winds will cast--
Full richly robed as supermen at last!

INTRODUCTION TO LYRICS OF LOWLY LIFE
I think I should scarcely trouble the reader with a special appeal in
behalf of this book, if it had not specially appealed to me for reasons
apart from the author's race, origin, and condition. The world is too
old now, and I find myself too much of its mood, to care for the work of
a poet because he is black, because his father and mother were slaves,
because he was, before and after he began to write poems, an
elevator-boy. These facts would certainly attract me to him as a man, if
I knew him to have a literary ambition, but when it came to his literary
art, I must judge it irrespective of these facts, and enjoy or endure it
for what it was in itself.
It seems to me that this was my experience with the poetry of Paul
Laurence Dunbar when I found it in another form, and in justice to him I
cannot wish that it should be otherwise with his readers here. Still, it
will legitimately interest those who like to know the causes, or, if
these may not be known, the sources, of things, to learn that the father
and mother of the first poet of his race in our language were negroes
without admixture of white blood. The father escaped from slavery in
Kentucky to freedom in Canada, while there was still no hope of freedom
otherwise; but the mother was freed by the events of the civil war, and
came North to Ohio, where their son was born at Dayton, and grew up with
such chances and mischances for mental training as everywhere befall the
children of the poor. He has told me that his father picked up the trade
of a plasterer, and when he had taught himself to read, loved chiefly to
read history. The boy's mother shared his passion for literature, with a
special love of poetry, and after the father died she struggled on in
more than the poverty she had shared with him. She could value the
faculty which her son showed first in prose sketches and attempts at
fiction, and she was proud of the praise and kindness they won him among
the people of the town, where he has never been without the warmest and
kindest friends.
In fact from every part of Ohio and from several cities of the adjoining
States, there came letters in cordial appreciation of the critical
recognition which it was my pleasure no less than my duty to offer Paul
Dunbar's work in another place. It seemed to me a happy omen for him
that so many people who had known him, or known of him, were glad of a
stranger's good word; and it was gratifying to see that at home he was
esteemed for the things he had done rather than because as the son of
negro slaves he had done them. If a prophet is often without honor in
his own country, it surely is nothing against him when he has it. In
this case it deprived me of the glory of a discoverer; but that is
sometimes a barren joy, and I am always willing to forego it.
What struck me in reading Mr. Dunbar's poetry was what had already
struck his friends in Ohio and Indiana, in Kentucky and Illinois. They
had felt, as I felt, that however gifted his race had proven itself in
music, in oratory, in several of the other arts, here was the first
instance of an American negro who had evinced innate distinction in
literature. In my criticism of his book I had alleged Dumas in France,
and I had forgetfully failed to allege the far greater Pushkin in
Russia; but these were both mulattoes, who might have been supposed to
derive their qualities from white blood vastly more artistic than ours,
and who were the creatures of an environment more favorable to their
literary development. So far as I could remember, Paul Dunbar was the
only man of pure African blood and of American civilization to feel the
negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically. It seemed to me that
this had come to its most modern consciousness in him, and that his
brilliant and unique achievement was to have studied the American negro
objectively, and to have represented him as he found him to be, with
humor, with sympathy, and yet with what the reader must instinctively
feel to be entire truthfulness. I said that a race which had come to
this effect in any member of it, had attained civilization in him, and I
permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the
prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to
vanish in the arts; that these were to be the final proof that God had
made of one blood all nations of men. I thought his merits positive and
not comparative; and I held that if his black poems had been written by
a white man, I should not have found them less admirable. I accepted
them as an evidence of the essential unity of the human race, which does
not think or feel, black in one and white in another, but humanly in
all.
Yet it appeared to me then, and it appears to me now, that there is a
precious difference of temperament between the races which it would be a
great pity ever to lose, and that this is best preserved and most
charmingly suggested by Mr. Dunbar in those pieces of his where he
studies the moods and traits of his race in its own accent of our
English. We call such pieces dialect pieces for want of some closer
phrase, but they are really not dialect so much as delightful personal
attempts and failures for the written and spoken language. In nothing is
his essentially refined and delicate art so well shown as in these
pieces, which, as I ventured to say, described the range between
appetite and emotion, with certain lifts far beyond and above it, which
is the range of the race. He reveals in these a finely ironical
perception of the negro's limitations, with a tenderness for them which
I think so very rare as to be almost quite new. I should say, perhaps,
that it was this humorous quality which Mr. Dunbar had added to our
literature, and it would be this which would most distinguish him, now
and hereafter. It is something that one feels in nearly all the dialect
pieces; and I hope that in the present collection he has kept all of
these in his earlier volume, and added others to them. But the contents
of this book are wholly of his own choosing, and I do not know how much
or little he may have preferred the poems in literary English. Some of
these I thought very good, and even more than very good, but not
distinctively his contribution to the body of American poetry. What I
mean is that several people might have written them; but I do not know
any one else at present who could quite have written the dialect pieces.
These are divinations and reports of what passes in the hearts and minds
of a lowly people whose poetry had hitherto been inarticulately
expressed in music, but now finds, for the first time in our tongue,
literary interpretation of a very artistic completeness.
I say the event is interesting, but how important it shall be can be
determined only by Mr. Dunbar's future performance. I cannot undertake
to prophesy concerning this; but if he should do nothing more than he
has done, I should feel that he had made the strongest claim for the
negro in English literature that the negro has yet made. He has at
least produced something that, however we may critically disagree about
it, we cannot well refuse to enjoy; in more than one piece he has
produced a work of art.

I held my heart so far from harm                                 255
I found you and I lost you                                       251
I know a man                                                     235
I know my love is true                                            58
I know what the caged bird feels, alas!                          102
I never shall furgit that night when father hitched up Dobbin     42
I sit upon the old sea wall                                      115
I stand above the city's rush and din                            275
I stood by the shore at the death of day                          69
I think that though the clouds be dark                            53
I was not; now I am--a few days hence                             17
If Death should claim me for her own to-day                      210
If life were but a dream, my Love                                 75
If the muse were mine to tempt it                                 50
If thro' the sea of night which here surrounds me                256
If 'twere fair to suppose                                        258
If you could sit with me beside the sea to-day                    21
In a small and lonely cabin out of noisy traffic's way           124
In de dead of night I sometimes                                  260
In Life's Red Sea with faith I plant my feet                     110
In the east the morning comes                                    199
In the heavy earth the miner                                     107
In the forenoon's restful quiet                                   95
In the silence of my heart                                       110
In this sombre garden close                                      209
In the tents of Akbar                                            223
In this old garden, fair, I walk to-day                          111
I's a-gittin' weary of de way dat people do                      244
I's boun' to see my gal to-night                                 142
I's feelin' kin' o' lonesome in my little room to-night          202
It is as if a silver chord                                       216
It may be misery not to sing at all                              225
It was Chrismus Eve, I mind hit fu' a mighty gloomy day          137
It's all a farce,--these tales they tell                          56
It's hot to-day. The bees is buzzin'                             279
It's moughty tiahsome layin' 'roun'                              195
I've a humble little motto                                        46
I've always been a faithful man                                  267
I've been list'nin' to them lawyers                               22
I've been watchin' of 'em, parson                                 39
I've journeyed 'roun' consid'able, a-seein' men an' things       147
Jes' lak toddy wahms you thoo'                                   148
Just whistle a bit, if the day be dark                            98
Key and bar, key and bar                                         201
Kiss me, Miami, thou most constant one!                          277
Know you, winds that blow your course                             40
Lay me down beneaf de willers in de grass                        142
Lead gently, Lord, and slow                                       98
Let me close the eyes of my soul                                 261
Let those who will stride on their barren roads                  214
'Lias! 'Lias! Bless de Lawd!                                     190
Like sea-washed sand upon the shore                              202
Like the blush upon the rose                                     282
Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes                             134
Little brown face full of smiles                                 267
Little lady at de do'                                            177
Long had I grieved at what I deemed abuse                        106
Long since, in sore distress, I heard one pray                   123
Long time ago, we too set out                                    119
Long years ago, within a distant clime                           104
Love hath the wings of the butterfly                             117
Love is the light of the world, my dear                          231
Love me. I care not what the circling years                       89
Love used to carry a bow, you know                               258
Lucy done gone back on me                                        136
Mammy's in de kitchen, an' de do' is shet                        241
Mastah drink his ol' Made'a                                      213
Men may sing of their Havanas, elevating to the stars            129
Mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two                  79
My cot was down by a cypress grove                                 8
My heart to thy heart                                             13
My lady love lives far away                                      288
My muvver's ist the nicest one                                   247
My neighbor lives on the hill                                    192
My soul, lost in the music's mist                                 76
Night, dim night, and it rains, my love, it rains                227
Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy                           90
Not o'er thy dust let there be spent                              18
No matter what you call it                                       287
Not they who soar, but they who plod                              18
Not to the midnight of the gloomy past                           214
O li'l' lamb out in de col'                                      133
O Lord, the hard-won miles                                        11
O Mother Race! to thee I bring                                    15
October is the treasurer of the year                              63
Oh, de clouds is mighty heavy                                    169

Oh, dere's lots o' keer an' trouble                               20
Oh for the breath of the briny deep                               92
Oh, I am hurt to death, my Love                                   72
Oh, I des received a letter f'om de sweetest little gal          266
Oh, I haven't got long to live, for we all                        48
Oh, summer has clothed the earth                                  91
Oh the breeze is blowin' balmy                                   262
Oh, the day has set me dreaming                                  107
Oh, the little bird is rocking in the cradle of the wind         245
Oh, the poets may sing of their Lady Irenes                       26
Oh to have you in May                                            166
Oh, what shall I do? I am wholly upset                           131
Oh, who is the Lord of the land of life                          268
Oh, who would be sad tho' the sky be a-graying                   236
Oh, wind of the spring-time, oh, free wind of May                221
On a summer's day as I sat by a stream                           248
On the wide veranda white                                         59
Once Love grew bold and arrogant of air                          102
One night in my room, still and beamless                         109
Our good knight, Ted, girds his broadsword on                    108
Out in de night a sad bird moans                                 194
Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing                  64
Out of my heart, one day, I wrote a song                         117
Out of my heart, one treach'rous winter's day                    102
Out of the sunshine and out of the heat                          167
Outside the rain upon the street                                 253
Over the hills and the valleys of dreaming                        90
Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day                       74
Place this bunch of mignonette                                    66
Poor withered rose, she gave it me                               286
Pray, what can dreams avail                                      104
Pray why are you so bare, so bare                                219
Prometheus stole from Heaven the sacred fire                     117
Ring out, ye bells!                                              278
Round the wide earth, from the red field your valour has won     112
Say a mass for my soul's repose, my brother                      211
Search thou my heart                                             116

Shadder in de valley                                             226
She gave a rose                                                  103
She sang, and I listened the whole song thro'                    121
She told the story, and the whole world wept                     119
She told her beads with downcast eyes                            106
She wrapped her soul in a lace of lies                           240
Silence, and whirling worlds afar                                263
Silently without my window                                        54
Since I left the city's heat                                     263
Slow de night's a-fallin'                                        186
Slow moves the pageant of a climbing race                        211
So we, who 'we supped the selfsame cup                            40
Some folks t'inks hit's right an' p'opah                         201
Standin' at de winder                                            253
Step me now a bridal measure                                     248
Step wid de banjo an' glide wid de fiddle                        269
Storm and strife and stress                                      227
Summah night an' sighin' breeze                                  132
Summah's nice, wif sun a-shinin'                                 132
Summer is de lovin' time                                         262
Sunshine on de medders                                           168
Sweetest of the flowers a-blooming                               237
Swing yo' lady roun' an' roun'                                   200
Tek a cool night, good an' cleah                                 150
Tell your love where the roses blow                              238
Temples he built, and palaces of air                             100
The air is dark, the sky is gray                                  65
The change has come, and Helen sleeps                             58
The cloud looked in at the window                                 72
The draft of love was cool and sweet                             252
The gray dawn on the mountain top                                248
The gray of the sea, and the gray of the sky                      93
The lake's dark breast                                             8
The lark is silent in his nest                                    61
The little bird sits in the nest and sings                        67
The Midnight wooed the Morning-Star                               99
The mist has left the greening plain                             252
The moon begins her stately ride                                 276
The moon has left the sky, love                                   46
The night is dewy as a maiden's mouth                             64
The November sun invites me                                      282
The poor man went to the rich man's doors                        106
The rain streams down like harpstrings from the sky              270
The river sleeps beneath the sky                                   9
The sand-man he's a jolly old fellow                             235
The sky of brightest gray seems dark                              59
The smell of the sea in my nostrils                               91
The snow lies deep upon the ground                               105
The sun has slipped his tether                                   100
The sun hath shed its kindly light                               281
The sun is low                                                   285
The trees bend down along the stream                             249
The wind is out in its rage to-night                             244
The wind told the little leaves to hurry                         258
The word is writ that he who runs may read                       209
The world is a snob, and the man who wins                        118
The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair                       52
Ther' ain't no use in all this strife                             49
There are no beaten paths to Glory's height                       21
There is a heaven, for ever, day by day                          106
There's a fabulous story                                         246
There's a memory keeps a-runnin'                                  10
These are the days of elfs and fays                              251
They please me not--these solemn songs                           125
This is the debt I pay                                           213
This is to-day, a golden summer's day                            223
This poem must be done to-day                                    122
Thou arrant robber, Death!                                       284
"Thou art a fool," said my head to my heart                        5
Thou art my lute, by thee I sing                                 109
Thou art the soul of a summer's day                              271
Though the winds be dank                                          71
Thy tones are silver melted into sound                           116

'Tis better to set here beside the sea                           186
'Tis fine to play                                                235

LYRICS OF LOWLY LIFE
ERE SLEEP COMES DOWN TO SOOTHE THE WEARY EYES
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    Which all the day with ceaseless care have sought
  The magic gold which from the seeker flies;
    Ere dreams put on the gown and cap of thought,
  And make the waking world a world of lies,--
    Of lies most palpable, uncouth, forlorn,
  That say life's full of aches and tears and sighs,--
    Oh, how with more than dreams the soul is torn,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    How all the griefs and heart-aches we have known
  Come up like pois'nous vapors that arise
    From some base witch's caldron, when the crone,
  To work some potent spell, her magic plies.
    The past which held its share of bitter pain,
  Whose ghost we prayed that Time might exorcise,
    Comes up, is lived and suffered o'er again,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    What phantoms fill the dimly lighted room;
  What ghostly shades in awe-creating guise
    Are bodied forth within the teeming gloom.
  What echoes faint of sad and soul-sick cries,
    And pangs of vague inexplicable pain
  That pay the spirit's ceaseless enterprise,
    Come thronging through the chambers of the brain,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    Where ranges forth the spirit far and free?
  Through what strange realms and unfamiliar skies
    Tends her far course to lands of mystery?
  To lands unspeakable--beyond surmise,
    Where shapes unknowable to being spring,
  Till, faint of wing, the Fancy fails and dies
    Much wearied with the spirit's journeying,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
    How questioneth the soul that other soul,--
  The inner sense which neither cheats nor lies,
    But self exposes unto self, a scroll
  Full writ with all life's acts unwise or wise,
    In characters indelible and known;
  So, trembling with the shock of sad surprise,
    The soul doth view its awful self alone,
  Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
  When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes,
    The last dear sleep whose soft embrace is balm,
  And whom sad sorrow teaches us to prize
    For kissing all our passions into calm,
  Ah, then, no more we heed the sad world's cries,
    Or seek to probe th' eternal mystery,
  Or fret our souls at long-withheld replies,
    At glooms through which our visions cannot see,
  When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes.
THE POET AND HIS SONG
  A song is but a little thing,
  And yet what joy it is to sing!
  In hours of toil it gives me zest,
  And when at eve I long for rest;
  When cows come home along the bars,
    And in the fold I hear the bell,
  As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,
    I sing my song, and all is well.
  There are no ears to hear my lays,
  No lips to lift a word of praise;
  But still, with faith unfaltering,
  I live and laugh and love and sing.
  What matters yon unheeding throng?
    They cannot feel my spirit's spell,
  Since life is sweet and love is long,
    I sing my song, and all is well.
  My days are never days of ease;
  I till my ground and prune my trees.
  When ripened gold is all the plain,
  I put my sickle to the grain.
  I labor hard, and toil and sweat,
    While others dream within the dell;
  But even while my brow is wet,
    I sing my song, and all is well.
  Sometimes the sun, unkindly hot,
  My garden makes a desert spot;
  Sometimes a blight upon the tree
  Takes all my fruit away from me;
  And then with throes of bitter pain
    Rebellious passions rise and swell;
  But--life is more than fruit or grain,
    And so I sing, and all is well.
RETORT
  "Thou art a fool," said my head to my heart,
  "Indeed, the greatest of fools thou art,
    To be led astray by the trick of a tress,
  By a smiling face or a ribbon smart;"
    And my heart was in sore distress.
  Then Phyllis came by, and her face was fair,
  The light gleamed soft on her raven hair;
    And her lips were blooming a rosy red.
  Then my heart spoke out with a right bold air:
    "Thou art worse than a fool, O head!"
ACCOUNTABILITY
  Folks ain't got no right to censuah othah folks about dey habits;
  Him dat giv' de squir'ls de bushtails made de bobtails fu' de rabbits.
  Him dat built de gread big mountains hollered out de little valleys,
  Him dat made de streets an' driveways wasn't shamed to make de alleys.
  We is all constructed diff'ent, d'ain't no two of us de same;
  We cain't he'p ouah likes an' dislikes, ef we'se bad we ain't to blame.
  Ef we 'se good, we need n't show off, case you bet it ain't ouah doin'
  We gits into su'ttain channels dat we jes' cain't he'p pu'suin'.
  But we all fits into places dat no othah ones could fill,
  An' we does the things we has to, big er little, good er ill.
  John cain't tek de place o' Henry, Su an' Sally ain't alike;
  Bass ain't nuthin' like a suckah, chub ain't nuthin' like a pike.
  When you come to think about it, how it 's all planned out it 's splendid.
  Nuthin 's done er evah happens, 'dout hit 's somefin' dat 's intended;
  Don't keer whut you does, you has to, an' hit sholy beats de dickens,--
  Viney, go put on de kittle, I got one o' mastah's chickens.
FREDERICK DOUGLASS
  A hush is over all the teeming lists,
    And there is pause, a breath-space in the strife;
  A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists
    And vapors that obscure the sun of life.
  And Ethiopia, with bosom torn,
  Laments the passing of her noblest born.
  She weeps for him a mother's burning tears--
    She loved him with a mother's deepest love.
  He was her champion thro' direful years,
    And held her weal all other ends above.
  When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust,
  He raised her up and whispered, "Hope and Trust."
  For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung
    That broke in warning on the ears of men;
  For her the strong bow of his power he strung,
    And sent his arrows to the very den
  Where grim Oppression held his bloody place
  And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.
  And he was no soft-tongued apologist;
    He spoke straightforward, fearlessly uncowed;
  The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist,
    And set in bold relief each dark hued cloud;
  To sin and crime he gave their proper hue,
  And hurled at evil what was evil's due.
  Through good and ill report he cleaved his way.
    Right onward, with his face set toward the heights,
  Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array,--
    The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites.
  He dared the lightning in the lightning's track,
  And answered thunder with his thunder back.
  When men maligned him, and their torrent wrath
    In furious imprecations o'er him broke,
  He kept his counsel as he kept his path;
    'T was for his race, not for himself he spoke.
  He knew the import of his Master's call,
  And felt himself too mighty to be small.
  No miser in the good he held was he,--
    His kindness followed his horizon's rim.
  His heart, his talents, and his hands were free
    To all who truly needed aught of him.
  Where poverty and ignorance were rife,
  He gave his bounty as he gave his life.
  The place and cause that first aroused his might
    Still proved its power until his latest day.
  In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right
    Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray;
  Wrong lived; his occupation was not gone.
  He died in action with his armor on!
  We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,
    And felt the magic of his presence nigh,
  The current that he sent throughout the land,
    The kindling spirit of his battle-cry.
  O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet,
  And place our banner where his hopes were set!
  Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,
    But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale!
  Thou 'st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar,
    And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.
  She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,
  She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,
  And, rising from beneath the chast'ning rod,
  She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!
LIFE
  A crust of bread and a corner to sleep in,
  A minute to smile and an hour to weep in,
  A pint of joy to a peck of trouble,
  And never a laugh but the moans come double;
          And that is life!
  A crust and a corner that love makes precious,
  With a smile to warm and the tears to refresh us;
  And joy seems sweeter when cares come after,
  And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter;
          And that is life!
THE LESSON
  My cot was down by a cypress grove,
    And I sat by my window the whole night long,
  And heard well up from the deep dark wood
    A mocking-bird's passionate song.
  And I thought of myself so sad and lone,
    And my life's cold winter that knew no spring;
  Of my mind so weary and sick and wild,
    Of my heart too sad to sing.
  But e'en as I listened the mock-bird's song,
    A thought stole into my saddened heart,
  And I said, "I can cheer some other soul
    By a carol's simple art."
  For oft from the darkness of hearts and lives
    Come songs that brim with joy and light,
  As out of the gloom of the cypress grove
    The mocking-bird sings at night.
  So I sang a lay for a brother's ear
    In a strain to soothe his bleeding heart,
  And he smiled at the sound of my voice and lyre,
    Though mine was a feeble art.
  But at his smile I smiled in turn,
    And into my soul there came a ray:
  In trying to soothe another's woes
    Mine own had passed away.
THE RISING OF THE STORM
    The lake's dark breast
    Is all unrest,
  It heaves with a sob and a sigh.
    Like a tremulous bird,
    From its slumber stirred,
  The moon is a-tilt in the sky.
    From the silent deep
    The waters sweep,
  But faint on the cold white stones,
    And the wavelets fly
    With a plaintive cry
  O'er the old earth's bare, bleak bones.
    And the spray upsprings
    On its ghost-white wings,
  And tosses a kiss at the stars;
    While a water-sprite,
    In sea-pearls dight,
  Hums a sea-hymn's solemn bars.
    Far out in the night,
    On the wavering sight
  I see a dark hull loom;
    And its light on high,
    Like a Cyclops' eye,
  Shines out through the mist and gloom.
    Now the winds well up
    From the earth's deep cup,
  And fall on the sea and shore,
    And against the pier
    The waters rear
  And break with a sullen roar.
    Up comes the gale,
    And the mist-wrought veil
  Gives way to the lightning's glare,
    And the cloud-drifts fall,
    A sombre pall,
  O'er water, earth, and air.
    The storm-king flies,
    His whip he plies,
  And bellows down the wind.
    The lightning rash
    With blinding flash
  Comes pricking on behind.
    Rise, waters, rise,
    And taunt the skies
  With your swift-flitting form.
    Sweep, wild winds, sweep,
    And tear the deep
  To atoms in the storm.
    And the waters leapt,
    And the wild winds swept,
  And blew out the moon in the sky,
    And I laughed with glee,
    It was joy to me
  As the storm went raging by!
SUNSET
  The river sleeps beneath the sky,
    And clasps the shadows to its breast;
  The crescent moon shines dim on high;
    And in the lately radiant west
      The gold is fading into gray.
      Now stills the lark his festive lay,
      And mourns with me the dying day.
  While in the south the first faint star
    Lifts to the night its silver face,
  And twinkles to the moon afar
    Across the heaven's graying space,
  Low murmurs reach me from the town,
  As Day puts on her sombre crown,
  And shakes her mantle darkly down.
THE OLD APPLE-TREE
  There's a memory keeps a-runnin'
    Through my weary head to-night,
  An' I see a picture dancin'
    In the fire-flames' ruddy light;
  'Tis the picture of an orchard
    Wrapped in autumn's purple haze,
  With the tender light about it
    That I loved in other days.
  An' a-standin' in a corner
    Once again I seem to see
  The verdant leaves an' branches
    Of an old apple-tree.
  You perhaps would call it ugly,
    An' I don't know but it's so,
  When you look the tree all over
    Unadorned by memory's glow;
  For its boughs are gnarled an' crooked,
    An' its leaves are gettin' thin,
  An' the apples of its bearin'
    Would n't fill so large a bin
  As they used to. But I tell you,
    When it comes to pleasin' me,
  It's the dearest in the orchard,--
    Is that old apple-tree.
  I would hide within its shelter,
    Settlin' in some cosy nook,
  Where no calls nor threats could stir me
    From the pages o' my book.
  Oh, that quiet, sweet seclusion
    In its fulness passeth words!
  It was deeper than the deepest
    That my sanctum now affords.
  Why, the jaybirds an' the robins,
    They was hand in glove with me,
  As they winked at me an' warbled
    In that old apple-tree.
  It was on its sturdy branches
    That in summers long ago
  I would tie my swing an' dangle
    In contentment to an' fro,
  Idly dreamin' childish fancies,
    Buildin' castles in the air,
  Makin' o' myself a hero
    Of romances rich an' rare.
  I kin shet my eyes an' see it
    Jest as plain as plain kin be,
  That same old swing a-danglin'
    To the old apple-tree.
  There's a rustic seat beneath it
    That I never kin forget.
  It's the place where me an' Hallie--
    Little sweetheart--used to set,
  When we 'd wander to the orchard
    So 's no listenin' ones could hear
  As I whispered sugared nonsense
    Into her little willin' ear.
  Now my gray old wife is Hallie,
    An' I 'm grayer still than she,
  But I 'll not forget our courtin'
    'Neath the old apple-tree.
  Life for us ain't all been summer,
    But I guess we 'we had our share
  Of its flittin' joys an' pleasures,
    An' a sprinklin' of its care.
  Oft the skies have smiled upon us;
    Then again we 've seen 'em frown,
  Though our load was ne'er so heavy
    That we longed to lay it down.
  But when death does come a-callin',
    This my last request shall be,--
  That they 'll bury me an' Hallie
    'Neath the old apple tree.
A PRAYER
  O Lord, the hard-won miles
    Have worn my stumbling feet:
  Oh, soothe me with thy smiles,
    And make my life complete.
  The thorns were thick and keen
    Where'er I trembling trod;
  The way was long between
    My wounded feet and God.
  Where healing waters flow
    Do thou my footsteps lead.
  My heart is aching so;
    Thy gracious balm I need.
PASSION AND LOVE
  A maiden wept and, as a comforter,
  Came one who cried, "I love thee," and he seized
  Her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath,
  That dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks.
  While evermore his boldly blazing eye
  Burned into hers; but she uncomforted
  Shrank from his arms and only wept the more.
  Then one came and gazed mutely in her face
  With wide and wistful eyes; but still aloof
  He held himself; as with a reverent fear,
  As one who knows some sacred presence nigh.
  And as she wept he mingled tear with tear,
  That cheered her soul like dew a dusty flower,--
  Until she smiled, approached, and touched his hand!
THE SEEDLING
  As a quiet little seedling
    Lay within its darksome bed,
  To itself it fell a-talking,
    And this is what it said:
  "I am not so very robust,
    But I 'll do the best I can;"
  And the seedling from that moment
    Its work of life began.
  So it pushed a little leaflet
    Up into the light of day,
  To examine the surroundings
    And show the rest the way.
  The leaflet liked the prospect,
    So it called its brother, Stem;
  Then two other leaflets heard it,
    And quickly followed them.
  To be sure, the haste and hurry
    Made the seedling sweat and pant;
  But almost before it knew it
    It found itself a plant.
  The sunshine poured upon it,
    And the clouds they gave a shower;
  And the little plant kept growing
    Till it found itself a flower.
  Little folks, be like the seedling,
    Always do the best you can;
  Every child must share life's labor
    Just as well as every man.
  And the sun and showers will help you
    Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
  Till you raise to light and beauty
    Virtue's fair, unfading flowers.
PROMISE
  I grew a rose within a garden fair,
  And, tending it with more than loving care,
  I thought how, with the glory of its bloom,
  I should the darkness of my life illume;
  And, watching, ever smiled to see the lusty bud
  Drink freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood.
  My rose began to open, and its hue
  Was sweet to me as to it sun and dew;
  I watched it taking on its ruddy flame
  Until the day of perfect blooming came,
  Then hasted I with smiles to find it blushing red--
  Too late! Some thoughtless child had plucked my rose and fled!
FULFILMENT.
  I grew a rose once more to please mine eyes.
  All things to aid it--dew, sun, wind, fair skies--
  Were kindly; and to shield it from despoil,
  I fenced it safely in with grateful toil.
  No other hand than mine shall pluck this flower, said I,
  And I was jealous of the bee that hovered nigh.
  It grew for days; I stood hour after hour
  To watch the slow unfolding of the flower,
  And then I did not leave its side at all,
  Lest some mischance my flower should befall.
  At last, oh joy! the central petals burst apart.
  It blossomed--but, alas! a worm was at its heart!
SONG
    My heart to thy heart,
      My hand to thine;
    My lip to thy lips,
      Kisses are wine
  Brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade;
  Let me drink deep, then, my African maid.
    Lily to lily,
      Rose unto rose;
    My love to thy love
      Tenderly grows.
  Rend not the oak and the ivy in twain,
  Nor the swart maid from her swarthier swain.
AN ANTE-BELLUM SERMON
  We is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs,
    In dis howlin' wildaness,
  Fu' to speak some words of comfo't
    To each othah in distress.
  An' we chooses fu' ouah subjic'
    Dis--we'll 'splain it by an' by;
    "An' de Lawd said, 'Moses, Moses,'
    An' de man said, 'Hyeah am I.'"
  Now ole Pher'oh, down in Egypt,
    Was de wuss man evah bo'n,
  An' he had de Hebrew chillun
    Down dah wukin' in his co'n;
  'T well de Lawd got tiahed o' his foolin',
    An' sez he: "I' ll let him know--
  Look hyeah, Moses, go tell Pher'oh
    Fu' to let dem chillun go."
  "An' ef he refuse to do it,
    I will make him rue de houah,
  Fu' I'll empty down on Egypt
    All de vials of my powah."
  Yes, he did--an' Pher'oh's ahmy
    Wasn't wuth a ha'f a dime;
  Fu' de Lawd will he'p his chillun,
    You kin trust him evah time.
  An' yo' enemies may 'sail you
    In de back an' in de front;
  But de Lawd is all aroun' you,
    Fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.
  Dey kin fo'ge yo' chains an' shackles
    F'om de mountains to de sea;
  But de Lawd will sen' some Moses
    Fu' to set his chillun free.
  An' de lan' shall hyeah his thundah,
    Lak a blas' f'om Gab'el's ho'n,
  Fu' de Lawd of hosts is mighty
    When he girds his ahmor on.
  But fu' feah some one mistakes me,
    I will pause right hyeah to say,
  Dat I 'm still a-preachin' ancient,
    I ain't talkin' 'bout to-day.
  But I tell you, fellah christuns,
    Things'll happen mighty strange;
  Now, de Lawd done dis fu' Isrul,
    An' his ways don't nevah change,
  An' de love he showed to Isrul
    Was n't all on Isrul spent;
  Now don't run an' tell yo' mastahs
    Dat I's preachin' discontent.
  'Cause I isn't; I'se a-judgin'
    Bible people by deir ac's;
  I 'se a-givin' you de Scriptuah,
    I 'se a-handin' you de fac's.
  Cose ole Pher'oh b'lieved in slav'ry,
    But de Lawd he let him see,
  Dat de people he put bref in,--
    Evah mothah's son was free.
  An' dahs othahs thinks lak Pher'oh,
    But dey calls de Scriptuah liar,
  Fu' de Bible says "a servant
    Is a-worthy of his hire."
  An' you cain't git roun' nor thoo dat,
    An' you cain't git ovah it,
  Fu' whatevah place you git in,
    Dis hyeah Bible too 'll fit.
  So you see de Lawd's intention,
    Evah sence de worl' began,
  Was dat His almighty freedom
    Should belong to evah man,
  But I think it would be bettah,
    Ef I'd pause agin to say,
  Dat I'm talkin' 'bout ouah freedom
    In a Bibleistic way.
  But de Moses is a-comin',
    An' he's comin', suah and fas'
  We kin hyeah his feet a-trompin',
    We kin hyeah his trumpit blas'.
  But I want to wa'n you people,
    Don't you git too brigity;
  An' don't you git to braggin'
    'Bout dese things, you wait an' see.
  But when Moses wif his powah
    Comes an' sets us chillun free,
  We will praise de gracious Mastah.
    Dat has gin us liberty;
  An' we 'll shout ouah halleluyahs,
    On dat mighty reck'nin' day,
  When we 'se reco'nised ez citiz'--
    Huh uh! Chillun, let us pray!
ODE TO ETHIOPIA
  O Mother Race! to thee I bring
  This pledge of faith unwavering,
    This tribute to thy glory.
  I know the pangs which thou didst feel,
  When Slavery crushed thee with its heel,
    With thy dear blood all gory.
  Sad days were those--ah, sad indeed!
  But through the land the fruitful seed
    Of better times was growing.
  The plant of freedom upward sprung,
  And spread its leaves so fresh and young--
    Its blossoms now are blowing.
  On every hand in this fair land,
  Proud Ethiope's swarthy children stand
    Beside their fairer neighbor;
  The forests flee before their stroke,
  Their hammers ring, their forges smoke,--
    They stir in honest labour.
  They tread the fields where honour calls;
  Their voices sound through senate halls
    In majesty and power.
  To right they cling; the hymns they sing
  Up to the skies in beauty ring,
    And bolder grow each hour.
  Be proud, my Race, in mind and soul;
  Thy name is writ on Glory's scroll
    In characters of fire.
  High 'mid the clouds of Fame's bright sky
  Thy banner's blazoned folds now fly,
    And truth shall lift them higher.
  Thou hast the right to noble pride,
  Whose spotless robes were purified
    By blood's severe baptism.
  Upon thy brow the cross was laid,
  And labour's painful sweat-beads made
    A consecrating chrism.
  No other race, or white or black,
  When bound as thou wert, to the rack,
    So seldom stooped to grieving;
  No other race, when free again,
  Forgot the past and proved them men
    So noble in forgiving.
  Go on and up! Our souls and eyes
  Shall follow thy continuous rise;
    Our ears shall list thy story
  From bards who from thy root shall spring,
  And proudly tune their lyres to sing
    Of Ethiopia's glory.
THE CORN-STALK FIDDLE
  When the corn 's all cut and the bright stalks shine
    Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;
  When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,
    And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;
  Then it's heigho! fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,
  For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.
  And you take a stalk that is straight and long,
    With an expert eye to its worthy points,
  And you think of the bubbling strains of song
    That are bound between its pithy joints--
  Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,
  With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.
  Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow
    O'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!
  And the music's flow never loud but low
    Is the concert note of a fairy band.
  Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle
  To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.
  When the eve comes on, and our work is done,
    And the sun drops down with a tender glance,
  With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,
    Come the neighbor girls for the evening's dance,
  And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle--
  More time than tune--from the corn-stalk fiddle.
  Then brother Jabez takes the bow,
    While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,
  Then Henry stops by Milly Snow,
    And John takes Nellie Jones's hand,
  While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,
  And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.
  "Salute your partners," comes the call,
    "All join hands and circle round,"
  "Grand train back," and "Balance all,"
    Footsteps lightly spurn the ground.
  "Take your lady and balance down the middle"
  To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.
  So the night goes on and the dance is o'er,
    And the merry girls are homeward gone,
  But I see it all in my sleep once more,
    And I dream till the very break of dawn
  Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle
  To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.
THE MASTER-PLAYER
  An old, worn harp that had been played
  Till all its strings were loose and frayed,
  Joy, Hate, and Fear, each one essayed,
  To play. But each in turn had found
  No sweet responsiveness of sound.
  Then Love the Master-Player came
  With heaving breast and eyes aflame;
  The Harp he took all undismayed,
  Smote on its strings, still strange to song,
  And brought forth music sweet and strong.
THE MYSTERY
  I was not; now I am--a few days hence
  I shall not be; I fain would look before
  And after, but can neither do; some Power
  Or lack of power says "no" to all I would.
  I stand upon a wide and sunless plain,
  Nor chart nor steel to guide my steps aright.
  Whene'er, o'ercoming fear, I dare to move,
  I grope without direction and by chance.
  Some feign to hear a voice and feel a hand
  That draws them ever upward thro' the gloom.
  But I--I hear no voice and touch no hand,
  Tho' oft thro' silence infinite I list,
  And strain my hearing to supernal sounds;
  Tho' oft thro' fateful darkness do I reach,
  And stretch my hand to find that other hand.
  I question of th' eternal bending skies
  That seem to neighbor with the novice earth;
  But they roll on, and daily shut their eyes
  On me, as I one day shall do on them,
  And tell me not the secret that I ask.
NOT THEY WHO SOAR
  Not they who soar, but they who plod
  Their rugged way, unhelped, to God
  Are heroes; they who higher fare,
  And, flying, fan the upper air,
  Miss all the toil that hugs the sod.
  'Tis they whose backs have felt the rod,
  Whose feet have pressed the path unshod,
  May smile upon defeated care,
    Not they who soar.
  High up there are no thorns to prod,
  Nor boulders lurking 'neath the clod
  To turn the keenness of the share,
  For flight is ever free and rare;
  But heroes they the soil who 've trod,
    Not they who soar!
WHITTIER
  Not o'er thy dust let there be spent
  The gush of maudlin sentiment;
  Such drift as that is not for thee,
  Whose life and deeds and songs agree,
  Sublime in their simplicity.
  Nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed.
  O singer sweet, thou art not dead!
  In spite of time's malignant chill,
  With living fire thy songs shall thrill,
  And men shall say, "He liveth still!"
  Great poets never die, for Earth
  Doth count their lives of too great worth
  To lose them from her treasured store;
  So shalt thou live for evermore--
  Though far thy form from mortal ken--
  Deep in the hearts and minds of men.
TWO SONGS
  A bee that was searching for sweets one day
  Through the gate of a rose garden happened to stray.
  In the heart of a rose he hid away,
  And forgot in his bliss the light of day,
  As sipping his honey he buzzed in song;
  Though day was waning, he lingered long,
    For the rose was sweet, so sweet.
  A robin sits pluming his ruddy breast,
  And a madrigal sings to his love in her nest:
  "Oh, the skies they are blue, the fields are green,
  And the birds in your nest will soon be seen!"
  She hangs on his words with a thrill of love,
  And chirps to him as he sits above
    For the song is sweet, so sweet.
  A maiden was out on a summer's day
  With the winds and the waves and the flowers at play;
  And she met with a youth of gentle air,
  With the light of the sunshine on his hair.
  Together they wandered the flowers among;
  They loved, and loving they lingered long,
    For to love is sweet, so sweet.
       *       *       *       *       *
  Bird of my lady's bower,
    Sing her a song;
  Tell her that every hour,
    All the day long,
  Thoughts of her come to me,
    Filling my brain
  With the warm ecstasy
    Of love's refrain.
  Little bird! happy bird!
    Being so near,
  Where e'en her slightest word
    Thou mayest hear,
  Seeing her glancing eyes,
    Sheen of her hair,
  Thou art in paradise,--
    Would I were there.
  I am so far away,
    Thou art so near;
  Plead with her, birdling gay,
  Plead with my dear.
  Rich be thy recompense,
    Fine be thy fee,
  If through thine eloquence
    She hearken me.
A BANJO SONG
  Oh, dere 's lots o' keer an' trouble
    In dis world to swaller down;
  An' ol' Sorrer 's purty lively
    In her way o' gittin' roun'.
  Yet dere's times when I furgit em,--
    Aches an' pains an' troubles all,--
  An' it's when I tek at ebenin'
    My ol' banjo f'om de wall.
  'Bout de time dat night is fallin'
    An' my daily wu'k is done,
  An' above de shady hilltops
    I kin see de settin' sun;
  When de quiet, restful shadders
    Is beginnin' jes' to fall,--
  Den I take de little banjo
    F'om its place upon de wall.
  Den my fam'ly gadders roun' me
    In de fadin' o' de light,
  Ez I strike de strings to try 'em
    Ef dey all is tuned er-right.
  An' it seems we 're so nigh heaben
    We kin hyeah de angels sing
  When de music o' dat banjo
    Sets my cabin all er-ring.
  An' my wife an' all de othahs,--
    Male an' female, small an' big,--
  Even up to gray-haired granny,
    Seem jes' boun' to do a jig;
  'Twell I change de style o' music,
    Change de movement an' de time,
  An' de ringin' little banjo
    Plays an ol' hea't-feelin' hime.
  An' somehow my th'oat gits choky,
    An' a lump keeps tryin' to rise
  Lak it wan'ed to ketch de water
    Dat was flowin' to my eyes;
  An' I feel dat I could sorter
    Knock de socks clean off o' sin
  Ez I hyeah my po' ol' granny
    Wif huh tremblin' voice jine in.
  Den we all th'ow in our voices
    Fu' to he'p de chune out too,
  Lak a big camp-meetin' choiry
    Tryin' to sing a mou'nah th'oo.
  An' our th'oahts let out de music,
    Sweet an' solemn, loud an' free,
  'Twell de raftahs o' my cabin
    Echo wif de melody.
  Oh, de music o' de banjo,
    Quick an' deb'lish, solemn, slow,
  Is de greates' joy an' solace
    Dat a weary slave kin know!
  So jes' let me hyeah it ringin',
    Dough de chune be po' an' rough,
  It's a pleasure; an' de pleasures
    O' dis life is few enough.
  Now, de blessed little angels
    Up in heaben, we are told,
  Don't do nothin' all dere lifetime
    'Ceptin' play on ha'ps o' gold.
  Now I think heaben 'd be mo' homelike
    Ef we 'd hyeah some music fall
  F'om a real ol'-fashioned banjo,
    Like dat one upon de wall.
LONGING
  If you could sit with me beside the sea to-day,
  And whisper with me sweetest dreamings o'er and o'er;
  I think I should not find the clouds so dim and gray,
  And not so loud the waves complaining at the shore.
  If you could sit with me upon the shore to-day,
  And hold my hand in yours as in the days of old,
  I think I should not mind the chill baptismal spray,
  Nor find my hand and heart and all the world so cold.
  If you could walk with me upon the strand to-day,
  And tell me that my longing love had won your own,
  I think all my sad thoughts would then be put away,
  And I could give back laughter for the Ocean's moan!
THE PATH
  There are no beaten paths to Glory's height,
  There are no rules to compass greatness known;
  Each for himself must cleave a path alone,
  And press his own way forward in the fight.
  Smooth is the way to ease and calm delight,
  And soft the road Sloth chooseth for her own;
  But he who craves the flower of life full-blown,
  Must struggle up in all his armor dight!
  What though the burden bear him sorely down
  And crush to dust the mountain of his pride,
  Oh, then, with strong heart let him still abide;
  For rugged is the roadway to renown,
  Nor may he hope to gain the envied crown,
  Till he hath thrust the looming rocks aside.
THE LAWYERS' WAYS
  I 've been list'nin' to them lawyers
    In the court house up the street,
  An' I 've come to the conclusion
    That I'm most completely beat.
  Fust one feller riz to argy,
    An' he boldly waded in
  As he dressed the tremblin' pris'ner
    In a coat o' deep-dyed sin.
  Why, he painted him all over
    In a hue o' blackest crime,
  An' he smeared his reputation
    With the thickest kind o' grime,
  Tell I found myself a-wond'rin',
    In a misty way and dim,
  How the Lord had come to fashion
    Sich an awful man as him.
  Then the other lawyer started,
    An' with brimmin', tearful eyes,
  Said his client was a martyr
    That was brought to sacrifice.
  An' he give to that same pris'ner
    Every blessed human grace,
  Tell I saw the light o' virtue
    Fairly shinin' from his face.
  Then I own 'at I was puzzled
    How sich things could rightly be;
  An' this aggervatin' question
    Seems to keep a-puzzlin' me.
  So, will some one please inform me,
    An' this mystery unroll--
  How an angel an' a devil
    Can persess the self-same soul?
ODE FOR MEMORIAL DAY
  Done are the toils and the wearisome marches,
    Done is the summons of bugle and drum.
  Softly and sweetly the sky over-arches,
    Shelt'ring a land where Rebellion is dumb.
  Dark were the days of the country's derangement,
    Sad were the hours when the conflict was on,
  But through the gloom of fraternal estrangement
    God sent his light, and we welcome the dawn.
  O'er the expanse of our mighty dominions,
    Sweeping away to the uttermost parts,
  Peace, the wide-flying, on untiring pinions,
    Bringeth her message of joy to our hearts.
  Ah, but this joy which our minds cannot measure,
    What did it cost for our fathers to gain!
  Bought at the price of the heart's dearest treasure,
    Born out of travail and sorrow and pain;
  Born in the battle where fleet Death was flying,
    Slaying with sabre-stroke bloody and fell;
  Born where the heroes and martyrs were dying,
    Torn by the fury of bullet and shell.
  Ah, but the day is past: silent the rattle,
    And the confusion that followed the fight.
  Peace to the heroes who died in the battle,
    Martyrs to truth and the crowning of Right!
  Out of the blood of a conflict fraternal,
    Out of the dust and the dimness of death,
  Burst into blossoms of glory eternal
    Flowers that sweeten the world with their breath.
  Flowers of charity, peace, and devotion
    Bloom in the hearts that are empty of strife;
  Love that is boundless and broad as the ocean
    Leaps into beauty and fulness of life.
  So, with the singing of paeans and chorals,
    And with the flag flashing high in the sun,
  Place on the graves of our heroes the laurels
    Which their unfaltering valor has won!
PREMONITION
      Dear heart, good-night!
  Nay, list awhile that sweet voice singing
    When the world is all so bright,
  And the sound of song sets the heart a-ringing,
    Oh, love, it is not right--
    Not then to say, "Good-night."
      Dear heart, good-night!
  The late winds in the lake weeds shiver,
    And the spray flies cold and white.
  And the voice that sings gives a telltale quiver--
    "Ah, yes, the world is bright,
      But, dearest heart, good-night!"
      Dear heart, good-night!
  And do not longer seek to hold me!
    For my soul is in affright
  As the fearful glooms in their pall enfold me.
    See him who sang how white
      And still; so, dear, good-night.
      Dear heart, good-night!
  Thy hand I 'll press no more forever,
    And mine eyes shall lose the light;
  For the great white wraith by the winding river
    Shall check my steps with might.
      So, dear, good-night, good-night!
RETROSPECTION
  When you and I were young, the days
    Were filled with scent of pink and rose,
    And full of joy from dawn till close,
  From morning's mist till evening's haze.
    And when the robin sung his song
    The verdant woodland ways along,
      We whistled louder than he sung.
  And school was joy, and work was sport
  For which the hours were all too short,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, the woods
    Brimmed bravely o'er with every joy
    To charm the happy-hearted boy.
  The quail turned out her timid broods;
    The prickly copse, a hostess fine,
    Held high black cups of harmless wine;
      And low the laden grape-vine swung
  With beads of night-kissed amethyst
  Where buzzing lovers held their tryst,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, the cool
    And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows
    When tumbling o'er the scented mows,
  Or stripping by the dimpling pool,
    Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face,
    Save where we 'd worn an ent'ring place.
      How with our shouts the calm banks rung!
  How flashed the spray as we plunged in,--
  Pure gems that never caused a sin!
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, we heard
    All sounds of Nature with delight,--
    The whirr of wing in sudden flight,
  The chirping of the baby-bird.
    The columbine's red bells were rung;
    The locust's vested chorus sung;
      While every wind his zithern strung
  To high and holy-sounding keys,
  And played sonatas in the trees--
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
  When you and I were young, we knew
    To shout and laugh, to work and play,
    And night was partner to the day
  In all our joys. So swift time flew
    On silent wings that, ere we wist,
    The fleeting years had fled unmissed;
      And from our hearts this cry was wrung--
  To fill with fond regret and tears
  The days of our remaining years--
    "When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young."
UNEXPRESSED
  Deep in my heart that aches with the repression,
    And strives with plenitude of bitter pain,
  There lives a thought that clamors for expression,
    And spends its undelivered force in vain.
  What boots it that some other may have thought it?
    The right of thoughts' expression is divine;
  The price of pain I pay for it has bought it,
    I care not who lays claim to it--'t is mine!
  And yet not mine until it be delivered;
    The manner of its birth shall prove the test.
  Alas, alas, my rock of pride is shivered--
    I beat my brow--the thought still unexpressed.
SONG OF SUMMER
  Dis is gospel weathah sho'--
    Hills is sawt o' hazy.
  Meddahs level ez a flo'
    Callin' to de lazy.
  Sky all white wif streaks o' blue,
    Sunshine softly gleamin',
  D'ain't no wuk hit's right to do,
    Nothin' 's right but dreamin'.
  Dreamin' by de rivah side
    Wif de watahs glist'nin',
  Feelin' good an' satisfied
    Ez you lay a-list'nin'
  To the little nakid boys
    Splashin' in de watah,
  Hollerin' fu' to spress deir joys
    Jes' lak youngsters ought to.
  Squir'l a-tippin' on his toes,
    So 's to hide an' view you;
  Whole flocks o' camp-meetin' crows
    Shoutin' hallelujah.
  Peckahwood erpon de tree
    Tappin' lak a hammah;
  Jaybird chattin' wif a bee,
    Tryin' to teach him grammah.
  Breeze is blowin' wif perfume,
    Jes' enough to tease you;
  Hollyhocks is all in bloom,
    Smellin' fu' to please you.
  Go 'way, folks, an' let me 'lone,
    Times is gettin' dearah--
  Summah's settin' on de th'one,
    An' I 'm a-layin' neah huh!
SPRING SONG
  A blue-bell springs upon the ledge,
  A lark sits singing in the hedge;
  Sweet perfumes scent the balmy air,
  And life is brimming everywhere.
  What lark and breeze and bluebird sing,
      Is Spring, Spring, Spring!
  No more the air is sharp and cold;
  The planter wends across the wold,
  And, glad, beneath the shining sky
  We wander forth, my love and I.
  And ever in our hearts doth ring
      This song of Spring, Spring!
  For life is life and love is love,
  'Twixt maid and man or dove and dove.
  Life may be short, life may be long,
  But love will come, and to its song
  Shall this refrain for ever cling
      Of Spring, Spring, Spring!
TO LOUISE
  Oh, the poets may sing of their Lady Irenes,
  And may rave in their rhymes about wonderful queens;
  But I throw my poetical wings to the breeze,
  And soar in a song to my Lady Louise.
  A sweet little maid, who is dearer, I ween,
  Than any fair duchess, or even a queen.
  When speaking of her I can't plod in my prose,
  For she 's the wee lassie who gave me a rose.
  Since poets, from seeing a lady's lip curled,
  Have written fair verse that has sweetened the world;
  Why, then, should not I give the space of an hour
  To making a song in return for a flower?
  I have found in my life--it has not been so long--
  There are too few of flowers--too little of song.
  So out of that blossom, this lay of mine grows,
  For the dear little lady who gave me the rose.
  I thank God for innocence, dearer than Art,
  That lights on a by-way which leads to the heart,
  And led by an impulse no less than divine,
  Walks into the temple and sits at the shrine.
  I would rather pluck daisies that grow in the wild,
  Or take one simple rose from the hand of a child,
  Then to breathe the rich fragrance of flowers that bide
  In the gardens of luxury, passion, and pride.
  I know not, my wee one, how came you to know
  Which way to my heart was the right way to go;
  Unless in your purity, soul-clean and clear,
  God whispers his messages into your ear.
  You have now had my song, let me end with a prayer
  That your life may be always sweet, happy, and fair;
  That your joys may be many, and absent your woes,
  O dear little lady who gave me the rose!
THE RIVALS
  'T was three an' thirty year ago,
  When I was ruther young, you know,
  I had my last an' only fight
  About a gal one summer night.
  'T was me an' Zekel Johnson; Zeke
  'N' me 'd be'n spattin' 'bout a week,
  Each of us tryin' his best to show
  That he was Liza Jones's beau.
  We could n't neither prove the thing,
  Fur she was fur too sharp to fling
  One over fur the other one
  An' by so doin' stop the fun
  That we chaps did n't have the sense
  To see she got at our expense,
  But that's the way a feller does,
  Fur boys is fools an' allus was.
  An' when they's females in the game
  I reckon men's about the same.
  Well, Zeke an' me went on that way
  An' fussed an' quarrelled day by day;
  While Liza, mindin' not the fuss,
  Jest kep' a-goin' with both of us,
  Tell we pore chaps, that's Zeke an' me,
  Was jest plum mad with jealousy.
  Well, fur a time we kep' our places,
  An' only showed by frownin' faces
  An' looks 'at well our meanin' boded
  How full o' fight we both was loaded.
  At last it come, the thing broke out,
  An' this is how it come about.
  One night ('t was fair, you'll all agree)
  I got Eliza's company,
  An' leavin' Zekel in the lurch,
  Went trottin' off with her to church.
  An' jest as we had took our seat
  (Eliza lookin' fair an' sweet),
  Why, I jest could n't help but grin
  When Zekel come a-bouncin' in
  As furious as the law allows.
  He 'd jest be'n up to Liza's house,
  To find her gone, then come to church
  To have this end put to his search.
  I guess I laffed that meetin' through,
  An' not a mortal word I knew
  Of what the preacher preached er read
  Er what the choir sung er said.
  Fur every time I 'd turn my head
  I could n't skeercely help but see
  'At Zekel had his eye on me.
  An' he 'ud sort o' turn an' twist
  An' grind his teeth an' shake his fist.
  I laughed, fur la! the hull church seen us,
  An' knowed that suthin' was between us.
  Well, meetin' out, we started hum,
  I sorter feelin' what would come.
  We 'd jest got out, when up stepped Zeke,
  An' said, "Scuse me, I 'd like to speak
  To you a minute." "Cert," said I--
  A-nudgin' Liza on the sly
  An' laughin' in my sleeve with glee,
  I asked her, please, to pardon me.
  We walked away a step er two,
  Jest to git out o' Liza's view,
  An' then Zeke said, "I want to know
  Ef you think you 're Eliza's beau,
  An' 'at I 'm goin' to let her go
  Hum with sich a chap as you?"
  An' I said bold, "You bet I do."
  Then Zekel, sneerin', said 'at he
  Did n't want to hender me.
  But then he 'lowed the gal was his
  An' 'at he guessed he knowed his biz,
  An' was n't feared o' all my kin
  With all my friends an' chums throwed in.
  Some other things he mentioned there
  That no born man could no ways bear
  Er think o' ca'mly tryin' to stan'
  Ef Zeke had be'n the bigges' man
  In town, an' not the leanest runt
  'At time an' labor ever stunt.
  An' so I let my fist go "bim,"
  I thought I 'd mos' nigh finished him.
  But Zekel did n't take it so.
  He jest ducked down an' dodged my blow
  An' then come back at me so hard,
  I guess I must 'a' hurt the yard,
  Er spilet the grass plot where I fell,
  An' sakes alive it hurt me; well,
  It would n't be'n so bad, you see,
  But he jest kep' a-hittin' me.
  An' I hit back an' kicked an' pawed,
  But 't seemed 't was mostly air I clawed,
  While Zekel used his science well
  A-makin' every motion tell.
  He punched an' hit, why, goodness lands,
  Seemed like he had a dozen hands.
  Well, afterwhile they stopped the fuss,
  An' some one kindly parted us.
  All beat an' cuffed an' clawed an' scratched,
  An' needin' both our faces patched,
  Each started hum a different way;
  An' what o' Liza, do you say,
  Why, Liza--little humbug--dern her,
  Why, she 'd gone home with Hiram Turner.
THE LOVER AND THE MOON
  A lover whom duty called over the wave,
    With himself communed: "Will my love be true
    If left to herself? Had I better not sue
  Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?
    But my friend might fail in my need," he said,
    "And I return to find love dead.
    Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,
    I will leave her in charge of the stable moon."
  Then he said to the moon: "O dear old moon,
    Who for years and years from thy thrown above
    Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,
  My heart has but come to its waiting June,
    And the promise time of the budding vine;
    Oh, guard thee well this love of mine."
    And he harked him then while all was still,
    And the pale moon answered and said, "I will."
  And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,
    And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:
    In isles of the south and in Orient lands,
  Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.
    But his star was high, so he braved the main,
    And sailed him blithely home again;
    And with joy he bended his footsteps soon
    To learn of his love from the matron moon.
  She sat as of yore, in her olden place,
    Serene as death, in her silver chair.
    A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,
  And the tint of a blush was on her face.
    At sight of the youth she sadly bowed
    And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.
    She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,
    But "How," spoke the youth, "have you kept your charge?"
  The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;
    The blush went out in her blanching cheek,
    And her voice was timid and low and weak,
  As she made her plea and sighed and wept.
    "Oh, another prayed and another plead,
    And I could n't resist," she answering said;
    "But love still grows in the hearts of men:
    Go forth, dear youth, and love again."
  But he turned him away from her proffered grace.
    "Thou art false, O moon, as the hearts of men,
    I will not, will not love again."
  And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face
    To the sea, and cried: "Sea, curse the moon,
    Who makes her vows and forgets so soon."
    And the awful sea with anger stirred,
    And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.
  And ever the moon wept down in rain,
    And ever her sighs rose high in wind;
    But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,
  And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.
    And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,
    The cries of a wraith through the thunder pierce;
    And the waves strain their awful hands on high
    To tear the false moon from the sky.
CONSCIENCE AND REMORSE
  "Good-bye," I said to my conscience--
    "Good-bye for aye and aye,"
  And I put her hands off harshly,
    And turned my face away;
  And conscience smitten sorely
    Returned not from that day.
  But a time came when my spirit
    Grew weary of its pace;
  And I cried: "Come back, my conscience;
    I long to see thy face."
  But conscience cried: "I cannot;
    Remorse sits in my place."
IONE
I
  Ah, yes, 't is sweet still to remember,
    Though 'twere less painful to forget;
  For while my heart glows like an ember,
    Mine eyes with sorrow's drops are wet,
    And, oh, my heart is aching yet.
  It is a law of mortal pain
    That old wounds, long accounted well,
    Beneath the memory's potent spell,
  Will wake to life and bleed again.
  So 't is with me; it might be better
    If I should turn no look behind,--
  If I could curb my heart, and fetter
    From reminiscent gaze my mind,
    Or let my soul go blind--go blind!
  But would I do it if I could?
    Nay! ease at such a price were spurned;
    For, since my love was once returned,
  All that I suffer seemeth good.
  I know, I know it is the fashion,
    When love has left some heart distressed,
  To weight the air with wordful passion;
    But I am glad that in my breast
    I ever held so dear a guest.
  Love does not come at every nod,
    Or every voice that calleth "hasten;"
    He seeketh out some heart to chasten,
  And whips it, wailing, up to God!
  Love is no random road wayfarer
    Who where he may must sip his glass.
  Love is the King, the Purple-Wearer,
    Whose guard recks not of tree or grass
    To blaze the way that he may pass.
  What if my heart be in the blast
    That heralds his triumphant way;
    Shall I repine, shall I not say:
  "Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!"
  In life, each heart holds some sad story--
    The saddest ones are never told.
  I, too, have dreamed of fame and glory,
    And viewed the future bright with gold;
    But that is as a tale long told.
  Mine eyes have lost their youthful flash,
    My cunning hand has lost its art;
    I am not old, but in my heart
  The ember lies beneath the ash.
  I loved! Why not? My heart was youthful,
    My mind was filled with healthy thought.
  He doubts not whose own self is truthful,
    Doubt by dishonesty is taught;
    So loved I boldly, fearing naught.
  I did not walk this lowly earth;
    Mine was a newer, higher sphere,
    Where youth was long and life was dear,
  And all save love was little worth.
  Her likeness! Would that I might limn it,
    As Love did, with enduring art;
  Nor dust of days nor death may dim it,
    Where it lies graven on my heart,
    Of this sad fabric of my life a part.
  I would that I might paint her now
    As I beheld her in that day,
    Ere her first bloom had passed away,
  And left the lines upon her brow.
  A face serene that, beaming brightly,
    Disarmed the hot sun's glances bold.
  A foot that kissed the ground so lightly,
    He frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,
    But loved her still though he was old.
  A form where every maiden grace
    Bloomed to perfection's richest flower,--
    The statued pose of conscious power,
  Like lithe-limbed Dian's of the chase.
  Beneath a brow too fair for frowning,
    Like moon-lit deeps that glass the skies
  Till all the hosts above seem drowning,
    Looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,
    With gaze serene and purely wise.
  And over all, her tresses rare,
    Which, when, with his desire grown weak,
    The Night bent down to kiss her cheek,
  Entrapped and held him captive there.
  This was Ione; a spirit finer
    Ne'er burned to ash its house of clay;
  A soul instinct with fire diviner
    Ne'er fled athwart the face of day,
    And tempted Time with earthly stay.
  Her loveliness was not alone
    Of face and form and tresses' hue:
    For aye a pure, high soul shone through
  Her every act: this was Ione.
II
  'T was in the radiant summer weather,
    When God looked, smiling, from the sky;
  And we went wand'ring much together
    By wood and lane, Ione and I,
    Attracted by the subtle tie
  Of common thoughts and common tastes,
    Of eyes whose vision saw the same,
    And freely granted beauty's claim
  Where others found but worthless wastes.
  We paused to hear the far bells ringing
    Across the distance, sweet and clear.
  We listened to the wild bird's singing
    The song he meant for his mate's ear,
    And deemed our chance to do so dear.
  We loved to watch the warrior Sun,
    With flaming shield and flaunting crest,
    Go striding down the gory West,
  When Day's long fight was fought and won.
  And life became a different story;
    Where'er I looked, I saw new light.
  Earth's self assumed a greater glory,
    Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.
    Then first I saw the need and might
  Of that fair band, the singing throng,
    Who, gifted with the skill divine,
    Take up the threads of life, spun fine,
  And weave them into soulful song.
  They sung for me, whose passion pressing
    My soul, found vent in song nor line.
  They bore the burden of expressing
    All that I felt, with art's design,
    And every word of theirs was mine.
  I read them to Ione, ofttimes,
    By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,
    And she looked deeply in mine eyes,
  And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.
  Her life was like the stream that floweth,
    And mine was like the waiting sea;
  Her love was like the flower that bloweth,
    And mine was like the searching bee--
    I found her sweetness all for me.
  God plied him in the mint of time,
    And coined for us a golden day,
    And rolled it ringing down life's way
  With love's sweet music in its chime.
  And God unclasped the Book of Ages,
    And laid it open to our sight;
  Upon the dimness of its pages,
    So long consigned to rayless night,
    He shed the glory of his light.
  We read them well, we read them long,
    And ever thrilling did we see
    That love ruled all humanity,--
  The master passion, pure and strong.
III
  To-day my skies are bare and ashen,
    And bend on me without a beam.
  Since love is held the master-passion,
    Its loss must be the pain supreme--
    And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.
  But pardon, dear departed Guest,
    I will not rant, I will not rail;
    For good the grain must feel the flail;
  There are whom love has never blessed.
  I had and have a younger brother,
    One whom I loved and love to-day
  As never fond and doting mother
    Adored the babe who found its way
    From heavenly scenes into her day.
  Oh, he was full of youth's new wine,--
    A man on life's ascending slope,
    Flushed with ambition, full of hope;
  And every wish of his was mine.
  A kingly youth; the way before him
    Was thronged with victories to be won;
  So joyous, too, the heavens o'er him
    Were bright with an unchanging sun,--
    His days with rhyme were overrun.
  Toil had not taught him Nature's prose,
    Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,
    And sorrow had not made him wise;
  His life was in the budding rose.
  I know not how I came to waken,
    Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;
  My heart by some vague thrill was shaken,--
    A thrill so true and yet so slight,
    I hardly deemed I read aright.
  As when a sleeper, ign'rant why,
    Not knowing what mysterious hand
    Has called him out of slumberland,
  Starts up to find some danger nigh.
  Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,
    But, having come, asserts his right;
  He will not be repressed nor hidden.
    And so my brother's dawning plight
    Became uncovered to my sight.
  Some sound-mote in his passing tone
    Caught in the meshes of my ear;
    Some little glance, a shade too dear,
  Betrayed the love he bore Ione.
  What could I do? He was my brother,
    And young, and full of hope and trust;
  I could not, dared not try to smother
    His flame, and turn his heart to dust.
    I knew how oft life gives a crust
  To starving men who cry for bread;
    But he was young, so few his days,
    He had not learned the great world's ways,
  Nor Disappointment's volumes read.
  However fair and rich the booty,
    I could not make his loss my gain.
  For love is dear, but dearer duty,
    And here my way was clear and plain.
  I saw how I could save him pain.
  And so, with all my day grown dim,
    That this loved brother's sun might shine,
    I joined his suit, gave over mine,
  And sought Ione, to plead for him.
  I found her in an eastern bower,
    Where all day long the am'rous sun
  Lay by to woo a timid flower.
    This day his course was well-nigh run,
    But still with lingering art he spun
  Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.
    The vines waved soft and green above,
    And there where one might tell his love,
  I told my griefs--I told her all!
  I told her all, and as she hearkened,
    A tear-drop fell upon her dress.
  With grief her flushing brow was darkened;
    One sob that she could not repress
    Betrayed the depths of her distress.
  Upon her grief my sorrow fed,
    And I was bowed with unlived years,
    My heart swelled with a sea of tears,
  The tears my manhood could not shed.
  The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,
    Disporting in the hour of doom.
  God made us men; times make the hero--
    But in that awful space of gloom
    I gave no thought but sorrow's room.
  All--all was dim within that bower,
    What time the sun divorced the day;
    And all the shadows, glooming gray,
  Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.
  She could not speak--no word was needed;
    Her look, half strength and half despair,
  Told me I had not vainly pleaded,
    That she would not ignore my prayer.
    And so she turned and left me there,
  And as she went, so passed my bliss;
    She loved me, I could not mistake--
    But for her own and my love's sake,
  Her womanhood could rise to this!
  My wounded heart fled swift to cover,
    And life at times seemed very drear.
  My brother proved an ardent lover--
    What had so young a man to fear?
    He wed Ione within the year.
  No shadow clouds her tranquil brow,
    Men speak her husband's name with pride,
    While she sits honored at his side--
  She is--she must be happy now!
  I doubt the course I took no longer,
    Since those I love seem satisfied.
  The bond between them will grow stronger
    As they go forward side by side;
    Then will my pains be jusfied.
  Their joy is mine, and that is best--
    I am not totally bereft;
    For I have still the mem'ry left--
  Love stopped with me--a Royal Guest!
RELIGION
  I am no priest of crooks nor creeds,
  For human wants and human needs
  Are more to me than prophets' deeds;
  And human tears and human cares
  Affect me more than human prayers.
  Go, cease your wail, lugubrious saint!
  You fret high Heaven with your plaint.
  Is this the "Christian's joy" you paint?
  Is this the Christian's boasted bliss?
  Avails your faith no more than this?
  Take up your arms, come out with me,
  Let Heav'n alone; humanity
  Needs more and Heaven less from thee.
  With pity for mankind look 'round;
  Help them to rise--and Heaven is found.
DEACON JONES' GRIEVANCE
  I 've been watchin' of 'em, parson,
    An' I 'm sorry fur to say
  'At my mind is not contented
    With the loose an' keerless way
  'At the young folks treat the music;
    'T ain't the proper sort o' choir.
  Then I don't believe in Christuns
    A-singin' hymns for hire.
  But I never would 'a' murmured
    An' the matter might 'a' gone
  Ef it was n't fur the antics
    'At I've seen 'em kerry on;
  So I thought it was my dooty
    Fur to come to you an' ask
  Ef you would n't sort o' gently
    Take them singin' folks to task.
  Fust, the music they 've be'n singin'
    Will disgrace us mighty soon;
  It 's a cross between a opry
    An' a ol' cotillion tune.
  With its dashes an' its quavers
    An' its hifalutin style--
  Why, it sets my head to swimmin'
    When I 'm comin' down the aisle.
  Now it might be almost decent
    Ef it was n't fur the way
  'At they git up there an' sing it,
    Hey dum diddle, loud and gay.
  Why, it shames the name o' sacred
    In its brazen wordliness,
  An' they 've even got "Ol' Hundred"
    In a bold, new-fangled dress.
  You 'll excuse me, Mr. Parson,
    Ef I seem a little sore;
  But I 've sung the songs of Isr'el
    For threescore years an' more,
  An' it sort o' hurts my feelin's
    Fur to see 'em put away
  Fur these harum-scarum ditties
    'At is capturin' the day.
  There 's anuther little happ'nin'
    'At I 'll mention while I 'm here,
  Jes' to show 'at my objections
    All is offered sound and clear.
  It was one day they was singin'
    An' was doin' well enough--
  Singin' good as people could sing
    Sich an awful mess o' stuff--
  When the choir give a holler,
    An' the organ give a groan,
  An' they left one weak-voiced feller
    A-singin' there alone!
  But he stuck right to the music,
    Tho' 't was tryin' as could be;
  An' when I tried to help him,
    Why, the hull church scowled at me.
  You say that's so-low singin',
    Well, I pray the Lord that I
  Growed up when folks was willin'
    To sing their hymns so high.
  Why, we never had sich doin's
    In the good ol' Bethel days,
  When the folks was all contented
    With the simple songs of praise.
  Now I may have spoke too open,
    But 'twas too hard to keep still,
  An' I hope you 'll tell the singers
    'At I bear 'em no ill-will.
  'At they all may git to glory
    Is my wish an' my desire,
  But they 'll need some extry trainin'
    'Fore they jine the heavenly choir.
ALICE
  Know you, winds that blow your course
    Down the verdant valleys,
  That somewhere you must, perforce,
    Kiss the brow of Alice?
  When her gentle face you find,
  Kiss it softly, naughty wind.
  Roses waving fair and sweet
    Thro' the garden alleys,
  Grow into a glory meet
    For the eye of Alice;
  Let the wind your offering bear
  Of sweet perfume, faint and rare.
  Lily holding crystal dew
    In your pure white chalice,
  Nature kind hath fashioned you
    Like the soul of Alice;
  It of purest white is wrought,
  Filled with gems of crystal thought.
AFTER THE QUARREL
  So we, who 've supped the self-same cup,
    To-night must lay our friendship by;
  Your wrath has burned your judgment up,
    Hot breath has blown the ashes high.
  You say that you are wronged--ah, well,
    I count that friendship poor, at best
  A bauble, a mere bagatelle,
    That cannot stand so slight a test.
  I fain would still have been your friend,
    And talked and laughed and loved with you;
  But since it must, why, let it end;
    The false but dies, 't is not the true.
  So we are favored, you and I,
    Who only want the living truth.
  It was not good to nurse the lie;
    'T is well it died in harmless youth.
  I go from you to-night to sleep.
    Why, what's the odds? why should I grieve?
  I have no fund of tears to weep
    For happenings that undeceive.
  The days shall come, the days shall go
    Just as they came and went before.
  The sun shall shine, the streams shall flow
    Though you and I are friends no more.
  And in the volume of my years,
    Where all my thoughts and acts shall be,
  The page whereon your name appears
    Shall be forever sealed to me.
  Not that I hate you over-much,
    'T is less of hate than love defied;
  Howe'er, our hands no more shall touch,
    We 'll go our ways, the world is wide.
BEYOND THE YEARS
I
  Beyond the years the answer lies,
  Beyond where brood the grieving skies
      And Night drops tears.
  Where Faith rod-chastened smiles to rise
      And doff its fears,
  And carping Sorrow pines and dies--
      Beyond the years.
II
  Beyond the years the prayer for rest
  Shall beat no more within the breast;
      The darkness clears,
  And Morn perched on the mountain's crest
      Her form uprears--
  The day that is to come is best,
      Beyond the years.
III
  Beyond the years the soul shall find
  That endless peace for which it pined,
      For light appears,
  And to the eyes that still were blind
      With blood and tears,
  Their sight shall come all unconfined
      Beyond the years.
AFTER A VISIT
  I be'n down in ole Kentucky
    Fur a week er two, an' say,
  'T wuz ez hard ez breakin' oxen
    Fur to tear myse'f away.
  Allus argerin' 'bout fren'ship
    An' yer hospitality--
  Y' ain't no right to talk about it
    Tell you be'n down there to see.
  See jest how they give you welcome
    To the best that's in the land,
  Feel the sort o' grip they give you
    When they take you by the hand.
  Hear 'em say, "We 're glad to have you,
    Better stay a week er two;"
  An' the way they treat you makes you
    Feel that ev'ry word is true.
  Feed you tell you hear the buttons
    Crackin' on yore Sunday vest;
  Haul you roun' to see the wonders
    Tell you have to cry for rest.
  Drink yer health an' pet an' praise you
    Tell you git to feel ez great
  Ez the Sheriff o' the county
    Ez the Gov'ner o' the State.
  Wife, she sez I must be crazy
    'Cause I go on so, an' Nelse
  He 'lows, "Goodness gracious! daddy,
    Cain't you talk about nuthin' else?"
  Well, pleg-gone it, I 'm jes' tickled,
    Bein' tickled ain't no sin;
  I be'n down in ole Kentucky,
    An' I want o' go ag'in.
CURTAIN
  Villain shows his indiscretion,
  Villain's partner makes confession.
  Juvenile, with golden tresses,
  Finds her pa and dons long dresses.
  Scapegrace comes home money-laden,
  Hero comforts tearful maiden,
  Soubrette marries loyal chappie,
  Villain skips, and all are happy.
THE SPELLIN'-BEE
  I never shall furgit that night when father hitched up Dobbin,
  An' all us youngsters clambered in an' down the road went bobbin'
  To school where we was kep' at work in every kind o' weather,
  But where that night a spellin'-bee was callin' us together.
  'Twas one o' Heaven's banner nights, the stars was all a glitter,
  The moon was shinin' like the hand o' God had jest then lit her.
  The ground was white with spotless snow, the blast was sort o' stingin';
  But underneath our round-abouts, you bet our hearts was singin'.
  That spellin'-bee had be'n the talk o' many a precious moment,
  The youngsters all was wild to see jes' what the precious show meant,
  An' we whose years was in their teens was little less desirous
  O' gittin' to the meetin' so 's our sweethearts could admire us.
  So on we went so anxious fur to satisfy our mission
  That father had to box our ears, to smother our ambition.
  But boxin' ears was too short work to hinder our arrivin',
  He jest turned roun' an' smacked us all, an' kep' right on a-drivin'.
  Well, soon the schoolhouse hove in sight, the winders beamin' brightly;
  The sound o' talkin' reached our ears, and voices laffin' lightly.
  It puffed us up so full an' big 'at I 'll jest bet a dollar,
  There wa'n't a feller there but felt the strain upon his collar.
  So down we jumped an' in we went ez sprightly ez you make 'em,
  But somethin' grabbed us by the knees an' straight began to shake 'em.
  Fur once within that lighted room, our feelin's took a canter,
  An' scurried to the zero mark ez quick ez Tam O'Shanter.
  'Cause there was crowds o' people there, both sexes an' all stations;
  It looked like all the town had come an' brought all their relations.
  The first I saw was Nettie Gray, I thought that girl was dearer
  'N' gold; an' when I got a chance, you bet I aidged up near her.
  An' Farmer Dobbs's girl was there, the one 'at Jim was sweet on,
  An' Cyrus Jones an' Mandy Smith an' Faith an' Patience Deaton.
  Then Parson Brown an' Lawyer Jones were present--all attention,
  An' piles on piles of other folks too numerous to mention.
  The master rose an' briefly said: "Good friends, dear brother Crawford,
  To spur the pupils' minds along, a little prize has offered.
  To him who spells the best to-night--or 't may be 'her'--no tellin'--
  He offers ez a jest reward, this precious work on spellin'."
  A little blue-backed spellin'-book with fancy scarlet trimmin';
  We boys devoured it with our eyes--so did the girls an' women.
  He held it up where all could see, then on the table set it,
  An' ev'ry speller in the house felt mortal bound to get it.
  At his command we fell in line, prepared to do our dooty,
  Outspell the rest an' set 'em down, an' carry home the booty.
  'T was then the merry times began, the blunders, an' the laffin',
  The nudges an' the nods an' winks an' stale good-natured chaffin'.
  Ole Uncle Hiram Dane was there, the clostest man a-livin',
  Whose only bugbear seemed to be the dreadful fear o' givin'.
  His beard was long, his hair uncut, his clothes all bare an' dingy;
  It wasn't 'cause the man was pore, but jest so mortal stingy;
  An' there he sot by Sally Riggs a-smilin' an' a-smirkin',
  An' all his children lef' to home a diggin' an' a-workin'.
  A widower he was, an' Sal was thinkin' 'at she 'd wing him;
  I reckon he was wond'rin' what them rings o' hern would bring him.
  An' when the spellin'-test commenced, he up an' took his station,
  A-spellin' with the best o' them to beat the very nation.
  An' when he 'd spell some youngster down, he 'd turn to look at Sally,
  An' say: "The teachin' nowadays can't be o' no great vally."
  But true enough the adage says, "Pride walks in slipp'ry places,"
  Fur soon a thing occurred that put a smile on all our faces.
  The laffter jest kep' ripplin' 'roun' an' teacher could n't quell it,
  Fur when he give out "charity" ole Hiram could n't spell it.
  But laffin' 's ketchin' an' it throwed some others off their bases,
  An' folks 'u'd miss the very word that seemed to fit their cases.
  Why, fickle little Jessie Lee come near the house upsettin'
  By puttin' in a double "kay" to spell the word "coquettin'."
  An' when it come to Cyrus Jones, it tickled me all over--
  Him settin' up to Mandy Smith an' got sot down on "lover."
  But Lawyer Jones of all gone men did shorely look the gonest,
  When he found out that he 'd furgot to put the "h" in "honest."
  An' Parson Brown, whose sermons were too long fur toleration,
  Caused lots o' smiles by missin' when they give out "condensation."
  So one by one they giv' it up--the big words kep' a-landin',
  Till me an' Nettie Gray was left, the only ones a-standin',
  An' then my inward strife began--I guess my mind was petty--
  I did so want that spellin'-book; but then to spell down Nettie
  Jest sort o' went ag'in my grain--I somehow could n't do it,
  An' when I git a notion fixed, I 'm great on stickin' to it.
  So when they giv' the next word out--I had n't orter tell it,
  But then 't was all fur Nettie's sake--I missed so's she could spell it.
  She spelt the word, then looked at me so lovin'-like an' mello',
  I tell you 't sent a hunderd pins a shootin' through a fello'.
  O' course I had to stand the jokes an' chaffin' of the fello's,
  But when they handed her the book I vow I was n't jealous.
  We sung a hymn, an' Parson Brown dismissed us like he orter,
  Fur, la! he 'd learned a thing er two an' made his blessin' shorter.
  'T was late an' cold when we got out, but Nettie liked cold weather,
  An' so did I, so we agreed we 'd jest walk home together.
  We both wuz silent, fur of words we nuther had a surplus,
  'Till she spoke out quite sudden like, "You missed that word on purpose."
  Well, I declare it frightened me; at first I tried denyin',
  But Nettie, she jest smiled an' smiled, she knowed that I was lyin'.
  Sez she: "That book is yourn by right;" sez I: "It never could be--
  I--I--you--ah--" an' there I stuck, an' well she understood me.
  So we agreed that later on when age had giv' us tether,
  We 'd jine our lots an' settle down to own that book together.
KEEP A-PLUGGIN' AWAY
  I 've a humble little motto
  That is homely, though it 's true,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  It's a thing when I 've an object
  That I always try to do,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  When you 've rising storms to quell,
  When opposing waters swell,
  It will never fail to tell,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  If the hills are high before
  And the paths are hard to climb,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  And remember that successes
  Come to him who bides his time,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  From the greatest to the least,
  None are from the rule released.
  Be thou toiler, poet, priest,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  Delve away beneath the surface,
  There is treasure farther down,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  Let the rain come down in torrents,
  Let the threat'ning heavens frown,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  When the clouds have rolled away,
  There will come a brighter day
  All your labor to repay,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  There 'll be lots of sneers to swallow,
  There 'll be lots of pain to bear,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  If you 've got your eye on heaven,
  Some bright day you 'll wake up there,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
  Perseverance still is king;
  Time its sure reward will bring;
  Work and wait unwearying,--
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
NIGHT OF LOVE
  The moon has left the sky, love,
    The stars are hiding now,
  And frowning on the world, love,
    Night bares her sable brow.
  The snow is on the ground, love,
    And cold and keen the air is.
  I 'm singing here to you, love;
    You 're dreaming there in Paris.
  But this is Nature's law, love,
    Though just it may not seem,
  That men should wake to sing, love,
    While maidens sleep and dream.
  Them care may not molest, love,
    Nor stir them from their slumbers,
  Though midnight find the swain, love,
    Still halting o'er his numbers.
  I watch the rosy dawn, love,
    Come stealing up the east,
  While all things round rejoice, love,
    That Night her reign has ceased.
  The lark will soon be heard, love,
    And on his way be winging;
  When Nature's poets wake, love,
    Why should a man be singing?
COLUMBIAN ODE
I
  Four hundred years ago a tangled waste
    Lay sleeping on the west Atlantic's side;
  Their devious ways the Old World's millions traced
    Content, and loved, and labored, dared and died,
  While students still believed the charts they conned,
    And revelled in their thriftless ignorance,
  Nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond
    Old Ocean's dense, indefinite expanse.
II
  But deep within her heart old Nature knew
    That she had once arrayed, at Earth's behest,
  Another offspring, fine and fair to view,--
    The chosen suckling of the mother's breast.
  The child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine,
    Each fold a work of Nature's matchless art;
  The mother looked on it with love divine,
    And strained the loved one closely to her heart.
  And there it lay, and with the warmth grew strong
    And hearty, by the salt sea breezes fanned,
  Till Time with mellowing touches passed along,
    And changed the infant to a mighty land.
III
  But men knew naught of this, till there arose
    That mighty mariner, the Genoese,
  Who dared to try, in spite of fears and foes,
    The unknown fortunes of unsounded seas.
  O noblest of Italia's sons, thy bark
  Went not alone into that shrouding night!
  O dauntless darer of the rayless dark,
    The world sailed with thee to eternal light!
  The deer-haunts that with game were crowded then
    To-day are tilled and cultivated lands;
  The schoolhouse tow'rs where Bruin had his den,
    And where the wigwam stood the chapel stands;
  The place that nurtured men of savage mien
    Now teems with men of Nature's noblest types;
  Where moved the forest-foliage banner green,
    Now flutters in the breeze the stars and stripes!
A BORDER BALLAD
  Oh, I have n't got long to live, for we all
    Die soon, e'en those who live longest;
  And the poorest and weakest are taking their chance
    Along with the richest and strongest.
  So it's heigho for a glass and a song,
    And a bright eye over the table,
  And a dog for the hunt when the game is flush,
    And the pick of a gentleman's stable.
  There is Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yester-night,
    But he 's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh;
  'Twas the hand o' MacPherson that gave him the blow,
    And the vultures shall feast on his marrow.
  But it's heigho for a brave old song
    And a glass while we are able;
  Here 's a health to death and another cup
    To the bright eye over the table.
  I can show a broad back and a jolly deep chest,
    But who argues now on appearance?
  A blow or a thrust or a stumble at best
    May send me to-day to my clearance.
  Then it's heigho for the things I love,
    My mother 'll be soon wearing sable,
  But give me my horse and my dog and my glass,
    And a bright eye over the table.
AN EASY-GOIN' FELLER
  Ther' ain't no use in all this strife,
  An' hurryin', pell-mell, right thro' life.
  I don't believe in goin' too fast
  To see what kind o' road you 've passed.
  It ain't no mortal kind o' good,
  'N' I would n't hurry ef I could.
  I like to jest go joggin' 'long,
  To limber up my soul with song;
  To stop awhile 'n' chat the men,
  'N' drink some cider now an' then.
  Do' want no boss a-standin' by
  To see me work; I allus try
  To do my dooty right straight up,
  An' earn what fills my plate an' cup.
  An' ez fur boss, I 'll be my own,
  I like to jest be let alone;
  To plough my strip an' tend my bees,
  An' do jest like I doggoned please.
  My head's all right, an' my heart's meller,
  But I 'm a easy-goin' feller.
A NEGRO LOVE SONG
  Seen my lady home las' night,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,
  Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,
  An' a smile go flittin' by--
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  An' my hea't was beatin' so,
  When I reached my lady's do',
  Dat I could n't ba' to go--
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Put my ahm aroun' huh wais',
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Raised huh lips an' took a tase,
    Jump back, honey, jump back.
  Love me, honey, love me true?
  Love me well ez I love you?
  An' she answe'd, "'Cose I do"--
   Jump back, honey, jump back.
THE DILETTANTE: A MODERN TYPE
  He scribbles some in prose and verse,
    And now and then he prints it;
  He paints a little,--gathers some
    Of Nature's gold and mints it.
  He plays a little, sings a song,
    Acts tragic roles, or funny;
  He does, because his love is strong,
    But not, oh, not for money!
  He studies almost everything
    From social art to science;
  A thirsty mind, a flowing spring,
    Demand and swift compliance.
  He looms above the sordid crowd--
    At least through friendly lenses;
  While his mamma looks pleased and proud,
    And kindly pays expenses.
BY THE STREAM
  By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass,
  How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass,
  And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads,
  Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads.
  And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go,
  For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show,
  And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries,
  When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.
THE COLORED SOLDIERS
  If the muse were mine to tempt it
    And my feeble voice were strong,
  If my tongue were trained to measures,
    I would sing a stirring song.
  I would sing a song heroic
    Of those noble sons of Ham,
  Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!
  In the early days you scorned them,
    And with many a flip and flout
  Said "These battles are the white man's,
    And the whites will fight them out."
  Up the hills you fought and faltered,
    In the vales you strove and bled,
  While your ears still heard the thunder
    Of the foes' advancing tread.
  Then distress fell on the nation,
    And the flag was drooping low;
  Should the dust pollute your banner?
    No! the nation shouted, No!
  So when War, in savage triumph,
    Spread abroad his funeral pall--
  Then you called the colored soldiers,
    And they answered to your call.
  And like hounds unleashed and eager
    For the life blood of the prey,
  Sprung they forth and bore them bravely
    In the thickest of the fray.
  And where'er the fight was hottest,
    Where the bullets fastest fell,
  There they pressed unblanched and fearless
    At the very mouth of hell.
  Ah, they rallied to the standard
    To uphold it by their might;
  None were stronger in the labors,
    None were braver in the fight.
  From the blazing breach of Wagner
    To the plains of Olustee,
  They were foremost in the fight
    Of the battles of the free.
  And at Pillow! God have mercy
    On the deeds committed there,
  And the souls of those poor victims
    Sent to Thee without a prayer.
  Let the fulness of Thy pity
    O'er the hot wrought spirits sway
  Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fell fighting on that day!
  Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom,
    And they won it dearly, too;
  For the life blood of their thousands
    Did the southern fields bedew.
  In the darkness of their bondage,
    In the depths of slavery's night,
  Their muskets flashed the dawning,
    And they fought their way to light.
  They were comrades then and brothers,
    Are they more or less to-day?
  They were good to stop a bullet
    And to front the fearful fray.
  They were citizens and soldiers,
    When rebellion raised its head;
  And the traits that made them worthy,--
    Ah! those virtues are not dead.
  They have shared your nightly vigils,
    They have shared your daily toil;
  And their blood with yours commingling
    Has enriched the Southern soil.
  They have slept and marched and suffered
    'Neath the same dark skies as you,
  They have met as fierce a foeman,
    And have been as brave and true.
  And their deeds shall find a record
    In the registry of Fame;
  For their blood has cleansed completely
    Every blot of Slavery's shame.
  So all honor and all glory
    To those noble sons of Ham--
  The gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!
NATURE AND ART
TO MY FRIEND CHARLES BOOTH NETTLETON
I
  The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair,
    Once on a time fell upon evil days.
    From hearing oft herself discussed with praise,
  There grew within her heart the longing rare
  To see herself; and every passing air
    The warm desire fanned into lusty blaze.
    Full oft she sought this end by devious ways,
  But sought in vain, so fell she in despair.
  For none within her train nor by her side
    Could solve the task or give the envied boon.
    So day and night, beneath the sun and moon,
  She wandered to and fro unsatisfied,
    Till Art came by, a blithe inventive elf,
    And made a glass wherein she saw herself.
II
  Enrapt, the queen gazed on her glorious self,
    Then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought,
    Commanded that the skilful wight be brought
  That she might dower him with lands and pelf.
  Then out upon the silent sea-lapt shelf
    And up the hills and on the downs they sought
    Him who so well and wondrously had wrought;
  And with much search found and brought home the elf.
    But he put by all gifts with sad replies,
  And from his lips these words flowed forth like wine:
    "O queen, I want no gift but thee," he said.
  She heard and looked on him with love-lit eyes,
  Gave him her hand, low murmuring, "I am thine,"
    And at the morrow's dawning they were wed.
AFTER WHILE
  A POEM OF FAITH
  I think that though the clouds be dark,
  That though the waves dash o'er the bark,
  Yet after while the light will come,
  And in calm waters safe at home
        The bark will anchor.
  Weep not, my sad-eyed, gray-robed maid,
  Because your fairest blossoms fade,
  That sorrow still o'erruns your cup,
  And even though you root them up,
        The weeds grow ranker.
  For after while your tears shall cease,
  And sorrow shall give way to peace;
  The flowers shall bloom, the weeds shall die,
  And in that faith seen, by and by
        Thy woes shall perish.
  Smile at old Fortune's adverse tide,
  Smile when the scoffers sneer and chide.
  Oh, not for you the gems that pale,
  And not for you the flowers that fail;
        Let this thought cherish:
  That after while the clouds will part,
  And then with joy the waiting heart
  Shall feel the light come stealing in,
  That drives away the cloud of sin
        And breaks its power.
  And you shall burst your chrysalis,
  And wing away to realms of bliss,
  Untrammelled, pure, divinely free,
  Above all earth's anxiety
        From that same hour.
THE OL' TUNES
  You kin talk about yer anthems
    An' yer arias an' sich,
  An' yer modern choir-singin'
    That you think so awful rich;
  But you orter heerd us youngsters
    In the times now far away,
  A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
  There was some of us sung treble
    An' a few of us growled bass,
  An' the tide o' song flowed smoothly
    With its 'comp'niment o' grace;
  There was spirit in that music,
    An' a kind o' solemn sway,
  A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
  I remember oft o' standin'
    In my homespun pantaloons--
  On my face the bronze an' freckles
    O' the suns o' youthful Junes--
  Thinkin' that no mortal minstrel
    Ever chanted sich a lay
  As the ol' tunes we was singin'
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
  The boys 'ud always lead us,
    An' the girls 'ud all chime in
  Till the sweetness o' the singin'
    Robbed the list'nin' soul o' sin;
  An' I used to tell the parson
    'T was as good to sing as pray,
  When the people sung the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
  How I long ag'in to hear 'em
    Pourin' forth from soul to soul,
  With the treble high an' meller,
    An' the bass's mighty roll;
  But the times is very diff'rent,
    An' the music heerd to-day
  Ain't the singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
  Little screechin' by a woman,
    Little squawkin' by a man,
  Then the organ's twiddle-twaddle,
    Jest the empty space to span,--
  An' ef you should even think it,
    'T is n't proper fur to say
  That you want to hear the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
  But I think that some bright mornin',
    When the toils of life air o'er,
  An' the sun o' heaven arisin'
    Glads with light the happy shore,
  I shall hear the angel chorus,
    In the realms of endless day,
  A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
MELANCHOLIA
  Silently without my window,
    Tapping gently at the pane,
    Falls the rain.
  Through the trees sighs the breeze
    Like a soul in pain.
  Here alone I sit and weep;
  Thought hath banished sleep.
  Wearily I sit and listen
    To the water's ceaseless drip.
    To my lip
  Fate turns up the bitter cup,
    Forcing me to sip;
  'T is a bitter, bitter drink,
  Thus I sit and think,--
  Thinking things unknown and awful,
    Thoughts on wild, uncanny themes,
    Waking dreams.
  Spectres dark, corpses stark,
    Show the gaping seams
  Whence the cold and cruel knife
  Stole away their life.
  Bloodshot eyes all strained and staring,
    Gazing ghastly into mine;
    Blood like wine
  On the brow--clotted now--
    Shows death's dreadful sign.
  Lonely vigil still I keep;
  Would that I might sleep!
  Still, oh, still, my brain is whirling!
    Still runs on my stream of thought;
    I am caught
  In the net fate hath set.
    Mind and soul are brought
  To destruction's very brink;
  Yet I can but think!
  Eyes that look into the future,--
    Peeping forth from out my mind,
    They will find
  Some new weight, soon or late,
    On my soul to bind,
    Crushing all its courage out,--
  Heavier than doubt.
  Dawn, the Eastern monarch's daughter,
    Rising from her dewy bed,
    Lays her head
  'Gainst the clouds' sombre shrouds
    Now half fringed with red.
  O'er the land she 'gins to peep;
  Come, O gentle Sleep!
  Hark! the morning cock is crowing;
    Dreams, like ghosts, must hie away;
    'Tis the day.
  Rosy morn now is born;
    Dark thoughts may not stay.
  Day my brain from foes will keep;
  Now, my soul, I sleep.
THE WOOING
  A youth went faring up and down,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  He fared him to the market town,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  And there he met a maiden fair,
  With hazel eyes and auburn hair;
  His heart went from him then and there,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  She posies sold right merrily,
      Alack and well-a-day;
  But not a flower was fair as she,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  He bought a rose and sighed a sigh,
  "Ah, dearest maiden, would that I
  Might dare the seller too to buy!"
      Alack and well-a-day.
  She tossed her head, the coy coquette,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  "I'm not, sir, in the market yet,"
      Alack and well-a-day.
  "Your love must cool upon a shelf;
  Tho' much I sell for gold and pelf,
  I 'm yet too young to sell myself,"
     Alack and well-a-day.
  The youth was filled with sorrow sore,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  And looked he at the maid once more,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  Then loud he cried, "Fair maiden, if
  Too young to sell, now as I live,
  You're not too young yourself to give,"
      Alack and well-a-day.
  The little maid cast down her eyes,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  And many a flush began to rise,
      Alack and well-a-day.
  "Why, since you are so bold," she said,
  "I doubt not you are highly bred,
  So take me!" and the twain were wed,
      Alack and well-a-day.
MERRY AUTUMN
  It's all a farce,--these tales they tell
    About the breezes sighing,
  And moans astir o'er field and dell,
    Because the year is dying.
  Such principles are most absurd,--
    I care not who first taught 'em;
  There's nothing known to beast or bird
    To make a solemn autumn.
  In solemn times, when grief holds sway
    With countenance distressing,
  You'll note the more of black and gray
    Will then be used in dressing.
  Now purple tints are all around;
    The sky is blue and mellow;
  And e'en the grasses turn the ground
    From modest green to yellow.
  The seed burrs all with laughter crack
    On featherweed and jimson;
  And leaves that should be dressed in black
    Are all decked out in crimson.
  A butterfly goes winging by;
    A singing bird comes after;
  And Nature, all from earth to sky,
    Is bubbling o'er with laughter.
  The ripples wimple on the rills,
    Like sparkling little lasses;
  The sunlight runs along the hills,
    And laughs among the grasses.
  The earth is just so full of fun
    It really can't contain it;
  And streams of mirth so freely run
    The heavens seem to rain it.
  Don't talk to me of solemn days
    In autumn's time of splendor,
  Because the sun shows fewer rays,
    And these grow slant and slender.
  Why, it's the climax of the year,--
    The highest time of living!--
  Till naturally its bursting cheer
    Just melts into thanksgiving.
WHEN DE CO'N PONE'S HOT
  Dey is times in life when Nature
    Seems to slip a cog an' go,
  Jes' a-rattlin' down creation,
    Lak an ocean's overflow;
  When de worl' jes' stahts a-spinnin'
    Lak a picaninny's top,
  An' yo' cup o' joy is brimmin'
    'Twell it seems about to slop,
  An' you feel jes' lak a racah,
    Dat is trainin' fu' to trot--
  When yo' mammy says de blessin'
    An' de co'n pone 's hot.
  When you set down at de table,
    Kin' o' weary lak an' sad,
  An' you 'se jes' a little tiahed
    An' purhaps a little mad;
  How yo' gloom tu'ns into gladness,
    How yo' joy drives out de doubt
  When de oven do' is opened,
    An' de smell comes po'in' out;
  Why, de 'lectric light o' Heaven
    Seems to settle on de spot,
  When yo' mammy says de blessin'
    An' de co'n pone 's hot.
  When de cabbage pot is steamin'
    An' de bacon good an' fat,
  When de chittlins is a-sputter'n'
    So 's to show you whah dey's at;
  Tek away yo' sody biscuit,
    Tek away yo' cake an' pie,
  Fu' de glory time is comin',
    An' it's 'proachin' mighty nigh,
  An' you want to jump an' hollah,
    Dough you know you 'd bettah not,
  When yo' mammy says de blessin'
    An' de co'n pone 's hot.
  I have hyeahd o' lots o' sermons,
    An' I 've hyeahd o' lots o' prayers,
  An' I 've listened to some singin'
    Dat has tuck me up de stairs
  Of de Glory-Lan' an' set me
    Jes' below de Mastah's th'one,
  An' have lef my hea't a-singin'
    In a happy aftah tone;
  But dem wu'ds so sweetly murmured
    Seem to tech de softes' spot,
  When my mammy says de blessin',
    An' de co'n pone's hot.
BALLAD
  I know my love is true,
    And oh the day is fair.
  The sky is clear and blue,
  The flowers are rich of hue,
    The air I breathe is rare,
    I have no grief or care;
  For my own love is true,
    And oh 'the day is fair.
  My love is false I find,
    And oh the day is dark.
  Blows sadly down the wind,
  While sorrow holds my mind;
    I do not hear the lark,
    For quenched is life's dear spark,--
  My love is false I find,
    And oh the day is dark!
  For love doth make the day
    Or dark or doubly bright;
  Her beams along the way
  Dispel the gloom and gray.
    She lives and all is bright,
    She dies and life is night.
  For love doth make the day,
   Or dark or doubly bright.
THE CHANGE HAS COME
  The change has come, and Helen sleeps--
  Not sleeps; but wakes to greater deeps
    Of wisdom, glory, truth, and light,
    Than ever blessed her seeking sight,
    In this low, long, lethargic night,
      Worn out with strife
      Which men call life.
  The change has come, and who would say
  "I would it were not come to-day"?
    What were the respite till to-morrow?
    Postponement of a certain sorrow,
    From which each passing day would borrow!
      Let grief be dumb,
      The change has come.
COMPARISON
  The sky of brightest gray seems dark
    To one whose sky was ever white.
  To one who never knew a spark,
    Thro' all his life, of love or light,
    The grayest cloud seems over-bright.
  The robin sounds a beggar's note
    Where one the nightingale has heard,
  But he for whom no silver throat
    Its liquid music ever stirred,
    Deems robin still the sweetest bird.
A CORN-SONG
  On the wide veranda white,
   In the purple failing light,
  Sits the master while the sun is lowly burning;
  And his dreamy thoughts are drowned
  In the softly flowing sound
  Of the corn-songs of the field-hands slow returning.
      Oh, we hoe de co'n
      Since de ehly mo'n;
      Now de sinkin' sun
      Says de day is done.
  O'er the fields with heavy tread,
  Light of heart and high of head,
  Though the halting steps be labored, slow, and weary;
  Still the spirits brave and strong
  Find a comforter in song,
  And their corn-song rises ever loud and cheery.
      Oh, we hoe de co'n
      Since de ehly mo'n;
      Now de sinkin' sun
      Says de day is done.
  To the master in his seat,
  Comes the burden, full and sweet,
  Of the mellow minor music growing clearer,
  As the toilers raise the hymn,
  Thro' the silence dusk and dim,
  To the cabin's restful shelter drawing nearer.
      Oh, we hoe de co'n
      Since de ehly mo'n;
      Now de sinkin' sun
      Says de day is done.
  And a tear is in the eye
  Of the master sitting by,
  As he listens to the echoes low-replying
  To the music's fading calls
  As it faints away and falls
  Into silence, deep within the cabin dying.
      Oh, we hoe de co'n
      Since de ehly mo'n;
      Now de sinkin' sun
      Says de day is done.
DISCOVERED

DISAPPOINTED
  An old man planted and dug and tended,
    Toiling in joy from dew to dew;
  The sun was kind, and the rain befriended;
    Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.
  Then he said: "I will quiet my thrifty fears,
  For here is fruit for my failing years."
  But even then the storm-clouds gathered,
    Swallowing up the azure sky;
  The sweeping winds into white foam lathered
    The placid breast of the bay, hard by;
  Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air
  Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.
  The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,
    Viewing the place the storm had swept;
  And then with a cry from his soul despairing,
    He bowed him down to the earth and wept.
  But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain;
  "Arise, old man, and plant again!"
INVITATION TO LOVE
  Come when the nights are bright with stars
    Or when the moon is mellow;
  Come when the sun his golden bars
    Drops on the hay-field yellow.
  Come in the twilight soft and gray,
  Come in the night or come in the day,
  Come, O love, whene'er you may,
    And you are welcome, welcome.
  You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,
  You are soft as the nesting dove.
  Come to my heart and bring it rest
  As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.
  Come when my heart is full of grief
    Or when my heart is merry;
  Come with the falling of the leaf
    Or with the redd'ning cherry.
  Come when the year's first blossom blows,
  Come when the summer gleams and glows,
  Come with the winter's drifting snows,
    And you are welcome, welcome.
HE HAD HIS DREAM
  He had his dream, and all through life,
  Worked up to it through toil and strife.
  Afloat fore'er before his eyes,
  It colored for him all his skies:
      The storm-cloud dark
      Above his bark,
  The calm and listless vault of blue
  Took on its hopeful hue,
  It tinctured every passing beam--
      He had his dream.
  He labored hard and failed at last,
  His sails too weak to bear the blast,
  The raging tempests tore away
  And sent his beating bark astray.
      But what cared he
      For wind or sea!
  He said, "The tempest will be short,
  My bark will come to port."
  He saw through every cloud a gleam--
      He had his dream.
GOOD-NIGHT
  The lark is silent in his nest,
    The breeze is sighing in its flight,
  Sleep, Love, and peaceful be thy rest.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night.
  Sweet dreams attend thee in thy sleep,
    To soothe thy rest till morning's light,
  And angels round thee vigil keep.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night.
  Sleep well, my love, on night's dark breast,
    And ease thy soul with slumber bright;
  Be joy but thine and I am blest.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night.
A COQUETTE CONQUERED
  Yes, my ha't 's ez ha'd ez stone--
  Go 'way, Sam, an' lemme 'lone.
  No; I ain't gwine change my min'--
  Ain't gwine ma'y you--nuffin' de kin'.
  Phiny loves you true an' deah?
  Go ma'y Phiny; whut I keer?
  Oh, you need n't mou'n an' cry--
  I don't keer how soon you die.
  Got a present! Whut you got?
  Somef'n fu' de pan er pot!
  Huh! yo' sass do sholy beat--
  Think I don't git 'nough to eat?
  Whut's dat un'neaf yo' coat?
  Looks des lak a little shoat.
  'T ain't no possum! Bless de Lamb!
  Yes, it is, you rascal, Sam!
  Gin it to me; whut you say?
  Ain't you sma't now! Oh, go 'way!
  Possum do look mighty nice,
  But you ax too big a price.
  Tell me, is you talkin' true,
  Dat 's de gal's whut ma'ies you?
  Come back, Sam; now whah 's you gwine?
  Co'se you knows dat possum's mine!
NORA: A SERENADE
  Ah, Nora, my Nora, the light fades away,
    While Night like a spirit steals up o'er the hills;
  The thrush from his tree where he chanted all day,
    No longer his music in ecstasy trills.
  Then, Nora, be near me; thy presence doth cheer me,
    Thine eye hath a gleam that is truer than gold.
  I cannot but love thee; so do not reprove me,
    If the strength of my passion should make me too bold.
  Nora, pride of my heart--
    Rosy cheeks, cherry lips, sparkling with glee,--
  Wake from thy slumbers, wherever thou art;
    Wake from thy slumbers to me.
  Ah, Nora, my Nora, there 's love in the air,--
    It stirs in the numbers that thrill in my brain;
  Oh, sweet, sweet is love with its mingling of care,
    Though joy travels only a step before pain.
  Be roused from thy slumbers and list to my numbers;
  My heart is poured out in this song unto thee.
  Oh, be thou not cruel, thou treasure, thou jewel;
    Turn thine ear to my pleading and hearken to me.
OCTOBER
  October is the treasurer of the year,
    And all the months pay bounty to her store;
  The fields and orchards still their tribute bear,
    And fill her brimming coffers more and more.
  But she, with youthful lavishness,
  Spends all her wealth in gaudy dress,
    And decks herself in garments bold
    Of scarlet, purple, red, and gold.
  She heedeth not how swift the hours fly,
    But smiles and sings her happy life along;
  She only sees above a shining sky;
    She only hears the breezes' voice in song.
  Her garments trail the woodlands through,
  And gather pearls of early dew
    That sparkle, till the roguish Sun
    Creeps up and steals them every one.
  But what cares she that jewels should be lost,
    When all of Nature's bounteous wealth is hers?
  Though princely fortunes may have been their cost,
    Not one regret her calm demeanor stirs.
  Whole-hearted, happy, careless, free,
  She lives her life out joyously,
    Nor cares when Frost stalks o'er her way
    And turns her auburn locks to gray.
A SUMMER'S NIGHT
  The night is dewy as a maiden's mouth,
    The skies are bright as are a maiden's eyes,
    Soft as a maiden's breath the wind that flies
  Up from the perfumed bosom of the South.
  Like sentinels, the pines stand in the park;
    And hither hastening, like rakes that roam,
    With lamps to light their wayward footsteps home,
  The fireflies come stagg'ring down the dark.
SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT
  Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;
    I look far out into the pregnant night,
  Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
    And catch the gleaming of a random light,
  That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.
  My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
    For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
  I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
    My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
  And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.
  O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
    O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
  Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
    That I may sight and check that speeding bark
  Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?
THE DELINQUENT
  Goo'-by, Jinks, I got to hump,
  Got to mek dis pony jump;
  See dat sun a-goin' down
  'N' me a-foolin' hyeah in town!
      Git up, Suke--go long!
  Guess Mirandy'll think I's tight,
  Me not home an' comin' on night.
  What 's dat stan'in' by de fence?
  Pshaw! why don't I lu'n some sense?
      Git up, Suke--go long!
  Guess I spent down dah at Jinks'
  Mos' a dollah fur de drinks.
  Bless yo'r soul, you see dat star?
  Lawd, but won't Mirandy rar?
      Git up, Suke--go long!
  Went dis mo'nin', hyeah it 's night,
  Dah 's de cabin dah in sight.
  Who's dat stan'in' in de do'?
  Dat must be Mirandy, sho',
      Git up, Suke--go long!
  Got de close-stick in huh han',
  Dat look funny, goodness lan',
  Sakes alibe, but she look glum!
  Hyeah, Mirandy, hyeah I come!
      Git up, Suke--go long!
    Ef 't had n't a' b'en fur you, you slow ole fool, I 'd a' be'n home
  long fo' now!
DAWN
  An angel, robed in spotless white,
  Bent down and kissed the sleeping Night.
  Night woke to blush; the sprite was gone.
  Men saw the blush and called it Dawn.
A DROWSY DAY
  The air is dark, the sky is gray,
    The misty shadows come and go,
  And here within my dusky room
  Each chair looks ghostly in the gloom.
    Outside the rain falls cold and slow--
  Half-stinging drops, half-blinding spray.
  Each slightest sound is magnified,
    For drowsy quiet holds her reign;
  The burnt stick in the fireplace breaks,
  The nodding cat with start awakes,
    And then to sleep drops off again,
  Unheeding Towser at her side.
  I look far out across the lawn,
    Where huddled stand the silly sheep;
  My work lies idle at my hands,
  My thoughts fly out like scattered strands
    Of thread, and on the verge of sleep--
  Still half awake--I dream and yawn.
  What spirits rise before my eyes!
    How various of kind and form!
  Sweet memories of days long past,
  The dreams of youth that could not last,
    Each smiling calm, each raging storm,
  That swept across my early skies.
  Half seen, the bare, gaunt-fingered boughs
    Before my window sweep and sway,
  And chafe in tortures of unrest.
  My chin sinks down upon my breast;
    I cannot work on such a day,
  But only sit and dream and drowse.
DIRGE
  Place this bunch of mignonette
    In her cold, dead hand;
  When the golden sun is set,
    Where the poplars stand,
  Bury her from sun and day,
  Lay my little love away
      From my sight.
  She was like a modest flower
    Blown in sunny June,
  Warm as sun at noon's high hour,
    Chaster than the moon.
  Ah, her day was brief and bright,
  Earth has lost a star of light;
      She is dead.
  Softly breathe her name to me,--
    Ah, I loved her so.
  Gentle let your tribute be;
    None may better know
  Her true worth than I who weep
  O'er her as she lies asleep--
      Soft asleep.
  Lay these lilies on her breast,
    They are not more white
  Than the soul of her, at rest
    'Neath their petals bright.
  Chant your aves soft and low,
  Solemn be your tread and slow,--
      She is dead.
  Lay her here beneath the grass,
    Cool and green and sweet,
  Where the gentle brook may pass
    Crooning at her feet.
  Nature's bards shall come and sing,
  And the fairest flowers shall spring
      Where she lies.
  Safe above the water's swirl,
    She has crossed the bar;
  Earth has lost a precious pearl,
    Heaven has gained a star,
  That shall ever sing and shine,
  Till it quells this grief of mine
      For my love.
HYMN
  When storms arise
  And dark'ning skies
    About me threat'ning lower,
  To thee, O Lord, I raise mine eyes,
  To thee my tortured spirit flies
    For solace in that hour.
  The mighty arm
  Will let no harm
    Come near me nor befall me;
  Thy voice shall quiet my alarm,
  When life's great battle waxeth warm--
    No foeman shall appall me.
  Upon thy breast
  Secure I rest,
    From sorrow and vexation;
  No more by sinful cares oppressed,
  But in thy presence ever blest,
    O God of my salvation.
PREPARATION
  The little bird sits in the nest and sings
    A shy, soft song to the morning light;
  And it flutters a little and prunes its wings.
    The song is halting and poor and brief,
    And the fluttering wings scarce stir a leaf;
  But the note is a prelude to sweeter things,
    And the busy bill and the flutter slight
    Are proving the wings for a bolder flight!
THE DESERTED PLANTATION
  Oh, de grubbin'-hoe 's a-rustin' in de co'nah,
    An' de plow 's a-tumblin' down in de fiel',
  While de whippo'will 's a-wailin' lak a mou'nah
    When his stubbo'n hea't is tryin' ha'd to yiel'.
  In de furrers whah de co'n was allus wavin',
    Now de weeds is growin' green an' rank an' tall;
  An' de swallers roun' de whole place is a-bravin'
    Lak dey thought deir folks had allus owned it all.
  An' de big house stan's all quiet lak an' solemn,
    Not a blessed soul in pa'lor, po'ch, er lawn;
  Not a guest, ner not a ca'iage lef' to haul 'em,
    Fu' de ones dat tu'ned de latch-string out air gone.
  An' de banjo's voice is silent in de qua'ters,
    D' ain't a hymn ner co'n-song ringin' in de air;
  But de murmur of a branch's passin' waters
    Is de only soun' dat breks de stillness dere.
  Whah 's de da'kies, dem dat used to be a-dancin'
    Evry night befo' de ole cabin do'?
  Whah 's de chillun, dem dat used to be a-prancin'
    Er a-rollin' in de san' er on de flo'?
  Whah 's ole Uncle Mordecai an' Uncle Aaron?
    Whah 's Aunt Doshy, Sam, an' Kit, an' all de res'?
  Whah 's ole Tom de da'ky fiddlah, how 's he farin'?
    Whah 's de gals dat used to sing an' dance de bes'?
  Gone! not one o' dem is lef' to tell de story;
    Dey have lef' de deah ole place to fall away.
  Could n't one o' dem dat seed it in its glory
    Stay to watch it in de hour of decay?
  Dey have lef' de ole plantation to de swallers,
    But it hol's in me a lover till de las';
  Fu' I fin' hyeah in de memory dat follers
    All dat loved me an' dat I loved in de pas'.
  So I'll stay an' watch de deah ole place an' tend it
    Ez I used to in de happy days gone by.
  'Twell de othah Mastah thinks it's time to end it,
    An' calls me to my qua'ters in de sky.
THE SECRET
  What says the wind to the waving trees?
    What says the wave to the river?
  What means the sigh in the passing breeze?
    Why do the rushes quiver?
  Have you not heard the fainting cry
  Of the flowers that said "Good-bye, good-bye"?
  List how the gray dove moans and grieves
    Under the woodland cover;
  List to the drift of the falling leaves,
    List to the wail of the lover.
  Have you not caught the message heard
  Already by wave and breeze and bird?
  Come, come away to the river's bank,
    Come in the early morning;
  Come when the grass with dew is dank,
    There you will find the warning--
  A hint in the kiss of the quickening air
  Of the secret that birds and breezes bear.
THE WIND AND THE SEA
  I stood by the shore at the death of day,
    As the sun sank flaming red;
  And the face of the waters that spread away
    Was as gray as the face of the dead.
  And I heard the cry of the wanton sea
    And the moan of the wailing wind;
  For love's sweet pain in his heart had he,
    But the gray old sea had sinned.
  The wind was young and the sea was old,
    But their cries went up together;
  The wind was warm and the sea was cold,
    For age makes wintry weather.
  So they cried aloud and they wept amain,
    Till the sky grew dark to hear it;
  And out of its folds crept the misty rain,
    In its shroud, like a troubled spirit.
  For the wind was wild with a hopeless love,
    And the sea was sad at heart
  At many a crime that he wot of,
    Wherein he had played his part.
  He thought of the gallant ships gone down
    By the will of his wicked waves;
  And he thought how the church-yard in the town
    Held the sea-made widows' graves.
  The wild wind thought of the love he had left
    Afar in an Eastern land,
  And he longed, as long the much bereft,
    For the touch of her perfumed hand.
  In his winding wail and his deep-heaved sigh
    His aching grief found vent;
  While the sea looked up at the bending sky
    And murmured: "I repent."
  But e'en as he spoke, a ship came by
   That bravely ploughed the main,
  And a light came into the sea's green eye,
    And his heart grew hard again.
  Then he spoke to the wind: "Friend, seest thou not
    Yon vessel is eastward bound?
  Pray speed with it to the happy spot
    Where thy loved one may be found."
  And the wind rose up in a dear delight,
    And after the good ship sped;
  But the crafty sea by his wicked might
    Kept the vessel ever ahead.
  Till the wind grew fierce in his despair,
    And white on the brow and lip.
  He tore his garments and tore his hair,
    And fell on the flying ship.
  And the ship went down, for a rock was there,
    And the sailless sea loomed black;
  While burdened again with dole and care,
    The wind came moaning back.
  And still he moans from his bosom hot
    Where his raging grief lies pent,
  And ever when the ships come not,
    The sea says: "I repent."
RIDING TO TOWN
  When labor is light and the morning is fair,
  I find it a pleasure beyond all compare
  To hitch up my nag and go hurrying down
  And take Katie May for a ride into town;
    For bumpety-bump goes the wagon,
      But tra-la-la-la our lay.
  There's joy in a song as we rattle along
    In the light of the glorious day.
  A coach would be fine, but a spring wagon's good;
  My jeans are a match for Kate's gingham and hood;
  The hills take us up and the vales take us down,
  But what matters that? we are riding to town,
    And bumpety-bump goes the wagon,
      But tra-la-la-la sing we.
  There's never a care may live in the air
    That is filled with the breath of our glee.
  And after we've started, there's naught can repress
  The thrill of our hearts in their wild happiness;
  The heavens may smile or the heavens may frown,
  And it's all one to us when we're riding to town.
    For bumpety-bump goes the wagon,
      But tra-la-la-la we shout,
  For our hearts they are clear and there 's nothing to fear,
    And we've never a pain nor a doubt.
  The wagon is weak and the roadway is rough,
    And tho' it is long it is not long enough,
  For mid all my ecstasies this is the crown
    To sit beside Katie and ride into town,
      When bumpety-bump goes the wagon,
        But tra-la-la-la our song;
  And if I had my way, I 'd be willing to pay
    If the road could be made twice as long.
WE WEAR THE MASK
  We wear the mask that grins and lies,
  It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--
  This debt we pay to human guile;
  With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,
  And mouth with myriad subtleties.
  Why should the world be over-wise,
  In counting all our tears and sighs?
  Nay, let them only see us, while
      We wear the mask.
  We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
  To thee from tortured souls arise.
  We sing, but oh the clay is vile
  Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
  But let the world dream otherwise,
      We wear the mask!
THE MEADOW LARK
  Though the winds be dank,
    And the sky be sober,
      And the grieving Day
      In a mantle gray
    Hath let her waiting maiden robe her,--
      All the fields along
      I can hear the song
  Of the meadow lark,
      As she flits and flutters,
      And laughs at the thunder when it mutters.
      O happy bird, of heart most gay
      To sing when skies are gray!
  When the clouds are full,
    And the tempest master
      Lets the loud winds sweep
      From his bosom deep
    Like heralds of some dire disaster,
      Then the heart alone
      To itself makes moan;
  And the songs come slow,
      While the tears fall fleeter,
      And silence than song by far seems sweeter.
      Oh, few are they along the way
      Who sing when skies are gray!
ONE LIFE
  Oh, I am hurt to death, my Love;
    The shafts of Fate have pierced my striving heart,
  And I am sick and weary of
    The endless pain and smart.
  My soul is weary of the strife,
  And chafes at life, and chafes at life.
  Time mocks me with fair promises;
    A blooming future grows a barren past,
  Like rain my fair full-blossomed trees
    Unburden in the blast.
  The harvest fails on grain and tree,
  Nor comes to me, nor comes to me.
  The stream that bears my hopes abreast
    Turns ever from my way its pregnant tide.
  My laden boat, torn from its rest,
    Drifts to the other side.
  So all my hopes are set astray,
  And drift away, and drift away.
  The lark sings to me at the morn,
    And near me wings her skyward-soaring flight;
  But pleasure dies as soon as born,
    The owl takes up the night,
  And night seems long and doubly dark;
  I miss the lark, I miss the lark.
  Let others labor as they may,
    I'll sing and sigh alone, and write my line.
  Their fate is theirs, or grave or gay,
    And mine shall still be mine.
  I know the world holds joy and glee,
  But not for me,--'t is not for me.
CHANGING TIME
  The cloud looked in at the window,
    And said to the day, "Be dark!"
  And the roguish rain tapped hard on the pane,
    To stifle the song of the lark.
  The wind sprang up in the tree tops
    And shrieked with a voice of death,
  But the rough-voiced breeze, that shook the trees,
    Was touched with a violet's breath.
DEAD
  A knock is at her door, but she is weak;
  Strange dews have washed the paint streaks from her cheek;
  She does not rise, but, ah, this friend is known,
  And knows that he will find her all alone.
  So opens he the door, and with soft tread
  Goes straightway to the richly curtained bed.
  His soft hand on her dewy head he lays.
  A strange white light she gives him for his gaze.
  Then, looking on the glory of her charms,
  He crushes her resistless in his arms.
  Stand back! look not upon this bold embrace,
  Nor view the calmness of the wanton's face;
  With joy unspeakable and 'bated breath,
  She keeps her last, long liaison with death!
A CONFIDENCE
  Uncle John, he makes me tired;
  Thinks 'at he's jest so all-fired
  Smart, 'at he kin pick up, so,
  Ever'thing he wants to know.
  Tried to ketch me up last night,
  But you bet I would n't bite.
  I jest kep' the smoothes' face,
  But I led him sich a chase,
  Could n't corner me, you bet--
  I skipped all the traps he set.
  Makin' out he wan'ed to know
  Who was this an' that girl's beau;
  So 's he 'd find out, don't you see,
  Who was goin' 'long with me.
  But I answers jest ez sly,
  An' I never winks my eye,
  Tell he hollers with a whirl,
  "Look here, ain't you got a girl?"
  Y' ought 'o seen me spread my eyes,
  Like he 'd took me by surprise,
  An' I said, "Oh, Uncle John,
  Never thought o' havin' one."
  An' somehow that seemed to tickle
  Him an' he shelled out a nickel.
  Then you ought to seen me leave
  Jest a-laffin' in my sleeve.
  Fool him--well, I guess I did;
  He ain't on to this here kid.
  Got a girl! well, I guess yes,
  Got a dozen more or less,
  But I got one reely one,
  Not no foolin' ner no fun;
  Fur I 'm sweet on her, you see,
  An' I ruther guess 'at she
  Must be kinder sweet on me,
  So we 're keepin' company.
  Honest Injun! this is true,
  Ever' word I 'm tellin' you!
  But you won't be sich a scab
  Ez to run aroun' an' blab.
  Mebbe 't ain't the way with you,
  But you know some fellers do.
  Spoils a girl to let her know
  'At you talk about her so.
  Don't you know her? her name 's Liz,
  Nicest girl in town she is.
  Purty? ah, git out, you gilly--
  Liz 'ud purt 'nigh knock you silly.
  Y' ought 'o see her when she 's dressed
  All up in her Sunday best,
  All the fellers nudgin' me,
  An' a-whisperin', gemunee!
  Betcher life 'at I feel proud
  When she passes by the crowd.
  'T 's kinder nice to be a-goin'
  With a girl 'at makes some showin'--
  One you know 'at hain't no snide,
  Makes you feel so satisfied.
  An' I 'll tell you she 's a trump,
  Never even seen her jump
  Like some silly girls 'ud do,
  When I 'd hide and holler "Boo!"
  She 'd jest laff an' say "Git out!
  What you hollerin' about?"
  When some girls 'ud have a fit
  That 'un don't git skeered a bit,
  Never makes a bit o' row
  When she sees a worm er cow.
  Them kind 's few an' far between;
  Bravest girl I ever seen.
  Tell you 'nuther thing she 'll do,
  Mebbe you won't think it 's true,
  But if she 's jest got a dime
  She 'll go halvers ever' time.
  Ah, you goose, you need n't laff;
  That's the kinder girl to have.
  If you knowed her like I do,
  Guess you 'd kinder like her too.
  Tell you somep'n' if you 'll swear
  You won't tell it anywhere.
  Oh, you got to cross yer heart
  Earnest, truly, 'fore I start.
  Well, one day I kissed her cheek;
  Gee, but I felt cheap an' weak,
  'Cause at first she kinder flared,
  'N', gracious goodness! I was scared.
  But I need n't been, fer la!
  Why, she never told her ma.
  That's what I call grit, don't you?
  Sich a girl's worth stickin' to.
PHYLLIS
  Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day,
    Few are my years, but my griefs are not few,
  Ever to youth should each day be a May-day,
    Warm wind and rose-breath and diamonded dew--
  Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day.
  Oh for the sunlight that shines on a May-day!
    Only the cloud hangeth over my life.
  Love that should bring me youth's happiest heyday
    Brings me but seasons of sorrow and strife;
  Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day.
  Sunshine or shadow, or gold day or gray day,
    Life must be lived as our destinies rule;
  Leisure or labor or work day or play day--
    Feasts for the famous and fun for the fool;
  Phyllis, ah, Phyllis, my life is a gray day.
RIGHT'S SECURITY
  What if the wind do howl without,
  And turn the creaking weather-vane;
  What if the arrows of the rain
  Do beat against the window-pane?
  Art thou not armored strong and fast
  Against the sallies of the blast?
  Art thou not sheltered safe and well
  Against the flood's insistent swell?
  What boots it, that thou stand'st alone,
  And laughest in the battle's face
  When all the weak have fled the place
  And let their feet and fears keep pace?
  Thou wavest still thine ensign, high,
  And shoutest thy loud battle-cry;
  Higher than e'er the tempest roared,
  It cleaves the silence like a sword.
  Right arms and armors, too, that man
  Who will not compromise with wrong;
  Though single, he must front the throng,
  And wage the battle hard and long.
  Minorities, since time began,
  Have shown the better side of man;
  And often in the lists of Time
  One man has made a cause sublime!
IF
  If life were but a dream, my Love,
    And death the waking time;
  If day had not a beam, my Love,
    And night had not a rhyme,--
      A barren, barren world were this
      Without one saving gleam;
      I 'd only ask that with a kiss
      You 'd wake me from the dream.
  If dreaming were the sum of days,
    And loving were the bane;
  If battling for a wreath of bays
    Could soothe a heart in pain,--
      I 'd scorn the meed of battle's might,
      All other aims above
      I 'd choose the human's higher right,
      To suffer and to love!
THE SONG
  My soul, lost in the music's mist,
  Roamed, rapt, 'neath skies of amethyst.
  The cheerless streets grew summer meads,
  The Son of Phoebus spurred his steeds,
  And, wand'ring down the mazy tune,
  December lost its way in June,
  While from a verdant vale I heard
  The piping of a love-lorn bird.
  A something in the tender strain
  Revived an old, long-conquered pain,
  And as in depths of many seas,
  My heart was drowned in memories.
  The tears came welling to my eyes,
  Nor could I ask it otherwise;
  For, oh! a sweetness seems to last
  Amid the dregs of sorrows past.
  It stirred a chord that here of late
  I 'd grown to think could not vibrate.
  It brought me back the trust of youth,
  The world again was joy and truth.
  And Avice, blooming like a bride,
  Once more stood trusting at my side.
  But still, with bosom desolate,
  The lorn bird sang to find his mate.
  Then there are trees, and lights and stars,
  The silv'ry tinkle of guitars;
  And throbs again as throbbed that waltz,
  Before I knew that hearts were false.
  Then like a cold wave on a shore,
  Comes silence and she sings no more.
  I wake, I breathe, I think again,
  And walk the sordid ways of men.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES
  Air a-gittin' cool an' coolah,
    Frost a-comin' in de night,
  Hicka' nuts an' wa'nuts fallin',

WHY FADES A DREAM?
  Why fades a dream?
    An iridescent ray
  Flecked in between the tryst
    Of night and day.
    Why fades a dream?--
  Of consciousness the shade
  Wrought out by lack of light and made
    Upon life's stream.
    Why fades a dream?
  That thought may thrive,
    So fades the fleshless dream;
  Lest men should learn to trust
    The things that seem.
    So fades a dream,
  That living thought may grow
  And like a waxing star-beam glow
    Upon life's stream--
    So fades a dream.
THE SPARROW
  A little bird, with plumage brown,
  Beside my window flutters down,
  A moment chirps its little strain,
  Ten taps upon my window-pane,
  And chirps again, and hops along,
  To call my notice to its song;
  But I work on, nor heed its lay,
  Till, in neglect, it flies away.
  So birds of peace and hope and love
  Come fluttering earthward from above,
  To settle on life's window-sills,
  And ease our load of earthly ills;
  But we, in traffic's rush and din
  Too deep engaged to let them in,
  With deadened heart and sense plod on,
  Nor know our loss till they are gone.
SPEAKIN' O' CHRISTMAS
  Breezes blowin' middlin' brisk,
  Snow-flakes thro' the air a-whisk,
  Fallin' kind o' soft an' light,
  Not enough to make things white,
  But jest sorter siftin' down
  So 's to cover up the brown
  Of the dark world's rugged ways
  'N' make things look like holidays.
  Not smoothed over, but jest specked,
  Sorter strainin' fur effect,
  An' not quite a-gittin' through
  What it started in to do.
  Mercy sakes! it does seem queer
  Christmas day is 'most nigh here.
  Somehow it don't seem to me
  Christmas like it used to be,--
  Christmas with its ice an' snow,
  Christmas of the long ago.
  You could feel its stir an' hum
  Weeks an' weeks before it come;
  Somethin' in the atmosphere
  Told you when the day was near,
  Did n't need no almanacs;
  That was one o' Nature's fac's.
  Every cottage decked out gay--
  Cedar wreaths an' holly spray--
  An' the stores, how they were drest,
  Tinsel tell you could n't rest;
  Every winder fixed up pat,
  Candy canes, an' things like that;
  Noah's arks, an' guns, an' dolls,
  An' all kinds o' fol-de-rols.
  Then with frosty bells a-chime,
  Slidin' down the hills o' time,
  Right amidst the fun an' din
  Christmas come a-bustlin' in,
  Raised his cheery voice to call
  Out a welcome to us all;
  Hale and hearty, strong an' bluff,
  That was Christmas, sure enough.
  Snow knee-deep an' coastin' fine,
  Frozen mill-ponds all ashine,
  Seemin' jest to lay in wait,
  Beggin' you to come an' skate.
  An' you 'd git your gal an' go
  Stumpin' cheerily thro' the snow,
  Feelin' pleased an' skeert an' warm
  'Cause she had a-holt yore arm.
  Why, when Christmas come in, we
  Spent the whole glad day in glee,
  Havin' fun an' feastin' high
  An' some courtin' on the sly.
  Bustin' in some neighbor's door
  An' then suddenly, before
  He could give his voice a lift,
  Yellin' at him, "Christmas gift."
  Now sich things are never heard,
  "Merry Christmas" is the word.
  But it's only change o' name,
  An' means givin' jest the same.
  There 's too many new-styled ways
  Now about the holidays.
  I 'd jest like once more to see
  Christmas like it used to be!
LONESOME
  Mother 's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two,
  An', oh, the house is lonesome ez a nest whose birds has flew
  To other trees to build ag'in; the rooms seem jest so bare
  That the echoes run like sperrits from the kitchen to the stair.
  The shetters flap more lazy-like 'n what they used to do,
  Sence mother 's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two.
  We 've killed the fattest chicken an' we've cooked her to a turn;
  We 've made the richest gravy, but I jest don't give a durn
  Fur nothin' 'at I drink er eat, er nothin' 'at I see.
  The food ain't got the pleasant taste it used to have to me.
  They 's somep'n' stickin' in my throat ez tight ez hardened glue,
  Sence mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two.
  The hollyhocks air jest ez pink, they 're double ones at that,
  An' I wuz prouder of 'em than a baby of a cat.
  But now I don't go near 'em, though they nod an' blush at me,
  Fur they 's somep'n' seems to gall me in their keerless sort o' glee
  An' all their fren'ly noddin' an' their blushin' seems to say:
  "You 're purty lonesome, John, old boy, sence mother 's gone away."
  The neighbors ain't so fren'ly ez it seems they 'd ort to be;
  They seem to be a-lookin' kinder sideways like at me,
  A-kinder feared they 'd tech me off ez ef I wuz a match,
  An' all because 'at mother 's gone an' I 'm a-keepin' batch!
  I 'm shore I don't do nothin' worse 'n what I used to do
  'Fore mother went a-visitin' to spend a month er two.
  The sparrers ac's more fearsome like an' won't hop quite so near,
  The cricket's chirp is sadder, an' the sky ain't ha'f so clear;
  When ev'nin' comes, I set an' smoke tell my eyes begin to swim,
  An' things aroun' commence to look all blurred an' faint an' dim.
  Well, I guess I 'll have to own up 'at I 'm feelin' purty blue
  Sence mother's gone a-visitin' to spend a month er two.
GROWIN' GRAY
  Hello, ole man, you 're a-gittin' gray,
  An' it beats ole Ned to see the way
  'At the crow's feet's a-getherin' aroun' yore eyes;
  Tho' it ought n't to cause me no su'prise,
  Fur there 's many a sun 'at you 've seen rise
  An' many a one you 've seen go down
  Sence yore step was light an' yore hair was brown,
  An' storms an' snows have had their way--
  Hello, ole man, you 're a-gittin' gray.
  Hello, ole man, you 're a-gittin' gray,
  An' the youthful pranks 'at you used to play
  Are dreams of a far past long ago
  That lie in a heart where the fires burn low--
  That has lost the flame though it kept the glow,
  An' spite of drivin' snow an' storm,
  Beats bravely on forever warm.
  December holds the place of May--
  Hello, ole man, you 're a-gittin' gray.
  Hello, ole man, you 're a-gittin' gray--
  Who cares what the carpin' youngsters say?
  For, after all, when the tale is told,
  Love proves if a man is young or old!
  Old age can't make the heart grow cold
  When it does the will of an honest mind;
  When it beats with love fur all mankind;
  Then the night but leads to a fairer day--
  Hello, ole man, you 're a-gittin' gray!
TO THE MEMORY OF MARY YOUNG
  God has his plans, and what if we
  With our sight be too blind to see
  Their full fruition; cannot he,
  Who made it, solve the mystery?
  One whom we loved has fall'n asleep,
  Not died; although her calm be deep,
  Some new, unknown, and strange surprise
  In Heaven holds enrapt her eyes.
  And can you blame her that her gaze
  Is turned away from earthly ways,
  When to her eyes God's light and love
  Have giv'n the view of things above?
  A gentle spirit sweetly good,
  The pearl of precious womanhood;
  Who heard the voice of duty clear,
  And found her mission soon and near.
  She loved all nature, flowers fair,
  The warmth of sun, the kiss of air,
  The birds that filled the sky with song,
  The stream that laughed its way along.
  Her home to her was shrine and throne,
  But one love held her not alone;
  She sought out poverty and grief,
  Who touched her robe and found relief.
  So sped she in her Master's work,
  Too busy and too brave to shirk,
  When through the silence, dusk and dim,
  God called her and she fled to him.
  We wonder at the early call,
  And tears of sorrow can but fall
  For her o'er whom we spread the pall;
  But faith, sweet faith, is over all.
  The house is dust, the voice is dumb,
  But through undying years to come,
  The spark that glowed within her soul
  Shall light our footsteps to the goal.
  She went her way; but oh, she trod
  The path that led her straight to God.
  Such lives as this put death to scorn;
  They lose our day to find God's morn.
WHEN MALINDY SINGS
  G'way an' quit dat noise, Miss Lucy--
    Put dat music book away;
  What's de use to keep on tryin'?
    Ef you practise twell you 're gray,
  You cain't sta't no notes a-flyin'
    Lak de ones dat rants and rings
  F'om de kitchen to be big woods
    When Malindy sings.
  You ain't got de nachel o'gans
    Fu' to make de soun' come right,
  You ain't got de tu'ns an' twistin's
    Fu' to make it sweet an' light.
  Tell you one thing now, Miss Lucy,
    An' I 'm tellin' you fu' true,
  When hit comes to raal right singin',
    'T ain't no easy thing to do.
  Easy 'nough fu' folks to hollah,
    Lookin' at de lines an' dots,
  When dey ain't no one kin sence it,
    An' de chune comes in, in spots;
  But fu' real melojous music,
    Dat jes' strikes yo' hea't and clings,
  Jes' you stan' an' listen wif me
    When Malindy sings.
  Ain't you nevah hyeahd Malindy?
    Blessed soul, tek up de cross!
  Look hyeah, ain't you jokin', honey?
    Well, you don't know whut you los'.
  Y' ought to hyeah dat gal a-wa'blin',
    Robins, la'ks, an' all dem things,
  Heish dey moufs an' hides dey faces
    When Malindy sings.
  Fiddlin' man jes' stop his fiddlin',
    Lay his fiddle on de she'f;
  Mockin'-bird quit tryin' to whistle,
    'Cause he jes' so shamed hisse'f.
  Folks a-playin' on de banjo
    Draps dey fingahs on de strings--
  Bless yo' soul--fu'gits to move em,
    When Malindy sings.
  She jes' spreads huh mouf and hollahs,
    "Come to Jesus," twell you hyeah
  Sinnahs' tremblin' steps and voices,
    Timid-lak a-drawin' neah;
  Den she tu'ns to "Rock of Ages,"
    Simply to de cross she clings,
  An' you fin' yo' teahs a-drappin'
    When Malindy sings.
  Who dat says dat humble praises
    Wif de Master nevah counts?
  Heish yo' mouf, I hyeah dat music,
    Ez hit rises up an' mounts--
  Floatin' by de hills an' valleys,
    Way above dis buryin' sod,
  Ez hit makes its way in glory
    To de very gates of God!
  Oh, hit's sweetah dan de music
    Of an edicated band;
  An' hit's dearah dan de battle's
    Song o' triumph in de lan'.
  It seems holier dan evenin'
    When de solemn chu'ch bell rings,
  Ez I sit an' ca'mly listen
    While Malindy sings.
  Towsah, stop dat ba'kin', hyeah me!
    Mandy, mek dat chile keep still;
  Don't you hyeah de echoes callin'
    F'om de valley to de hill?
  Let me listen, I can hyeah it,
    Th'oo de bresh of angels' wings,
  Sof an' sweet, "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"
    Ez Malindy sings.
THE PARTY
  Dey had a gread big pahty down to Tom's de othah night;
  Was I dah? You bet! I nevah in my life see sich a sight;
  All de folks f'om fou' plantations was invited, an' dey come,
  Dey come troopin' thick ez chillun when dey hyeahs a fife an' drum.
  Evahbody dressed deir fines'--Heish yo' mouf an' git away,
  Ain't seen no sich fancy dressin' sence las' quah'tly meetin' day;
  Gals all dressed in silks an' satins, not a wrinkle ner a crease,
  Eyes a-battin', teeth a-shinin', haih breshed back ez slick ez grease;
  Sku'ts all tucked an' puffed an' ruffled, evah blessed seam an' stitch;
  Ef you 'd seen 'em wif deir mistus, could n't swahed to which was which.
  Men all dressed up in Prince Alberts, swaller-tails 'u'd tek yo' bref!
  I cain't tell you nothin' 'bout it, y' ought to seen it fu' yo'se'f.
  Who was dah? Now who you askin'? How you 'spect I gwine to know?
  You mus' think I stood an' counted evahbody at de do.'
  Ole man Babah's house-boy Isaac, brung dat gal, Malindy Jane,
  Huh a-hangin' to his elbow, him a-struttin' wif a cane;
  My, but Hahvey Jones was jealous! seemed to stick him lak a tho'n;
  But he laughed with Viney Cahteh, tryin' ha'd to not let on,
  But a pusson would 'a' noticed f'om de d'rection of his look,
  Dat he was watchin' ev'ry step dat Ike an' Lindy took.
  Ike he foun' a cheer an' asked huh: "Won't you set down?" wif a smile,
  An' she answe'd up a-bowin', "Oh, I reckon 't ain't wuth while."
  Dat was jes' fu' Style, I reckon, 'cause she sot down jes' de same,
  An' she stayed dah 'twell he fetched huh fu' to jine some so't o' game;
  Den I hyeahd huh sayin' propah, ez she riz to go away,
  "Oh, you raly mus' excuse me, fu' I hardly keers to play."
  But I seen huh in a minute wif de othahs on de flo',
  An' dah wasn't any one o' dem a-playin' any mo';
  Comin' down de flo' a-bowin' an' a-swayin' an' a-swingin',
  Puttin' on huh high-toned mannahs all de time dat she was singin':
  "Oh, swing Johnny up an' down, swing him all aroun',
  Swing Johnny up an' down, swing him all aroun',
  Oh, swing Johnny up an' down, swing him all aroun'
  Fa' you well, my dahlin'."
  Had to laff at ole man Johnson, he 's a caution now, you bet--
  Hittin' clost onto a hunderd, but he 's spry an' nimble yet;
  He 'lowed how a-so't o' gigglin', "I ain't ole, I 'll let you see,
  D'ain't no use in gittin' feeble, now you youngstahs jes' watch me,"
  An' he grabbed ole Aunt Marier--weighs th'ee hunderd mo' er less,
  An' he spun huh 'roun' de cabin swingin' Johnny lak de res'.
  Evahbody laffed an' hollahed: "Go it! Swing huh, Uncle Jim!"
  An' he swung huh too, I reckon, lak a youngstah, who but him.
  Dat was bettah 'n young Scott Thomas, tryin' to be so awful smaht.
  You know when dey gits to singin' an' dey comes to dat ere paht:
          "In some lady's new brick house,
        In some lady's gyahden.
          Ef you don't let me out, I will jump out,
        So fa' you well, my dahlin'."
  Den dey 's got a circle 'roun' you, an' you's got to break de line;
  Well, dat dahky was so anxious, lak to bust hisse'f a-tryin';
  Kep' on blund'rin' 'roun' an' foolin' 'twell he giv' one gread big jump,
  Broke de line, an lit head-fo'most in de fiah-place right plump;
  Hit 'ad fiah in it, mind you; well, I thought my soul I 'd bust,
  Tried my best to keep f'om laffin', but hit seemed like die I must!
  Y' ought to seen dat man a-scramblin' f'om de ashes an' de grime.
  Did it bu'n him! Sich a question, why he did n't give it time;
  Th'ow'd dem ashes and dem cindahs evah which-a-way I guess,
  An' you nevah did, I reckon, clap yo' eyes on sich a mess;
  Fu' he sholy made a picter an' a funny one to boot,
  Wif his clothes all full o' ashes an' his face all full o' soot.
  Well, hit laked to stopped de pahty, an' I reckon lak ez not
  Dat it would ef Tom's wife, Mandy, had n't happened on de spot,
  To invite us out to suppah--well, we scrambled to de table,
  An' I 'd lak to tell you 'bout it--what we had--but I ain't able,
  Mention jes' a few things, dough I know I had n't orter,
  Fu' I know 't will staht a hank'rin' an' yo' mouf 'll 'mence to worter.
  We had wheat bread white ez cotton an' a egg pone jes like gol',
  Hog jole, bilin' hot an' steamin' roasted shoat an' ham sliced cold--
  Look out! What's de mattah wif you? Don't be fallin' on de flo';
  Ef it 's go'n' to 'fect you dat way, I won't tell you nothin' mo'.
  Dah now--well, we had hot chittlin's--now you 's tryin' ag'in to fall,
  Cain't you stan' to hyeah about it? S'pose you'd been an' seed it all;
  Seed dem gread big sweet pertaters, layin' by de possum's side,
  Seed dat coon in all his gravy, reckon den you 'd up and died!
  Mandy 'lowed "you all mus' 'scuse me, d' wa'n't much upon my she'ves,
  But I's done my bes' to suit you, so set down an' he'p yo'se'ves."
  Tom, he 'lowed: "I don't b'lieve in 'pologisin' an' perfessin',
  Let 'em tek it lak dey ketch it. Eldah Thompson, ask de blessin'."
  Wish you 'd seed dat colo'ed preachah cleah his th'oat an' bow his head;
  One eye shet, an' one eye open,--dis is evah wud he said:
  "Lawd, look down in tendah mussy on sich generous hea'ts ez dese;
  Make us truly thankful, amen. Pass dat possum, ef you please!"
  Well, we eat and drunk ouah po'tion, 'twell dah was n't nothin' lef,
  An' we felt jes' like new sausage, we was mos' nigh stuffed to def!
  Tom, he knowed how we 'd be feelin', so he had de fiddlah 'roun',
  An' he made us cleah de cabin fu' to dance dat suppah down.
  Jim, de fiddlah, chuned his fiddle, put some rosum on his bow,
  Set a pine box on de table, mounted it an' let huh go!
  He's a fiddlah, now I tell you, an' he made dat fiddle ring,
  'Twell de ol'est an' de lamest had to give deir feet a fling.
  Jigs, cotillions, reels an' breakdowns, cordrills an' a waltz er two;
  Bless yo' soul, dat music winged 'em an' dem people lak to flew.
  Cripple Joe, de old rheumatic, danced dat flo' f'om side to middle,
  Th'owed away his crutch an' hopped it; what's rheumatics 'ginst a fiddle?
  Eldah Thompson got so tickled dat he lak to los' his grace,
  Had to tek bofe feet an' hol' dem so 's to keep 'em in deir place.
  An' de Christuns an' de sinnahs got so mixed up on dat flo',
  Dat I don't see how dey 'd pahted ef de trump had chanced to blow.
  Well, we danced dat way an' capahed in de mos' redic'lous way,
  'Twell de roostahs in de bahnyard cleahed deir th'oats an' crowed fu' day.
  Y' ought to been dah, fu' I tell you evahthing was rich an' prime,
  An' dey ain't no use in talkin', we jes had one scrumptious time!
LYRICS OF THE HEARTHSIDE
LOVE'S APOTHEOSIS
  Love me. I care not what the circling years
        To me may do.
  If, but in spite of time and tears,
        You prove but true.
  Love me--albeit grief shall dim mine eyes,
        And tears bedew,
  I shall not e'en complain, for then my skies
        Shall still be blue.
  Love me, and though the winter snow shall pile,
        And leave me chill,
  Thy passion's warmth shall make for me, meanwhile,
        A sun-kissed hill.
  And when the days have lengthened into years,
        And I grow old,
  Oh, spite of pains and griefs and cares and fears,
        Grow thou not cold.
  Then hand and hand we shall pass up the hill,
        I say not down;
  That twain go up, of love, who 've loved their fill,--
        To gain love's crown.
  Love me, and let my life take up thine own,
        As sun the dew.
  Come, sit, my queen, for in my heart a throne
        Awaits for you!
THE PARADOX
  I am the mother of sorrows,
    I am the ender of grief;
  I am the bud and the blossom,
    I am the late-falling leaf.
  I am thy priest and thy poet,
    I am thy serf and thy king;
  I cure the tears of the heartsick,
    When I come near they shall sing.
  White are my hands as the snowdrop;
    Swart are my fingers as clay;
  Dark is my frown as the midnight,
    Fair is my brow as the day.
  Battle and war are my minions,
    Doing my will as divine;
  I am the calmer of passions,
    Peace is a nursling of mine.
  Speak to me gently or curse me,
    Seek me or fly from my sight;
  I am thy fool in the morning,
    Thou art my slave in the night.
  Down to the grave will I take thee,
    Out from the noise of the strife;
  Then shalt thou see me and know me--
    Death, then, no longer, but life.
  Then shalt thou sing at my coming.
    Kiss me with passionate breath,
  Clasp me and smile to have thought me
    Aught save the foeman of Death.
  Come to me, brother, when weary,
    Come when thy lonely heart swells;
  I 'll guide thy footsteps and lead thee
    Down where the Dream Woman dwells.
OVER THE HILLS
  Over the hills and the valleys of dreaming
    Slowly I take my way.
  Life is the night with its dream-visions teeming,
    Death is the waking at day.
  Down thro' the dales and the bowers of loving,
    Singing, I roam afar.
  Daytime or night-time, I constantly roving,--
    Dearest one, thou art my star.
WITH THE LARK
  Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy,
  Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy;
  Darkness for sighing and daylight for song,--
  Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and strong.
  All the night through, though I moan in the dark,
  I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
  Deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves,
  Softly and sadly the wood-spirit grieves.
  But when the first hue of dawn tints the sky,
  I shall shake out my wings like the birds and be dry;
  And though, like the rain-drops, I grieved through the dark,
  I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
  On the high hills of heaven, some morning to be,
  Where the rain shall not grieve thro' the leaves of the tree,
  There my heart will be glad for the pain I have known,
  For my hand will be clasped in the hand of mine own;
  And though life has been hard and death's pathway been dark,
  I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
IN SUMMER
  Oh, summer has clothed the earth
    In a cloak from the loom of the sun!
  And a mantle, too, of the skies' soft blue,
    And a belt where the rivers run.
  And now for the kiss of the wind,
    And the touch of the air's soft hands,
  With the rest from strife and the heat of life,
    With the freedom of lakes and lands.
  I envy the farmer's boy
    Who sings as he follows the plow;
  While the shining green of the young blades lean
    To the breezes that cool his brow.
  He sings to the dewy morn,
    No thought of another's ear;
  But the song he sings is a chant for kings
    And the whole wide world to hear.
  He sings of the joys of life,
    Of the pleasures of work and rest,
  From an o'erfull heart, without aim or art;
  'T is a song of the merriest.
  O ye who toil in the town,
    And ye who moil in the mart,
  Hear the artless song, and your faith made strong
    Shall renew your joy of heart.
  Oh, poor were the worth of the world
    If never a song were heard,--
  If the sting of grief had no relief,
    And never a heart were stirred.
  So, long as the streams run down,
    And as long as the robins trill,
  Let us taunt old Care with a merry air,
    And sing in the face of ill.
THE MYSTIC SEA
  The smell of the sea in my nostrils,
    The sound of the sea in mine ears;
  The touch of the spray on my burning face,
    Like the mist of reluctant tears.
  The blue of the sky above me,
    The green of the waves beneath;
  The sun flashing down on a gray-white sail
    Like a scimitar from its sheath.
  And ever the breaking billows,
    And ever the rocks' disdain;
  And ever a thrill in mine inmost heart
    That my reason cannot explain.
  So I say to my heart, "Be silent,
    The mystery of time is here;
  Death's way will be plain when we fathom the main,
    And the secret of life be clear."
A SAILOR'S SONG
  Oh for the breath of the briny deep,
  And the tug of the bellying sail,
  With the sea-gull's cry across the sky
  And a passing boatman's hail.
  For, be she fierce or be she gay,
  The sea is a famous friend alway.
  Ho! for the plains where the dolphins play,
  And the bend of the mast and spars,
  And a fight at night with the wild sea-sprite
  When the foam has drowned the stars.
  And, pray, what joy can the landsman feel
  Like the rise and fall of a sliding keel?
  Fair is the mead; the lawn is fair
  And the birds sing sweet on the lea;
  But the echo soft of a song aloft
  Is the strain that pleases me;
  And swish of rope and ring of chain
  Are music to men who sail the main.
  Then, if you love me, let me sail
  While a vessel dares the deep;
  For the ship 's my wife, and the breath of life
  Are the raging gales that sweep;
  And when I 'm done with calm and blast,
  A slide o'er the side, and rest at last.
THE BOHEMIAN
  Bring me the livery of no other man.
    I am my own to robe me at my pleasure.
    Accepted rules to me disclose no treasure:
  What is the chief who shall my garments plan?
    No garb conventional but I 'll attack it.
    (Come, why not don my spangled jacket?)
ABSENCE
  Good-night, my love, for I have dreamed of thee
  In waking dreams, until my soul is lost--
  Is lost in passion's wide and shoreless sea,
  Where, like a ship, unruddered, it is tost
  Hither and thither at the wild waves' will.
  There is no potent Master's voice to still
  This newer, more tempestuous Galilee!
  The stormy petrels of my fancy fly
  In warning course across the darkening green,
  And, like a frightened bird, my heart doth cry
  And seek to find some rock of rest between
  The threatening sky and the relentless wave.
  It is not length of life that grief doth crave,
  But only calm and peace in which to die.
  Here let me rest upon this single hope,
  For oh, my wings are weary of the wind,
  And with its stress no more may strive or cope.
  One cry has dulled mine ears, mine eyes are blind,--
  Would that o'er all the intervening space,
  I might fly forth and see thee face to face.
  I fly; I search, but, love, in gloom I grope.
  Fly home, far bird, unto thy waiting nest;
  Spread thy strong wings above the wind-swept sea.
  Beat the grim breeze with thy unruffled breast
  Until thou sittest wing to wing with me.
  Then, let the past bring up its tales of wrong;
  We shall chant low our sweet connubial song,
  Till storm and doubt and past no more shall be!
HER THOUGHT AND HIS
  The gray of the sea, and the gray of the sky,
  A glimpse of the moon like a half-closed eye.
  The gleam on the waves and the light on the land,
  A thrill in my heart,--and--my sweetheart's hand.
  She turned from the sea with a woman's grace,
  And the light fell soft on her upturned face,
  And I thought of the flood-tide of infinite bliss
  That would flow to my heart from a single kiss.
  But my sweetheart was shy, so I dared not ask
  For the boon, so bravely I wore the mask.
  But into her face there came a flame:--
  I wonder could she have been thinking the same?
THE RIGHT TO DIE
  I have no fancy for that ancient cant
  That makes us masters of our destinies,
  And not our lives, to hold or give them up
  As will directs; I cannot, will not think
  That men, the subtle worms, who plot and plan
  And scheme and calculate with such shrewd wit,
  Are such great blund'ring fools as not to know
  When they have lived enough.
                               Men court not death
  When there are sweets still left in life to taste.
  Nor will a brave man choose to live when he,
  Full deeply drunk of life, has reached the dregs,
  And knows that now but bitterness remains.
  He is the coward who, outfaced in this,
  Fears the false goblins of another life.
  I honor him who being much harassed
  Drinks of sweet courage until drunk of it,--
  Then seizing Death, reluctant, by the hand,
  Leaps with him, fearless, to eternal peace!
BEHIND THE ARRAS
  As in some dim baronial hall restrained,
  A prisoner sits, engirt by secret doors
  And waving tapestries that argue forth
  Strange passages into the outer air;
  So in this dimmer room which we call life,
  Thus sits the soul and marks with eye intent
  That mystic curtain o'er the portal death;
  Still deeming that behind the arras lies
  The lambent way that leads to lasting light.
  Poor fooled and foolish soul! Know now that death
  Is but a blind, false door that nowhere leads,
  And gives no hope of exit final, free.
WHEN THE OLD MAN SMOKES
  In the forenoon's restful quiet,
    When the boys are off at school,
  When the window lights are shaded
    And the chimney-corner cool,
  Then the old man seeks his armchair,
    Lights his pipe and settles back;
  Falls a-dreaming as he draws it
    Till the smoke-wreaths gather black.
  And the tear-drops come a-trickling
    Down his cheeks, a silver flow--
  Smoke or memories you wonder,
    But you never ask him,--no;
  For there 's something almost sacred
    To the other family folks
  In those moods of silent dreaming
    When the old man smokes.
  Ah, perhaps he sits there dreaming
    Of the love of other days
  And of how he used to lead her
   Through the merry dance's maze;
  How he called her "little princess,"
    And, to please her, used to twine
  Tender wreaths to crown her tresses,
    From the "matrimony vine."
  Then before his mental vision
    Comes, perhaps, a sadder day,
  When they left his little princess
    Sleeping with her fellow clay.
  How his young heart throbbed, and pained him!
    Why, the memory of it chokes!
  Is it of these things he 's thinking
    When the old man smokes?
  But some brighter thoughts possess him,
    For the tears are dried the while.
  And the old, worn face is wrinkled
    In a reminiscent smile,
  From the middle of the forehead
    To the feebly trembling lip,
  At some ancient prank remembered
    Or some long unheard-of quip.
  Then the lips relax their tension
    And the pipe begins to slide,
  Till in little clouds of ashes,
    It falls softly at his side;
  And his head bends low and lower
    Till his chin lies on his breast,
  And he sits in peaceful slumber
    Like a little child at rest.
  Dear old man, there 's something sad'ning,
    In these dreamy moods of yours,
  Since the present proves so fleeting,
    All the past for you endures.
  Weeping at forgotten sorrows,
    Smiling at forgotten jokes;
  Life epitomized in minutes,
    When the old man smokes.
THE GARRET
  Within a London garret high,
  Above the roofs and near the sky,
  My ill-rewarding pen I ply
      To win me bread.
  This little chamber, six by four,
  Is castle, study, den, and more,--
  Altho' no carpet decks the floor,
      Nor down, the bed.
  My room is rather bleak and bare;
  I only have one broken chair,
  But then, there's plenty of fresh air,--
      Some light, beside.
  What tho' I cannot ask my friends
  To share with me my odds and ends,
  A liberty my aerie lends,
      To most denied.
  The bore who falters at the stair
  No more shall be my curse and care,
  And duns shall fail to find my lair
      With beastly bills.
  When debts have grown and funds are short,
  I find it rather pleasant sport
  To live "above the common sort"
      With all their ills.
  I write my rhymes and sing away,
  And dawn may come or dusk or day:
  Tho' fare be poor, my heart is gay.
      And full of glee.
  Though chimney-pots be all my views;
  'T is nearer for the winging Muse,
  So I am sure she 'll not refuse
      To visit me.
TO E. H. K.
ON THE RECEIPT OF A FAMILIAR POEM
  To me, like hauntings of a vagrant breath
    From some far forest which I once have known,
    The perfume of this flower of verse is blown.
  Tho' seemingly soul-blossoms faint to death,
  Naught that with joy she bears e'er withereth.
    So, tho' the pregnant years have come and flown,
  Lives come and gone and altered like mine own,
  This poem comes to me a shibboleth:
  Brings sound of past communings to my ear,
    Turns round the tide of time and bears me back
    Along an old and long untraversed way;
  Makes me forget this is a later year,
    Makes me tread o'er a reminiscent track,
      Half sad, half glad, to one forgotten day!
A BRIDAL MEASURE
  Come, essay a sprightly measure,
  Tuned to some light song of pleasure.
    Maidens, let your brows be crowned
    As we foot this merry round.
  From the ground a voice is singing,
  From the sod a soul is springing.
    Who shall say 't is but a clod
    Quick'ning upward toward its God?
  Who shall say it? Who may know it,
  That the clod is not a poet
    Waiting but a gleam to waken
    In a spirit music-shaken?
  Phyllis, Phyllis, why be waiting?
  In the woods the birds are mating.
    From the tree beside the wall,
    Hear the am'rous robin call.
  Listen to yon thrush's trilling;
  Phyllis, Phyllis, are you willing,
    When love speaks from cave and tree,
    Only we should silent be?
  When the year, itself renewing,
  All the world with flowers is strewing,
    Then through Youth's Arcadian land,
    Love and song go hand in hand.
  Come, unfold your vocal treasure,
  Sing with me a nuptial measure,--
    Let this springtime gambol be
    Bridal dance for you and me.
VENGEANCE IS SWEET
  When I was young I longed for Love,
  And held his glory far above
  All other earthly things. I cried:
  "Come, Love, dear Love, with me abide;"
  And with my subtlest art I wooed,
  And eagerly the wight pursued.
  But Love was gay and Love was shy,
  He laughed at me and passed me by.
  Well, I grew old and I grew gray,
  When Wealth came wending down my way.
  I took his golden hand with glee,
  And comrades from that day were we.
  Then Love came back with doleful face,
  And prayed that I would give him place.
  But, though his eyes with tears were dim,
  I turned my back and laughed at him.
A HYMN
AFTER READING "LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT."
  Lead gently, Lord, and slow,
    For oh, my steps are weak,
  And ever as I go,
    Some soothing sentence speak;
  That I may turn my face
    Through doubt's obscurity
  Toward thine abiding-place,
    E'en tho' I cannot see.
  For lo, the way is dark;
    Through mist and cloud I grope,
  Save for that fitful spark,
    The little flame of hope.
  Lead gently, Lord, and slow,
    For fear that I may fall;
  I know not where to go
    Unless I hear thy call.
  My fainting soul doth yearn
    For thy green hills afar;
  So let thy mercy burn--
    My greater, guiding star!
JUST WHISTLE A BIT
  Just whistle a bit, if the day be dark,
    And the sky be overcast:
  If mute be the voice of the piping lark,
    Why, pipe your own small blast.
  And it's wonderful how o'er the gray sky-track
  The truant warbler comes stealing back.
  But why need he come? for your soul's at rest,
  And the song in the heart,--ah, that is best.
  Just whistle a bit, if the night be drear
    And the stars refuse to shine:
  And a gleam that mocks the starlight clear
    Within you glows benign.
  Till the dearth of light in the glooming skies
  Is lost to the sight of your soul-lit eyes.
  What matters the absence of moon or star?
  The light within is the best by far.
  Just whistle a bit, if there 's work to do,
    With the mind or in the soil.
  And your note will turn out a talisman true
    To exorcise grim Toil.
  It will lighten your burden and make you feel
  That there 's nothing like work as a sauce for a meal.
  And with song in your heart and the meal in--its place,
  There 'll be joy in your bosom and light in your face.
  Just whistle a bit, if your heart be sore;
  'Tis a wonderful balm for pain.
  Just pipe some old melody o'er and o'er
    Till it soothes like summer rain.
  And perhaps 't would be best in a later day,
  When Death comes stalking down the way,
  To knock at your bosom and see if you 're fit,
  Then, as you wait calmly, just whistle a bit.
THE BARRIER
  The Midnight wooed the Morning-Star,
    And prayed her: "Love come nearer;
  Your swinging coldly there afar
    To me but makes you dearer!"
  The Morning-Star was pale with dole
    As said she, low replying:
  "Oh, lover mine, soul of my soul,
    For you I too am sighing.
  "But One ordained when we were born,
    In spite of Love's insistence,
  That Night might only view the Morn
    Adoring at a distance."
  But as she spoke the jealous Sun
    Across the heavens panted.
  "Oh, whining fools," he cried, "have done;
    Your wishes shall be granted!"
  He hurled his flaming lances far;
    The twain stood unaffrighted--
  And Midnight and the Morning-Star
    Lay down in death united!
DREAMS
  Dream on, for dreams are sweet:
    Do not awaken!
  Dream on, and at thy feet
    Pomegranates shall be shaken.
  Who likeneth the youth
    Of life to morning?
  'Tis like the night in truth,
    Rose-coloured dreams adorning.
  The wind is soft above,
    The shadows umber.
  (There is a dream called Love.)
    Take thou the fullest slumber!
  In Lethe's soothing stream,
    Thy thirst thou slakest.
  Sleep, sleep; 't is sweet to dream.
    Oh, weep when thou awakest!
THE DREAMER
  Temples he built and palaces of air,
    And, with the artist's parent-pride aglow,
    His fancy saw his vague ideals grow
  Into creations marvellously fair;
  He set his foot upon Fame's nether stair.
    But ah, his dream,--it had entranced him so
    He could not move. He could no farther go;
  But paused in joy that he was even there!
  He did not wake until one day there gleamed
    Thro' his dark consciousness a light that racked
  His being till he rose, alert to act.
  But lo! what he had dreamed, the while he dreamed,
    Another, wedding action unto thought,
    Into the living, pulsing world had brought.
WAITING
  The sun has slipped his tether
    And galloped down the west.
  (Oh, it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
  The little bird is sleeping
    In the softness of its nest.
  Night follows day, day follows dawn,
  And so the time has come and gone:
    And it's weary, weary waiting, love.
  The cruel wind is rising
    With a whistle and a wail.
  (And it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
  My eyes are seaward straining
    For the coming of a sail;
  But void the sea, and void the beach
  Far and beyond where gaze can reach!
    And it's weary, weary waiting, love.
  I heard the bell-buoy ringing--
    How long ago it seems!
  (Oh, it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
  And ever still, its knelling
    Crashes in upon my dreams.
  The banns were read, my frock was sewn;
  Since then two seasons' winds have blown--
    And it's weary, weary waiting, love.
  The stretches of the ocean
    Are bare and bleak to-day.
  (Oh, it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
  My eyes are growing dimmer--
    Is it tears, or age, or spray?
  But I will stay till you come home.
  Strange ships come in across the foam!
    But it's weary, weary waiting, love.
THE END OF THE CHAPTER
  Ah, yes, the chapter ends to-day;
  We even lay the book away;
  But oh, how sweet the moments sped
  Before the final page was read!
  We tried to read between the lines
  The Author's deep-concealed designs;
  But scant reward such search secures;
  You saw my heart and I saw yours.
  The Master,--He who penned the page
  And bade us read it,--He is sage:
  And what he orders, you and I
  Can but obey, nor question why.
  We read together and forgot
  The world about us. Time was not.
  Unheeded and unfelt, it fled.
  We read and hardly knew we read.
  Until beneath a sadder sun,
  We came to know the book was done.
  Then, as our minds were but new lit,
  It dawned upon us what was writ;
  And we were startled. In our eyes,
  Looked forth the light of great surprise.
  Then as a deep-toned tocsin tolls,
  A voice spoke forth: "Behold your souls!"
  I do, I do. I cannot look
  Into your eyes: so close the book.
  But brought it grief or brought it bliss,
  No other page shall read like this!
SYMPATHY
  I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
    When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
  When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
  And the river flows like a stream of glass;
    When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
  And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
  I know what the caged bird feels!
  I know why the caged bird beats his wing
    Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
  For he must fly back to his perch and cling
  When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
    And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
  And they pulse again with a keener sting--
  I know why he beats his wing!
  I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
    When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
  When he beats his bars and he would be free;
  It is not a carol of joy or glee,
    But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
  But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
  I know why the caged bird sings!
LOVE AND GRIEF
  Out of my heart, one treach'rous winter's day,
  I locked young Love and threw the key away.
  Grief, wandering widely, found the key,
  And hastened with it, straightway, back to me,
  With Love beside him. He unlocked the door
  And bade Love enter with him there and stay.
  And so the twain abide for evermore.
LOVE'S CHASTENING
  Once Love grew bold and arrogant of air,
  Proud of the youth that made him fresh and fair;
  So unto Grief he spake, "What right hast thou
  To part or parcel of this heart?" Grief's brow
  Was darkened with the storm of inward strife;
  Thrice smote he Love as only he might dare,
  And Love, pride purged, was chastened all his life.
MORTALITY
  Ashes to ashes, dust unto dust,
  What of his loving, what of his lust?
  What of his passion, what of his pain?
  What of his poverty, what of his pride?
  Earth, the great mother, has called him again:
  Deeply he sleeps, the world's verdict defied.
  Shall he be tried again? Shall he go free?
  Who shall the court convene? Where shall it be?
  No answer on the land, none from the sea.
  Only we know that as he did, we must:
  You with your theories, you with your trust,--
  Ashes to ashes, dust unto dust!
LOVE
  A life was mine full of the close concern
    Of many-voiced affairs. The world sped fast;
    Behind me, ever rolled a pregnant past.
  A present came equipped with lore to learn.
  Art, science, letters, in their turn,
    Each one allured me with its treasures vast;
    And I staked all for wisdom, till at last
  Thou cam'st and taught my soul anew to yearn.
    I had not dreamed that I could turn away
  From all that men with brush and pen had wrought;
    But ever since that memorable day
  When to my heart the truth of love was brought,
    I have been wholly yielded to its sway,
  And had no room for any other thought.
SHE GAVE ME A ROSE
  She gave a rose,
    And I kissed it and pressed it.
  I love her, she knows,
    And my action confessed it.
  She gave me a rose,
    And I kissed it and pressed it.
  Ah, how my heart glows,
    Could I ever have guessed it?
  It is fair to suppose
    That I might have repressed it:
  She gave me a rose,
    And I kissed it and pressed it.
  'T was a rhyme in life's prose
    That uplifted and blest it.
  Man's nature, who knows
    Until love comes to test it?
  She gave me a rose,
    And I kissed it and pressed it.
DREAM SONG I
  Long years ago, within a distant clime,
  Ere Love had touched me with his wand sublime,
  I dreamed of one to make my life's calm May
  The panting passion of a summer's day.
  And ever since, in almost sad suspense,
  I have been waiting with a soul intense
  To greet and take unto myself the beams,
  Of her, my star, the lady of my dreams.
  O Love, still longed and looked for, come to me,
  Be thy far home by mountain, vale, or sea.
  My yearning heart may never find its rest
  Until thou liest rapt upon my breast.
  The wind may bring its perfume from the south,
  Is it so sweet as breath from my love's mouth?
  Oh, naught that surely is, and naught that seems
  May turn me from the lady of my dreams.
DREAM SONG II
  Pray, what can dreams avail
    To make love or to mar?
  The child within the cradle rail
    Lies dreaming of the star.
  But is the star by this beguiled
  To leave its place and seek the child?
  The poor plucked rose within its glass
    Still dreameth of the bee;
  But, tho' the lagging moments pass,
    Her Love she may not see.
  If dream of child and flower fail,
  Why should a maiden's dreams prevail?
CHRISTMAS IN THE HEART
  The snow lies deep upon the ground,
  And winter's brightness all around
  Decks bravely out the forest sere,
  With jewels of the brave old year.
  The coasting crowd upon the hill
  With some new spirit seems to thrill;
  And all the temple bells achime.
  Ring out the glee of Christmas time.
  In happy homes the brown oak-bough
  Vies with the red-gemmed holly now;
  And here and there, like pearls, there show
  The berries of the mistletoe.
  A sprig upon the chandelier
  Says to the maidens, "Come not here!"
  Even the pauper of the earth
  Some kindly gift has cheered to mirth!
  Within his chamber, dim and cold,
  There sits a grasping miser old.
  He has no thought save one of gain,--
  To grind and gather and grasp and drain.
  A peal of bells, a merry shout
  Assail his ear: he gazes out
  Upon a world to him all gray,
  And snarls, "Why, this is Christmas Day!"
  No, man of ice,--for shame, for shame!
  For "Christmas Day" is no mere name.
  No, not for you this ringing cheer,
  This festal season of the year.
  And not for you the chime of bells
  From holy temple rolls and swells.
  In day and deed he has no part--
  Who holds not Christmas in his heart!
THE KING IS DEAD
  Aye, lay him in his grave, the old dead year!
  His life is lived--fulfilled his destiny.
  Have you for him no sad, regretful tear
  To drop beside the cold, unfollowed bier?
  Can you not pay the tribute of a sigh?
  Was he not kind to you, this dead old year?
  Did he not give enough of earthly store?
  Enough of love, and laughter, and good cheer?
  Have not the skies you scanned sometimes been clear?
  How, then, of him who dies, could you ask more?
  It is not well to hate him for the pain
  He brought you, and the sorrows manifold.
  To pardon him these hurts still I am fain;
  For in the panting period of his reign,
  He brought me new wounds, but he healed the old.
  One little sigh for thee, my poor, dead friend--
  One little sigh while my companions sing.
  Thou art so soon forgotten in the end;
  We cry e'en as thy footsteps downward tend:
  "The king is dead! long live the king!"
THEOLOGY
  There is a heaven, for ever, day by day,
  The upward longing of my soul doth tell me so.
  There is a hell, I 'm quite as sure; for pray,
  If there were not, where would my neighbours go?
RESIGNATION
  Long had I grieved at what I deemed abuse;
    But now I am as grain within the mill.
  If so be thou must crush me for thy use,
    Grind on, O potent God, and do thy will!
LOVE'S HUMILITY
  As some rapt gazer on the lowly earth,
    Looks up to radiant planets, ranging far,
  So I, whose soul doth know thy wondrous worth
    Look longing up to thee as to a star.
PRECEDENT
  The poor man went to the rich man's doors,
  "I come as Lazarus came," he said.
  The rich man turned with humble head,--
  "I will send my dogs to lick your sores!"
SHE TOLD HER BEADS
  She told her beads with down-cast eyes,
    Within the ancient chapel dim;
    And ever as her fingers slim
  Slipt o'er th' insensate ivories,
  My rapt soul followed, spaniel-wise.
  Ah, many were the beads she wore;
    But as she told them o'er and o'er,
  They did not number all my sighs.
  My heart was filled with unvoiced cries
    And prayers and pleadings unexpressed;
    But while I burned with Love's unrest,
  She told her beads with down-cast eyes.
LITTLE LUCY LANDMAN
  Oh, the day has set me dreaming
    In a strange, half solemn way
  Of the feelings I experienced
    On another long past day,--
  Of the way my heart made music
    When the buds began to blow,
  And o' little Lucy Landman
    Whom I loved long years ago.
  It 's in spring, the poet tells us,
    That we turn to thoughts of love,
  And our hearts go out a-wooing
    With the lapwing and the dove.
  But whene'er the soul goes seeking
    Its twin-soul, upon the wing,
  I 've a notion, backed by mem'ry,
    That it's love that makes the spring.
  I have heard a robin singing
    When the boughs were brown and bare,
  And the chilling hand of winter
  Scattered jewels through the air.
  And in spite of dates and seasons,
    It was always spring, I know,
  When I loved Lucy Landman
    In the days of long ago.
  Ah, my little Lucy Landman,
    I remember you as well
  As if 't were only yesterday
    I strove your thoughts to tell,--
  When I tilted back your bonnet,
    Looked into your eyes so true,
  Just to see if you were loving
    Me as I was loving you.
  Ah, my little Lucy Landman
    It is true it was denied
  You should see a fuller summer
    And an autumn by my side.
  But the glance of love's sweet sunlight
    Which your eyes that morning gave
  Has kept spring within my bosom,
    Though you lie within the grave.
THE GOURD
  In the heavy earth the miner
    Toiled and laboured day by day,
  Wrenching from the miser mountain
    Brilliant treasure where it lay.
  And the artist worn and weary
    Wrought with labour manifold
  That the king might drink his nectar
    From a goblet made of gold.
  On the prince's groaning table
    Mid the silver gleaming bright
  Mirroring the happy faces
    Giving back the flaming light,
  Shine the cups of priceless crystal
    Chased with many a lovely line,
  Glowing now with warmer colour,
    Crimsoned by the ruby wine.
  In a valley sweet with sunlight,
    Fertile with the dew and rain,
  Without miner's daily labour,
    Without artist's nightly pain,
  There there grows the cup I drink from,
    Summer's sweetness in it stored,
  And my lips pronounce a blessing
    As they touch an old brown gourd.
  Why, the miracle at Cana
    In the land of Galilee,
  Tho' it puzzles all the scholars,
    Is no longer strange to me.
  For the poorest and the humblest
    Could a priceless wine afford,
  If they 'd only dip up water
    With a sunlight-seasoned gourd.
  So a health to my old comrade,
    And a song of praise to sing
  When he rests inviting kisses
    In his place beside the spring.
  Give the king his golden goblets,
    Give the prince his crystal hoard;
  But for me the sparkling water
    From a brown and brimming gourd!
THE KNIGHT
  Our good knight, Ted, girds his broadsword on
    (And he wields it well, I ween);
  He 's on his steed, and away has gone
    To the fight for king and queen.
  What tho' no edge the broadsword hath?
  What tho' the blade be made of lath?
    'T is a valiant hand
    That wields the brand,
  So, foeman, clear the path!
  He prances off at a goodly pace;
    'T is a noble steed he rides,
  That bears as well in the speedy race
    As he bears in battle-tides.
  What tho' 't is but a rocking-chair
  That prances with this stately air?
    'T is a warrior bold
    The reins doth hold,
  Who bids all foes beware!
THOU ART MY LUTE
  Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,--
    My being is attuned to thee.
  Thou settest all my words a-wing,
    And meltest me to melody.
  Thou art my life, by thee I live,
    From thee proceed the joys I know;
  Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give
    The meed of love--the cup of woe.
  Thou art my love, by thee I lead
    My soul the paths of light along,
  From vale to vale, from mead to mead,
    And home it in the hills of song.
  My song, my soul, my life, my all,
    Why need I pray or make my plea,
  Since my petition cannot fall;
    For I 'm already one with thee!
THE PHANTOM KISS
  One night in my room, still and beamless,
    With will and with thought in eclipse,
  I rested in sleep that was dreamless;
    When softly there fell on my lips
  A touch, as of lips that were pressing
    Mine own with the message of bliss--
  A sudden, soft, fleeting caressing,
    A breath like a maiden's first kiss.
  I woke-and the scoffer may doubt me--
    I peered in surprise through the gloom;
  But nothing and none were about me,
    And I was alone in my room.
  Perhaps 't was the wind that caressed me
    And touched me with dew-laden breath;
  Or, maybe, close-sweeping, there passed me
    The low-winging Angel of Death.
  Some sceptic may choose to disdain it,
    Or one feign to read it aright;
  Or wisdom may seek to explain it--
    This mystical kiss in the night.
  But rather let fancy thus clear it:
    That, thinking of me here alone,
  The miles were made naught, and, in spirit,
    Thy lips, love, were laid on mine own.
COMMUNION
  In the silence of my heart,
    I will spend an hour with thee,
  When my love shall rend apart
    All the veil of mystery:
  All that dim and misty veil
    That shut in between our souls
  When Death cried, "Ho, maiden, hail!"
    And your barque sped on the shoals.
  On the shoals? Nay, wrongly said.
    On the breeze of Death that sweeps
  Far from life, thy soul has sped
    Out into unsounded deeps.
  I shall take an hour and come
    Sailing, darling, to thy side.
  Wind nor sea may keep me from
    Soft communings with my bride.
  I shall rest my head on thee
    As I did long days of yore,
  When a calm, untroubled sea
    Rocked thy vessel at the shore.
  I shall take thy hand in mine,
    And live o'er the olden days
  When thy smile to me was wine,--
    Golden wine thy word of praise,
  For the carols I had wrought
    In my soul's simplicity;
  For the petty beads of thought
    Which thine eyes alone could see.
  Ah, those eyes, love-blind, but keen
    For my welfare and my weal!
  Tho' the grave-door shut between,
    Still their love-lights o'er me steal.
  I can see thee thro' my tears,
    As thro' rain we see the sun.
  What tho' cold and cooling years
    Shall their bitter courses run,--
  I shall see thee still and be
    Thy true lover evermore,
  And thy face shall be to me
    Dear and helpful as before.
  Death may vaunt and Death may boast,
    But we laugh his pow'r to scorn;
  He is but a slave at most,--
    Night that heralds coming morn.
  I shall spend an hour with thee
    Day by day, my little bride.
  True love laughs at mystery,
    Crying, "Doors of Death, fly wide."
MARE RUBRUM
  In Life's Red Sea with faith I plant my feet,
    And wait the sound of that sustaining word
      Which long ago the men of Israel heard,
  When Pharaoh's host behind them, fierce and fleet,
  Raged on, consuming with revengeful heat.
      Why are the barrier waters still unstirred?--
      That struggling faith may die of hope deferred?
  Is God not sitting in His ancient seat?
  The billows swirl above my trembling limbs,
    And almost chill my anxious heart to doubt
      And disbelief, long conquered and defied.
  But tho' the music of my hopeful hymns
    Is drowned by curses of the raging rout,
      No voice yet bids th' opposing waves divide!
IN AN ENGLISH GARDEN
  In this old garden, fair, I walk to-day
    Heart-charmed with all the beauty of the scene:
    The rich, luxuriant grasses' cooling green,
  The wall's environ, ivy-decked and gray,
  The waving branches with the wind at play,
    The slight and tremulous blooms that show between,
    Sweet all: and yet my yearning heart doth lean
  Toward Love's Egyptian fleshpots far away.
  Beside the wall, the slim Laburnum grows
    And flings its golden flow'rs to every breeze.
    But e'en among such soothing sights as these,
  I pant and nurse my soul-devouring woes.
  Of all the longings that our hearts wot of,
  There is no hunger like the want of love!
THE CRISIS
  A man of low degree was sore oppressed,
    Fate held him under iron-handed sway,
  And ever, those who saw him thus distressed
    Would bid him bend his stubborn will and pray.
  But he, strong in himself and obdurate,
  Waged, prayerless, on his losing fight with Fate.
  Friends gave his proffered hand their coldest clasp,
    Or took it not at all; and Poverty,
  That bruised his body with relentless grasp,
    Grinned, taunting, when he struggled to be free.
  But though with helpless hands he beat the air,
  His need extreme yet found no voice in prayer.
  Then he prevailed; and forthwith snobbish Fate,
    Like some whipped cur, came fawning at his feet;
  Those who had scorned forgave and called him great--
    His friends found out that friendship still was sweet.
  But he, once obdurate, now bowed his head
  In prayer, and trembling with its import, said:
  "Mere human strength may stand ill-fortune's frown;
    So I prevailed, for human strength was mine;
  But from the killing pow'r of great renown,
    Naught may protect me save a strength divine.
  Help me, O Lord, in this my trembling cause;
  I scorn men's curses, but I dread applause!"
THE CONQUERORS
THE BLACK TROOPS IN CUBA
  Round the wide earth, from the red field your valour has won,
  Blown with the breath of the far-speaking gun,
          Goes the word.
  Bravely you spoke through the battle cloud heavy and dun.
  Tossed though the speech toward the mist-hidden sun,
          The world heard.
  Hell would have shrunk from you seeking it fresh from the fray,
  Grim with the dust of the battle, and gray
          From the fight.
  Heaven would have crowned you, with crowns not of gold but of bay,
  Owning you fit for the light of her day,
          Men of night.
  Far through the cycle of years and of lives that shall come,
  There shall speak voices long muffled and dumb,
          Out of fear.
  And through the noises of trade and the turbulent hum,
  Truth shall rise over the militant drum,
          Loud and clear.
  Then on the cheek of the honester nation that grows,
  All for their love of you, not for your woes,
          There shall lie
  Tears that shall be to your souls as the dew to the rose;
  Afterward thanks, that the present yet knows
          Not to ply!
ALEXANDER CRUMMELL--DEAD
  Back to the breast of thy mother,
  Child of the earth!
  E'en her caress can not smother
  What thou hast done.
  Follow the trail of the westering sun
  Over the earth.
  Thy light and his were as one--
  Sun, in thy worth.
  Unto a nation whose sky was as night,
  Camest thou, holily, bearing thy light:
  And the dawn came,
  In it thy fame
  Flashed up in a flame.
  Back to the breast of thy mother--
  To rest.
  Long hast thou striven;
  Dared where the hills by the lightning of heaven were riven;
  Go now, pure shriven.
  Who shall come after thee, out of the clay--
  Learned one and leader to show us the way?
  Who shall rise up when the world gives the test?
  Think thou no more of this--
  Rest!
WHEN ALL IS DONE
  When all is done, and my last word is said,
  And ye who loved me murmur, "He is dead,"
  Let no one weep, for fear that I should know,
  And sorrow too that ye should sorrow so.
  When all is done and in the oozing clay,
  Ye lay this cast-off hull of mine away,
  Pray not for me, for, after long despair,
  The quiet of the grave will be a prayer.
  For I have suffered loss and grievous pain,
  The hurts of hatred and the world's disdain,
  And wounds so deep that love, well-tried and pure,
  Had not the pow'r to ease them or to cure.
  When all is done, say not my day is o'er,
  And that thro' night I seek a dimmer shore:
  Say rather that my morn has just begun,--
  I greet the dawn and not a setting sun,
          When all is done.
THE POET AND THE BABY
  How's a man to write a sonnet, can you tell,--
  How's he going to weave the dim, poetic spell,--
    When a-toddling on the floor
    Is the muse he must adore,
  And this muse he loves, not wisely, but too well?
  Now, to write a sonnet, every one allows,
  One must always be as quiet as a mouse;
    But to write one seems to me
    Quite superfluous to be,
  When you 've got a little sonnet in the house.
  Just a dainty little poem, true and fine,
  That is full of love and life in every line,
    Earnest, delicate, and sweet,
    Altogether so complete
  That I wonder what's the use of writing mine.
DISTINCTION
  "I am but clay," the sinner plead,
    Who fed each vain desire.
  "Not only clay," another said,
    "But worse, for thou art mire."
THE SUM
  A little dreaming by the way,
  A little toiling day by day;
  A little pain, a little strife,
  A little joy,--and that is life.
  A little short-lived summer's morn,
  When joy seems all so newly born,
  When one day's sky is blue above,
  And one bird sings,--and that is love.
  A little sickening of the years,
  The tribute of a few hot tears
  Two folded hands, the failing breath,
  And peace at last,--and that is death.
  Just dreaming, loving, dying so,
  The actors in the drama go--
  A flitting picture on a wall,
  Love, Death, the themes; but is that all?
SONNET
ON AN OLD BOOK WITH UNCUT LEAVES
  Emblem of blasted hope and lost desire,
    No finger ever traced thy yellow page
    Save Time's. Thou hast not wrought to noble rage
  The hearts thou wouldst have stirred. Not any fire
  Save sad flames set to light a funeral pyre
    Dost thou suggest. Nay,--impotent in age,
    Unsought, thou holdst a corner of the stage
  And ceasest even dumbly to aspire.
  How different was the thought of him that writ.
    What promised he to love of ease and wealth,
  When men should read and kindle at his wit.
    But here decay eats up the book by stealth,
  While it, like some old maiden, solemnly,
  Hugs its incongruous virginity!
ON THE SEA WALL
  I sit upon the old sea wall,
    And watch the shimmering sea,
  Where soft and white the moonbeams fall,
    Till, in a fantasy,
  Some pure white maiden's funeral pall
    The strange light seems to me.
  The waters break upon the shore
    And shiver at my feet,
  While I dream old dreams o'er and o'er,
    And dim old scenes repeat;
  Tho' all have dreamed the same before,
    They still seem new and sweet.
  The waves still sing the same old song
    That knew an elder time;
  The breakers' beat is not more strong,
    Their music more sublime;
  And poets thro' the ages long
    Have set these notes to rhyme.
  But this shall not deter my lyre,
    Nor check my simple strain;
  If I have not the old-time fire,
    I know the ancient pain:
  The hurt of unfulfilled desire,--
    The ember quenched by rain.
  I know the softly shining sea
    That rolls this gentle swell
  Has snarled and licked its tongues at me
    And bared its fangs as well;
  That 'neath its smile so heavenly,
    There lurks the scowl of hell!
  But what of that? I strike my string
    (For songs in youth are sweet);
  I 'll wait and hear the waters bring
    Their loud resounding beat;
  Then, in her own bold numbers sing
    The Ocean's dear deceit!
TO A LADY PLAYING THE HARP
  Thy tones are silver melted into sound,
    And as I dream
  I see no walls around,
    But seem to hear
    A gondolier
  Sing sweetly down some slow Venetian stream.
  Italian skies--that I have never seen--
    I see above.
  (Ah, play again, my queen;
    Thy fingers white
    Fly swift and light
  And weave for me the golden mesh of love.)
  Oh, thou dusk sorceress of the dusky eyes
    And soft dark hair,
  'T is thou that mak'st my skies
    So swift to change
    To far and strange:
  But far and strange, thou still dost make them fair.
  Now thou dost sing, and I am lost in thee
    As one who drowns
  In floods of melody.
    Still in thy art
    Give me this part,
  Till perfect love, the love of loving crowns.
CONFESSIONAL
  Search thou my heart;
    If there be guile,
  It shall depart
    Before thy smile.
  Search thou my soul;
    Be there deceit,
  'T will vanish whole
    Before thee, sweet.
  Upon my mind
    Turn thy pure lens;
  Naught shalt thou find
    Thou canst not cleanse.
  If I should pray,
    I scarcely know
  In just what way
    My prayers would go.
  So strong in me
    I feel love's leaven,
  I 'd bow to thee
    As soon as Heaven!
MISAPPREHENSION
  Out of my heart, one day, I wrote a song,
    With my heart's blood imbued,
  Instinct with passion, tremulously strong,
    With grief subdued;
    Breathing a fortitude
      Pain-bought.
  And one who claimed much love for what I wrought,
    Read and considered it,
      And spoke:
  "Ay, brother,--'t is well writ,
      But where's the joke?"
PROMETHEUS
  Prometheus stole from Heaven the sacred fire
    And swept to earth with it o'er land and sea.
    He lit the vestal flames of poesy,
  Content, for this, to brave celestial ire.
  Wroth were the gods, and with eternal hate
    Pursued the fearless one who ravished Heaven
    That earth might hold in fee the perfect leaven
  To lift men's souls above their low estate.
  But judge you now, when poets wield the pen,
    Think you not well the wrong has been repaired?
    'Twas all in vain that ill Prometheus fared:
  The fire has been returned to Heaven again!
  We have no singers like the ones whose note
    Gave challenge to the noblest warbler's song.
    We have no voice so mellow, sweet, and strong
  As that which broke from Shelley's golden throat.
  The measure of our songs is our desires:
    We tinkle where old poets used to storm.
    We lack their substance tho' we keep their form:
  We strum our banjo-strings and call them lyres.
LOVE'S PHASES
  Love hath the wings of the butterfly,
    Oh, clasp him but gently,
  Pausing and dipping and fluttering by
    Inconsequently.
  Stir not his poise with the breath of a sigh;
  Love hath the wings of the butterfly.
  Love hath the wings of the eagle bold,
    Cling to him strongly--
  What if the look of the world be cold,
    And life go wrongly?
  Rest on his pinions, for broad is their fold;
  Love hath the wings of the eagle bold.
  Love hath the voice of the nightingale,
    Hearken his trilling--
  List to his song when the moonlight is pale,--
    Passionate, thrilling.
  Cherish the lay, ere the lilt of it fail;
  Love hath the voice of the nightingale.
  Love hath the voice of the storm at night,
    Wildly defiant.
  Hear him and yield up your soul to his might,
    Tenderly pliant.
  None shall regret him who heed him aright;
  Love hath the voice of the storm at night.
FOR THE MAN WHO FAILS
  The world is a snob, and the man who wins
    Is the chap for its money's worth:
  And the lust for success causes half of the sins
    That are cursing this brave old earth.
  For it 's fine to go up, and the world's applause
    Is sweet to the mortal ear;
  But the man who fails in a noble cause
    Is a hero that 's no less dear.
  'T is true enough that the laurel crown
    Twines but for the victor's brow;
  For many a hero has lain him down
    With naught but the cypress bough.
  There are gallant men in the losing fight,
    And as gallant deeds are done
  As ever graced the captured height
    Or the battle grandly won.
  We sit at life's board with our nerves highstrung,
    And we play for the stake of Fame,
  And our odes are sung and our banners hung
    For the man who wins the game.
  But I have a song of another kind
    Than breathes in these fame-wrought gales,--
  An ode to the noble heart and mind
    Of the gallant man who fails!
  The man who is strong to fight his fight,
    And whose will no front can daunt,
  If the truth be truth and the right be right,
    Is the man that the ages want.
  Tho' he fail and die in grim defeat,
    Yet he has not fled the strife,
  And the house of Earth will seem more sweet
    For the perfume of his life.
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE
  She told the story, and the whole world wept
    At wrongs and cruelties it had not known
    But for this fearless woman's voice alone.
    She spoke to consciences that long had slept:
  Her message, Freedom's clear reveille, swept
    From heedless hovel to complacent throne.
    Command and prophecy were in the tone
    And from its sheath the sword of justice leapt.
  Around two peoples swelled a fiery wave,
    But both came forth transfigured from the flame.
  Blest be the hand that dared be strong to save,
    And blest be she who in our weakness came--
    Prophet and priestess! At one stroke she gave
    A race to freedom and herself to fame.
VAGRANTS
  Long time ago, we two set out,
    My soul and I.
    I know not why,
  For all our way was dim with doubt.
    I know not where
    We two may fare:
  Though still with every changing weather,
  We wander, groping on together.
  We do not love, we are not friends,
    My soul and I.
    He lives a lie;
  Untruth lines every way he wends.
    A scoffer he
    Who jeers at me:
  And so, my comrade and my brother,
  We wander on and hate each other.
  Ay, there be taverns and to spare,
    Beside the road;
    But some strange goad
  Lets me not stop to taste their fare.
    Knew I the goal
    Toward which my soul
  And I made way, hope made life fragrant:
  But no. We wander, aimless, vagrant!
A WINTER'S DAY
  Across the hills and down the narrow ways,
    And up the valley where the free winds sweep,
    The earth is folded in an ermined sleep
  That mocks the melting mirth of myriad Mays.
  Departed her disheartening duns and grays,
    And all her crusty black is covered deep.
    Dark streams are locked in Winter's donjon-keep,
  And made to shine with keen, unwonted rays.
  O icy mantle, and deceitful snow!
    What world-old liars in your hearts ye are!
    Are there not still the darkened seam and scar
  Beneath the brightness that you fain would show?
  Come from the cover with thy blot and blur,
  O reeking Earth, thou whited sepulchre!
MY LITTLE MARCH GIRL
  Come to the pane, draw the curtain apart,
  There she is passing, the girl of my heart;
  See where she walks like a queen in the street,
  Weather-defying, calm, placid and sweet.
  Tripping along with impetuous grace,
  Joy of her life beaming out of her face,
  Tresses all truant-like, curl upon curl,
  Wind-blown and rosy, my little March girl.
  Hint of the violet's delicate bloom,
  Hint of the rose's pervading perfume!
  How can the wind help from kissing her face,--
  Wrapping her round in his stormy embrace?
  But still serenely she laughs at his rout,
  She is the victor who wins in the bout.
  So may life's passions about her soul swirl,
  Leaving it placid,--my little March girl.
  What self-possession looks out of her eyes!
  What are the wild winds, and what are the skies,
  Frowning and glooming when, brimming with life,
  Cometh the little maid ripe for the strife?
  Ah! Wind, and bah! Wind, what might have you now?
  What can you do with that innocent brow?
  Blow, Wind, and grow, Wind, and eddy and swirl,
  But bring her to me, Wind,--my little March girl.
REMEMBERED
  She sang, and I listened the whole song thro'.
    (It was sweet, so sweet, the singing.)
  The stars were out and the moon it grew
  From a wee soft glimmer way out in the blue
    To a bird thro' the heavens winging.
  She sang, and the song trembled down to my breast,--
    (It was sweet, so sweet the singing.)
  As a dove just out of its fledgling nest,
  And, putting its wings to the first sweet test,
    Flutters homeward so wearily winging.
  She sang and I said to my heart "That song,
    That was sweet, so sweet i' the singing,
  Shall live with us and inspire us long,
  And thou, my heart, shalt be brave and strong
    For the sake of those words a-winging."
  The woman died and the song was still.
    (It was sweet, so sweet, the singing.)
  But ever I hear the same low trill,
  Of the song that shakes my heart with a thrill,
    And goes forever winging.
LOVE DESPOILED
  As lone I sat one summer's day,
    With mien dejected, Love came by;
  His face distraught, his locks astray,
    So slow his gait, so sad his eye,
    I hailed him with a pitying cry:
  "Pray, Love, what has disturbed thee so?"
    Said I, amazed. "Thou seem'st bereft;
  And see thy quiver hanging low,--
    What, not a single arrow left?
    Pray, who is guilty of this theft?"
  Poor Love looked in my face and cried:
    "No thief were ever yet so bold
  To rob my quiver at my side.
    But Time, who rules, gave ear to Gold,
    And all my goodly shafts are sold."
THE LAPSE
  This poem must be done to-day;
    Then, I 'll e'en to it.
  I must not dream my time away,--
    I 'm sure to rue it.
  The day is rather bright, I know
    The Muse will pardon
  My half-defection, if I go
    Into the garden.
  It must be better working there,--
    I 'm sure it's sweeter:
  And something in the balmy air
    May clear my metre.
    [_In the Garden._]
  Ah this is noble, what a sky!
    What breezes blowing!
  The very clouds, I know not why,
    Call one to rowing.
  The stream will be a paradise
    To-day, I 'll warrant.
  I know the tide that's on the rise
    Will seem a torrent;
  I know just how the leafy boughs
    Are all a-quiver;
  I know how many skiffs and scows
    Are on the river.
  I think I 'll just go out awhile
    Before I write it;
  When Nature shows us such a smile,
    We should n't slight it.
  For Nature always makes desire
    By giving pleasure;
  And so 't will help me put more fire
    Into my measure.
    [_On the River._]
  The river's fine, I 'm glad I came,
    That poem 's teasing;
  But health is better far than fame,
    Though cheques are pleasing.
  I don't know what I did it for,--
    This air 's a poppy.
  I 'm sorry for my editor,--
    He 'll get no copy!
THE WARRIOR'S PRAYER
  Long since, in sore distress, I heard one pray,
    "Lord, who prevailest with resistless might,
  Ever from war and strife keep me away,
      My battles fight!"
  I know not if I play the Pharisee,
    And if my brother after all be right;
  But mine shall be the warrior's plea to thee--
      Strength for the fight.
  I do not ask that thou shalt front the fray,
    And drive the warring foeman from my sight;
  I only ask, O Lord, by night, by day,
      Strength for the fight!
  When foes upon me press, let me not quail
    Nor think to turn me into coward flight.
  I only ask, to make mine arms prevail,
      Strength for the fight!
  Still let mine eyes look ever on the foe,
    Still let mine armor case me strong and bright;
  And grant me, as I deal each righteous blow,
      Strength for the fight!
  And when, at eventide, the fray is done,
    My soul to Death's bedchamber do thou light,
  And give me, be the field or lost or won,
      Rest from the fight!
FAREWELL TO ARCADY
  With sombre mien, the Evening gray
  Comes nagging at the heels of Day,
  And driven faster and still faster
  Before the dusky-mantled Master,
  The light fades from her fearful eyes,
  She hastens, stumbles, falls, and dies.
  Beside me Amaryllis weeps;
  The swelling tears obscure the deeps
  Of her dark eyes, as, mistily,
  The rushing rain conceals the sea.
  Here, lay my tuneless reed away,--
  I have no heart to tempt a lay.
  I scent the perfume of the rose
  Which by my crystal fountain grows.
  In this sad time, are roses blowing?
  And thou, my fountain, art thou flowing,
  While I who watched thy waters spring
  Am all too sad to smile or sing?
  Nay, give me back my pipe again,
  It yet shall breathe this single strain:
        Farewell to Arcady!
THE VOICE OF THE BANJO
  In a small and lonely cabin out of noisy traffic's way,
  Sat an old man, bent and feeble, dusk of face, and hair of gray,
  And beside him on the table, battered, old, and worn as he,
  Lay a banjo, droning forth this reminiscent melody:
  "Night is closing in upon us, friend of mine, but don't be sad;
  Let us think of all the pleasures and the joys that we have had.
  Let us keep a merry visage, and be happy till the last,
  Let the future still be sweetened with the honey of the past.
  "For I speak to you of summer nights upon the yellow sand,
  When the Southern moon was sailing high and silvering all the land;
  And if love tales were not sacred, there's a tale that I could tell
  Of your many nightly wanderings with a dusk and lovely belle.
  "And I speak to you of care-free songs when labour's hour was o'er,
  And a woman waiting for your step outside the cabin door,
  And of something roly-poly that you took upon your lap,
  While you listened for the stumbling, hesitating words, 'Pap, pap.'
  "I could tell you of a 'possum hunt across the wooded grounds,
  I could call to mind the sweetness of the baying of the hounds,
  You could lift me up and smelling of the timber that 's in me,
  Build again a whole green forest with the mem'ry of a tree.
  "So the future cannot hurt us while we keep the past in mind,
  What care I for trembling fingers,--what care you that you are blind?
  Time may leave us poor and stranded, circumstance may make us bend;
  But they 'll only find us mellower, won't they, comrade?--in the end."
THE STIRRUP CUP
  Come, drink a stirrup cup with me,
    Before we close our rouse.
  You 're all aglow with wine, I know:
    The master of the house,
    Unmindful of our revelry,
    Has drowned the carking devil care,
      And slumbers in his chair.
  Come, drink a cup before we start;
    We 've far to ride to-night.
  And Death may take the race we make,
    And check our gallant flight:
    But even he must play his part,
    And tho' the look he wears be grim,
    We 'll drink a toast to him!
  For Death,--a swift old chap is he,
    And swift the steed He rides.
  He needs no chart o'er main or mart,
    For no direction bides.
    So, come, a final, cup with me,
    And let the soldiers' chorus swell,--
    To hell with care, to hell!
A CHOICE
  They please me not--these solemn songs
  That hint of sermons covered up.
  'Tis true the world should heed its wrongs,
    But in a poem let me sup,
  Not simples brewed to cure or ease
  Humanity's confessed disease,
  But the spirit-wine of a singing line,
    Or a dew-drop in a honey cup!
HUMOUR AND DIALECT
THEN AND NOW
THEN
  He loved her, and through many years,
  Had paid his fair devoted court,
  Until she wearied, and with sneers
  Turned all his ardent love to sport.
  That night within his chamber lone,
  He long sat writing by his bed
  A note in which his heart made moan
  For love; the morning found him dead.
NOW
  Like him, a man of later day
  Was jilted by the maid he sought,
  And from her presence turned away,
  Consumed by burning, bitter thought.
  He sought his room to write--a curse
  Like him before and die, I ween.
  Ah no, he put his woes in verse,
  And sold them to a magazine.
AT CHESHIRE CHEESE
  When first of wise old Johnson taught,
  My youthful mind its homage brought,
  And made the pond'rous crusty sage
  The object of a noble rage.
  Nor did I think (How dense we are!)
  That any day, however far,
  Would find me holding, unrepelled,
  The place that Doctor Johnson held!
  But change has come and time has moved,
  And now, applauded, unreproved,
  I hold, with pardonable pride,
  The place that Johnson occupied.
  Conceit! Presumption! What is this?
  You surely read my words amiss;
  Like Johnson I,--a man of mind!
  How could you ever be so blind?
  No. At the ancient "Cheshire Cheese,"
  Blown hither by some vagrant breeze,
  To dignify my shallow wit,
  In Doctor Johnson's seat I sit!
MY CORN-COB PIPE
  Men may sing of their Havanas, elevating to the stars
  The real or fancied virtues of their foreign-made cigars;
  But I worship Nicotina at a different sort of shrine,
  And she sits enthroned in glory in this corn-cob pipe of mine.
  It 's as fragrant as the meadows when the clover is in bloom;
  It 's as dainty as the essence of the daintiest perfume;
  It 's as sweet as are the orchards when the fruit is hanging ripe,
  With the sun's warm kiss upon them--is this corn-cob pipe.
  Thro' the smoke about it clinging, I delight its form to trace,
  Like an oriental beauty with a veil upon her face;
  And my room is dim with vapour as a church when censers sway,
  As I clasp it to my bosom--in a figurative way.
  It consoles me in misfortune and it cheers me in distress,
  And it proves a warm partaker of my pleasures in success;
  So I hail it as a symbol, friendship's true and worthy type,
  And I press my lips devoutly to my corn-cob pipe.
IN AUGUST
  When August days are hot an' dry,
  When burning copper is the sky,
  I 'd rather fish than feast or fly
  In airy realms serene and high.
  I 'd take a suit not made for looks,
  Some easily digested books,
  Some flies, some lines, some bait, some hooks,
  Then would I seek the bays and brooks.
  I would eschew mine every task,
  In Nature's smiles my soul should bask,
  And I methinks no more could ask,
  Except--perhaps--one little flask.
  In case of accident, you know,
  Or should the wind come on to blow,
  Or I be chilled or capsized, so,
  A flask would be the only go.
  Then could I spend a happy time,--
  A bit of sport, a bit of rhyme
  (A bit of lemon, or of lime,
  To make my bottle's contents prime).
  When August days are hot an' dry,
  I won't sit by an' sigh or die,
  I 'll get my bottle (on the sly)
  And go ahead, and fish, and lie!
THE DISTURBER
  Oh, what shall I do? I am wholly upset;
  I am sure I 'll be jailed for a lunatic yet.
  I 'll be out of a job--it's the thing to expect
  When I 'm letting my duty go by with neglect.
  You may judge the extent and degree of my plight
  When I 'm thinking all day and a-dreaming all night,
  And a-trying my hand at a rhyme on the sly,
  All on account of a sparkling eye.
  There are those who say men should be strong, well-a-day!
  But what constitutes strength in a man? Who shall say?
  I am strong as the most when it comes to the arm.
  I have aye held my own on the playground or farm.
  And when I 've been tempted, I haven't been weak;
  But now--why, I tremble to hear a maid speak.
  I used to be bold, but now I 've grown shy,
  And all on account of a sparkling eye.
  There once was a time when my heart was devout,
  But now my religion is open to doubt.
  When parson is earnestly preaching of grace,
  My fancy is busy with drawing a face,
  Thro' the back of a bonnet most piously plain;
  'I draw it, redraw it, and draw it again.'
  While the songs and the sermon unheeded go by,--
  All on account of a sparkling eye.
  Oh, dear little conjurer, give o'er your wiles,
  It is easy for you, you're all blushes and smiles:
  But, love of my heart, I am sorely perplexed;
  I am smiling one minute and sighing the next;
  And if it goes on, I 'll drop hackle and flail,
  And go to the parson and tell him my tale.
  I warrant he 'll find me a cure for the sigh
  That you 're aye bringing forth with the glance of your eye.
EXPECTATION
  You 'll be wonderin' whut 's de reason
    I 's a grinnin' all de time,
  An' I guess you t'ink my sperits
    Mus' be feelin' mighty prime.
  Well, I 'fess up, I is tickled
    As a puppy at his paws.
  But you need n't think I's crazy,
    I ain' laffin' 'dout a cause.
  You's a wonderin' too, I reckon,
    Why I does n't seem to eat,
  An' I notice you a lookin'
    Lak you felt completely beat
  When I 'fuse to tek de bacon,
    An' don' settle on de ham.
  Don' you feel no feah erbout me,
    Jes' keep eatin', an' be ca'm.
  Fu' I's waitin' an' I's watchin'
    'Bout a little t'ing I see--
  D' othah night I's out a walkin'
    An' I passed a 'simmon tree.
  Now I's whettin' up my hongry,
    An' I's laffin' fit to kill,
  Fu' de fros' done turned de 'simmons,
    An' de possum 's eat his fill.
  He done go'ged hisse'f owdacious,
    An' he stayin' by de tree!
  Don' you know, ol' Mistah Possum
    Dat you gittin' fat fu' me?
  'T ain't no use to try to 'spute it,
    'Case I knows you's gittin' sweet
  Wif dat 'simmon flavoh thoo you,
    So I's waitin' fu' yo' meat.
  An' some ebenin' me an Towsah
    Gwine to come an' mek a call,
  We jes' drap in onexpected
    Fu' to shek yo' han', dat's all.
  Oh, I knows dat you 'll be tickled,
    Seems lak I kin see you smile,
  So pu'haps I mought pu'suade you
    Fu' to visit us a while.
LOVER'S LANE
  Summah night an' sighin' breeze,
    'Long de lovah's lane;
  Frien'ly, shadder-mekin' trees,
    'Long de lovah's lane.
  White folks' wo'k all done up gran'--
  Me an' 'Mandy han'-in-han'
  Struttin' lak we owned de lan',

  An' come hidin' f'om de moon

  But I whispahs low lak dis,
  An' my 'Mandy smile huh bliss--
  Mistah Bush he shek his fis',
   Down in lovah's lane.
  Whut I keer ef day is long,
    Down in lovah's lane.
  I kin allus sing a song
    'Long de lovah's lane.
  An' de wo'ds I hyeah an' say
  Meks up fu' de weary day
  Wen I's strollin' by de way,
    Down in lovah's lane.
  An' dis t'ought will allus rise
    Down in lovah's lane;
  Wondah whethah in de skies
    Dey 's a lovah's lane.
  Ef dey ain't, I tell you true,
  'Ligion do look mighty blue,
  'Cause I do' know whut I 'd do
    'Dout a lovah's lane.
PROTEST
  Who say my hea't ain't true to you?
    Dey bettah heish dey mouf.
  I knows I loves you thoo an' thoo
    In watah time er drouf.
  I wush dese people 'd stop dey talkin',
  Don't mean no mo' dan chicken's squawkin':
  I guess I knows which way I's walkin',
    I knows de norf f'om souf.
  I does not love Elizy Brown,
    I guess I knows my min'.
  You allus try to tek me down
    Wid evaht'ing you fin'.
  Ef dese hyeah folks will keep on fillin'
  Yo' haid wid nonsense, an' you's willin'

  O' cose I buys de gal ice-cream,
    Whut else I gwine to do?
  I knows jes' how de t'ing 'u'd seem
    Ef I 'd be sho't wid you.
  On Sunday, you's at chu'ch a-shoutin',
  Den all de week you go 'roun' poutin'--
  I's mighty tiahed o' all dis doubtin',
    I tell you cause I's true.
HYMN
  O li'l' lamb out in de col',
  De Mastah call you to de fol',
          O li'l' lamb!
  He hyeah you bleatin' on de hill;
  Come hyeah an' keep yo' mou'nin' still,

  He answah f'om de brambles thick,
  "O Shepud, I's a-comin' quick"--
          O li'l' lamb!
LITTLE BROWN BABY
  Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
    Come to yo' pappy an' set on his knee.
  What you been doin', suh--makin' san' pies?
    Look at dat bib--you's ez du'ty ez me.
  Look at dat mouf--dat's merlasses, I bet;
    Come hyeah, Maria, an' wipe off his han's.
  Bees gwine to ketch you an' eat you up yit,
    Bein' so sticky an sweet--goodness lan's!
  Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes,
    Who's pappy's darlin' an' who 's pappy's chile?
  Who is it all de day nevah once tries
    Fu' to be cross, er once loses dat smile?
  Whah did you git dem teef? My, you 's a scamp!
    Whah did dat dimple come f'om in yo' chin?
  Pappy do' know you--I b'lieves you 's a tramp;
    Mammy, dis hyeah's some ol' straggler got in!
  Let's th'ow him outen de do' in de san',
    We do' want stragglers a-layin' 'roun' hyeah;
  Let's gin him 'way to de big buggah-man;
    I know he's hidin' erroun' hyeah right neah.
  Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do',
    Hyeah 's a bad boy you kin have fu' to eat.
  Mammy an' pappy do' want him no mo',
    Swaller him down f'om his haid to his feet!
  Dah, now, I t'ought dat you 'd hug me up close.
    Go back, ol' buggah, you sha'n't have dis boy.
  He ain't no tramp, ner no straggler, of co'se;
    He's pappy's pa'dner an' play-mate an' joy.
  Come to you' pallet now--go to yo' res;
    Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies;
  Wisht you could stay jes' a chile on my breas'--
    Little brown baby wif spa'klin' eyes!
TIME TO TINKER 'ROUN'!
  Summah 's nice, wif sun a-shinin',
    Spring is good wif greens and grass,
  An' dey 's some t'ings nice 'bout wintah,
    Dough hit brings de freezin' blas;
  But de time dat is de fines',
    Whethah fiel's is green er brown,
  Is w'en de rain 's a-po'in'
    An' dey 's time to tinker 'roun.
  Den you men's de mule's ol' ha'ness,
    An' you men's de broken chair.
  Hummin' all de time you 's wo'kin'
    Some ol' common kind o' air.
  Evah now an' then you looks out,
    Tryin' mighty ha'd to frown,
  But you cain't, you 's glad hit 's rainin',
    An' dey 's time to tinker 'roun'.
  Oh, you 'ten's lak you so anxious
    Evah time it so't o' stops.

  But hit ain't de crops you 's aftah;

  Dat's hit's too wet out fu' wo'kin',

  Oh, dey 's fun inside de co'n-crib.

  An' dey 's allus some one jokin',

  Dah 's a quiet in yo' cabin,
    Only fu' de rain's sof soun';
  So you 's mighty blessed happy
    W'en dey 's time to tinker 'roun'!
THE REAL QUESTION
  Folks is talkin' 'bout de money, 'bout de silvah an' de gold;
  All de time de season 's changin' an' de days is gittin' cold.
  An' dey 's wond'rin' 'bout de metals, whethah we'll have one er two.
  While de price o' coal is risin' an' dey 's two months' rent dat 's due.
  Some folks says dat gold 's de only money dat is wuff de name,
  Den de othahs rise an' tell 'em dat dey ought to be ashame,
  An' dat silvah is de only thing to save us f'om de powah
  Of de gold-bug ragin' 'roun' an' seekin' who he may devowah.
  Well, you folks kin keep on shoutin' wif yo' gold er silvah cry,
  But I tell you people hams is sceerce an' fowls is roostin' high.
  An' hit ain't de so't o' money dat is pesterin' my min',
  But de question I want answehed 's how to get at any kin'!
JILTED
  Lucy done gone back on me,
    Dat's de way wif life.
  Evaht'ing was movin' free,
    T'ought I had my wife.
  Den some dahky comes along,
  Sings my gal a little song,
  Since den, evaht'ing's gone wrong,
    Evah day dey 's strife.
  Did n't answeh me to-day,
    Wen I called huh name,
  Would you t'ink she 'd ac' dat way
    Wen I ain't to blame?
  Dat 's de way dese women do,
  Wen dey fin's a fellow true,
  Den dey 'buse him thoo an' thoo;
    Well, hit 's all de same.
  Somep'n's wrong erbout my lung,
    An' I 's glad hit 's so.
  Doctah says 'at I 'll die young,
    Well, I wants to go!
  Whut 's de use o' livin' hyeah,
  Wen de gal you loves so deah,
  Goes back on you clean an' cleah--
    I sh'd like to know?
THE NEWS
  Whut dat you whisperin' keepin' f'om me?
  Don't shut me out 'cause I 's ol' an' can't see.
  Somep'n's gone wrong dat 's a-causin' you dread,--
  Don't be afeared to tell--Whut! mastah dead?
  Somebody brung de news early to-day,--
  One of de sojers he led, do you say?
  Did n't he foller whah ol' mastah lead?
  How kin he live w'en his leadah is dead?
  Let me lay down awhile, dah by his bed;
  I wants to t'ink,--hit ain't cleah in my head:--
  Killed while a-leadin' his men into fight,--
  Dat 's whut you said, ain't it, did I hyeah right?
  Mastah, my mastah, dead dah in de fiel'?
  Lif me up some,--dah, jes' so I kin kneel.
  I was too weak to go wid him, dey said,
  Well, now I 'll--fin' him--so--mastah is dead.
  Yes, suh, I 's comin' ez fas' ez I kin,--
  Twas kin' o' da'k, but hit 's lightah agin:
  P'omised yo' pappy I 'd allus tek keer
  Of you,--yes, mastah,--I 's follerin',--hyeah!
CHRISMUS ON THE PLANTATION
  It was Chrismus Eve, I mind hit fu' a mighty gloomy day--
  Bofe de weathah an' de people--not a one of us was gay;
  Cose you 'll t'ink dat 's mighty funny 'twell I try to mek hit cleah,
  Fu' a da'ky 's allus happy when de holidays is neah.
  But we wasn't, fu' dat mo'nin' Mastah 'd tol' us we mus' go,
  He 'd been payin' us sence freedom, but he couldn't pay no mo';'
  He wa'n't nevah used to plannin' 'fo' he got so po' an' ol',
  So he gwine to give up tryin', an' de homestead mus' be sol'.
  I kin see him stan'in' now erpon de step ez cleah ez day,
  Wid de win' a-kind o' fondlin' thoo his haih all thin an' gray;
  An' I 'membah how he trimbled when he said, "It's ha 'd fu' me,
  Not to mek yo' Chrismus brightah, but I 'low it wa'n't to be."
  All de women was a-cryin', an' de men, too, on de sly,
  An' I noticed somep'n shinin' even in ol' Mastah's eye.
  But we all stood still to listen ez ol' Ben come f'om de crowd
  An' spoke up, a-try'n' to steady down his voice and mek it loud:--
  "Look hyeah, Mastah, I 's been servin' you' fu' lo! dese many yeahs,
  An' now, sence we 's got freedom an' you 's kind o' po', hit 'pears
  Dat you want us all to leave you 'cause you don't t'ink you can pay.
  Ef my membry has n't fooled me, seem dat whut I hyead you say.
  "Er in othah wo'ds, you wants us to fu'git dat you 's been kin',
  An' ez soon ez you is he'pless, we 's to leave you hyeah behin'.
  Well, ef dat 's de way dis freedom ac's on people, white er black,
  You kin jes' tell Mistah Lincum fu' to tek his freedom back.
  "We gwine wo'k dis ol' plantation fu' whatevah we kin git,
  Fu' I know hit did suppo't us, an' de place kin do it yit.
  Now de land is yo's, de hands is ouahs, an' I reckon we 'll be brave,
  An' we 'll bah ez much ez you do w'en we has to scrape an' save."
  Ol' Mastah stood dah trimblin', but a-smilin' thoo his teahs,
  An' den hit seemed jes' nachul-like, de place fah rung wid cheahs,
  An' soon ez dey was quiet, some one sta'ted sof an' low:
  "Praise God," an' den we all jined in, "from whom all blessin's flow!"
  Well, dey was n't no use tryin', ouah min's was sot to stay,
  An' po' ol' Mastah could n't plead ner baig, ner drive us 'way,
  An' all at once, hit seemed to us, de day was bright agin,
  So evahone was gay dat night, an' watched de Chrismus in.
ANGELINA
  When de fiddle gits to singin' out a ol' Vahginny reel,
  An' you 'mence to feel a ticklin' in yo' toe an' in yo' heel;
  Ef you t'ink you got 'uligion an' you wants to keep it, too,
  You jes' bettah tek a hint an' git yo'self clean out o' view.
  Case de time is mighty temptin' when de chune is in de swing,
  Fu' a darky, saint or sinner man, to cut de pigeon-wing.
  An' you could n't he'p f'om dancin' ef yo' feet was boun' wif twine,
  When Angelina Johnson comes a-swingin' down de line.
  Don't you know Miss Angelina? She 's de da'lin' of de place.
  W'y, dey ain't no high-toned lady wif sich mannahs an' sich grace.
  She kin move across de cabin, wif its planks all rough an' wo';
  Jes' de same 's ef she was dancin' on ol' mistus' ball-room flo'.
  Fact is, you do' see no cabin--evaht'ing you see look grand,
  An' dat one ol' squeaky fiddle soun' to you jes' lak a ban';
  Cotton britches look lak broadclof an' a linsey dress look fine,
  When Angelina Johnson comes a-swingin' down de line.
  Some folks say dat dancin 's sinful, an' de blessed Lawd, dey say,
  Gwine to punish us fu' steppin' w'en we hyeah de music play.
  But I tell you I don' b'lieve it, fu' de Lawd is wise and good,
  An' he made de banjo's metal an' he made de fiddle's wood,
  An' he made de music in dem, so I don' quite t'ink he 'll keer
  Ef our feet keeps time a little to de melodies we hyeah.
  W'y, dey's somep'n' downright holy in de way our faces shine,
  When Angelina Johnson comes a-swingin' down de line.
  Angelina steps so gentle, Angelina bows so low,
  An' she lif huh sku't so dainty dat huh shoetop skacely show:
  An' dem teef o' huh'n a-shinin', ez she tek you by de han'--
  Go 'way, people, d' ain't anothah sich a lady in de lan'!
  When she 's movin' thoo de figgers er a-dancin' by huhse'f,
  Folks jes' stan' stock-still a-sta'in', an' dey mos' nigh hol's dey bref;
  An' de young mens, dey 's a-sayin', "I 's gwine mek dat damsel mine,"
  When Angelina Johnson comes a-swingin' down de line.
FOOLIN' WID DE SEASONS
  Seems lak folks is mighty curus
    In de way dey t'inks an' ac's.
  Dey jes' spen's dey days a-mixin'
    Up de t'ings in almanacs.
  Now, I min' my nex' do' neighbour,--
    He's a mighty likely man,
  But he nevah t'inks o' nuffin
    'Ceptin' jes' to plot an' plan.
  All de wintah he was plannin'
    How he 'd gethah sassafras
  Jes' ez soon ez evah Springtime
    Put some greenness in de grass.
  An' he 'lowed a little soonah
    He could stan' a coolah breeze
  So 's to mek a little money
    F'om de sugah-watah trees.
  In de summah, he 'd be waihin'
    Out de linin' of his soul,
  Try 'n' ca'ci'late an' fashion
    How he 'd git his wintah coal;
  An' I b'lieve he got his jedgement
    Jes' so tuckahed out an' thinned
  Dat he t'ought a robin's whistle
    Was de whistle of de wind.
  Why won't folks gin up dey plannin',
    An' jes' be content to know
  Dat dey 's gittin' all dat's fu' dem
    In de days dat come an' go?
  Why won't folks quit movin' forrard?
    Ain't hit bettah jes' to stan'
  An' be satisfied wid livin'
   In de season dat 's at han'?
  Hit 's enough fu' me to listen
    W'en de birds is singin' 'roun',
  'Dout a-guessin' whut 'll happen
    W'en de snow is on de groun'.
  In de Springtime an' de summah,
    I lays sorrer on de she'f;
  An' I knows ol' Mistah Wintah
    Gwine to hustle fu' hisse'f.
  We been put hyeah fu' a pu'pose,
    But de questun dat has riz
  An' made lots o' people diffah
    Is jes' whut dat pu'pose is.
  Now, accordin' to my reas'nin',
    Hyeah's de p'int whaih I 's arriv,
  Sence de Lawd put life into us,
    We was put hyeah fu' to live!
MY SORT O' MAN
  I don't believe in 'ristercrats
      An' never did, you see;
  The plain ol' homelike sorter folks
      Is good enough fur me.
  O' course, I don't desire a man
      To be too tarnal rough,
  But then, I think all folks should know
      When they air nice enough.
  Now there is folks in this here world,
      From peasant up to king,
  Who want to be so awful nice
      They overdo the thing.
  That's jest the thing that makes me sick,
      An' quicker 'n a wink
  I set it down that them same folks
      Ain't half so good 's you think.
  I like to see a man dress nice,
      In clothes becomin' too;
  I like to see a woman fix
      As women orter to do;
  An' boys an' gals I like to see
      Look fresh an' young an' spry.--
  We all must have our vanity
      An' pride before we die.
  But I jedge no man by his clothes,--
      Nor gentleman nor tramp;
  The man that wears the finest suit
      May be the biggest scamp,
  An' he whose limbs air clad in rags
      That make a mournful sight,
  In life's great battle may have proved
      A hero in the fight.
  I don't believe in 'ristercrats;
      I like the honest tan
  That lies upon the healthful cheek
      An' speaks the honest man;
  I like to grasp the brawny hand
      That labor's lips have kissed,
  For he who has not labored here
      Life's greatest pride has missed:
  The pride to feel that yore own strength
      Has cleaved fur you the way
  To heights to which you were not born,
      But struggled day by day.
  What though the thousands sneer an' scoff,
      An' scorn yore humble birth?
  Kings are but puppets; you are king
      By right o' royal worth.
  The man who simply sits an' waits
      Fur good to come along,
  Ain't worth the breath that one would take
      To tell him he is wrong.
  Fur good ain't flowin' round this world
      Fur every fool to sup;
  You 've got to put yore see-ers on,
      An' go an' hunt it up.
  Good goes with honesty, I say,
      To honour an' to bless;
  To rich an' poor alike it brings
      A wealth o' happiness.
  The 'ristercrats ain't got it all,
      Fur much to their su'prise,
  That's one of earth's most blessed things
      They can't monopolize.
POSSUM
  Ef dey 's anyt'ing dat riles me
    An' jes' gits me out o' hitch,
  Twell I want to tek my coat off,
    So 's to r'ar an' t'ar an' pitch,
  Hit's to see some ign'ant white man
    'Mittin' dat owdacious sin--
  Wen he want to cook a possum
    Tekin' off de possum's skin.
  W'y dey ain't no use in talkin',
    Hit jes' hu'ts me to de hea't
  Fu' to see dem foolish people
    Th'owin' 'way de fines' pa't.
  W'y, dat skin is jes' ez tendah
    An' ez juicy ez kin be;
  I knows all erbout de critter--
    Hide an' haih--don't talk to me!
  Possum skin is jes lak shoat skin;
    Jes' you swinge an' scrope it down,
  Tek a good sha'p knife an' sco' it,
    Den you bake it good an' brown.
  Huh-uh! honey, you 's so happy
    Dat yo' thoughts is 'mos' a sin
  When you 's settin' dah a-chawin'
    On dat possum's cracklin' skin.
  White folks t'ink dey know 'bout eatin',
    An' I reckon dat dey do
  Sometimes git a little idee
    Of a middlin' dish er two;
  But dey ain't a t'ing dey knows of
    Dat I reckon cain't be beat
  Wen we set down at de table
    To a unskun possum's meat!
ON THE ROAD
  I 's boun' to see my gal to-night--
    Oh, lone de way, my dearie!
  De moon ain't out, de stars ain't bright--
    Oh, lone de way, my dearie!
  Dis hoss o' mine is pow'ful slow,
  But when I does git to yo' do'
  Yo' kiss 'll pay me back, an' mo',
    Dough lone de way, my dearie.
  De night is skeery-lak an' still--
    Oh, lone de way, my dearie!
  'Cept fu' dat mou'nful whippo'will--
    Oh, lone de way, my dearie!
  De way so long wif dis slow pace,
  'T 'u'd seem to me lak savin' grace
  Ef you was on a nearer place,
    Fu' lone de way, my dearie.
  I hyeah de hootin' of de owl--
    Oh, lone de way, my dearie!
  I wish dat watch-dog would n't howl:--

  An' evaht'ing, bofe right an' lef',

  In shape to skeer me half to def--

  But anyhow I's kin' o' skeered,

  De sky been lookin' mighty glum,
  But you kin mek hit lighten some,
  Ef you 'll jes' say you's glad I come,
    Dough lone de way, my dearie.
A DEATH SONG
  Lay me down beneaf de willers in de grass,
  Whah de branch 'll go a-singin' as it pass.
    An' w'en I 's a-layin' low,
    I kin hyeah it as it go
  Singin', "Sleep, my honey, tek yo' res' at las'."
  Lay me nigh to whah hit meks a little pool,
  An' de watah stan's so quiet lak an' cool,
    Whah de little birds in spring,
    Ust to come an' drink an' sing,
  An' de chillen waded on dey way to school.
  Let me settle w'en my shouldahs draps dey load
  Nigh enough to hyeah de noises in de road;
    Fu' I t'ink de las' long res'
    Gwine to soothe my sperrit bes'
  Ef I's layin' 'mong de t'ings I's allus knowed.
A BACK-LOG SONG
  De axes has been ringin' in de woods de blessid day,
    An' de chips has been a-fallin' fa' an' thick;
  Dey has cut de bigges' hick'ry dat de mules kin tote away,
    An' dey's laid hit down and soaked it in de crik.
  Den dey tuk hit to de big house an' dey piled de wood erroun'
    In de fiah-place f'om ash-flo' to de flue,
  While ol' Ezry sta'ts de hymn dat evah yeah has got to soun'
    When de back-log fus' commence a-bu'nin' thoo.
  Ol' Mastah is a-smilin' on de da'kies f'om de hall,
  Ol' Mistus is a-stannin' in de do',
  An' de young folks, males an' misses, is a-tryin', one an' all,
    Fu' to mek us feel hit 's Chrismus time fu' sho'.
  An' ouah hea'ts are full of pleasure, fu' we know de time is ouahs
    Fu' to dance er do jes' whut we wants to do.
  An' dey ain't no ovahseer an' no othah kind o' powahs
    Dat kin stop us while dat log is bu'nin thoo.
  Dey 's a-wokin' in de qua'tahs a-preparin' fu' de feas',
    So de little pigs is feelin' kind o' shy.
  De chickens ain't so trus'ful ez dey was, to say de leas',
    An' de wise ol' hens is roostin' mighty high.
  You could n't git a gobblah fu' to look you in de face--
    I ain't sayin' whut de tu'ky 'spects is true;
  But hit's mighty dange'ous trav'lin' fu' de critters on de place
  F'om de time dat log commence a bu'nin' thoo.
  Some one's tunin' up his fiddle dah, I hyeah a banjo's ring,
    An', bless me, dat's de tootin' of a ho'n!
  Now dey 'll evah one be runnin' dat has got a foot to fling,
    An' dey 'll dance an' frolic on f'om now 'twell mo'n.
  Plunk de banjo, scrap de fiddle, blow dat ho'n yo' level bes',
    Keep yo' min' erpon de chune an' step it true.
  Oh, dey ain't no time fu' stoppin' an' dey ain't no time fu' res',
    Fu' hit 's Chrismus an' de back-log 's bu'nin' thoo!

  Full of jealousy!
  Look hyeah, man, I 'll fight you,
  Don't you fool wid me!

  De breeze is blowin' 'cross de bay.

  De ship hit teks me far away,

  Ole Mas' done sol' me down de stream;

TEMPTATION
  I done got 'uligion, honey, an' I 's happy ez a king;
  Evahthing I see erbout me 's jes' lak sunshine in de spring;
  An' it seems lak I do' want to do anothah blessid thing
  But jes' run an' tell de neighbours, an' to shout an' pray an' sing.
  I done shuk my fis' at Satan, an' I 's gin de worl' my back;
  I do' want no hendrin' causes now a-both'rin' in my track;
  Fu' I 's on my way to glory, an' I feels too sho' to miss.
  Wy, dey ain't no use in sinnin' when 'uligion 's sweet ez dis.
  Talk erbout a man backslidin' w'en he 's on de gospel way;
  No, suh, I done beat de debbil, an' Temptation 's los' de day.
  Gwine to keep my eyes right straight up, gwine to shet my eahs, an' see
  Whut ole projick Mistah Satan 's gwine to try to wuk on me.
  Listen, whut dat soun' I hyeah dah? 'tain't no one commence to sing;
  It 's a fiddle; git erway dah! don' you hyeah dat blessid thing?
  W'y, dat's sweet ez drippin' honey, 'cause, you knows, I draws de bow,
  An' when music's sho' 'nough music, I 's de one dat's sho' to know.
  W'y, I 's done de double shuffle, twell a body could n't res',
  Jes' a-hyeahin' Sam de fiddlah play dat chune his level bes';
  I could cut a mighty caper, I could gin a mighty fling
  Jes' right now, I 's mo' dan suttain I could cut de pigeon wing.
  Look hyeah, whut 's dis I 's been sayin'? whut on urf 's tuk holt o' me?
  Dat ole music come nigh runnin' my 'uligion up a tree!
  Cleah out wif dat dah ole fiddle, don' you try dat trick agin;
  Did n't think I could be tempted, but you lak to made me sin!
POSSUM TROT
  I 've journeyed 'roun' consid'able, a-seein' men an' things,
  An' I 've learned a little of the sense that meetin' people brings;
  But in spite of all my travelling an' of all I think I know,
  I 've got one notion in my head, that I can't git to go;
  An' it is that the folks I meet in any other spot
  Ain't half so good as them I knowed back home in Possum Trot.
  I know you 've never heerd the name, it ain't a famous place,
  An' I reckon ef you 'd search the map you could n't find a trace
  Of any sich locality as this I 've named to you;
  But never mind, I know the place, an' I love it dearly too.
  It don't make no pretensions to bein' great or fine,
  The circuses don't come that way, they ain't no railroad line.
  It ain't no great big city, where the schemers plan an' plot,
  But jest a little settlement, this place called Possum Trot.
  But don't you think the folks that lived in that outlandish place
  Were ignorant of all the things that go for sense or grace.
  Why, there was Hannah Dyer, you may search this teemin' earth
  An' never find a sweeter girl, er one o' greater worth;
  An' Uncle Abner Williams, a-leanin' on his staff,
  It seems like I kin hear him talk, an' hear his hearty laugh.
  His heart was big an' cheery as a sunny acre lot,
  Why, that's the kind o' folks we had down there at Possum Trot.
  Good times? Well, now, to suit my taste,--an' I 'm some hard to suit,--
  There ain't been no sich pleasure sence, an' won't be none to boot,
  With huskin' bees in Harvest time, an' dances later on,
  An' singin' school, an taffy pulls, an' fun from night till dawn.
  Revivals come in winter time, baptizin's in the spring,
  You 'd ought to seen those people shout, an' heerd 'em pray an' sing;
  You 'd ought to 've heard ole Parson Brown a-throwin' gospel shot
  Among the saints an' sinners in the days of Possum Trot.
  We live up in the city now, my wife was bound to come;
  I hear aroun' me day by day the endless stir an' hum.
  I reckon that it done me good, an' yet it done me harm,
  That oil was found so plentiful down there on my ole farm.
  We 've got a new-styled preacher, our church is new-styled too,
  An' I 've come down from what I knowed to rent a cushioned pew.
  But often when I 'm settin' there, it's foolish, like as not,
  To think of them ol' benches in the church at Possum Trot.
  I know that I 'm ungrateful, an' sich thoughts must be a sin,
  But I find myself a wishin' that the times was back agin.
  With the huskin's an' the frolics, an' the joys' I used to know,
  When I lived at the settlement, a dozen years ago.
  I don't feel this way often, I 'm scarcely ever glum,
  For life has taught me how to take her chances as they come.
  But now an' then my mind goes back to that ol' buryin' plot,
  That holds the dust of some I loved, down there at Possum Trot.
DELY
  Jes' lak toddy wahms you thoo'
    Sets yo' haid a reelin',
  Meks you ovah good and new,
    Dat 's de way I 's feelin'.
  Seems to me hit 's summah time,
    Dough hit 's wintah reely,
  I 's a feelin' jes' dat prime--
    An' huh name is Dely.
  Dis hyeah love 's a cu'rus thing,
    Changes 'roun' de season,
  Meks you sad or meks you sing,
    'Dout no urfly reason.
  Sometimes I go mopin' 'roun',
    Den agin I 's leapin';
  Sperits allus up an' down
    Even when I 's sleepin'.
  Fu' de dreams comes to me den,
    An' dey keeps me pitchin',
  Lak de apple dumplin's w'en
    Bilin' in de kitchen.
  Some one sot to do me hahm,
    Tryin' to ovahcome me,
  Ketchin' Dely by de ahm
    So 's to tek huh f'om me.
  Mon, you bettah b'lieve I fights
    (Dough hit's on'y seemin');
  I's a hittin' fu' my rights
    Even w'en I 's dreamin'.
  But I 'd let you have 'em all,
    Give 'em to you freely,
  Good an' bad ones, great an' small,
    So 's you leave me Dely.
  Dely got dem meltin' eyes,
    Big an' black an' tendah.
  Dely jes' a lady-size,
    Delikit an' slendah.
  Dely brown ez brown kin be
    An' huh haih is curly;
  Oh, she look so sweet to me,--
    Bless de precious girlie!
  Dely brown ez brown kin be,
    She ain' no mullatter;
  She pure cullud,--don' you see
    Dat 's jes' whut 's de mattah?
  Dat 's de why I love huh so,
    D' ain't no mix about huh,
  Soon 's you see huh face you know
    D' ain't no chanst to doubt huh.
  Folks dey go to chu'ch an' pray
    So 's to git a blessin'.
  Oomph, dey bettah come my way,
    Dey could lu'n a lesson.
  Sabbaf day I don' go fu',
    Jes' to see my pigeon;
  I jes' sets an' looks at huh,
    Dat's enuff 'uligion.
BREAKING THE CHARM
  Caught Susanner whistlin'; well,
  It's most nigh too good to tell.
  'Twould 'a' b'en too good to see
  Ef it had n't b'en fur me,
  Comin' up so soft an' sly
  That she didn' hear me nigh.
  I was pokin' 'round that day,
  An' ez I come down the way,
  First her whistle strikes my ears,--
  Then her gingham dress appears;
  So with soft step up I slips.
  Oh, them dewy, rosy lips!
  Ripe ez cherries, red an' round,
  Puckered up to make the sound.
  She was lookin' in the spring,
  Whistlin' to beat anything,--
  "Kitty Dale" er "In the Sweet."
  I was jest so mortal beat
  That I can't quite ricoleck
  What the toon was, but I 'speck
  'T was some hymn er other, fur
  Hymny things is jest like her.
  Well she went on fur awhile
  With her face all in a smile,
  An' I never moved, but stood
  Stiller 'n a piece o' wood--
  Would n't wink ner would n't stir,
  But a-gazin' right at her,
  Tell she turns an' sees me--my!
  Thought at first she 'd try to fly.
  But she blushed an' stood her ground.
  Then, a-slyly lookin' round,
  She says: "Did you hear me, Ben?"
  "Whistlin' woman, crowin' hen,"
  Says I, lookin' awful stern.
  Then the red commenced to burn
  In them cheeks o' hern. Why, la!
  Reddest red you ever saw--
  Pineys wa'n't a circumstance.
  You 'd 'a' noticed in a glance
  She was pow'rful shamed an' skeart;
  But she looked so sweet an' peart,
  That a idee struck my head;
  So I up an' slowly said:
  "Woman whistlin' brings shore harm,
  Jest one thing 'll break the charm."
  "And what's that?" "Oh, my!" says I,
  "I don't like to tell you." "Why?"
  Says Susanner. "Well, you see
  It would kinder fall on me."
  Course I knowed that she 'd insist,--
  So I says: "You must be kissed
  By the man that heard you whistle;
  Everybody says that this 'll
  Break the charm and set you free
  From the threat'nin' penalty."
  She was blushin' fit to kill,
  But she answered, kinder still:
  "I don't want to have no harm,
  Please come, Ben, an' break the charm."
  Did I break that charm?--oh, well,
  There's some things I must n't tell.
  I remember, afterwhile,
  Her a-sayin' with a smile:
  "Oh, you quit,--you sassy dunce,
  You jest caught me whistlin' _once_."
  Ev'ry sence that when I hear
  Some one whistlin' kinder clear,
  I most break my neck to see
  Ef it 's Susy; but, dear me,
  I jest find I 've b'en to chase
  Some blamed boy about the place.
  Dad 's b'en noticin' my way,
  An' last night I heerd him say:
  "We must send fur Dr. Glenn,
  Mother; somethin 's wrong with Ben!"
HUNTING SONG
    Tek a cool night, good an' cleah,
      Skiff o' snow upon de groun';
    Jes' 'bout fall-time o' de yeah
      W'en de leaves is dry an brown;
    Tek a dog an' tek a axe,
      Tek a lantu'n in yo' han',
    Step light whah de switches cracks,
      Fu' dey 's huntin' in de lan'.
  Down thoo de valleys an' ovah de hills,
    Into de woods whah de 'simmon-tree grows,
  Wakin' an' skeerin' de po' whippo'wills,
    Huntin' fu' coon an' fu' 'possum we goes.
    Blow dat ho'n dah loud an' strong,
      Call de dogs an' da'kies neah;
    Mek its music cleah an' long,
      So de folks at home kin hyeah.
    Blow it twell de hills an' trees
      Sen's de echoes tumblin' back;
    Blow it twell de back'ard breeze
      Tells de folks we 's on de track.
  Coons is a-ramblin' an' 'possums is out;
    Look at dat dog; you could set on his tail!
  Watch him now--steady,--min'--what you 's about,
    Bless me, dat animal's got on de trail!
    Listen to him ba'kin now!
      Dat means bus'ness, sho 's you bo'n;
    Ef he's struck de scent I 'low
      Dat ere 'possum's sholy gone.
    Knowed dat dog fu' fo'teen yeahs,
      An' I nevah seed him fail
    Wen he sot dem flappin' eahs
      An' went off upon a trail.
  Run, Mistah 'Possum, an' run, Mistah Coon,
    No place is safe fu' yo' ramblin' to-night;
  Mas' gin' de lantu'n an' God gin de moon,
    An' a long hunt gins a good appetite.
    Look hyeah, folks, you hyeah dat change?
      Dat ba'k is sha'per dan de res'.
    Dat ere soun' ain't nothin' strange,--
      Dat dog's talked his level bes'.
    Somep'n' 's treed, I know de soun'.
      Dah now,--wha 'd I tell you? see!
    Dat ere dog done run him down;
      Come hyeah, he'p cut down dis tree.
  Ah, Mistah 'Possum, we got you at las'--
    Need n't play daid, laying dah on de groun';
  Fros' an' de 'simmons has made you grow fas',--
    Won't he be fine when he's roasted up brown!
A LETTER
  Dear Miss Lucy: I been t'inkin' dat I 'd write you long fo' dis,
  But dis writin' 's mighty tejous, an' you know jes' how it is.
  But I 's got a little lesure, so I teks my pen in han'
  Fu' to let you know my feelin's since I retched dis furrin' lan'.
  I 's right well, I 's glad to tell you (dough dis climate ain't to blame),
  An' I hopes w'en dese lines reach you, dat dey 'll fin' yo' se'f de same.
  Cose I 'se feelin kin' o' homesick--dat 's ez nachul ez kin be,
  Wen a feller 's mo'n th'ee thousand miles across dat awful sea.
  (Don't you let nobidy fool you 'bout de ocean bein' gran';
  If you want to see de billers, you jes' view dem f'om de lan'.)
  'Bout de people? We been t'inkin' dat all white folks was alak;
  But dese Englishmen is diffunt, an' dey 's curus fu' a fac'.
  Fust, dey's heavier an' redder in dey make-up an' dey looks,
  An' dey don't put salt nor pepper in a blessed t'ing dey cooks!
  Wen dey gin you good ol' tu'nips, ca'ots, pa'snips, beets, an' sich,
  Ef dey ain't some one to tell you, you cain't 'stinguish which is which.
  Wen I t'ought I 's eatin' chicken--you may b'lieve dis hyeah 's a lie--
  But de waiter beat me down dat I was eatin' rabbit pie.
  An' dey 'd t'ink dat you was crazy--jes' a reg'lar ravin' loon,
  Ef you 'd speak erbout a 'possum or a piece o' good ol' coon.
  O, hit's mighty nice, dis trav'lin', an' I 's kin' o' glad I come.
  But, I reckon, now I 's willin' fu' to tek my way back home.
  I done see de Crystal Palace, an' I 's hyeahd dey string-band play,
  But I has n't seen no banjos layin' nowhahs roun' dis way.
  Jes' gin ol' Jim Bowles a banjo, an' he 'd not go very fu',
  'Fo' he 'd outplayed all dese fiddlers, wif dey flourish and dey stir.
  Evahbiddy dat I 's met wif has been monst'ous kin an' good;
  But I t'ink I 'd lak it better to be down in Jones's wood,
  Where we ust to have sich frolics, Lucy, you an' me an' Nelse,
  Dough my appetite 'ud call me, ef dey was n't nuffin else.
  I 'd jes' lak to have some sweet-pertaters roasted in de skin;
  I 's a-longin' fu' my chittlin's an' my mustard greens ergin;
  I 's a-wishin' fu' some buttermilk, an' co'n braid, good an' brown,
  An' a drap o' good ol' bourbon fu' to wash my feelin's down!
  An' I 's comin' back to see you jes' as ehly as I kin,
  So you better not go spa'kin' wif dat wuffless scoun'el Quin!
  Well, I reckon, I mus' close now; write ez soon's dis reaches you;
  Gi' my love to Sister Mandy an' to Uncle Isham, too.
  Tell de folks I sen' 'em howdy; gin a kiss to pap an' mam;
  Closin' I is, deah Miss Lucy, Still Yo' Own True-Lovin' Sam.
  P. S. Ef you cain't mek out dis letter, lay it by erpon de she'f,
       An' when I git home, I 'll read it, darlin', to you my own se'f.
CHRISMUS IS A-COMIN'
  Bones a-gittin' achy,
  Back a-feelin' col',
  Han's a-growin' shaky,
  Jes' lak I was ol'.
  Fros' erpon de meddah
  Lookin' mighty white;
  Snowdraps lak a feddah
  Slippin' down at night.
  Jes' keep t'ings a-hummin'
  Spite o' fros' an' showahs,

A CABIN TALE
THE YOUNG MASTER ASKS FOR A STORY
  Whut you say, dah? huh, uh! chile,
  You 's enough to dribe me wile.
  Want a sto'y; jes' hyeah dat!
  Whah' 'll I git a sto'y at?
  Di'n' I tell you th'ee las' night?
  Go 'way, honey, you ain't right.
  I got somep'n' else to do,
  'Cides jes' tellin' tales to you.
  Tell you jes' one? Lem me see
  Whut dat one's a-gwine to be.
  When you 's ole, yo membry fails;
  Seems lak I do' know no tales.
  Well, set down dah in dat cheer,
  Keep still ef you wants to hyeah.
  Tek dat chin up off yo' han's,
  Set up nice now. Goodness lan's!
  Hol' yo'se'f up lak yo' pa.
  Bet nobidy evah saw
  Him scrunched down lak you was den--
  High-tone boys meks high-tone men.
  Once dey was a ole black bah,
  Used to live 'roun' hyeah some whah
  In a cave. He was so big
  He could ca'y off a pig
  Lak you picks a chicken up,
  Er yo' leetles' bit o' pup.
  An' he had two gread big eyes,
  Jes' erbout a saucer's size.
  Why, dey looked lak balls o' fiah
  Jumpin' 'roun' erpon a wiah
  W'en dat bah was mad; an' laws!
  But you ought to seen his paws!
  Did I see 'em? How you 'spec
  I 's a-gwine to ricollec'
  Dis hyeah ya'n I 's try'n' to spin
  Ef you keeps on puttin' in?
  You keep still an' don't you cheep
  Less I 'll sen' you off to sleep.
  Dis hyeah bah 'd go trompin' 'roun'
  Eatin' evahthing he foun';
  No one could n't have a fa'm
  But dat bah 'u'd do' em ha'm;
  And dey could n't ketch de scamp.
  Anywhah he wan'ed to tramp.
  Dah de scoun'el 'd mek his track,
  Do his du't an' come on back.
  He was sich a sly ole limb,
  Traps was jes' lak fun to him.
  Now, down neah whah Mistah Bah
  Lived, dey was a weasel dah;
  But dey was n't fren's a-tall
  Case de weasel was so small.
  An' de bah 'u'd, jes' fu' sass,
  Tu'n his nose up w'en he 'd pass.
  Weasels 's small o' cose, but my!
  Dem air animiles is sly.
  So dis hyeah one says, says he,
  "I 'll jes' fix dat bah, you see."
  So he fixes up his plan
  An' hunts up de fa'merman.
  When de fa'mer see him come,
  He 'mence lookin' mighty glum,
  An' he ketches up a stick;
  But de weasel speak up quick:
  "Hol' on, Mistah Fa'mer man,
  I wan' 'splain a little plan.
  Ef you waits, I 'll tell you whah
  An' jes' how to ketch ol' Bah.
  But I tell yow now you mus'
  Gin me one fat chicken fus'."
  Den de man he scratch his haid,
  Las' he say, "I'll mek de trade."
  So de weasel et his hen,
  Smacked his mouf and says, "Well, den,
  Set yo' trap an' bait ternight,
  An' I 'll ketch de bah all right."
  Den he ups an' goes to see
  Mistah Bah, an' says, says he:
  "Well, fren' Bah, we _ain't_ been fren's,
  But ternight ha'd feelin' 'en's.
  Ef you ain't too proud to steal,
  We kin git a splendid meal.
  Cose I would n't come to you,
  But it mus' be done by two;
  Hit's a trap, but we kin beat
  All dey tricks an' git de meat."
  "Cose I 's wif you," says de bah,
  "Come on, weasel, show me whah."
  Well, dey trots erlong ontwell
  Dat air meat beginned to smell
  In de trap. Den weasel say:
  "Now you put yo' paw dis way
  While I hol' de spring back so,
  Den you grab de meat an' go."
  Well, de bah he had to grin
  Ez he put his big paw in,
  Den he juked up, but--kerbing!
  Weasel done let go de spring.
  "Dah now," says de weasel, "dah,
  I done cotched you, Mistah Bah!"
  O, dat bah did sno't and spout,
  Try'n' his bestes' to git out,
  But de weasel say, "Goo'-bye!
  Weasel small, but weasel sly."
  Den he tu'ned his back an' run
  Tol' de fa'mer whut he done.
  So de fa'mer come down dah,
  Wif a axe and killed de bah.
  Dah now, ain't dat sto'y fine?
  Run erlong now, nevah min'.
  Want some mo', you rascal, you?
  No, suh! no, suh! dat 'll do.
AT CANDLE-LIGHTIN' TIME
  When I come in f'om de co'n-fiel' aftah wo'kin' ha'd all day,
  It 's amazin' nice to fin' my suppah all erpon de way;
  An' it 's nice to smell de coffee bubblin' ovah in de pot,
  An' it 's fine to see de meat a-sizzlin' teasin'-lak an' hot.
  But when suppah-time is ovah, an' de t'ings is cleahed away;
  Den de happy hours dat foller are de sweetes' of de day.
  When my co'ncob pipe is sta'ted, an' de smoke is drawin' prime,
  My ole 'ooman says, "I reckon, Ike, it 's candle-lightin' time."
  Den de chillun snuggle up to me, an' all commence to call,
  "Oh, say, daddy, now it 's time to mek de shadders on de wall."
  So I puts my han's togethah--evah daddy knows de way,--
  An' de chillun snuggle closer roun' ez I begin to say:--
  "Fus' thing, hyeah come Mistah Rabbit; don' you see him wo'k his eahs?
  Huh, uh! dis mus' be a donkey,--look, how innercent he 'pears!
  Dah 's de ole black swan a-swimmin'--ain't she got a' awful neck?
  Who 's dis feller dat 's a-comin'? Why, dat 's ole dog Tray, I 'spec'!"
  Dat 's de way I run on, tryin' fu' to please 'em all I can;
  Den I hollahs, "Now be keerful--dis hyeah las' 's de buga-man!"
  An' dey runs an' hides dey faces; dey ain't skeered--dey 's lettin' on:
  But de play ain't raaly ovah twell dat buga-man is gone.
  So I jes' teks up my banjo, an' I plays a little chune,
  An' you see dem haids come peepin' out to listen mighty soon.
  Den my wife says, "Sich a pappy fu' to give you sich a fright!
  Jes, you go to baid, an' leave him: say yo' prayers an' say good-night."
WHISTLING SAM
  I has hyeahd o' people dancin' an' I 's hyeahd o' people singin'.
  An' I 's been 'roun' lots of othahs dat could keep de banjo ringin';
  But of all de whistlin' da'kies dat have lived an' died since Ham,
  De whistlin'est I evah seed was ol' Ike Bates's Sam.
  In de kitchen er de stable, in de fiel' er mowin' hay,
  You could hyeah dat boy a-whistlin' pu'ty nigh a mile erway,--
  Puck'rin' up his ugly features 'twell you could n't see his eyes,
  Den you 'd hyeah a soun' lak dis un f'om dat awful puckah rise:
[Illustration: Musical score.]
  When dey had revival meetin' an' de Lawd's good grace was flowin'
  On de groun' dat needed wat'rin' whaih de seeds of good was growin',
  While de othahs was a-singin' an' a-shoutin' right an' lef,
  You could hyeah dat boy a-whistlin' kin' o' sof beneaf his bref:
[Illustration: Musical score.]
  At de call fu' colo'ed soldiers, Sam enlisted 'mong de res'
  Wid de blue o' Gawd's great ahmy wropped about his swellin' breas',
  An' he laffed an' whistled loudah in his youfful joy an' glee
  Dat de govament would let him he'p to mek his people free.
  Daih was lots o' ties to bin' him, pappy, mammy, an' his Dinah,--
  Dinah, min' you, was his sweet-hea't, an' dey was n't nary finah;
  But he lef 'em all, I tell you, lak a king he ma'ched away,
  Try'n' his level bes' to whistle, happy, solemn, choky, gay:
[Illustration: Musical score.]
  To de front he went an' bravely fought de foe an' kep' his sperrit,
  An' his comerds said his whistle made 'em strong when dey could hyeah it.
  When a saber er a bullet cut some frien' o' his'n down,
  An' de time 'u'd come to trench him an' de boys 'u'd gethah 'roun',
  An' dey could n't sta't a hymn-tune, mebbe none o' dem 'u'd keer,
  Sam 'u'd whistle "Sleep in Jesus," an' he knowed de Mastah 'd hyeah.
  In de camp, all sad discouraged, he would cheer de hea'ts of all,
  When above de soun' of labour dey could hyeah his whistle call:
[Illustration: Musical score.]
  When de cruel wah was ovah an' de boys come ma'chin' back,
  Dey was shouts an' cries an' blessin's all erlong dey happy track,
  An' de da'kies all was happy; souls an' bodies bofe was freed.
  Why, hit seemed lak de Redeemah mus' 'a' been on earf indeed.
  Dey was gethahed all one evenin' jes' befo' de cabin do',
  When dey hyeahd somebody whistlin' kin' o' sof' an' sweet an' low.
  Dey could n't see de whistlah, but de hymn was cleah and ca'm,
  An' dey all stood daih a-listenin' ontwell Dinah shouted, "Sam!"
  An' dey seed a little da'ky way off yandah thoo de trees
  Wid his face all in a puckah mekin' jes' sich soun's ez dese:

HOW LUCY BACKSLID
  De times is mighty stirrin' 'mong de people up ouah way,
  Dey 'sputin' an' dey argyin' an' fussin' night an' day;
  An' all dis monst'ous trouble dat hit meks me tiahed to tell
  Is 'bout dat Lucy Jackson dat was sich a mighty belle.
  She was de preachah's favoured, an' he tol' de chu'ch one night
  Dat she travelled thoo de cloud o' sin a-bearin' of a light;
  But, now, I 'low he t'inkin' dat she mus' 'a' los' huh lamp,
  Case Lucy done backslided an' dey trouble in de camp.
  Huh daddy wants to beat huh, but huh mammy daihs him to,
  Fu' she lookin' at de question f'om a ooman's pint o' view;
  An' she say dat now she would n't have it diff'ent ef she could;
  Dat huh darter only acted jes' lak any othah would.
  Cose you know w'en women argy, dey is mighty easy led
  By dey hea'ts an' don't go foolin' 'bout de reasons of de haid.
  So huh mammy laid de law down (she ain' reckernizin' wrong),
  But you got to mek erlowance fu' de cause dat go along.
  Now de cause dat made Miss Lucy fu' to th'ow huh grace away
  I 's afeard won't baih no 'spection w'en hit come to jedgement day;
  Do' de same t'ing been a-wo'kin' evah sence de worl' began,--
  De ooman disobeyin' fu' to 'tice along a man.
  Ef you 'tended de revivals which we held de wintah pas',
  You kin rickolec' dat convuts was a-comin' thick an' fas';
  But dey ain't no use in talkin', dey was all lef' in de lu'ch
  W'en ol' Mis' Jackson's dartah foun' huh peace an' tuk de chu'ch.
  W'y, she shouted ovah evah inch of Ebenezah's flo';
  Up into de preachah's pulpit an' f'om dah down to de do';
  Den she hugged an' squeezed huh mammy, an' she hugged an' kissed huh dad,
  An' she struck out at huh sistah, people said, lak she was mad.
  I has 'tended some revivals dat was lively in my day,
  An' I 's seed folks git 'uligion in mos' evah kin' o' way;
  But I tell you, an' you b'lieve me dat I 's speakin' true indeed,
  Dat gal tuk huh 'ligion ha'dah dan de ha'dest yit I 's seed.
  Well, f'om dat, 't was "Sistah Jackson, won't you please do dis er dat?"
  She mus' allus sta't de singin' w'en dey 'd pass erroun' de hat,
  An' hit seemed dey was n't nuffin' in dat chu'ch dat could go by
  'Dout sistah Lucy Jackson had a finger in de pie.
  But de sayin' mighty trufeful dat hit easiah to sail
  W'en de sea is ca'm an' gentle dan to weathah out a gale.
  Dat 's whut made dis ooman's trouble; ef de sto'm had kep' away,
  She 'd 'a' had enough 'uligion fu' to lasted out huh day.
  Lucy went wid 'Lishy Davis, but w'en she jined chu'ch, you know
  Dah was lots o' little places dat, of cose, she could n't go;
  An' she had to gin up dancin' an' huh singin' an' huh play.--
  Now hit's nachul dat sich goin's-on 'u'd drive a man away.
  So, w'en Lucy got so solemn, Ike he sta'ted fu' to go
  Wid a gal who was a sinnah an' could mek a bettah show.
  Lucy jes' went on to meetin' lak she did n't keer a rap,
  But my 'sperunce kep' me t'inkin dah was somep'n' gwine to drap.
  Fu' a gal won't let 'uligion er no othah so't o' t'ing
  Stop huh w'en she teks a notion dat she wants a weddin' ring.
  You kin p'omise huh de blessin's of a happy aftah life
  (An' hit's nice to be a angel), but she 'd ravah be a wife.
  So w'en Chrismus come an' mastah gin a frolic on de lawn,
  Did n't 'sprise me not de littlest seein' Lucy lookin' on.
  An' I seed a wa'nin' lightnin' go a-flashin' f'om huh eye
  Jest ez 'Lishy an' his new gal went a-gallivantin' by.
  An' dat Tildy, umph! she giggled, an' she gin huh dress a flirt
  Lak de people she was passin' was ez common ez de dirt;
  An' de minit she was dancin', w'y dat gal put on mo' aihs
  Dan a cat a-tekin' kittens up a paih o' windin' staihs.
  She could 'fo'd to show huh sma'tness, fu' she could n't he'p but know
  Dat wid jes' de present dancahs she was ownah of de flo';
  But I t'ink she 'd kin' o' cooled down ef she happened on de sly
  Fu' to noticed dat 'ere lightnin' dat I seed in Lucy's eye.
  An' she would n't been so 'stonished w'en de people gin a shout,
  An' Lucy th'owed huh mantle back an' come a-glidin' out.
  Some ahms was dah to tek huh an' she fluttahed down de flo'
  Lak a feddah f'om a bedtick w'en de win' commence to blow.
  Soon ez Tildy see de trouble, she jes' tu'n an' toss huh haid,
  But seem lak she los' huh sperrit, all huh darin'ness was daid.
  Did n't cut anothah capah nary time de blessid night;
  But de othah one, hit looked lak could n't git enough delight.
  W'en you keeps a colt a-stan'nin' in de stable all along,
  W'en he do git out hit 's nachul he 'll be pullin' mighty strong.
  Ef you will tie up yo' feelin's, hyeah 's de bes' advice to tek,
  Look out fu' an awful loosin' w'en de string dat hol's 'em brek.
  Lucy's mammy groaned to see huh, an' huh pappy sto'med an' to',
  But she kep' right on a-hol'in' to de centah of de flo'.
  So dey went an' ast de pastoh ef he could n't mek huh quit,
  But de tellin' of de sto'y th'owed de preachah in a fit.
  Tildy Taylor chewed huh hank'cher twell she 'd chewed it in a hole,--
  All de sinnahs was rejoicin' 'cause a lamb had lef de fol',
  An' de las' I seed o' Lucy, she an' 'Lish was side an' side:
  I don't blame de gal fu' dancin', an' I could n't ef I tried.
  Fu' de men dat wants to ma'y ain't a-growin' 'roun' on trees,
  An' de gal dat wants to git one sholy has to try to please.
  Hit's a ha'd t'ing fu' a ooman fu 'to pray an' jes' set down,
  An' to sacafice a husban' so 's to try to gain a crown.
  Now, I don' say she was justified in follerin' huh plan;
  But aldough she los' huh 'ligion, yit she sholy got de man.
  Latah on, w'en she is suttain dat de preachah 's made 'em fas'
  She kin jes' go back to chu'ch an' ax fu'giveness fu' de pas'!
LYRICS OF LOVE AND LAUGHTER
TWO LITTLE BOOTS
  Two little boots all rough an' wo',
      Two little boots!
  Law, I 's kissed 'em times befo',
      Dese little boots!
  Seems de toes a-peepin' thoo
  Dis hyeah hole an' sayin' "Boo!"
  Evah time dey looks at you--
      Dese little boots.
  Membah de time he put 'em on,
      Dese little boots;
  Riz an' called fu' 'em by dawn,
      Dese little boots;
  Den he tromped de livelong day,
  Laffin' in his happy way,
  Evaht'ing he had to say,
      "My little boots!"
  Kickin' de san' de whole day long,
      Dem little boots;
  Good de cobblah made 'em strong,
     Dem little boots!
  Rocks was fu' dat baby's use,
  I'on had to stan' abuse
  W'en you tu'ned dese champeens loose,
      Dese little boots!
  Ust to make de ol' cat cry,
      Dese little boots;
  Den you walked it mighty high,
      Proud little boots!
  Ahms akimbo, stan'in' wide,
  Eyes a-sayin' "Dis is pride!"
  Den de manny-baby stride!
      You little boots.
  Somehow, you don' seem so gay,
      Po' little boots,
  Sence yo' ownah went erway,
      Po' little boots!
  Yo' bright tops don' look so red,
  Dese brass tips is dull an' dead;
  "Goo'-by," whut de baby said;
      Deah little boots!
  Ain't you kin' o' sad yo'se'f,
      You little boots?
  Dis is all his mammy 's lef',
      Two little boots.
  Sence huh baby gone an' died.
  Heav'n itse'f hit seem to hide
  Des a little bit inside
      Two little boots.
TO THE ROAD
  Cool is the wind, for the summer is waning,
      Who 's for the road?
  Sun-flecked and soft, where the dead leaves are raining,
      Who 's for the road?
  Knapsack and alpenstock press hand and shoulder,
  Prick of the brier and roll of the boulder;
  This be your lot till the season grow older;
      Who 's for the road?
  Up and away in the hush of the morning,
      Who 's for the road?
  Vagabond he, all conventions a-scorning,
      Who 's for the road?
  Music of warblers so merrily singing,
  Draughts from the rill from the roadside up-springing,
  Nectar of grapes from the vines lowly swinging,
      These on the road.
  Now every house is a hut or a hovel,
      Come to the road:
  Mankind and moles in the dark love to grovel,
      But to the road.
  Throw off the loads that are bending you double;
  Love is for life, only labor is trouble;
  Truce to the town, whose best gift is a bubble:
      Come to the road!
A SPRING WOOING
  Come on walkin' wid me, Lucy; 't ain't no time to mope erroun'
    Wen de sunshine 's shoutin' glory in de sky,
  An' de little Johnny-Jump-Ups 's jes' a-springin' f'om de groun',

  Don' you hyeah dem cows a-mooin'? Dat 's dey howdy to de spring;

  Hit 's enough to mek a body want to spread dey mouf an' sing

  W'y dat squir'l dat jes' run past us, ef I did n' know his tricks,

  An' dem liza'ds slippin' back an' fofe ermong de stones an' sticks
    Is a-wigglin' 'cause dey feel so awful gay.
  Oh, I see yo' eyes a-shinin' dough you try to mek me b'lieve
    Dat you ain' so monst'ous happy 'cause you come;
  But I tell you dis hyeah weathah meks it moughty ha'd to 'ceive

  Robin whistlin' ovah yandah ez he buil' his little nes';

  He's a-sayin' dat he love huh in de wo'ds she know de bes',

  Now, Miss Lucy, dat ah robin sholy got his sheer o' sense,

  I 's a-waitin' fu' you, Lucy, tek de 'zample o' de birds,

  I cain' tell you dat I loves you in de robin's music wo'ds,
    But my cabin 's talkin' fu' me ovah thaih!
JOGGIN' ERLONG
  De da'kest hour, dey allus say,
  Is des' befo' de dawn,
  But it's moughty ha'd a-waitin'
  W'ere de night goes frownin' on;
  An' it's moughty ha'd a-hopin'
  W'en de clouds is big an' black,
  An' all de t'ings you 's waited fu'
  Has failed, er gone to wrack--
  But des' keep on a-joggin' wid a little bit o' song,
  De mo'n is allus brightah w'en de night's been long.
  Dey 's lots o' knocks you 's got to tek
  Befo' yo' journey 's done,
  An' dey 's times w'en you 'll be wishin'

  W'en you want to give up tryin'
  An' des' float erpon de wave,
  W'en you don't feel no mo' sorrer

  An' de burden 's allus heavies'

  Dey is times w'en tribulation
  Seems to git de uppah han'
  An' to whip de weary trav'lah
  'Twell he ain't got stren'th to stan'--
  But des' keep on a-joggin' wid a little bit o' song,
  De mo'n is allus brightah w'en de night's been long.
IN MAY
  Oh to have you in May,
    To talk with you under the trees,
  Dreaming throughout the day,
    Drinking the wine-like breeze,
  Oh it were sweet to think
    That May should be ours again,
  Hoping it not, I shrink,
    Out of the sight of men.
  May brings the flowers to bloom,
    It brings the green leaves to the tree,
  And the fatally sweet perfume,
    Of what you once were to me.
DREAMS
  What dreams we have and how they fly
  Like rosy clouds across the sky;
    Of wealth, of fame, of sure success,
    Of love that comes to cheer and bless;
  And how they wither, how they fade,
  The waning wealth, the jilting jade--
    The fame that for a moment gleams,
    Then flies forever,--dreams, ah--dreams!
  O burning doubt and long regret,
  O tears with which our eyes are wet,
    Heart-throbs, heart-aches, the glut of pain,
    The somber cloud, the bitter rain,
  You were not of those dreams--ah! well,
  Your full fruition who can tell?
    Wealth, fame, and love, ah! love that beams
    Upon our souls, all dreams--ah! dreams.
THE TRYST
  De night creep down erlong de lan',
    De shadders rise an' shake,
  De frog is sta'tin' up his ban',
    De cricket is awake;
  My wo'k is mos' nigh done, Celes',
    To-night I won't be late,
  I 's hu'yin' thoo my level bes',
    Wait fu' me by de gate.
  De mockin'-bird 'll sen' his glee
    A-thrillin' thoo and thoo,
  I know dat ol' magnolia-tree
    Is smellin' des' fu' you;
  De jessamine erside de road
    Is bloomin' rich an' white,
  My hea't 's a-th'obbin' 'cause it knowed
    You 'd wait fu' me to-night.
  Hit 's lonesome, ain't it, stan'in' thaih
    Wid no one nigh to talk?
  But ain't dey whispahs in de aih
    Erlong de gyahden walk?
  Don't somep'n kin' o' call my name,
    An' say "he love you bes'"?
  Hit 's true, I wants to say de same,
    So wait fu' me, Celes'.
  Sing somep'n fu' to pass de time,
    Outsing de mockin'-bird,
  You got de music an' de rhyme,
    You beat him wid de word.
  I 's comin' now, my wo'k is done,
    De hour has come fu' res',
  I wants to fly, but only run--
    Wait fu' me, deah Celes'.

THE DOVE
  Out of the sunshine and out of the heat,
  Out of the dust of the grimy street,
  A song fluttered down in the form of a dove,
  And it bore me a message, the one word--Love!
  Ah, I was toiling, and oh, I was sad:
  I had forgotten the way to be glad.
  Now, smiles for my sadness and for my toil, rest
  Since the dove fluttered down to its home in my breast!
A WARM DAY IN WINTER
  "Sunshine on de medders,
    Greenness on de way;
  Dat 's de blessed reason
    I sing all de day."
  Look hyeah! Whut you axin'?
    Whut meks me so merry?
  'Spect to see me sighin'
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary?
  'Long de stake an' rider
    Seen a robin set;
  W'y hit 'mence a-thawin',
    Groun' is monst'ous wet.
  Den you stan' dah wond'rin',
    Lookin' skeert an' stary;
  I's a right to caper
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary.
  Missis gone a-drivin',

  Ev'ry da'ky lazin'
    In de sun to boot.
  Qua'tah 's moughty pleasant,
    Hangin' 'roun' my Mary;
  Cou'tin' boun' to prospah
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary.
  Cidah look so pu'ty
    Po'in' f'om de jug--
  Don' you see it's happy?

  Now's de time fu' people
    Fu' to try an' bury
  All dey grief an' sorrer,
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary.
SNOWIN'
  Dey is snow upon de meddahs, dey is snow upon de hill,
  An' de little branch's watahs is all glistenin' an' still;
  De win' goes roun' de cabin lak a sperrit wan'erin' 'roun'.
  An' de chillen shakes an' shivahs as dey listen to de soun'.
  Dey is hick'ry in de fiahplace, whah de blaze is risin' high,
  But de heat it meks ain't wa'min' up de gray clouds in de sky.
  Now an' den I des peep outside, den I hurries to de do',
  Lawd a mussy on my body, how I wish it would n't snow!
  I kin stan' de hottes' summah, I kin stan' de wettes' fall,
  I kin stan' de chilly springtime in de ploughland, but dat's all;
  Fu' de ve'y hottes' fiah nevah tells my skin a t'ing,
  W'en de snow commence a-flyin', an' de win' begin to sing.
  Dey is plenty wood erroun' us, an' I chop an' tote it in,
  But de t'oughts dat I 's a t'inkin' while I 's wo'kin' is a sin.
  I kin keep f'om downright swahin' all de time I 's on de go,
  But my hea't is full o' cuss-wo'ds w'en I's trampin' thoo de snow.
  What you say, you Lishy Davis, dat you see a possum's tracks?
  Look hyeah, boy, you stop yo' foolin', bring ol' Spot, an' bring de ax.
  Is I col'? Go way, now, Mandy, what you t'ink I's made of?--sho,
  W'y dis win' is des ez gentle, an' dis ain't no kin' o' snow.
  Dis hyeah weathah 's des ez healthy ez de wa'mest summah days.
  All you chillen step up lively, pile on wood an' keep a blaze.
  What's de use o' gittin' skeery case dey 's snow upon de groun'?
  Huh-uh, I 's a reg'lar snowbird ef dey 's any possum 'roun'.
  Go on, Spot, don' be so foolish; don' you see de signs o' feet.
  What you howlin' fu? Keep still, suh, cose de col' is putty sweet;
  But we goin' out on bus'ness, an' hit 's bus'ness o' de kin'
  Dat mus' put a dog an' dahky in a happy frame o' min'.
  Yes, you 's col'; I know it, Spotty, but you des stay close to me,
  An' I 'll mek you hot ez cotton w'en we strikes de happy tree.
  No, I don' lak wintah weathah, an' I 'd wush 't uz allus June,
  Ef it was n't fu' de trackin' o' de possum an' de coon.
KEEP A SONG UP ON DE WAY
  Oh, de clouds is mighty heavy
  An' de rain is mighty thick;
   Keep a song up on de way.
  An' de waters is a rumblin'
  On de boulders in de crick,
    Keep a song up on de way.
  Fu' a bird ercross de road
  Is a-singin' lak he knowed
  Dat we people did n't daih
  Fu' to try de rainy aih
    Wid a song up on de way.
  What's de use o' gittin' mopy,
  Case de weather ain' de bes'!
    Keep a song up on de way.
  W'en de rain is fallin' ha'des',
  Dey 's de longes' times to res'
    Keep a song up on de way.
  Dough de plough 's a-stan'in' still
  Dey 'll be watah fu' de mill,
  Rain mus' come ez well ez sun
  'Fo' de weathah's wo'k is done,
    Keep a song up on de way.
  W'y hit's nice to hyeah de showahs
  Fallin' down ermong de trees:
    Keep a song up on de way.
  Ef de birds don' bothah 'bout it,
  But go singin' lak dey please,
    Keep a song up on de way.
  You don' s'pose I's gwine to see
  Dem ah fowls do mo' dan me?
  No, suh, I 'll des chase dis frown,
  An' aldough de rain fall down,
    Keep a song up on de way.
THE TURNING OF THE BABIES IN THE BED
  Woman's sho' a cur'ous critter, an' dey ain't no doubtin' dat.
  She's a mess o' funny capahs f'om huh slippahs to huh hat.
  Ef you tries to un'erstan' huh, an' you fails, des' up an' say:
  "D' ain't a bit o' use to try to un'erstan' a woman's way."
  I don' mean to be complainin', but I 's jes' a-settin' down
  Some o' my own obserwations, w'en I cas' my eye eroun'.
  Ef you ax me fu' to prove it, I ken do it mighty fine,
  Fu' dey ain't no bettah 'zample den dis ve'y wife o' mine.
  In de ve'y hea't o' midnight, w'en I 's sleepin' good an' soun',
  I kin hyeah a so't o' rustlin' an' somebody movin' 'roun'.
  An' I say, "Lize, whut you doin'?" But she frown an' shek huh haid,
  "Heish yo' mouf, I's only tu'nin' of de chillun in de bed.
  "Don' you know a chile gits restless, layin' all de night one way?
  An' you' got to kind o' 'range him sev'al times befo' de day?
  So de little necks won't worry, an' de little backs won't break;
  Don' you t'ink case chillun 's chillun dey hain't got no pain an' ache."
  So she shakes 'em, an' she twists 'em, an' she tu'ns 'em 'roun' erbout,
  'Twell I don' see how de chillun evah keeps f'om hollahin' out.
  Den she lif's 'em up head down'ards, so's dey won't git livahgrown,
  But dey snoozes des' ez peaceful ez a liza'd on a stone.
  W'en hit's mos' nigh time fu' wakin' on de dawn o' jedgment day,
  Seems lak I kin hyeah ol' Gab'iel lay his trumpet down an' say,
  "Who dat walkin' 'roun' so easy, down on earf ermong de dead?"--
  'T will be Lizy up a-tu'nin' of de chillun in de bed.
THE DANCE
  Heel and toe, heel and toe,
   That is the song we sing;
  Turn to your partner and curtsey low,
   Balance and forward and swing.
  Corners are draughty and meadows are white,
  This is the game for a winter's night.
  Hands around, hands around,
    Trip it, and not too slow;
  Clear is the fiddle and sweet its sound,
    Keep the girls' cheeks aglow.
  Still let your movements be dainty and light,
  This is the game for a winter's night.
  Back to back, back to back,
    Turn to your place again;
  Never let lightness nor nimbleness lack,
    Either in maidens or men.
  Time hasteth ever, beware of its flight,
  Oh, what a game for a winter's night!
  Slower now, slower now,
    Softer the music sighs;
  Look, there are beads on your partner's brow
    Though there be light in her eyes.
  Lead her away and her grace requite,
  So goes the game on a winter's night.
SOLILOQUY OF A TURKEY
  Dey 's a so't o' threatenin' feelin' in de blowin' of de breeze,
    An' I 's feelin' kin' o' squeamish in de night;
  I 's a-walkin' 'roun' a-lookin' at de diffunt style o' trees,
    An' a-measurin' dey thickness an' dey height.
  Fu' dey 's somep'n mighty 'spicious in de looks de da'kies give,
    Ez dey pass me an' my fambly on de groun,'
  So it 'curs to me dat lakly, ef I caihs to try an' live,
    It concehns me fu' to 'mence to look erroun'.
  Dey's a cu'ious kin' o' shivah runnin' up an' down my back,
    An' I feel my feddahs rufflin' all de day,
  An' my laigs commence to trimble evah blessid step I mek;
    W'en I sees a ax, I tu'ns my head away.
  Folks is go'gin' me wid goodies, an' dey 's treatin' me wid caih,
    An' I 's fat in spite of all dat I kin do.
  I 's mistrus'ful of de kin'ness dat's erroun' me evahwhaih,
    Fu' it 's jes' too good, an' frequent, to be true.
  Snow 's a-fallin' on de medders, all erroun' me now is white,
    But I 's still kep' on a-roostin' on de fence;
  Isham comes an' feels my breas'bone, an' he hefted me las' night,
    An' he 's gone erroun' a-grinnin' evah sence.
  'T ain't de snow dat meks me shivah; 't ain't de col' dat meks me
       shake;
    'T ain't de wintah-time itse'f dat's 'fectin' me;
  But I t'ink de time is comin', an' I 'd bettah mek a break,
    Fu' to set wid Mistah Possum in his tree.
  Wen you hyeah de da'kies singin', an' de quahtahs all is gay,
    'T ain't de time fu' birds lak me to be 'erroun';
  Wen de hick'ry chip is flyin', an' de log 's been ca'ied erway,
    Den hit's dang'ous to be roostin' nigh he groun'.
  Grin on, Isham! Sing on, da'kies! But I flop my wings an' go
    Fu' de sheltah of de ve'y highest tree,
  Fu' dey 's too much close ertention--an' dey's too much fallin' snow--
    An' it's too nigh Chris'mus mo'nin' now fu' me.
FISHING
  Wen I git up in de mo'nin' an' de clouds is big an' black,
  Dey's a kin' o' wa'nin' shivah goes a-scootin' down my back;
  Den I says to my ol' ooman ez I watches down de lane,
  "Don't you so't o' reckon, Lizy, dat we gwine to have some rain?"
  "Go on, man," my Lizy answah, "you cain't fool me, not a bit,
  I don't see no rain a-comin', ef you's wishin' fu' it, quit;
  Case de mo' you t'ink erbout it, an de mo' you pray an' wish,
  W'y de rain stay 'way de longah, spechul ef you wants to fish."
  But I see huh pat de skillet, an' I see huh cas' huh eye
  Wid a kin' o' anxious motion to'ds de da'kness in de sky;
  An' I knows whut she 's a-t'inkin', dough she tries so ha'd to hide.
  She 's a-sayin', "Would n't catfish now tas'e monst'ous bully, fried?"
  Den de clouds git black an' blackah, an' de thundah 'mence to roll,
  An' de rain, it 'mence a-fallin'. Oh, I's happy, bless my soul!
  Ez I look at dat ol' skillet, an' I 'magine I kin see
  Jes' a slew o' new-ketched catfish sizzlin' daih fu' huh an' me.
  'T ain't no use to go a-ploughin', fu' de groun' 'll be too wet,
  So I puts out fu' de big house at a moughty pace, you bet,
  An' ol' mastah say, "Well, Lishy, ef you t'ink hit 's gwine to rain,
  Go on fishin', hit 's de weathah, an' I 'low we cain't complain."
  Talk erbout a dahky walkin' wid his haid up in de aih!
  Have to feel mine evah minute to be sho' I got it daih;
  En' de win' is cuttin' capahs an' a-lashin' thoo de trees,
  But de rain keeps on a-singin' blessed songs, lak "Tek yo' ease."
  Wid my pole erpon my shouldah an' my wo'm can in my han',
  I kin feel de fish a-waitin' w'en I strikes de rivah's san';
  Nevah min', you ho'ny scoun'els, need n' swim erroun' an' grin,
  I 'll be grinnin' in a minute w'en I 'mence to haul you in.
  W'en de fish begin to nibble, an' de co'k begin to jump,
  I 's erfeahed dat dey 'll quit bitin', case dey hyeah my hea't go "thump,"
  'Twell de co'k go way down undah, an' I raise a awful shout,
  Ez a big ol' yallah belly comes a gallivantin' out.
  Need n't wriggle, Mistah Catfish, case I got you jes' de same,
  You been eatin', I 'll be eatin', an' we needah ain't to blame.
  But you need n't feel so lonesome fu' I 's th'owin' out to see
  Ef dey ain't some of yo' comrades fu' to keep you company.
  Spo't, dis fishin'! now you talkin', w'y dey ain't no kin' to beat;
  I don' keer ef I is soakin', laigs, an' back, an' naik, an' feet,
  It 's de spo't I 's lookin' aftah. Hit 's de pleasure an' de fun,
  Dough I knows dat Lizy 's waitin' wid de skillet w'en I's done.
A PLANTATION PORTRAIT
  Hain't you see my Mandy Lou,
    Is it true?
  Whaih you been f'om day to day,
    Whaih, I say?
  Dat you say you nevah seen
    Dis hyeah queen
  Walkin' roun' f'om fiel' to street
    Smilin' sweet?
  Slendah ez a saplin' tree;
    Seems to me
  Wen de win' blow f'om de bay
    She jes' sway
  Lak de reg'lar saplin' do
    Ef hit's grew
  Straight an' graceful, 'dout a limb,
    Sweet an' slim.
  Browner den de frush's wing,
    An' she sing
  Lak he mek his wa'ble ring
    In de spring;
  But she sholy beat de frush,
    Hyeah me, hush:
  Wen she sing, huh teef kin show
    White ez snow.
  Eyes ez big an' roun' an' bright
    Ez de light
  Whut de moon gives in de prime
    Harvest time.
  An' huh haih a woolly skein,
    Black an' plain.
  Hol's you wid a natchul twis'
    Close to bliss.
  Tendah han's dat mek yo' own
    Feel lak stone;
  Easy steppin', blessid feet,
    Small an' sweet.
  Hain't you seen my Mandy Lou,
    Is it true?
  Look at huh befo' she's gone,
    Den pass on!
A LITTLE CHRISTMAS BASKET
  De win' is hollahin' "Daih you" to de shuttahs an' de fiah,
    De snow's a-sayin' "Got you" to de groun',
  Fu' de wintah weathah 's come widout a-askin' ouah desiah,
    An' he 's laughin' in his sleeve at whut he foun';
  Fu' dey ain't nobody ready wid dey fuel er dey food,
    An' de money bag look timid lak, fu' sho',
  So we want ouah Chrismus sermon, but we 'd lak it ef you could
    Leave a little Chrismus basket at de do'.
  Wha 's de use o' tellin' chillen 'bout a Santy er a Nick,
    An' de sto'ies dat a body allus tol'?
  When de harf is gray wid ashes an' you has n't got a stick
    Fu' to warm dem when dey little toes is col'?
  Wha 's de use o' preachin' 'ligion to a man dat's sta'ved to def,
    An' a-tellin' him de Mastah will pu'vide?
  Ef you want to tech his feelin's, save yo' sermons an' yo' bref,
    Tek a little Chrismus basket by yo' side.
  'T ain't de time to open Bibles an' to lock yo' cellah do',
    'T ain't de time to talk o' bein' good to men;
  Ef you want to preach a sermon ez you nevah preached befo',
    Preach dat sermon wid a shoat er wid er hen;
  Bein' good is heap sight bettah den a-dallyin' wid sin,
    An' dey ain't nobody roun' dat knows it mo',
  But I t'ink dat 'ligion 's sweeter w'en it kind o' mixes in
    Wid a little Chrismus basket at de do'.
THE VALSE
  When to sweet music my lady is dancing
    My heart to mild frenzy her beauty inspires.
  Into my face are her brown eyes a-glancing,
    And swift my whole frame thrills with tremulous fires.
  Dance, lady, dance, for the moments are fleeting,
    Pause not to place yon refractory curl;
  Life is for love and the night is for sweeting;
    Dreamily, joyously, circle and whirl.
  Oh, how those viols are throbbing and pleading;
    A prayer is scarce needed in sound of their strain.
  Surely and lightly as round you are speeding,
    You turn to confusion my heart and my brain.
  Dance, lady, dance to the viol's soft calling,
    Skip it and trip it as light as the air;
  Dance, for the moments like rose leaves are falling,
    Strikes, now, the clock from its place on the stair.
  Now sinks the melody lower and lower,
    The weary musicians scarce seeming to play.
  Ah, love, your steps now are slower and slower,
    The smile on your face is more sad and less gay.
  Dance, lady, dance to the brink of our parting,
    My heart and your step must not fail to be light.
  Dance! Just a turn--tho' the tear-drop be starting.
    Ah--now it is done--so--my lady, good-night!
REPONSE
  When Phyllis sighs and from her eyes
  The light dies out; my soul replies
  With misery of deep-drawn breath,
  E'en as it were at war with death.
  When Phyllis smiles, her glance beguiles
  My heart through love-lit woodland aisles,
  And through the silence high and clear,
  A wooing warbler's song I hear.
  But if she frown, despair comes down,
  I put me on my sack-cloth gown;
  So frown not, Phyllis, lest I die,
  But look on me with smile or sigh.
MY SWEET BROWN GAL
  W'en de clouds is hangin' heavy in de sky,
  An' de win's 's a-taihin' moughty vig'rous by,
  I don' go a-sighin' all erlong de way;

  Dey 's a happy sheltah, an' I 's goin' daih.
  Down in my ol' cabin wa'm ez mammy's toas',

  No one daih to cross me, got no talkin' pal,
  But I 's got de comp'ny o' my sweet brown gal.
  So I spen's my evenin' listenin' to huh sing,
  Lak a blessid angel; how huh voice do ring!
  Sweetah den a bluebird flutterin' erroun',
  W'en he sees de steamin' o' de new ploughed groun'.
  Den I hugs huh closah, closah to my breas'.
  Need n't sing, my da'lin', tek you' hones' res'.
  Does I mean Malindy, Mandy, Lize er Sal?
  No, I means my fiddle-dat's my sweet brown gal!
SPRING FEVER
  Grass commence a-comin'

  Bluebird sass de robin,

  Would n' min' de quoilin'

    Case hit 's done in song.
  Anybody wo'kin'

  Mastah, he's a-scol'in',

  Don' know whut's de mattah,

  Ef only I kin see you whaih
    You wait beside de way.
  Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,
    My soul will still be free,
  Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs

  Bird-song, breeze-wail, chune er moan,
    What puny t'ings dey 'll be,
  Ef w'en I 's seemin' all erlone,

  Wen de colo'ed ban' comes ma'chin' down de street,
  Don't you people stan' daih starin'; lif yo' feet!
    Ain't dey playin'? Hip, hooray!
    Stir yo' stumps an' cleah de way,
  Fu' de music dat dey mekin' can't be beat.
  Oh, de major man's a-swingin' of his stick,
  An' de pickaninnies crowdin' roun' him thick;
    In his go'geous uniform,
    He 's de lightnin' of de sto'm,
  An' de little clouds erroun' look mighty slick.
  You kin hyeah a fine perfo'mance w'en de white ban's serenade,
    An' dey play dey high-toned music mighty sweet,
  But hit 's Sousa played in ragtime, an' hit 's Rastus on Parade,
    Wen de colo'ed ban' comes ma'chin' down de street.
  Wen de colo'ed ban' comes ma'chin' down de street
  You kin hyeah de ladies all erroun' repeat:
    "Ain't dey handsome? Ain't dey gran'?
    Ain't dey splendid? Goodness, lan'!
  Wy dey's pu'fect f'om dey fo'heads to dey feet!"
  An' sich steppin' to de music down de line,
  'T ain't de music by itself dat meks it fine,
    Hit's de walkin', step by step,
    An' de keepin' time wid "Hep,"
  Dat it mek a common ditty soun' divine.
  Oh, de white ban' play hits music, an' hit 's mighty good to hyeah,
  An' it sometimes leaves a ticklin' in yo' feet;
  But de hea't goes into bus'ness fu' to he'p erlong de eah,
    Wen de colo'ed ban' goes ma'chin' down de street.
TO A VIOLET FOUND ON ALL SAINTS' DAY
  Belated wanderer of the ways of spring,
    Lost in the chill of grim November rain,
  Would I could read the message that you bring
    And find in it the antidote for pain.
  Does some sad spirit out beyond the day,
    Far looking to the hours forever dead,
  Send you a tender offering to lay
    Upon the grave of us, the living dead?
  Or does some brighter spirit, unforlorn,
    Send you, my little sister of the wood,
  To say to some one on a cloudful morn,
    "Life lives through death, my brother, all is good?"
  With meditative hearts the others go
    The memory of their dead to dress anew.
  But, sister mine, bide here that I may know,
    Life grows, through death, as beautiful as you.
INSPIRATION
  At the golden gate of song
  Stood I, knocking all day long,
  But the Angel, calm and cold,
  Still refused and bade me, "Hold."
  Then a breath of soft perfume,
  Then a light within the gloom;
  Thou, Love, camest to my side,
  And the gates flew open wide.
  Long I dwelt in this domain,
  Knew no sorrow, grief, or pain;
  Now you bid me forth and free,
  Will you shut these gates on me?
MY LADY OF CASTLE GRAND
  Gray is the palace where she dwells,
    Grimly the poplars stand
  There by the window where she sits,
    My Lady of Castle Grand.
  There does she bide the livelong day,
    Grim as the poplars are,
  Ever her gaze goes reaching out,
    Steady, but vague and far.
  Bright burn the fires in the castle hall,
    Brightly the fire-dogs stand;
  But cold is the body and cold the heart
    Of my Lady of Castle Grand.
  Blue are the veins in her lily-white hands,
    Blue are the veins in her brow;
  Thin is the line of her blue drawn lips,
    Who would be haughty now?
  Pale is the face at the window-pane,
    Pale as the pearl on her breast,
  "Roderick, love, wilt come again?
    Fares he to east or west?"
  The shepherd pipes to the shepherdess,
    The bird to his mate in the tree,
  And ever she sighs as she hears their song,
    "Nobody sings for me."
  The scullery maids have swains enow
    Who lead them the way of love,
  But lonely and loveless their mistress sits
    At her window up above.
  Loveless and lonely she waits and waits,
    The saddest in all the land;
  Ah, cruel and lasting is love-blind pride,
    My Lady of Castle Grand.
DRIZZLE
  Hit 's been drizzlin' an' been sprinklin',
    Kin' o' techy all day long.
  I ain't wet enough fu' toddy,
    I 's too damp to raise a song,
  An' de case have set me t'inkin',
    Dat dey 's folk des lak de rain,
  Dat goes drizzlin' w'en dey's talkin',
    An' won't speak out flat an' plain.
  Ain't you nevah set an' listened
    At a body 'splain his min'?
  W'en de t'oughts dey keep on drappin'
    Was n't big enough to fin'?
  Dem 's whut I call drizzlin' people,
    Othahs call 'em mealy mouf,
  But de fust name hits me bettah,
    Case dey nevah tech a drouf.
  Dey kin talk from hyeah to yandah,
    An' f'om yandah hyeah ergain,
  An' dey don' mek no mo' 'pression,
    Den dis powd'ry kin' o' rain.
  En yo' min' is dry ez cindahs,
    Er a piece o' kindlin' wood,
  'T ain't no use a-talkin' to 'em,
    Fu' dey drizzle ain't no good.
  Gimme folks dat speak out nachul,
    Whut 'll say des whut dey mean,
  Whut don't set dey wo'ds so skimpy
    Dat you got to guess between.
  I want talk des' lak de showahs
    Whut kin wash de dust erway,
  Not dat sprinklin' convusation,
    Dat des drizzle all de day.
DE CRITTERS' DANCE
  Ain't nobody nevah tol' you not a wo'd a-tall,
  'Bout de time dat all de critters gin dey fancy ball?
  Some folks tell it in a sto'y, some folks sing de rhyme,
  'Peahs to me you ought to hyeahed it, case hit 's ol' ez time.
  Well, de critters all was p'osp'ous, now would be de chance
  Fu' to tease ol' Pa'son Hedgehog, givin' of a dance;
  Case, you know, de critters' preachah was de stric'est kin',
  An' he nevah made no 'lowance fu' de frisky min'.
  So dey sont dey inbitations, Raccoon writ 'em all,
  "Dis hyeah note is to inbite you to de Fancy Ball;
  Come erlong an' bring yo' ladies, bring yo' chillun too,
  Put on all yo' bibs an' tuckahs, show whut you kin do."
  W'en de night come, dey all gathahed in a place dey knowed,
  Fu' enough erway f'om people, nigh enough de road,
  All de critters had ersponded, Hop-Toad up to Baih,
  An' I 's hyeah to tell you, Pa'son Hedgehog too, was daih.
  Well, dey talked an' made dey 'bejunce, des lak critters do,
  An' dey walked an' p'omenaded 'roun' an' thoo an' thoo;
  Jealous ol' Mis' Fox, she whispah, "See Mis' Wildcat daih,
  Ain't hit scan'lous, huh a-comin' wid huh shouldahs baih?"
  Ol' man T'utle was n't honin' fu' no dancin' tricks,
  So he stayed by ol' Mis' Tu'tle, talkin' politics;
  Den de ban' hit 'mence a-playin' critters all to place,
  Fou' ercross an' fou' stan' sideways, smilin' face to face.
  'Fessah Frog, he play de co'net, Cricket play de fife,
  Slews o' Grasshoppahs a-fiddlin' lak to save dey life;
  Mistah Crow, 'he call de figgers, settin' in a tree,
  Huh, uh! how dose critters sasshayed was a sight to see.
  Mistah Possom swing Mis' Rabbit up an' down de flo',
  Ol' man Baih, he ain't so nimble, an' it mek him blow;
  Raccoon dancin' wid Mis' Squ'il squeeze huh little han',
  She say, "Oh, now ain't you awful, quit it, goodness lan'!"
  Pa'son Hedgehog groanin' awful at his converts' shines,
  'Dough he peepin' thoo his fingahs at dem movin' lines,
  'Twell he cain't set still no longah w'en de fiddles sing,
  Up he jump, an' bless you, honey, cut de pigeon-wing.
  Well, de critters lak to fainted jes' wid dey su'prise.
  Sistah Fox, she vowed she was n't gwine to b'lieve huh eyes;
  But dey could n't be no 'sputin' 'bout it any mo':
  Pa'son Hedgehog was a-cape'in' all erroun' de flo.'
  Den dey all jes' capahed scan'lous case dey did n't doubt,
  Dat dey still could go to meetin'; who could tu'n 'em out?
  So wid dancin' an' uligion, dey was in de fol',
  Fu' a-dancin' wid de Pa'son couldn't hu't de soul.
WHEN DEY 'LISTED COLORED SOLDIERS
  Dey was talkin' in de cabin, dey was talkin' in de hall;
  But I listened kin' o' keerless, not a-t'inkin' 'bout it all;
  An' on Sunday, too, I noticed, dey was whisp'rin' mighty much,
  Stan'in' all erroun' de roadside w'en dey let us out o' chu'ch.
  But I did n't t'ink erbout it 'twell de middle of de week,
  An' my 'Lias come to see me, an' somehow he could n't speak.
  Den I seed all in a minute whut he 'd come to see me for;--
  Dey had 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias gwine to wah.
  Oh, I hugged him, an' I kissed him, an' I baiged him not to go;
  But he tol' me dat his conscience, hit was callin' to him so,
  An' he could n't baih to lingah w'en he had a chanst to fight
  For de freedom dey had gin him an' de glory of de right.
  So he kissed me, an' he lef me, w'en I 'd p'omised to be true;
  An' dey put a knapsack on him, an' a coat all colo'ed blue.
  So I gin him pap's ol' Bible f'om de bottom of de draw',--
  W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
  But I t'ought of all de weary miles dat he would have to tramp,
  An' I could n't be contented w'en dey tuk him to de camp.
  W'y my hea't nigh broke wid grievin' 'twell I seed him on de street;
  Den I felt lak I could go an' th'ow my body at his feet.
  For his buttons was a-shinin', an' his face was shinin', too,
  An' he looked so strong an' mighty in his coat o' sojer blue,
  Dat I hollahed, "Step up, manny," dough my th'oat was so' an' raw,--
  W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
  Ol' Mis' cried w'en mastah lef huh, young Miss mou'ned huh brothah Ned,
  An' I did n't know dey feelin's is de ve'y wo'ds dey said
  W'en I tol' 'em I was so'y. Dey had done gin up dey all;
  But dey only seemed mo' proudah dat dey men had hyeahed de call.
  Bofe my mastahs went in gray suits, an' I loved de Yankee blue,
  But I t'ought dat I could sorrer for de losin' of 'em too;
  But I could n't, for I did n't know de ha'f o' whut I saw,
  'Twell dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
  Mastah Jack come home all sickly; he was broke for life, dey said;
  An' dey lef my po' young mastah some'r's on de roadside,--dead.
  W'en de women cried an' mou'ned 'em, I could feel it thoo an' thoo,
  For I had a loved un fightin' in de way o' dangah, too.
  Den dey tol' me dey had laid him some'r's way down souf to res',
  Wid de flag dat he had fit for shinin' daih acrost his breas'.
  Well, I cried, but den I reckon dat 's whut Gawd had called him for,
  W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
LINCOLN
  Hurt was the nation with a mighty wound,
  And all her ways were filled with clam'rous sound.
  Wailed loud the South with unremitting grief,
  And wept the North that could not find relief.
  Then madness joined its harshest tone to strife:
  A minor note swelled in the song of life.
  'Till, stirring with the love that filled his breast,
  But still, unflinching at the right's behest,
  Grave Lincoln came, strong handed, from afar,
  The mighty Homer of the lyre of war.
  'T was he who bade the raging tempest cease,
  Wrenched from his harp the harmony of peace,
  Muted the strings, that made the discord,--Wrong,
  And gave his spirit up in thund'rous song.
  Oh mighty Master of the mighty lyre,
  Earth heard and trembled at thy strains of fire:
  Earth learned of thee what Heav'n already knew,
  And wrote thee down among her treasured few.
ENCOURAGEMENT
  Who dat knockin' at de do'?

THE BOOGAH MAN
  W'en de evenin' shadders
    Come a-glidin' down,
  Fallin' black an' heavy
    Ovah hill an' town,
  Ef you listen keerful,
    Keerful ez you kin,
  So 's you boun' to notice
    Des a drappin' pin;
  Den you 'll hyeah a funny

  W'en de owl's a-hootin',

  Den de rain kin pattah
    Win' blow lak a fan,
  But you need n' bothah
    'Bout de Boogah Man!
THE WRAITH
  Ah me, it is cold and chill
    And the fire sobs low in the grate,
  While the wind rides by on the hill,
    And the logs crack sharp with hate.
  And she, she is cold and sad
    As ever the sinful are,
  But deep in my heart I am glad
    For my wound and the coming scar.
  Oh, ever the wind rides by
    And ever the raindrops grieve;
  But a voice like a woman's sigh
    Says, "Do you believe, believe?"
  Ah, you were warm and sweet,
    Sweet as the May days be;
  Down did I fall at your feet,
    Why did you hearken to me?
  Oh, the logs they crack and whine,
    And the water drops from the eaves;
  But it is not rain but brine
    Where my dead darling grieves.
  And a wraith sits by my side,
    A spectre grim and dark;
  Are you gazing here open-eyed
    Out to the lifeless dark?
  But ever the wind rides on,
    And we sit close within;
  Out of the face of the dawn,
    I and my darling,--sin.
SILENCE
  'T is better to sit here beside the sea,
    Here on the spray-kissed beach,
  In silence, that between such friends as we
    Is full of deepest speech.
WHIP-POOR-WILL AND KATY-DID
  Slow de night 's a-fallin',
  An' I hyeah de callin,

  De restin'-time 's a-comin', an' de time to drink an' eat;
  A baby's toddlin' to'ds him on hits little dusty feet,
  An' a-goin' to'ds his cabin, an' his suppah 's moughty sweet,

A GRIEVANCE
  Wen de snow 's a-fallin'
    An' de win' is col'.
  Mammy 'mence a-callin',
    Den she 'mence to scol',
  "Lucius Lishy Brackett,
    Don't you go out do's,
  Button up yo' jacket,
    Les'n you 'll git froze."
  I sit at de windah
    Lookin' at de groun',
  Nuffin nigh to hindah,
    Mammy ain' erroun';
  Wish 't she would n' mek me
    Set down in dis chaih;
  Pshaw, it would n't tek me
    Long to git some aih.
  So I jump down nimble
    Ez a boy kin be,

    Feahed some one 'll see;
  Bet in a half a minute

  An' my mammy holler

  Of de stuff dat's fallin'
    'Roun' an' white an' damp,
  'Dout some one a-callin',
    "Come in hyeah, you scamp!"
DINAH KNEADING DOUGH
  I have seen full many a sight
  Born of day or drawn by night:
  Sunlight on a silver stream,
  Golden lilies all a-dream,
  Lofty mountains, bold and proud,
  Veiled beneath the lacelike cloud;
  But no lovely sight I know
  Equals Dinah kneading dough.
  Brown arms buried elbow-deep
  Their domestic rhythm keep,
  As with steady sweep they go
  Through the gently yielding dough.
  Maids may vaunt their finer charms--
  Naught to me like Dinah's arms;
  Girls may draw, or paint, or sew--
  I love Dinah kneading dough.
  Eyes of jet and teeth of pearl,
  Hair, some say, too tight a-curl;
  But the dainty maid I deem
  Very near perfection's dream.
  Swift she works, and only flings
  Me a glance--the least of things.
  And I wonder, does she know
  That my heart is in the dough?
TO A CAPTIOUS CRITIC
  Dear critic, who my lightness so deplores,
  Would I might study to be prince of bores,
  Right wisely would I rule that dull estate--
  But, sir, I may not, till you abdicate.
DAT OL' MARE O' MINE
  Want to trade me, do you, mistah? Oh, well, now, I reckon not,
  W'y you could n't buy my Sukey fu' a thousan' on de spot.
      Dat ol' mare o' mine?
  Yes, huh coat ah long an' shaggy, an' she ain't no shakes to see;
  Dat's a ring-bone, yes, you right, suh, an' she got a on'ry knee,
  But dey ain't no use in talkin', she de only hoss fu' me,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Co'se, I knows dat Suke 's contra'y, an' she moughty ap' to vex;
  But you got to mek erlowance fu' de nature of huh sex;
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Ef you pull her on de lef han'; she plum 'termined to go right,
  A cannon could n't skeer huh, but she boun' to tek a fright
  At a piece o' common paper, or anyt'ing whut's white,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Wen my eyes commence to fail me, dough, I trus'es to huh sight,
  An' she 'll tote me safe an' hones' on de ve'y da'kes' night,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Ef I whup huh, she jes' switch huh tail, an' settle to a walk,
  Ef I whup huh mo', she shek huh haid, an' lak ez not, she balk.
  But huh sense ain't no ways lackin', she do evah t'ing but talk,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  But she gentle ez a lady w'en she know huh beau kin see.
  An' she sholy got mo' gumption any day den you or me,
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  She's a leetle slow a-goin,' an' she moughty ha'd to sta't,
  But we 's gittin' ol' togathah, an' she 's closah to my hea't,
  An' I does n't reckon, mistah, dat she 'd sca'cely keer to pa't;
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  W'y I knows de time dat cidah 's kin' o' muddled up my haid,
  Ef it had n't been fu' Sukey hyeah, I reckon I 'd been daid;
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  But she got me in de middle o' de road an' tuk me home,
  An' she would n't let me wandah, ner she would n't let me roam,
  Dat's de kin' o' hoss to tie to w'en you 's seed de cidah's foam,
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  You kin talk erbout yo' heaven, you kin talk erbout yo' hell,
  Dey is people, dey is hosses, den dey's cattle, den dey's--well--
    Dat ol' mare o' mine;
  She de beatenes' t'ing dat evah struck de medders o' de town,
  An' aldough huh haid ain't fittin' fu' to waih no golden crown,
  D' ain't a blessed way fu' Petah fu' to tu'n my Sukey down,
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
IN THE MORNING
  'Lias! 'Lias! Bless de Lawd!
  Don' you know de day's erbroad?
  Ef you don' git up, you scamp,
  Dey 'll be trouble in dis camp.
  T'ink I gwine to let you sleep
  W'ile I meks yo' boa'd an' keep?

  But you go de mo'nin' thoo

  An' you sholy got me wrong.

  (Don' you daih to tech dem rolls--)
  "Bless de food we gwine to eat--"
  (You set still-I _see_ yo' feet;
  You jes' try dat trick agin!)
  "Gin us peace an' joy. Amen!"
THE POET
  He sang of life, serenely sweet,
    With, now and then, a deeper note.
    From some high peak, nigh yet remote,
  He voiced the world's absorbing beat.
  He sang of love when earth was young,
    And Love, itself, was in his lays.
    But ah, the world, it turned to praise
  A jingle in a broken tongue.
A FLORIDA NIGHT
  Win' a-blowin' gentle so de san' lay low,
    San' a little heavy f'om de rain,
  All de pa'ms a-wavin' an' a-weavin' slow,
    Sighin' lak a sinnah-soul in pain.
  Alligator grinnin' by de ol' lagoon,
  Mockin'-bird a-singin' to be big full moon.
  'Skeeter go a-skimmin' to his fightin' chune
    (Lizy Ann's a-waitin' in de lane!).
  Moccasin a-sleepin' in de cyprus swamp;
   Need n't wake de gent'man, not fu' me.
  Mule, you need n't wake him w'en you switch an' stomp,
    Fightin' off a 'skeeter er a flea.
  Florida is lovely, she's de fines' lan'
  Evah seed de sunlight f'om de Mastah's han',
  'Ceptin' fu' de varmints an' huh fleas an' san'
    An' de nights w'en Lizy Ann ain' free.
  Moon 's a-kinder shaddered on de melon patch;
    No one ain't a-watchin' ez I go.
  Climbin' of de fence so 's not to click de latch
    Meks my gittin' in a little slow.
  Watermelon smilin' as it say, "I' s free;"
  Alligator boomin', but I let him be,
  Florida, oh, Florida 's de lan' fu' me--
    (Lizy Ann a-singin' sweet an' low).
DIFFERENCES
  My neighbor lives on the hill,
    And I in the valley dwell,
  My neighbor must look down on me,
    Must I look up?--ah, well,
  My neighbor lives on the hill,
    And I in the valley dwell.
  My neighbor reads, and prays,
    And I--I laugh, God wot,
  And sing like a bird when the grass is green
    In my small garden plot;
  But ah, he reads and prays,
    And I--I laugh, God wot.
  His face is a book of woe,
    And mine is a song of glee;
  A slave he is to the great "They say,"
    But I--I am bold and free;
  No wonder he smacks of woe,
    And I have the tang of glee.
  My neighbor thinks me a fool,
    "The same to yourself," say I;
  "Why take your books and take your prayers,
    Give me the open sky;"
  My neighbor thinks me a fool,
    "The same to yourself," say I.
LONG AGO
  De ol' time's gone, de new time's hyeah

A PLANTATION MELODY
  De trees is bendin' in de sto'm,
  De rain done hid de mountain's fo'm,
    I 's 'lone an' in distress.
  But listen, dah 's a voice I hyeah,
    A-sayin' to me, loud an' cleah,
  "Lay low in de wildaness."
  De lightnin' flash, de bough sway low,
  My po' sick hea't is trimblin' so,
    It hu'ts my very breas'.
  But him dat give de lightnin' powah
  Jes' bids me in de tryin' howah
    "Lay low in de wildaness."
  O brothah, w'en de tempes' beat,
  An' w'en yo' weary head an' feet
    Can't fin' no place to res',
  Jes' 'membah dat de Mastah 's nigh,
  An' putty soon you 'll hyeah de cry,
    "Lay low in de wildaness."
  O sistah, w'en de rain come down,
  An' all yo' hopes is 'bout to drown,
    Don't trus' de Mastah less.
  He smilin' w'en you t'ink he frown,
  He ain' gwine let yo' soul sink down--
    Lay low in de wildaness.
A SPIRITUAL
  De 'cession's stahted on de gospel way,
    De Capting is a-drawin' nigh:
  Bettah stop a-foolin' an' a-try to pray;
    Lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
  Oh, sinnah mou'nin' in de dusty road,

    An' I wish you 'd tell me why:
  De Mastah is a mammy an' a pappy too;
    Lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
  Oh, Moses sot de sarpint in de wildahness
    W'en de chillun had commenced to die:
  Some 'efused to look, but hit cuohed de res';
    Lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
  Bow down, bow 'way down, Bow down,
  But lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
THE MEMORY OF MARTHA
  Out in de night a sad bird moans,
    An', oh, but hit 's moughty lonely;
  Times I kin sing, but mos' I groans,
    Fu' oh, but hit 's moughty lonely!
  Is you sleepin' well dis evenin', Marfy, deah?

  Down by de road de shadders grows,

  Does you know, I's cryin' fu' you, oh, my wife?
  Does you know dey ain't no joy no mo' in life?
    An' my only t'ought is dis,
    Dat I's honin' fu' de bliss
  Fu' to quit dis groun' o' worriment an' strife.
  Dah on de baid my banjo lays,
    An', oh, but hit's moughty lonely;
  Can't even sta't a chune o' praise,
    An', oh, but hit's moughty lonely!
  Oh, hit's moughty slow a-waitin' hyeah below.
  Is you watchin' fu' me, Marfy, at de do'?
    Ef you is, in spite o' sin,

  Wen dey sees yo' face a-shinin', den dey'll know.
W'EN I GITS HOME
  It's moughty tiahsome layin' 'roun'

  An' oftentimes I thinks, thinks I,
  'T would be a sweet t'ing des to die,
      An' go 'long home.
  Home whaih de frien's I loved 'll say,
  "We've waited fu' you many a day,
  Come hyeah an' res' yo'se'f, an' know
  You's done wid sorrer an' wid woe,
      Now you's at home."
  W'en I gits home some blessid day,
  I 'lows to th'ow my caihs erway,
  An' up an' down de shinin' street,
  Go singin' sof' an' low an' sweet,
      W'en I gits home.
  I wish de day was neah at han',

      An' go 'long home.
  Oh, Mastah, won't you sen' de call?
  My frien's is daih, my hope, my all.

"HOWDY, HONEY, HOWDY!"
  Do' a-stan'in' on a jar, fiah a-shinin' thoo,
  Ol' folks drowsin' 'roun' de place, wide awake is Lou,

  Now's de time, ef evah, ef I's gwine to try an' win,

  No use playin' on de aidge, trimblin' on de brink,
  Wen a body love a gal, tell huh whut he t'ink;
  W'en huh hea't is open fu' de love you gwine to gin,
  Pull yo'se'f togethah, suh, an' step right in.

  At de gate o' heaven w'en de storm o' life is pas',

  "Hyeah he stan' all weary, but he winned his fight wid sin.
  Howdy, honey, howdy, won't you step right in?"
THE UNSUNG HEROES
  A song for the unsung heroes who rose in the country's need,
  When the life of the land was threatened by the slaver's cruel greed,
  For the men who came from the cornfield, who came from the plough and
            the flail,
  Who rallied round when they heard the sound of the mighty man of the
            rail.
  They laid them down in the valleys, they laid them down in the wood,
  And the world looked on at the work they did, and whispered, "It is good."
  They fought their way on the hillside, they fought their way in the glen,
  And God looked down on their sinews brown, and said, "I have made them
            men."
  They went to the blue lines gladly, and the blue lines took them in,
  And the men who saw their muskets' fire thought not of their dusky skin.
  The gray lines rose and melted beneath their scathing showers,
  And they said, "'T is true, they have force to do, these old slave boys
            of ours."
  Ah, Wagner saw their glory, and Pillow knew their blood,
  That poured on a nation's altar, a sacrificial flood.
  Port Hudson heard their war-cry that smote its smoke-filled air,
  And the old free fires of their savage sires again were kindled there.
  They laid them down where the rivers the greening valleys gem.
  And the song of the thund'rous cannon was their sole requiem,
  And the great smoke wreath that mingled its hue with the dusky cloud,
  Was the flag that furled o'er a saddened world, and the sheet that made
            their shroud.
  Oh, Mighty God of the Battles Who held them in Thy hand,
  Who gave them strength through the whole day's length, to fight for their
            native land,
  They are lying dead on the hillsides, they are lying dead on the plain,
  And we have not fire to smite the lyre and sing them one brief strain.
  Give, Thou, some seer the power to sing them in their might,
  The men who feared the master's whip, but did not fear the fight;
  That he may tell of their virtues as minstrels did of old,
  Till the pride of face and the hate of race grow obsolete and cold.
  A song for the unsung heroes who stood the awful test,
  When the humblest host that the land could boast went forth to meet the
            best;
  A song for the unsung heroes who fell on the bloody sod,
  Who fought their way from night to day and struggled up to God.
THE POOL
  By the pool that I see in my dreams, dear love,
    I have sat with you time and again;
  And listened beneath the dank leaves, dear love,
    To the sibilant sound of the rain.
  And the pool, it is silvery bright, dear love,
    And as pure as the heart of a maid,
  As sparkling and dimpling, it darkles and shines
    In the depths of the heart of the glade.
  But, oh, I 've a wish in my soul, dear love,
    (The wish of a dreamer, it seems,)
  That I might wash free of my sins, dear love,
    In the pool that I see in my dreams.

DIRGE FOR A SOLDIER
  In the east the morning comes,
  Hear the rollin' of the drums
      On the hill.
  But the heart that beat as they beat
  In the battle's raging day heat
      Lieth still.
  Unto him the night has come,
  Though they roll the morning drum.
  What is in the bugle's blast?
  It is: "Victory at last!
      Now for rest."
  But, my comrades, come behold him,
  Where our colors now enfold him,
      And his breast
  Bares no more to meet the blade,
  But lies covered in the shade.
  What a stir there is to-day!
  They are laying him away
      Where he fell.
  There the flag goes draped before him;
  Now they pile the grave sod o'er him
      With a knell.
  And he answers to his name
  In the higher ranks of fame.
  There's a woman left to mourn
  For the child that she has borne
      In travail.
  But her heart beats high and higher,
  With the patriot mother's fire,
      At the tale.
  She has borne and lost a son,
  But her work and his are done.
  Fling the flag out, let it wave;
  They 're returning from the grave--
      "Double quick!"
  And the cymbals now are crashing,
  Bright his comrades' eyes are flashing
      From the thick
  Battle-ranks which knew him brave,
  No tears for a hero's grave.
  In the east the morning comes,
  Hear the rattle of the drums
      Far away.
  Now no time for grief's pursuing,
  Other work is for the doing,
      Here to-day.
  He is sleeping, let him rest
  With the flag across his breast.
A FROLIC
  Swing yo' lady roun' an' roun',
    Do de bes' you know;

LOVE'S CASTLE
  Key and bar, key and bar,
    Iron bolt and chain!
  And what will you do when the King comes
    To enter his domain?
  Turn key and lift bar,
    Loose, oh, bolt and chain!
  Open the door and let him in,
    And then lock up again.
  But, oh, heart, and woe, heart,
    Why do you ache so sore?
  Never a moment's peace have you
    Since Love hath passed the door.
  Turn key and lift bar,
   And loose bolt and chain;
  But Love took in his esquire, Grief,
   And there they both remain.
MORNING SONG OF LOVE
  Darling, my darling, my heart is on the wing,
    It flies to thee this morning like a bird,
  Like happy birds in springtime my spirits soar and sing,
   The same sweet song thine ears have often heard.
  The sun is in my window, the shadow on the lea,
    The wind is moving in the branches green,
  And all my life, my darling, is turning unto thee,
    And kneeling at thy feet, my own, my queen.
  The golden bells are ringing across the distant hill,
    Their merry peals come to me soft and clear,
  But in my heart's deep chapel all incense-filled and still
    A sweeter bell is sounding for thee, dear.
  The bell of love invites thee to come and seek the shrine
    Whose altar is erected unto thee,
  The offerings, the sacrifice, the prayers, the chants are thine,
    And I, my love, thy humble priest will be.
ON A CLEAN BOOK
TO F. N.
  Like sea-washed sand upon the shore,
    So fine and clean the tale,
  So clear and bright I almost see,
    The flashing of a sail.
  The tang of salt is in its veins,
    The freshness of the spray
  God give you love and lore and strength,
    To give us such alway.
TO THE EASTERN SHORE
  I 's feelin' kin' o' lonesome in my little room to-night,
    An' my min 's done los' de minutes an' de miles,
  Wile it teks me back a-flyin' to de country of delight,
    Whaih de Chesapeake goes grumblin' er wid smiles.
      Oh, de ol' plantation 's callin' to me, Come, come back,
    Hyeah 's de place fu' you to labouh an' to res',
      'Fu my sandy roads is gleamin' w'ile de city ways is black;
    Come back, honey, case yo' country home is bes'.
  I know de moon is shinin' down erpon de Eastern sho',
    An' de bay 's a-sayin' "Howdy" to de lan';
  An' de folks is all a-settin' out erroun' de cabin do',
    Wid dey feet a-restin' in de silvah san';
      An' de ol' plantation 's callin' to me, Come, oh, come,
    F'om de life dat 's des' a-waihin' you erway,
      F'om de trouble an' de bustle, an' de agernizin' hum

  Whaih we draws a simple livin' f'om de fo'est an' de tide,
    An' de days ah faih, an' evah night is sweet.
      Fu' de ol' plantation 's callin' to me, Come, oh, come.
    An' de Chesapeake 's a-sayin' "Dat's de t'ing,"
      W'ile my little cabin beckons, dough his mouf is closed an' dumb,
    I 's a-comin, an' my hea't begins to sing.

BALLADE
  By Mystic's banks I held my dream.
    (I held my fishing rod as well,)
  The vision was of dace and bream,
    A fruitless vision, sooth to tell.
    But round about the sylvan dell
  Were other sweet Arcadian shrines,
    Gone now, is all the rural spell,
  Arcadia has trolley lines.
  Oh, once loved, sluggish, darkling stream,
    For me no more, thy waters swell,
  Thy music now the engines' scream,
    Thy fragrance now the factory's smell;
    Too near for me the clanging bell;
  A false light in the water shines
    While Solitude lists to her knell,--
  Arcadia has trolley lines.
  Thy wooded lanes with shade and gleam
    Where bloomed the fragrant asphodel,
  Now bleak commercially teem
    With signs "To Let," "To Buy," "To Sell."
    And Commerce holds them fierce and fell;
  With vulgar sport she now combines
    Sweet Nature's piping voice to quell.
  Arcadia has trolley lines.
L'ENVOI.
  Oh, awful Power whose works repel
    The marvel of the earth's designs,--
  I 'll hie me otherwhere to dwell,
    Arcadia has trolley lines.
SPEAKIN' AT DE COU'T-HOUSE
  Dey been speakin' at de cou't-house,
    An' laws-a-massy me,
  'T was de beatness kin' o' doin's
    Dat evah I did see.
  Of cose I had to be dah
    In de middle o' de crowd,
  An' I hallohed wid de othahs,
    Wen de speakah riz and bowed.
  I was kind o' disapp'inted
    At de smallness of de man,
  Case I 'd allus pictered great folks
    On a mo' expansive plan;
  But I t'ought I could respect him
    An' tek in de wo'ds he said,
  Fu' dey sho was somp'n knowin'
    In de bald spot on his haid.
  But hit did seem so't o' funny
    Aftah waitin' fu' a week
  Dat de people kep' on shoutin'
    So de man des could n't speak;
  De ho'ns dey blared a little,
    Den dey let loose on de drums,--.
  Some one toll me dey was playin'
    "See de conkerin' hero comes."
  "Well," says I, "you all is white folks,
    But you 's sutny actin' queer,
  What's de use of heroes comin'
    Ef dey cain't talk w'en dey's here?"
  Aftah while dey let him open,
    An' dat man he waded in,
  An' he fit de wahs all ovah
    Winnin' victeries lak sin.
  Wen he come down to de present,
    Den he made de feathahs fly.
  He des waded in on money,
    An' he played de ta'iff high.
  An' he said de colah question,
    Hit was ovah, solved, an' done,
  Dat de dahky was his brothah,
    Evah blessed mothah's son.
  Well he settled all de trouble
    Dat's been pesterin' de lan',
  Den he set down mid de cheerin'
    An' de playin' of de ban'.
  I was feelin' moughty happy
    'Twell I hyeahed somebody speak,
  "Well, dat's his side of de bus'ness,
    But you wait for Jones nex' week."
BLACK SAMSON OF BRANDYWINE
   "In the fight at Brandywine, Black Samson, a giant negro armed with
   a scythe, sweeps his way through the red ranks...." C. M. Skinner's
   "_Myths and Legends of Our Own Land_."
  Gray are the pages of record,
    Dim are the volumes of eld;
  Else had old Delaware told us
    More that her history held.
  Told us with pride in the story,
    Honest and noble and fine,
  More of the tale of my hero,
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
  Sing of your chiefs and your nobles,
    Saxon and Celt and Gaul,
  Breath of mine ever shall join you,
    Highly I honor them all.
  Give to them all of their glory,
    But for this noble of mine,
  Lend him a tithe of your tribute,
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
  There in the heat of the battle,
    There in the stir of the fight,
  Loomed he, an ebony giant,
    Black as the pinions of night.
  Swinging his scythe like a mower
    Over a field of grain,
  Needless the care of the gleaners,
    Where he had passed amain.
  Straight through the human harvest,
    Cutting a bloody swath,
  Woe to you, soldier of Briton!
    Death is abroad in his path.
  Flee from the scythe of the reaper,
    Flee while the moment is thine,
  None may with safety withstand him,
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
  Was he a freeman or bondman?
    Was he a man or a thing?
  What does it matter? His brav'ry
    Renders him royal--a king.
  If he was only a chattel,
    Honor the ransom may pay
  Of the royal, the loyal black giant
    Who fought for his country that day.
  Noble and bright is the story,
    Worthy the touch of the lyre,
  Sculptor or poet should find it
    Full of the stuff to inspire.
  Beat it in brass and in copper,
    Tell it in storied line,
  So that the world may remember
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
THE LOOKING-GLASS
  Dinah stan' befo' de glass,
    Lookin' moughty neat,
  An' huh purty shadder sass
    At huh haid an' feet.
  While she sasshay 'roun' an' bow,
  Smilin' den an' poutin' now,
  An' de lookin'-glass, I 'low,
    Say: "Now, ain't she sweet?"
  All she do, de glass it see,
    Hit des see, no mo',
  Seems to me, hit ought to be
    Drappin' on de flo'.
  She go w'en huh time git slack,
  Kissin' han's an' smilin' back,
  Lawsy, how my lips go smack,
    Watchin' at de do'.
  Wisht I was huh lookin'-glass,
    Wen she kissed huh han';
  Does you t'ink I 'd let it pass,
    Settin' on de stan'?
  No; I'd des' fall down an' break,
  Kin' o' glad 't uz fu' huh sake;
  But de diffunce, dat whut make
    Lookin'-glass an' man.
A MISTY DAY
  Heart of my heart, the day is chill,
  The mist hangs low o'er the wooded hill,
  The soft white mist and the heavy cloud
  The sun and the face of heaven shroud.
  The birds are thick in the dripping trees,
  That drop their pearls to the beggar breeze;
  No songs are rife where songs are wont,
  Each singer crouches in his haunt.
  Heart of my heart, the day is chill,
  Whene'er thy loving voice is still,
  The cloud and mist hide the sky from me,
  Whene'er thy face I cannot see.
  My thoughts fly back from the chill without,
  My mind in the storm drops doubt on doubt,
  No songs arise. Without thee, love,
  My soul sinks down like a frightened dove.
LI'L' GAL
  Oh, de weathah it is balmy an' de breeze is sighin' low.
          Li'l' gal,
  An' de mockin' bird is singin' in de locus' by de do',
          Li'l' gal;
  Dere 's a hummin' an' a bummin' in de lan' f'om eas' to wes',
  I 's a-sighin' fu' you, honey, an' I nevah know no res'.
  Fu' dey 's lots o' trouble brewin' an' a-stewin' in my breas',
          Li'l' gal.
  Whut 's de mattah wid de weathah, whut's de mattah wid de breeze,
          Li'l' gal?
  Whut 's de mattah wid de locus' dat 's a-singin' in de trees,
          Li'l' gal?
  W'y dey knows dey ladies love 'em, an' dey knows dey love 'em true,
  An' dey love 'em back, I reckon, des' lak I 's a-lovin' you;
  Dat 's de reason dey 's a-weavin' an' a-sighin', thoo an' thoo,
          Li'l' gal.
  Don't you let no da'ky fool you 'cause de clo'es he waihs is fine,
          Li'l' gal.
  Dey 's a hones' hea't a-beatin' unnerneaf dese rags o' mine,
          Li'l' gal.
  Cose dey ain' no use in mockin' whut de birds an' weathah do,
  But I 's so'y I cain't 'spress it w'en I knows I loves you true,
  Dat 's de reason I 's a-sighin' an' a-singin now fu' you,
          Li'l' gal.
DOUGLASS
  Ah, Douglass, we have fall'n on evil days,
    Such days as thou, not even thou didst know,
    When thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago
  Saw, salient, at the cross of devious ways,
  And all the country heard thee with amaze.
    Not ended then, the passionate ebb and flow,
    The awful tide that battled to and fro;
  We ride amid a tempest of dispraise.
  Now, when the waves of swift dissension swarm,
    And Honor, the strong pilot, lieth stark,
  Oh, for thy voice high-sounding o'er the storm,
    For thy strong arm to guide the shivering bark,
  The blast-defying power of thy form,
    To give us comfort through the lonely dark.
WHEN SAM'L SINGS
  Hyeah dat singin' in de medders
    Whaih de folks is mekin' hay?
  Wo'k is pretty middlin' heavy
    Fu' a man to be so gay.
  You kin tell dey 's somep'n special
    F'om de canter o' de song;
  Somep'n sholy pleasin' Sam'l,
    W'en he singin' all day long.
  Hyeahd him wa'blin' 'way dis mo'nin'
    'Fo' 't was light enough to see.
  Seem lak music in de evenin'
    Allus good enough fu' me.
  But dat man commenced to hollah
    'Fo' he 'd even washed his face;
  Would you b'lieve, de scan'lous rascal
    Woke de birds erroun' de place?
  Sam'l took a trip a-Sad'day;
    Dressed hisse'f in all he had,
  Tuk a cane an' went a-strollin',
    Lookin' mighty pleased an' glad.
  Some folks don' know whut de mattah,
    But I do, you bet yo' life;
  Sam'l smilin' an' a-singin'
    'Case he been to see his wife.
  She live on de fu' plantation,
    Twenty miles erway er so;
  But huh man is mighty happy
    Wen he git de chanst to go.
  Walkin' allus ain' de nices'--
    Mo'nin' fin's him on de way--
  But he allus comes back smilin',
    Lak his pleasure was his pay.
  Den he do a heap o' talkin',
    Do' he mos'ly kin' o' still,
  But de wo'ds, dey gits to runnin'
    Lak de watah fu' a mill.
  "Whut 's de use o' havin' trouble,
    Whut 's de use o' havin' strife?"
  Dat 's de way dis Sam'l preaches
    W'en he been to see his wife.
  An' I reckon I git jealous,
    Fu' I laff an' joke an' sco'n,
  An' I say, "Oh, go on, Sam'l,
    Des go on, an' blow yo' ho'n."
  But I know dis comin' Sad'day,
    Dey 'll be brighter days in life;
  An' I 'll be ez glad ez Sam'l
    W'en I go to see my wife.
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON
  The word is writ that he who runs may read.
  What is the passing breath of earthly fame?
  But to snatch glory from the hands of blame--
  That is to be, to live, to strive indeed.
  A poor Virginia cabin gave the seed,
  And from its dark and lowly door there came
  A peer of princes in the world's acclaim,
  A master spirit for the nation's need.
  Strong, silent, purposeful beyond his kind,
    The mark of rugged force on brow and lip,
  Straight on he goes, nor turns to look behind
    Where hot the hounds come baying at his hip;
  With one idea foremost in his mind,
    Like the keen prow of some on-forging ship.
THE MONK'S WALK
  In this sombre garden close
  What has come and passed, who knows?
  What red passion, what white pain
  Haunted this dim walk in vain?
  Underneath the ivied wall,
  Where the silent shadows fall,
  Lies the pathway chill and damp
  Where the world-quit dreamers tramp.
  Just across, where sunlight burns,
  Smiling at the mourning ferns,
  Stand the roses, side by side,
  Nodding in their useless pride.
  Ferns and roses, who shall say
  What you witness day by day?
  Covert smile or dropping eye,
  As the monks go pacing by.
  Has the novice come to-day
  Here beneath the wall to pray?
  Has the young monk, lately chidden,
  Sung his lyric, sweet, forbidden?
  Tell me, roses, did you note
  That pale father's throbbing throat?
  Did you hear him murmur, "Love!"
  As he kissed a faded glove?
  Mourning ferns, pray tell me why
  Shook you with that passing sigh?
  Is it that you chanced to spy
  Something in the Abbot's eye?
  Here no dream, nor thought of sin,
  Where no worlding enters in;
  Here no longing, no desire,
  Heat nor flame of earthly fire.
  Branches waving green above,
  Whisper naught of life nor love;
  Softened winds that seem a breath,
  Perfumed, bring no fear of death.
  Is it living thus to live?
  Has life nothing more to give?
  Ah, no more of smile or sigh--
  Life, the world, and love, good-bye.
  Gray, and passionless, and dim,
  Echoing of the solemn hymn,
  Lies the walk, 'twixt fern and rose,
  Here within the garden close.
LOVE-SONG
  If Death should claim me for her own to-day,
    And softly I should falter from your side,
  Oh, tell me, loved one, would my memory stay,
    And would my image in your heart abide?
  Or should I be as some forgotten dream,
    That lives its little space, then fades entire?
  Should Time send o'er you its relentless stream,
    To cool your heart, and quench for aye love's fire?
  I would not for the world, love, give you pain,
    Or ever compass what would cause you grief;
  And, oh, how well I know that tears are vain!
    But love is sweet, my dear, and life is brief;
  So if some day before you I should go
    Beyond the sound and sight of song and sea,
  'T would give my spirit stronger wings to know
    That you remembered still and wept for me.
SLOW THROUGH THE DARK
  Slow moves the pageant of a climbing race;
    Their footsteps drag far, far below the height,
    And, unprevailing by their utmost might,
  Seem faltering downward from each hard won place.
  No strange, swift-sprung exception we; we trace
    A devious way thro' dim, uncertain light,--
    Our hope, through the long vistaed years, a sight
  Of that our Captain's soul sees face to face.
    Who, faithless, faltering that the road is steep,
  Now raiseth up his drear insistent cry?
    Who stoppeth here to spend a while in sleep
  Or curseth that the storm obscures the sky?
    Heed not the darkness round you, dull and deep;
  The clouds grow thickest when the summit's nigh.
THE MURDERED LOVER
  Say a mass for my soul's repose, my brother,
    Say a mass for my soul's repose, I need it,
  Lovingly lived we, the sons of one mother,
    Mine was the sin, but I pray you not heed it.
  Dark were her eyes as the sloe and they called me,
    Called me with voice independent of breath.
  God! how my heart beat; her beauty appalled me,
    Dazed me, and drew to the sea-brink of death.
  Lithe was her form like a willow. She beckoned,
    What could I do save to follow and follow,
  Nothing of right or result could be reckoned;
    Life without her was unworthy and hollow.
  Ay, but I wronged thee, my brother, my brother;
    Ah, but I loved her, thy beautiful wife.
  Shade of our father, and soul of our mother,
    Have I not paid for my love with my life?
  Dark was the night when, revengeful, I met you,
    Deep in the heart of a desolate land.
  Warm was the life-blood which angrily wet you
    Sharp was the knife that I felt from your hand.
  Wept you, oh, wept you, alone by the river,
    When my stark carcass you secretly sank.
  Ha, now I see that you tremble and shiver;
    'T was but my spirit that passed when you shrank!
  Weep not, oh, weep not, 't is over, 't is over;
    Stir the dark weeds with the turn of the tide;
  Go, thou hast sent me forth, ever a rover,
    Rest and the sweet realm of heaven denied.
  Say a mass for my soul's repose, my brother,
    Say a mass for my soul, I need it.
  Sin of mine was it, and sin of no other,
    Mine was it all, but I pray you not heed it.
PHILOSOPHY
  I been t'inkin' 'bout de preachah; whut he said de othah night,
    'Bout hit bein' people's dooty, fu' to keep dey faces bright;
  How one ought to live so pleasant dat ouah tempah never riles,
    Meetin' evahbody roun' us wid ouah very nicest smiles.
  Dat 's all right, I ain't a-sputin' not a t'ing dat soun's lak fac',
    But you don't ketch folks a-grinnin' wid a misery in de back;
  An' you don't fin' dem a-smilin' w'en dey 's hongry ez kin be,
    Leastways, dat 's how human natur' allus seems to 'pear to me.
  We is mos' all putty likely fu' to have our little cares,
    An' I think we 'se doin' fus' rate w'en we jes' go long and bears,
  Widout breakin' up ouah faces in a sickly so't o' grin,
    W'en we knows dat in ouah innards we is p'intly mad ez sin.
  Oh dey 's times fu' bein' pleasant an' fu' goin' smilin' roun',
    'Cause I don't believe in people allus totin' roun' a frown,
  But it's easy 'nough to titter w'en de stew is smokin' hot,
    But hit's mighty ha'd to giggle w'en dey's nuffin' in de pot.
A PREFERENCE
  Mastah drink his ol' Made'a,
    Missy drink huh sherry wine,
  Ovahseah lak his whiskey,
    But dat othah drink is mine,
      Des' 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  Wen you git a steamin' hoe-cake
    On de table, go way, man!
  'D ain but one t'ing to go wid it,
    'Sides de gravy in de pan,
      Dat 's 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  W'en hit 's 'possum dat you eatin',
    'Simmon beer is moughty sweet;
  But fu' evahday consumin'
    'D ain't no mo'tal way to beat
      Des' 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  W'y de bees is allus busy,
    An' ain' got no time to was'?
  Hit's beca'se dey knows de honey
    Dey 's a makin', gwine to tas'
      Lak 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  Oh, hit 's moughty mil' an' soothin',
    An' hit don' go to yo' haid;
  Dat 's de reason I 's a-backin'
    Up de othah wo'ds I said,
      "Des 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah."
THE DEBT
  This is the debt I pay
  Just for one riotous day,
  Years of regret and grief,
  Sorrow without relief.
  Pay it I will to the end--
  Until the grave, my friend,
  Gives me a true release--
  Gives me the clasp of peace.
  Slight was the thing I bought,
  Small was the debt I thought,
  Poor was the loan at best--
  God! but the interest!
ON THE DEDICATION OF DOROTHY HALL
TUSKEGEE, ALA., APRIL 22, 1901.
  Not to the midnight of the gloomy past,
    Do we revert to-day; we look upon
  The golden present and the future vast
    Whose vistas show us visions of the dawn.
  Nor shall the sorrows of departed years
    The sweetness of our tranquil souls annoy,
  The sunshine of our hopes dispels the tears,
    And clears our eyes to see this later joy.
  Not ever in the years that God hath given
    Have we gone friendless down the thorny way,
  Always the clouds of pregnant black were riven
    By flashes from His own eternal day.
  The women of a race should be its pride;
    We glory in the strength our mothers had,
  We glory that this strength was not denied
    To labor bravely, nobly, and be glad.
  God give to these within this temple here,
    Clear vision of the dignity of toil,
  That virtue in them may its blossoms rear
    Unspotted, fragrant, from the lowly soil.
  God bless the givers for their noble deed,
    Shine on them with the mercy of Thy face,
  Who come with open hearts to help and speed
    The striving women of a struggling race.
A ROADWAY
  Let those who will stride on their barren roads
  And prick themselves to haste with self-made goads,
  Unheeding, as they struggle day by day,
  If flowers be sweet or skies be blue or gray:
  For me, the lone, cool way by purling brooks,
  The solemn quiet of the woodland nooks,
  A song-bird somewhere trilling sadly gay,
  A pause to pick a flower beside the way.
BY RUGGED WAYS
  By rugged ways and thro' the night
  We struggle blindly toward the light;
  And groping, stumbling, ever pray
  For sight of long delaying day.
  The cruel thorns beside the road
  Stretch eager points our steps to goad,
  And from the thickets all about
  Detaining hands reach threatening out.
  "Deliver us, oh, Lord," we cry,
  Our hands uplifted to the sky.
  No answer save the thunder's peal,
  And onward, onward, still we reel.
  "Oh, give us now thy guiding light;"
  Our sole reply, the lightning's blight.
  "Vain, vain," cries one, "in vain we call;"
  But faith serene is over all.
  Beside our way the streams are dried,
  And famine mates us side by side.
  Discouraged and reproachful eyes
  Seek once again the frowning skies.
  Yet shall there come, spite storm and shock,
  A Moses who shall smite the rock,
  Call manna from the Giver's hand,
  And lead us to the promised land!
  The way is dark and cold and steep,
  And shapes of horror murder sleep,
  And hard the unrelenting years;
  But 'twixt our sighs and moans and tears,
  We still can smile, we still can sing,
  Despite the arduous journeying.
  For faith and hope their courage lend,
  And rest and light are at the end.
LOVE'S SEASONS
  When the bees are humming in the honeysuckle vine
    And the summer days are in their bloom,
  Then my love is deepest, oh, dearest heart of mine,
  When the bees are humming in the honeysuckle vine.
  When the winds are moaning o'er the meadows chill and gray,
    And the land is dim with winter gloom,
  Then for thee, my darling, love will have its way,
  When the winds are moaning o'er the meadows chill and gray.
  In the vernal dawning with the starting of the leaf,
    In the merry-chanting time of spring,
  Love steals all my senses, oh, the happy-hearted thief!
  In the vernal morning with the starting of the leaf.
  Always, ever always, even in the autumn drear,
    When the days are sighing out their grief,
  Thou art still my darling, dearest of the dear,
  Always, ever always, even in the autumn drear.
TO A DEAD FRIEND
  It is as if a silver chord
    Were suddenly grown mute,
  And life's song with its rhythm warred
    Against a silver lute.
  It is as if a silence fell
    Where bides the garnered sheaf,
  And voices murmuring, "It is well,"
    Are stifled by our grief.
  It is as if the gloom of night
    Had hid a summer's day,
  And willows, sighing at their plight,
    Bent low beside the way.
  For he was part of all the best
    That Nature loves and gives,
  And ever more on Memory's breast
    He lies and laughs and lives.
TO THE SOUTH
ON ITS NEW SLAVERY
  Heart of the Southland, heed me pleading now,
  Who bearest, unashamed, upon my brow
  The long kiss of the loving tropic sun,
  And yet, whose veins with thy red current run.
  Borne on the bitter winds from every hand,
  Strange tales are flying over all the land,
  And Condemnation, with his pinions foul,
  Glooms in the place where broods the midnight owl.
  What art thou, that the world should point at thee,
  And vaunt and chide the weakness that they see?
  There was a time they were not wont to chide;
  Where is thy old, uncompromising pride?
  Blood-washed, thou shouldst lift up thine honored head,
  White with the sorrow for thy loyal dead
  Who lie on every plain, on every hill,
  And whose high spirit walks the Southland still:
  Whose infancy our mother's hands have nursed.
  Thy manhood, gone to battle unaccursed,
  Our fathers left to till th' reluctant field,
  To rape the soil for what she would not yield;
  Wooing for aye, the cold unam'rous sod,
  Whose growth for them still meant a master's rod;
  Tearing her bosom for the wealth that gave
  The strength that made the toiler still a slave.
  Too long we hear the deep impassioned cry
  That echoes vainly to the heedless sky;
  Too long, too long, the Macedonian call
  Falls fainting far beyond the outward wall,
  Within whose sweep, beneath the shadowing trees,
  A slumbering nation takes its dangerous ease;
  Too long the rumors of thy hatred go
  For those who loved thee and thy children so.
  Thou must arise forthwith, and strong, thou must
  Throw off the smirching of this baser dust,
  Lay by the practice of this later creed,
  And be thine honest self again indeed.
  There was a time when even slavery's chain
  Held in some joys to alternate with pain,
  Some little light to give the night relief,
  Some little smiles to take the place of grief.
  There was a time when, jocund as the day,
  The toiler hoed his row and sung his lay,
  Found something gleeful in the very air,
  And solace for his toiling everywhere.
  Now all is changed, within the rude stockade,
  A bondsman whom the greed of men has made
  Almost too brutish to deplore his plight,
  Toils hopeless on from joyless morn till night.
  For him no more the cabin's quiet rest,
  The homely joys that gave to labor zest;
  No more for him the merry banjo's sound,
  Nor trip of lightsome dances footing round.
  For him no more the lamp shall glow at eve,
  Nor chubby children pluck him by the sleeve;
  No more for him the master's eyes be bright,--
  He has nor freedom's nor a slave's delight.
  What, was it all for naught, those awful years
  That drenched a groaning land with blood and tears?
  Was it to leave this sly convenient hell,
  That brother fighting his own brother fell?
  When that great struggle held the world in awe,
  And all the nations blanched at what they saw,
  Did Sanctioned Slavery bow its conquered head
  That this unsanctioned crime might rise instead?
  Is it for this we all have felt the flame,--
  This newer bondage and this deeper shame?
  Nay, not for this, a nation's heroes bled,
  And North and South with tears beheld their dead.
  Oh, Mother South, hast thou forgot thy ways,
  Forgot the glory of thine ancient days,
  Forgot the honor that once made thee great,
  And stooped to this unhallowed estate?
  It cannot last, thou wilt come forth in might,
  A warrior queen full armored for the fight;
  And thou wilt take, e'en with thy spear in rest,
  Thy dusky children to thy saving breast.
  Till then, no more, no more the gladsome song,
  Strike only deeper chords, the notes of wrong;
  Till then, the sigh, the tear, the oath, the moan,
  Till thou, oh, South, and thine, come to thine own.
THE HAUNTED OAK
  Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
    Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
  And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
    Runs a shudder over me?
  My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
    And sap ran free in my veins,
  But I saw in the moonlight dim and weird
    A guiltless victim's pains.
  I bent me down to hear his sigh;
    I shook with his gurgling moan,
  And I trembled sore when they rode away,
    And left him here alone.
  They 'd charged him with the old, old crime,
    And set him fast in jail:
  Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
    And why does the night wind wail?
  He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
    And he raised his hand to the sky;
  But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
    And the steady tread drew nigh.
  Who is it rides by night, by night,
    Over the moonlit road?
  And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
    What is the galling goad?
  And now they beat at the prison door,
    "Ho, keeper, do not stay!
  We are friends of him whom you hold within,
    And we fain would take him away
  "From those who ride fast on our heels
    With mind to do him wrong;
  They have no care for his innocence,
    And the rope they bear is long."
  They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
    They have fooled the man with lies;
  The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
    And the great door open flies.
  Now they have taken him from the jail,
    And hard and fast they ride,
  And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
    As they halt my trunk beside.
  Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
    And the doctor one of white,
  And the minister, with his oldest son,
    Was curiously bedight.
  Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
    'Tis but a little space,
  And the time will come when these shall dread
    The mem'ry of your face.
  I feel the rope against my bark,
    And the weight of him in my grain,
  I feel in the throe of his final woe
    The touch of my own last pain.
  And never more shall leaves come forth
    On a bough that bears the ban;
  I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
    From the curse of a guiltless man.
  And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
    And goes to hunt the deer,
  And ever another rides his soul
    In the guise of a mortal fear.
  And ever the man he rides me hard,
    And never a night stays he;
  For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,
    On the trunk of a haunted tree.
WELTSCHMERTZ
  You ask why I am sad to-day,
  I have no cares, no griefs, you say?
  Ah, yes, 't is true, I have no grief--
  But--is there not the falling leaf?
  The bare tree there is mourning left
  With all of autumn's gray bereft;
  It is not what has happened me,
  Think of the bare, dismantled tree.
  The birds go South along the sky,
  I hear their lingering, long good-bye.
  Who goes reluctant from my breast?
  And yet--the lone and wind-swept nest.
  The mourning, pale-flowered hearse goes by,
  Why does a tear come to my eye?
  Is it the March rain blowing wild?
  I have no dead, I know no child.
  I am no widow by the bier
  Of him I held supremely dear.
  I have not seen the choicest one
  Sink down as sinks the westering sun.
  Faith unto faith have I beheld,
  For me, few solemn notes have swelled;
  Love bekoned me out to the dawn,
  And happily I followed on.
  And yet my heart goes out to them
  Whose sorrow is their diadem;
  The falling leaf, the crying bird,
  The voice to be, all lost, unheard--
  Not mine, not mine, and yet too much
  The thrilling power of human touch,
  While all the world looks on and scorns
  I wear another's crown of thorns.
  Count me a priest who understands
  The glorious pain of nail-pierced hands;
  Count me a comrade of the thief
  Hot driven into late belief.
  Oh, mother's tear, oh, father's sigh,
  Oh, mourning sweetheart's last good-bye,
  I yet have known no mourning save
  Beside some brother's brother's grave.
ROBERT GOULD SHAW
  Why was it that the thunder voice of Fate
    Should call thee, studious, from the classic groves,
    Where calm-eyed Pallas with still footstep roves,
  And charge thee seek the turmoil of the state?
  What bade thee hear the voice and rise elate,
    Leave home and kindred and thy spicy loaves,
    To lead th' unlettered and despised droves
  To manhood's home and thunder at the gate?
  Far better the slow blaze of Learning's light,
    The cool and quiet of her dearer fane,
  Than this hot terror of a hopeless fight,
    This cold endurance of the final pain,--
  Since thou and those who with thee died for right
    Have died, the Present teaches, but in vain!
ROSES
  Oh, wind of the spring-time, oh, free wind of May,
    When blossoms and bird-song are rife;
  Oh, joy for the season, and joy for the day,
    That gave me the roses of life, of life,
    That gave me the roses of life.
  Oh, wind of the summer, sing loud in the night,
    When flutters my heart like a dove;
  One came from thy kingdom, thy realm of delight,
    And gave me the roses of love, of love,
    And gave me the roses of love.
  Oh, wind of the winter, sigh low in thy grief,
    I hear thy compassionate breath;
  I wither, I fall, like the autumn-kissed leaf,
   He gave me the roses of death, of death,
   He gave me the roses of death.
A LOVE SONG
  Ah, love, my love is like a cry in the night,
  A long, loud cry to the empty sky,
  The cry of a man alone in the desert,
  With hands uplifted, with parching lips,
  Oh, rescue me, rescue me,
  Thy form to mine arms,
  The dew of thy lips to my mouth,
  Dost thou hear me?--my call thro' the night?
  Darling, I hear thee and answer,
  Thy fountain am I,
  All of the love of my soul will I bring to thee,
  All of the pains of my being shall wring to thee,
  Deep and forever the song of my loving shall sing to thee,
  Ever and ever thro' day and thro' night shall I cling to thee.
  Hearest thou the answer?
  Darling, I come, I come.

TO AN INGRATE
  This is to-day, a golden summer's day
    And yet--and yet
    My vengeful soul will not forget
  The past, forever now forgot, you say.
  From that half height where I had sadly climbed,
    I stretched my hand,
    I lone in all that land,
  Down there, where, helpless, you were limed.
  Our fingers clasped, and dragging me a pace,
    You struggled up.
    It is a bitter Cup,
  That now for naught, you turn away your face.
  I shall remember this for aye and aye.
    Whate'er may come,
    Although my lips are dumb,
  My spirit holds you to that yesterday.
IN THE TENTS OF AKBAR
  In the tents of Akbar
    Are dole and grief to-day,
  For the flower of all the Indies
    Has gone the silent way.
  In the tents of Akbar
    Are emptiness and gloom,
  And where the dancers gather,
    The silence of the tomb.
  Across the yellow desert,
   Across the burning sands,
  Old Akbar wanders madly,
    And wrings his fevered hands.
  And ever makes his moaning
    To the unanswering sky,
  For Sutna, lovely Sutna,
    Who was so fair to die.
  For Sutna danced at morning,
    And Sutna danced at eve;
  Her dusky eyes half hidden
    Behind her silken sleeve.
  Her pearly teeth out-glancing
    Between her coral lips,
  The tremulous rhythm of passion
    Marked by her quivering hips.
  As lovely as a jewel
    Of fire and dewdrop blent,
  So danced the maiden Sutna
    In gallant Akbar's tent.
  And one who saw her dancing,
    Saw her bosom's fall and rise
  Put all his body's yearning
    Into his lovelit eyes.
  Then Akbar came and drove him--
    A jackal--from his door,
  And bade him wander far and look
    On Sutna's face no more.
  Some day the sea disgorges,
    The wilderness gives back,
  Those half-dead who have wandered,
    Aimless, across its track.
  And he returned--the lover,
    Haggard of brow and spent;
  He found fair Sutna standing
    Before her master's tent.
  "Not mine, nor Akbar's, Sutna!"
    He cried and closely pressed,
  And drove his craven dagger
    Straight to the maiden's breast.
  Oh, weep, oh, weep, for Sutna,
    So young, so dear, so fair,
  Her face is gray and silent
    Beneath her dusky hair.
  And wail, oh, wail, for Akbar,
    Who walks the desert sands,
  Crying aloud for Sutna,
    Wringing his fevered hands.
  In the tents of Akbar
    The tears of sorrow run,
  But the corpse of Sutna's slayer,
    Lies rotting in the sun.
THE FOUNT OF TEARS
  All hot and grimy from the road,
    Dust gray from arduous years,
  I sat me down and eased my load
    Beside the Fount of Tears.
  The waters sparkled to my eye,
    Calm, crystal-like, and cool,
  And breathing there a restful sigh,
    I bent me to the pool.
  When, lo! a voice cried: "Pilgrim, rise,
    Harsh tho' the sentence be,
  And on to other lands and skies--
    This fount is not for thee.
  "Pass on, but calm thy needless fears,
    Some may not love or sin,
  An angel guards the Fount of Tears;
    All may not bathe therein."
  Then with my burden on my back
    I turned to gaze awhile,
  First at the uninviting track,
    Then at the water's smile.
  And so I go upon my way,
    Thro'out the sultry years,
  But pause no more, by night, by day,
    Beside the Fount of Tears.
LIFE'S TRAGEDY
  It may be misery not to sing at all
    And to go silent through the brimming day.
  It may be sorrow never to be loved,
    But deeper griefs than these beset the way.
  To have come near to sing the perfect song
    And only by a half-tone lost the key,
  There is the potent sorrow, there the grief,
    The pale, sad staring of life's tragedy.
  To have just missed the perfect love,
    Not the hot passion of untempered youth,
  But that which lays aside its vanity
    And gives thee, for thy trusting worship, truth--
  This, this it is to be accursed indeed;
    For if we mortals love, or if we sing,
  We count our joys not by the things we have,
    But by what kept us from the perfect thing.
DE WAY T'INGS COME
  De way t'ings come, hit seems to me,
  Is des' one monst'ous mystery;
  De way hit seem to strike a man,
  Dey ain't no sense, dey ain't no plan;
  Ef trouble sta'ts a pilin' down,
  It ain't no use to rage er frown,
  It ain't no use to strive er pray,
  Hit's mortal boun' to come dat way.
  Now, ef you 's hongry, an' yo' plate
  Des' keep on sayin' to you, "Wait,"
  Don't mek no diffunce how you feel,
  'T won't do no good to hunt a meal,
  Fu' dat ah meal des' boun' to hide
  Ontwell de devil's satisfied,
  An' 'twell dey's some'p'n by to cyave
  You 's got to ease yo'se'f an' sta've.
  But ef dey 's co'n meal on de she'f
  You need n't bothah 'roun' yo'se'f,
  Somebody's boun' to amble in
  An' 'vite you to dey co'n meal bin;
  An' ef you 's stuffed up to be froat
  Wid co'n er middlin', fowl er shoat,
  Des' look out an' you 'll see fu' sho
  A 'possum faint befo' yo' do'.
  De way t'ings happen, huhuh, chile,
  Dis worl' 's done puzzled me one w'ile;
  I 's mighty skeered I 'll fall in doubt,
  I des' won't try to reason out
  De reason why folks strive an' plan
  A dinnah fu' a full-fed man,
  An' shet de do' an' cross de street
  F'om one dat raaly needs to eat.
NOON
  Shadder in de valley
  Sunlight on de hill,
  Sut'ny wish dat locus'
  Knowed how to be still.
  Don't de heat already
  Mek a body hum,
  'Dout dat insec' sayin'
  Hottah days to come?
  Fiel' 's a shinin' yaller
  Wid de bendin' grain,
  Guinea hen a callin',
  Now's de time fu' rain;
  Shet yo' mouf, you rascal,
  Wha' 's de use to cry?
  You do' see no rain clouds
  Up dah in de sky.
  Dis hyeah sweat's been po'in'
  Down my face sence dawn;
  Ain't hit time we 's hyeahin'

  Go on, Ben an' Jaspah,

  Let dat cradle swing,
  One mo' sweep, den da'kies,

AT THE TAVERN
      A lilt and a swing,
      And a ditty to sing,
    Or ever the night grow old;
      The wine is within,
      And I 'm sure 't were a sin
  For a soldier to choose to be cold, my dear,
  For a soldier to choose to be cold.
      We 're right for a spell,
      But the fever is--well,
    No thing to be braved, at least;
      So bring me the wine;
      No low fever in mine,
  For a drink is more kind than a priest, my dear,
  For a drink is more kind than a priest.
DEATH
  Storm and strife and stress,
  Lost in a wilderness,
  Groping to find a way,
  Forth to the haunts of day
  Sudden a vista peeps,
  Out of the tangled deeps,
  Only a point--the ray
  But at the end is day.
  Dark is the dawn and chill,
  Daylight is on the hill,
  Night is the flitting breath,
  Day rides the hills of death.
NIGHT, DIM NIGHT
  Night, dim night, and it rains, my love, it rains,
    (Art thou dreaming of me, I wonder)
  The trees are sad, and the wind complains,
    Outside the rolling of the thunder,
  And the beat against the panes.
  Heart, my heart, thou art mournful in the rain,
    (Are thy redolent lips a-quiver?)
  My soul seeks thine, doth it seek in vain?
    My love goes surging like a river,
  Shall its tide bear naught save pain?
LYRICS OF LOVE AND SORROW
I
  Love is the light of the world, my dear,
    Heigho, but the world is gloomy;
  The light has failed and the lamp down hurled,
    Leaves only darkness to me.
  Love is the light of the world, my dear,
    Ah me, but the world is dreary;
  The night is down, and my curtain furled
    But I cannot sleep, though weary.
  Love is the light of the world, my dear,
    Alas for a hopeless hoping,
  When the flame went out in the breeze that swirled,
    And a soul went blindly groping.
II
  The light was on the golden sands,
    A glimmer on the sea;
  My soul spoke clearly to thy soul,
    Thy spirit answered me.
  Since then the light that gilds the sands,
    And glimmers on the sea,
  But vainly struggles to reflect
    The radiant soul of thee.
III
  The sea speaks to me of you
    All the day long;
  Still as I sit by its side
    You are its song.
  The sea sings to me of you
    Loud on the reef;
  Always it moans as it sings,
    Voicing my grief.
IV
  My dear love died last night;
    Shall I clothe her in white?
  My passionate love is dead,
    Shall I robe her in red?
  But nay, she was all untrue,
    She shall not go drest in blue;
  Still my desolate love was brave,
    Unrobed let her go to her grave.
V
  There are brilliant heights of sorrow
    That only the few may know;
  And the lesser woes of the world, like waves,
    Break noiselessly, far below.
  I hold for my own possessing,
    A mount that is lone and still--
  The great high place of a hopeless grief,
    And I call it my "Heart-break Hill."
  And once on a winter's midnight
    I found its highest crown,
  And there in the gloom, my soul and I,
    Weeping, we sat us down.
  But now when I seek that summit
    We are two ghosts that go;
  Only two shades of a thing that died,
    Once in the long ago.
  So I sit me down in the silence,
    And say to my soul, "Be still,"
  So the world may not know we died that night,
    From weeping on "Heart-break Hill."
LYRICS OF SUNSHINE AND SHADOW
A BOY'S SUMMER SONG
      'Tis fine to play
      In the fragrant hay,
  And romp on the golden load;
      To ride old Jack
      To the barn and back,
  Or tramp by a shady road.
      To pause and drink,
      At a mossy brink;
  Ah, that is the best of joy,
      And so I say
      On a summer's day,
  What's so fine as being a boy?
          Ha, Ha!
      With line and hook
      By a babbling brook,
  The fisherman's sport we ply;
      And list the song
      Of the feathered throng
  That flit in the branches nigh.
      At last we strip
      For a quiet dip;
  Ah, that is the best of joy.
      For this I say
      On a summer's day,
  What's so fine as being a boy?
          Ha, Ha!
THE SAND-MAN
      I know a man
      With face of tan,
  But who is ever kind;
      Whom girls and boys
      Leaves games and toys
  Each eventide to find.
      When day grows dim,
      They watch for him,
  He comes to place his claim;
      He wears the crown
      Of Dreaming-town;
  The sand-man is his name.
      When sparkling eyes
      Troop sleepywise
  And busy lips grow dumb;
      When little heads
      Nod toward the beds,
  We know the sand-man's come.
JOHNNY SPEAKS
  The sand-man he's a jolly old fellow,
  His face is kind and his voice is mellow,
  But he makes your eyelids as heavy as lead,
  And then you got to go off to bed;
    I don't think I like the sand-man.
  But I've been playing this livelong day;
  It does make a fellow so tired to play!
  Oh, my, I'm a-yawning right here before ma,
  I'm the sleepiest fellow that ever you saw.
    I think I do like the sand-man.
WINTER-SONG
  Oh, who would be sad tho' the sky be a-graying,
    And meadow and woodlands are empty and bare;
  For softly and merrily now there come playing,
    The little white birds thro' the winter-kissed air.
  The squirrel's enjoying the rest of the thrifty,
    He munches his store in the old hollow tree;
  Tho' cold is the blast and the snow-flakes are drifty
    He fears the white flock not a whit more than we.
  _Chorus:_
  Then heigho for the flying snow!
  Over the whitened roads we go,
    With pulses that tingle,
    And sleigh-bells a-jingle
  For winter's white birds here's a cheery heigho!
A CHRISTMAS FOLKSONG
  De win' is blowin' wahmah,
    An hit's blowin' f'om de bay;
  Dey's a so't o' mist a-risin'
    All erlong de meddah way;
  Dey ain't a hint o' frostin'
    On de groun' ner in de sky,
  An' dey ain't no use in hopin'
    Dat de snow'll 'mence to fly.
      It's goin' to be a green Christmas,
        An' sad de day fu' me.
      I wish dis was de las' one
        Dat evah I should see.
  Dey's dancin' in de cabin,
    Dey's spahkin' by de tree;
  But dancin' times an' spahkin'
    Are all done pas' fur me.
  Dey's feastin' in de big house,
    Wid all de windahs wide--
  Is dat de way fu' people
    To meet de Christmas-tide?
      It's goin' to be a green Christmas,
        No mattah what you say.
      Dey's us dat will remembah
        An' grieve de comin' day.
  Dey's des a bref o' dampness
    A-clingin' to my cheek;
  De aih's been dahk an' heavy
    An' threatenin' fu' a week,
  But not wid signs o' wintah,
    Dough wintah'd seem so deah--
  De wintah's out o' season,
    An' Christmas eve is heah.
      It's goin' to be a green Christmas,
        An' oh, how sad de day!
      Go ax de hongry chu'chya'd,
        An' see what hit will say.
  Dey's Allen on de hillside,
    An' Marfy in de plain;
  Fu' Christmas was like springtime,
    An' come wid sun an' rain.
  Dey's Ca'line, John, an' Susie,
    Wid only dis one lef':
  An' now de curse is comin'
    Wid murder in hits bref.
      It's goin' to be a green Christmas--
        Des hyeah my words an' see:
      Befo' de summah beckons
        Dey's many 'll weep wid me.
THE FOREST GREETING
  Good hunting!--aye, good hunting,
    Wherever the forests call;
  But ever a heart beats hot with fear,
    And what of the birds that fall?
  Good hunting!--aye, good hunting,
    Wherever the north winds blow;
  But what of the stag that calls for his mate?
    And what of the wounded doe?
  Good hunting!--aye, good hunting;
    And ah! we are bold and strong;
  But our triumph call through the forest hall
    Is a brother's funeral song.
  For we are brothers ever,
    Panther and bird and bear;
  Man and the weakest that fear his face,
    Born to the nest or lair.
  Yes, brothers, and who shall judge us?
    Hunters and game are we;
  But who gave the right for me to smite?
    Who boasts when he smiteth me?
  Good hunting!--aye, good hunting,
    And dim is the forest track;
  But the sportsman Death comes striding on:
    Brothers, the way is black.
THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
  Sweetest of the flowers a-blooming
    In the fragrant vernal days
  Is the Lily of the Valley
    With its soft, retiring ways.
  Well, you chose this humble blossom
    As the nurse's emblem flower,
  Who grows more like her ideal
    Every day and every hour.
  Like the Lily of the Valley
    In her honesty and worth,
  Ah, she blooms in truth and virtue
    In the quiet nooks of earth.
  Tho' she stands erect in honor
    When the heart of mankind bleeds,
  Still she hides her own deserving
    In the beauty of her deeds.
  In the silence of the darkness
    Where no eye may see and know,
  There her footsteps shod with mercy,
    And fleet kindness come and go.
  Not amid the sounds of plaudits,
    Nor before the garish day,
  Does she shed her soul's sweet perfume,
    Does she take her gentle way.
  But alike her ideal flower,
    With its honey-laden breath,
  Still her heart blooms forth its beauty
    In the valley shades of death.
ENCOURAGED
    Because you love me I have much achieved,
  Had you despised me then I must have failed,
    But since I knew you trusted and believed,
  I could not disappoint you and so prevailed.
TO J. Q.
  What are the things that make life bright?
    A star gleam in the night.
  What hearts us for the coming fray?
    The dawn tints of the day.
  What helps to speed the weary mile?
    A brother's friendly smile.
  What turns o' gold the evening gray?
    A flower beside the way.
DIPLOMACY
  Tell your love where the roses blow,
    And the hearts of the lilies quiver,
  Not in the city's gleam and glow,
    But down by a half-sunned river.
  Not in the crowded ball-room's glare,
    That would be fatal, Marie, Marie,
  How can she answer you then and there?
    So come then and stroll with me, my dear,
    Down where the birds call, Marie, Marie.
SCAMP
  Ain't it nice to have a mammy
    W'en you kin' o' tiahed out
  Wid a-playin' in de meddah,
    An' a-runnin' roun' about
  Till hit's made you mighty hongry,
    An' yo' nose hit gits to know
  What de smell means dat 's a-comin'
    F'om de open cabin do'?
      She wash yo' face,
      An' mek yo' place,
    You's hongry as a tramp;
  Den hit's eat you suppah right away,
    You sta'vin' little scamp.
  W'en you's full o' braid an' bacon,
    An' dey ain't no mo' to eat,
  An' de lasses dat's a-stickin'

    Fu' to have som'body neah
  Dat'll wipe yo' han's an' kiss you
    Fo' dey lif' you f'om you' cheah?
      To smile so sweet,
      An' wash yo' feet,
    An' leave 'em co'l an' damp;
  Den hit's come let me undress you, now
    You lazy little scamp.
  Don' yo' eyes git awful heavy,
    An' yo' lip git awful slack,
  Ain't dey som'p'n' kin' o' weaknin'
    In de backbone of yo' back?
  Don' yo' knees feel kin' o' trimbly,
    An' yo' head go bobbin' roun',
  W'en you says yo' "Now I lay me,"
    An' is sno'in on de "down"?
      She kiss yo' nose,
      She kiss yo' toes,
    An' den tu'n out de lamp,
  Den hit's creep into yo' trunnel baid,
    You sleepy little scamp.
WADIN' IN DE CRICK
  Days git wa'm an' wa'mah,
    School gits mighty dull,
  Seems lak dese hyeah teachahs
    Mus' feel mussiful.
  Hookey's wrong, I know it
    Ain't no gent'man's trick;
  But de aih's a-callin',
    "Come on to de crick."
  Dah de watah's gu'glin'
    Ovah shiny stones,
  Des hit's ve'y singin'
    Seems to soothe yo' bones.
  Wat's de use o' waitin'
    Go on good an' quick:
  Dain't no fun lak dis hyeah
    Wadin' in de crick.
  W'at dat jay-b'ud sayin'?
    Bettah shet yo' haid,
  Fus' t'ing dat you fin' out,
    You'll be layin' daid.
  Jay-bu'ds sich a tattlah,
    Des seem lak his trick
  Fu' to tell on folkses
    Wadin' in de crick.
  Wilier boughs a-bendin'
    Hidin' of de sky,
  Wavin' kin' o' frien'ly
    Ez de win' go by,
  Elum trees a-shinin',
    Dahk an' green an' thick,
  Seem to say, "I see yo'
    Wadin' in de crick."
  But de trees don' chattah,
    Dey des look an' sigh
  Lak hit's kin' o' peaceful
    Des a-bein' nigh,
  An' yo' t'ank yo' Mastah
    Dat dey trunks is thick
  W'en yo' mammy fin's you

  Den yo' run behin' dem
    Lak yo' scaihed to def,

  But she set down gentle
    An' she drap huh stick,--
  An' fus' t'ing, dey's mammy
    Wadin' in de crick.
THE QUILTING
  Dolly sits a-quilting by her mother, stich by stitch,
  Gracious, how my pulses throb, how my fingers itch,
  While I note her dainty waist and her slender hand,
  As she matches this and that, she stitches strand by strand.
  And I long to tell her Life's a quilt and I'm a patch;
  Love will do the stitching if she'll only be my match.
PARTED
  She wrapped her soul in a lace of lies,
    With a prime deceit to pin it;
  And I thought I was gaining a fearsome prize,
    So I staked my soul to win it.
  We wed and parted on her complaint,
    And both were a bit of barter,
  Tho' I'll confess that I'm no saint,
    I'll swear that she's no martyr.
FOREVER
  I had not known before
    Forever was so long a word.
  The slow stroke of the clock of time
    I had not heard.
  'Tis hard to learn so late;
    It seems no sad heart really learns,
  But hopes and trusts and doubts and fears,
    And bleeds and burns.
  The night is not all dark,
    Nor is the day all it seems,
  But each may bring me this relief--
    My dreams and dreams.
  I had not known before
    That Never was so sad a word,
  So wrap me in forgetfulness--
    I have not heard.
THE PLANTATION CHILD'S LULLABY
  Wintah time hit comin'
    Stealin' thoo de night;
  Wake up in the mo'nin'
    Evah t'ing is white;
  Cabin lookin' lonesome
    Stannin' in de snow,
  Meks you kin' o' nervous,
    Wen de win' hit blow.
  Trompin' back from feedin',

  Ashes on de fiah,

  What's de use o' keerin'
    Ef de win' do blow?
  Smoke house full o' bacon,
    Brown an' sweet an' good;
  Taters in de cellah,
    'Possum roam de wood;
  Little baby snoozin'
    Des ez ef he know.
  What's de use o' keerin'
    Ef de win' do blow?
TWILIGHT
  'Twixt a smile and a tear,
    'Twixt a song and a sigh,
  'Twixt the day and the dark,
    When the night draweth nigh.
  Ah, sunshine may fade
    From the heavens above,
  No twilight have we
    To the day of our love.
CURIOSITY
  Mammy's in de kitchen, an' de do' is shet;
  All de pickaninnies climb an' tug an' sweat,

  Innercent an' p'opah, des lak chillun should

  An' lookin' in dat fathah's face
  An' 'memberin' dis lone sorrerin' place,
  He'll say, "Good Lawd, you ought to had
  Do sumpin' fu' to comfo't dad!"
THE FISHER CHILD'S LULLABY
  The wind is out in its rage to-night,
    And your father is far at sea.
  The rime on the window is hard and white
    But dear, you are near to me.
      Heave ho, weave low,
        Waves of the briny deep;
      Seethe low and breathe low,
        But sleep you, my little one, sleep, sleep.
  The little boat rocks in the cove no more,
    But the flying sea-gulls wail;
  I peer through the darkness that wraps the shore,
    For sight of a home set sail.
      Heave ho, weave low,
        Waves of the briny deep;
      Seethe low and breathe low,
        But sleep you, my little one, sleep, sleep.
  Ay, lad of mine, thy father may die
    In the gale that rides the sea,
  But we'll not believe it, not you and I,
    Who mind us of Galilee.
      Heave ho, weave low,
        Waves of the briny deep;
      Seethe low and breathe low,
        But sleep you, my little one, sleep, sleep.
FAITH
  I's a-gittin' weary of de way dat people do,
  De folks dat's got dey 'ligion in dey fiah-place an' flue;
  Dey's allus somep'n comin' so de spit'll have to turn,
  An' hit tain't no p'oposition fu' to mek de hickory bu'n.
  Ef de sweet pertater fails us an' de go'geous yallah yam,
  We kin tek a bit o' comfo't f'om ouah sto' o' summah jam.
  W'en de snow hit git to flyin', dat's de Mastah's own desiah,
  De Lawd'll run de wintah an' yo' mammy'll run de fiah.
  I ain' skeered because de win' hit staht to raih and blow,
  I ain't bothahed w'en he come er rattlin' at de do',
  Let him taih hisse'f an' shout, let him blow an' bawl,
  Dat's de time de branches shek an' bresh-wood 'mence to fall.
  W'en de sto'm er railin' an' de shettahs blowin' 'bout,
  Dat de time de fiah-place crack hits welcome out.
  Tain' my livin' business fu' to trouble ner enquiah,
  De Lawd'll min' de wintah an' my mammy'll min' de fiah.
  Ash-cake allus gits ez brown w'en February's hyeah

  De bacon smell ez callin'-like, de kittle rock an' sing,
  De same way in de wintah dat dey do it in de spring;
  Dey ain't no use in mopin' 'round an' lookin' mad an' glum
  Erbout de wintah season, fu' hit's des plumb boun' to come;
  An' ef it comes to runnin' t'ings I's willin' to retiah,
  De Lawd'll min' de wintah an' my mammy'll min' de fiah.
THE FARM CHILD'S LULLABY
  Oh, the little bird is rocking in the cradle of the wind,
    And it's bye, my little wee one, bye;
  The harvest all is gathered and the pippins all are binned;
    Bye, my little wee one, bye;
  The little rabbit's hiding in the golden shock of corn,
  The thrifty squirrel's laughing bunny's idleness to scorn;
  You are smiling with the angels in your slumber, smile till morn;
    So it's bye, my little wee one, bye.
  There'll be plenty in the cellar, there'll be plenty on the shelf;
    Bye, my little wee one, bye;
  There'll be goodly store of sweetings for a dainty little elf;
    Bye, my little wee one, bye.
  The snow may be a-flying o'er the meadow and the hill,
  The ice has checked the chatter of the little laughing rill,
  But in your cosey cradle you are warm and happy still;
    So bye, my little wee one, bye.
  Why, the Bob White thinks the snowflake is a brother to his song;
    Bye, my little wee one, bye;
  And the chimney sings the sweeter when the wind is blowing strong;
    Bye, my little wee one, bye;
  The granary's overflowing, full is cellar, crib, and bin,
  The wood has paid its tribute and the ax has ceased its din;
  The winter may not harm you when you're sheltered safe within;
    So bye, my little wee one, bye.
THE PLACE WHERE THE RAINBOW ENDS
  There's a fabulous story
  Full of splendor and glory,
    That Arabian legends transcends;
  Of the wealth without measure,
  The coffers of treasure,
    At the place where the rainbow ends.
  Oh, many have sought it,
  And all would have bought it,
    With the blood we so recklessly spend;
  But none has uncovered,
  The gold, nor discovered
    The spot at the rainbow's end.
  They have sought it in battle,
  And e'en where the rattle
    Of dice with man's blasphemy blends;
  But howe'er persuasive,
  It still proves evasive,
    This place where the rainbow ends.
  I own for my pleasure,
  I yearn not for treasure,
    Though gold has a power it lends;
  And I have a notion,
  To find without motion,
    The place where the rainbow ends.
  The pot may hold pottage,
  The place be a cottage,
    That a humble contentment defends,
  Only joy fills its coffer,
  But spite of the scoffer,
    There's the place where the rainbow ends.
  Where care shall be quiet,
  And love shall run riot,
    And I shall find wealth in my friends;
  Then truce to the story,
  Of riches and glory;
    There's the place where the rainbow ends.
HOPE
  De dog go howlin' 'long de road,
     De night come shiverin' down;
  My back is tiahed of its load,
     I cain't be fu' f'om town.
  No mattah ef de way is long,
  My haht is swellin' wid a song,
     No mattah 'bout de frownin' skies,
     I'll soon be home to see my Lize.
  My shadder staggah on de way,
     It's monstous col' to-night;
  But I kin hyeah my honey say
     "W'y bless me if de sight
  O' you ain't good fu' my so' eyes."
  (Dat talk's dis lak my lady Lize)
     I's so'y case de way was long
     But Lawd you bring me love an' song.
  No mattah ef de way is long,
     An' ef I trimbles so'
  I knows de fiah's burnin' strong,
     Behime my Lizy's do'.
  An' daih my res' an' joy shell be,
  Whaih my ol' wife's awaitin' me--
     Why what I keer fu' stingin' blas',
     I see huh windah light at las'.
APPRECIATION
  My muvver's ist the nicest one
     'At ever lived wiz folks;
  She lets you have ze mostes' fun,
     An' laffs at all your jokes.
  I got a ol' maid auntie, too,
     The worst you ever saw;
  Her eyes ist bore you through and through,--
     She ain't a bit like ma.
  She's ist as slim, as slim can be,
     An' when you want to slide
  Down on ze balusters, w'y she
     Says 'at she's harrified.
  She ain't as nice as Uncle Ben,
     What says 'at little boys
  Won't never grow to be big men
     Unless they're fond of noise.
  But muvver's nicer zan 'em all,
     She calls you, "precious lamb,"
  An' let's you roll your ten-pin ball,
     An' spreads your bread wiz jam.
  An' when you're bad, she ist looks sad,
     You fink she's goin' to cry;
  An' when she don't you're awful glad,
     An' den you're good, Oh, my!
  At night, she takes ze softest hand,
     An' lays it on your head,
  An' says "Be off to Sleepy-Land
     By way o' trundle-bed."
  So when you fink what muvver knows
     An' aunts an' uncle tan't,
  It skeers a feller; ist suppose
     His muvver 'd been a aunt.
A SONG
  On a summer's day as I sat by a stream,
     A dainty maid came by,
  And she blessed my sight like a rosy dream,
     And left me there to sigh, to sigh,
     And left me there to sigh, to sigh.
  On another day as I sat by the stream,
     This maiden paused a while,
  Then I made me bold as I told my dream,
     She heard it with a smile, a smile,
     She heard it with a smile, a smile.
  Oh, the months have fled and the autumn's red,
     The maid no more goes by:
  For my dream came true and the maid I wed,
     And now no more I sigh, I sigh,
     And now no more I sigh.
DAY
  The gray dawn on the mountain top
     Is slow to pass away.
  Still lays him by in sluggish dreams,
     The golden God of day.
  And then a light along the hills,
     Your laughter silvery gay;
  The Sun God wakes, a bluebird trills,
  You come and it is day.
TO DAN
  Step me now a bridal measure,
  Work give way to love and leisure,
  Hearts be free and hearts be gay--
  Doctor Dan doth wed to-day.
  Diagnosis, cease your squalling--
  Check that scalpel's senseless bawling,
  Put that ugly knife away--
  Doctor Dan doth wed to-day.
  'Tis no time for things unsightly,
  Life's the day and life goes lightly;
  Science lays aside her sway--
  Love rules Dr. Dan to-day.
  Gather, gentlemen and ladies,
  For the nuptial feast now made is,
  Swing your garlands, chant your lay
  For the pair who wed to-day.
  Wish them happy days and many,
  Troubles few and griefs not any,
  Lift your brimming cups and say
  God bless them who wed to-day.
  Then a cup to Cupid daring,
  Who for conquest ever faring,
  With his arrows dares assail
  E'en a doctor's coat of mail.
  So with blithe and happy hymning
  And with harmless goblets brimming,
  Dance a step--musicians play--
  Doctor Dan doth wed to-day.
WHAT'S THE USE
  What's the use o' folks a-frownin'
     When the way's a little rough?
  Frowns lay out the road fur smilin'
     You'll be wrinkled soon enough.
        What's the use?
  What's the use o' folks a-sighin'?
     It's an awful waste o' breath,
  An' a body can't stand wastin'
     What he needs so bad in death.
        What's the use?
  What's the use o' even weepin'?
     Might as well go long an' smile.
  Life, our longest, strongest arrow,
     Only lasts a little while.
        What's the use?
A LAZY DAY
  The trees bend down along the stream,
     Where anchored swings my tiny boat.
  The day is one to drowse and dream
     And list the thrush's throttling note.
  When music from his bosom bleeds
  Among the river's rustling reeds.
  No ripple stirs the placid pool,
     When my adventurous line is cast,
  A truce to sport, while clear and cool,
     The mirrored clouds slide softly past.
  The sky gives back a blue divine,
  And all the world's wide wealth is mine.
  A pickerel leaps, a bow of light,
  The minnows shine from side to side.
  The first faint breeze comes up the tide--
  I pause with half uplifted oar,
  While night drifts down to claim the shore.

  Wuss t'ing in de country dat I evah hyahed--
  A crow dot sat a-squawkin', "I's a mockin'-bird."
A GOLDEN DAY
  I found you and I lost you,
    All on a gleaming day.
  The day was rilled with sunshine,
    And the land was full of May.
  A golden bird was singing
    Its melody divine,
  I found you and I loved you,
    And all the world was mine.
  I found you and I lost you,
    All on a golden day,
  But when I dream of you, dear,
    It is always brimming May.
THE UNLUCKY APPLE
  'Twas the apple that in Eden
     Caused our father's primal fall;
  And the Trojan War, remember--
    'Twas an apple caused it all.
  So for weeks I've hesitated,
    You can guess the reason why,
  For I want to tell my darling
    She's the apple of my eye.
THE DISCOVERY
  These are the days of elfs and fays:
  Who says that with the dreams of myth,
  These imps and elves disport themselves?
  Ah no, along the paths of song
  Do all the tiny folk belong.
  Round all our homes,
  Kobolds and gnomes do daily cling,
  Then nightly fling their lanterns out.
  And shout on shout, they join the rout,
  And sing, and sing, within the sweet enchanted ring.
  Where gleamed the guile of moonlight's smile,
  Once paused I, listening for a while,
  And heard the lay, unknown by day,--
  The fairies' dancing roundelay.
  Queen Mab was there, her shimmering hair
  Each fairy prince's heart's despair.
  She smiled to see their sparkling glee,
  And once I ween, she smiled at me.
  Since when, you may by night or day,
  Dispute the sway of elf-folk gay;
  But, hear me, stay!
  I've learned the way to find Queen
     Mab and elf and fay.
  Where e'er by streams, the moonlight gleams,
  Or on a meadow softly beams,
  There, footing round on dew-lit ground,
  The fairy folk may all be found.
MORNING
  The mist has left the greening plain,
  The dew-drops shine like fairy rain,
  The coquette rose awakes again
     Her lovely self adorning.
  The Wind is hiding in the trees,
  A sighing, soothing, laughing tease,
  Until the rose says "Kiss me, please,"
  'Tis morning, 'tis morning.
  With staff in hand and careless-free,
  The wanderer fares right jauntily,
  For towns and houses are, thinks he,
     For scorning, for scorning.
  My soul is swift upon the wing,
  And in its deeps a song I bring;
  Come, Love, and we together sing,
     "'Tis morning, 'tis morning."
THE AWAKENING
  I did not know that life could be so sweet,
  I did not know the hours could speed so fleet,
  Till I knew you, and life was sweet again.
  The days grew brief with love and lack of pain--
  I was a slave a few short days ago,
  The powers of Kings and Princes now I know;
  I would not be again in bondage, save
  I had your smile, the liberty I crave.
LOVE'S DRAFT
  The draft of love was cool and sweet
     You gave me in the cup,
  But, ah, love's fire is keen and fleet,
     And I am burning up.
  Unless the tears I shed for you
     Shall quench this burning flame,
  It will consume me through and through,
     And leave but ash--a name.
A MUSICAL
  Outside the rain upon the street,
    The sky all grim of hue,
  Inside, the music-painful sweet,
    And yet I heard but you.
  As is a thrilling violin,
    So is your voice to me,
  And still above the other strains,
    It sang in ecstasy.
TWELL DE NIGHT IS PAS'
  All de night long twell de moon goes down,
    Lovin' I set at huh feet,
  Den fu' de long jou'ney back f'om de town,
    Ha'd, but de dreams mek it sweet.
  All de night long twell de break of de day,
    Dreamin' agin in my sleep,
  Mandy comes drivin' my sorrers away,
    Axin' me, "Wha' fu' you weep?"
  All de day long twell de sun goes down,
    Smilin', I ben' to my hoe,
  Fu' dough de weddah git nasty an' frown,
    One place I know I kin go.
  All my life long twell de night has pas'
    Let de wo'k come ez it will,
  So dat I fin' you, my honey, at las',
    Somewhaih des ovah de hill.
BLUE
  Standin' at de winder,
    Feelin' kind o' glum,
  Listenin' to de raindrops
    Play de kettle drum,
  Lookin' crost de medders
    Swimmin' lak a sea;
  Lawd 'a' mussy on us,
    What's de good o' me?
  Can't go out a-hoein',
    Wouldn't ef I could;
  Groun' too wet fu' huntin',
    Fishin' ain't no good.
  Too much noise fo' sleepin',
    No one hyeah to chat;
  Des mus' stan' an' listen
    To dat pit-a-pat.
  Hills is gittin' misty,,
    Valley's gittin' dahk;
  Watch-dog's 'mence a-howlin',
    Rathah have 'em ba'k
  Dan a-moanin' solemn
    Somewhaih out o' sight;
  Rain-crow des a-chucklin'--
    Dis is his delight.
  Mandy, bring my banjo,
    Bring de chillen in,
  Come in f'om de kitchen,
     I feel sick ez sin.
  Call in Uncle Isaac,
     Call Aunt Hannah, too,
  Tain't no use in talkin',
     Chile, I's sholy blue.
DREAMIN' TOWN
  Come away to dreamin' town,
    Mandy Lou, Mandy Lou,
  Whaih de skies don' nevah frown,
          Mandy Lou;
  Whaih he streets is paved with gol',
  Whaih de days is nevah col',
  An' no sheep strays f'om de fol',
          Mandy Lou.
  Ain't you tiahed of every day,
    Mandy Lou, Mandy Lou,
  Tek my han' an' come away,
          Mandy Lou,
  To the place whaih dreams is King,
  Whaih my heart hol's everything,
  An' my soul can allus sing,
          Mandy Lou.
  Come away to dream wid me,
    Mandy Lou, Mandy Lou,
  Whaih our hands an' hea'ts are free,
          Mandy Lou;
  Whaih de sands is shinin' white,
  Whaih de rivahs glistens bright,
          Mandy Lou.
  Come away to dreamland town,
    Mandy Lou, Mandy Lou,
  Whaih de fruit is bendin' down,
    Des fu' you.
  Smooth your brow of lovin' brown,
  An' my love will be its crown;
  Come away to dreamin' town,
          Mandy Lou.
AT NIGHT
  Whut time 'd dat clock strike?
        Nine? No--eight;
    I didn't think hit was so late.
  Aer chew! I must 'a' got a cough,
    I raally b'lieve I did doze off--
  Hit's mighty soothin' to de tiah,
    A-dozin' dis way by de fiah;
  Oo oom--hit feels so good to stretch
    I sutny is one weary wretch!
  Look hyeah, dat boy done gone to sleep!
    He des ain't wo'th his boa'd an' keep;
  I des don't b'lieve he'd bat his eyes
    If Gab'el called him fo'm de skies!
  But sleepin's good dey ain't no doubt--
    Dis pipe o' mine is done gone out.
  Don't bu'n a minute, bless my soul,
    Des please to han' me dat ah coal.
  You 'Lias git up now, my son,
    Seems lak my nap is des begun;
  You sutny mus' ma'k down de day
    Wen I treats comp'ny dis away!
  W'y, Brother Jones, dat drowse come on,
   An' laws! I dremp dat you was gone!
  You 'Lias, whaih yo' mannahs, suh,
    To hyeah me call an' nevah stuh!
  To-morrer mo'nin' w'en I call
    Dat boy'll be sleepin' to beat all,
  Don't mek no diffunce how I roah,
    He'll des lay up an' sno' and sno'.
  Now boy, you done hyeahed whut I said,
    You bettah tek yo'se'f yo baid,
  Case ef you gits me good an' wrong
    I'll mek dat sno' a diffunt song.
  Dis wood fiah is invitin' dho',
    Hit seems to wa'm de ve'y flo'--
  An' nuffin' ain't a whit ez sweet,
    Ez settin' toastin' of yo' feet.
  Hit mek you drowsy, too, but La!
    Hyeah, 'Lias, don't you hyeah yo' ma?

  To-morrer mo'nin' I kin bawl
    Twell all de neighbohs hyeah me call;
  An' you'll be snoozin' des ez deep

  Hit's funny when you got a cough
    Somehow yo' voice seems too fu' off--
  Can't wake dat boy fu' all I say,
  I reckon he'll sleep daih twell day!
KIDNAPED
  I held my heart so far from harm,
    I let it wander far and free
  In mead and mart, without alarm,
    Assured it must come back to me.
  And all went well till on a day,
    Learned Dr. Cupid wandered by
  A search along our sylvan way
    For some peculiar butterfly.
  A flash of wings, a hurried dive,
    A flutter and a short-lived flit;
  This Scientist, as I am alive
    Had seen my heart and captured it.
  Right tightly now 'tis held among
    The specimens that he has trapped,
  And sings (Oh, love is ever young),
  'Tis passing sweet to be kidnaped.
COMPENSATION
  Because I had loved so deeply,
    Because I had loved so long,
  God in His great compassion
    Gave me the gift of song.
  Because I have loved so vainly,
    And sung with such faltering breath,
  The Master in infinite mercy
    Offers the boon of Death.
WINTER'S APPROACH
  De sun hit shine an' de win' hit blow,
  Ol' Brer Rabbit be a-layin' low,
    He know dat de wintah time a-comin',
  De huntah man he walk an' wait,
  He walk right by Brer Rabbit's gate--
    He know--
  De dog he lick his sliverin' chop,
  An' he tongue 'gin' his mouf go flop, flop--
    He--
  He rub his nose fu' to clah his scent
  So's to tell w'ich way dat cottontail went,
   He--
  De huntah's wife she set an' spin
    A good wahm coat fu' to wrop him in
    She--
  She look at de skillet an' she smile, oh my!
  An' ol' Brer Rabbit got to sholy fly.
    Dey know.
ANCHORED
  If thro' the sea of night which here surrounds me,
    I could swim out beyond the farthest star,
  Break every barrier of circumstance that bounds me,
    And greet the Sun of sweeter life afar,
  Tho' near you there is passion, grief, and sorrow,
    And out there rest and joy and peace and all,
  I should renounce that beckoning for to-morrow,
    I could not choose to go beyond your call.
THE VETERAN
  Underneath the autumn sky,
  Haltingly, the lines go by.
  Ah, would steps were blithe and gay,
  As when first they marched away,
  Smile on lip and curl on brow,--
  Only white-faced gray-beards now,
  Standing on life's outer verge,
  E'en the marches sound a dirge.
  Blow, you bugles, play, you fife,
  Rattle, drums, for dearest life.
  Let the flags wave freely so,
  As the marching legions go,
  Shout, hurrah and laugh and jest,
  This is memory at its best.
  (Did you notice at your quip,
  That old comrade's quivering lip?)
  Ah, I see them as they come,
  Stumbling with the rumbling drum;
  But a sight more sad to me
  E'en than these ranks could be
  Was that one with cane upraised
  Who stood by and gazed and gazed,
  Trembling, solemn, lips compressed,
  Longing to be with the rest.
  Did he dream of old alarms,
  As he stood, "presented arms"?
  Did he think of field and camp
  And the unremitting tramp
  Mile on mile--the lonely guard
  When he kept his midnight ward?
  Did he dream of wounds and scars
  In that bitter war of wars?
  What of that? He stood and stands
  In my memory--trembling hands,
  Whitened beard and cane and all
  As if waiting for the call
  Once again: "To arms, my sons,"
  And his ears hear far-off guns,
  Roll of cannon and the tread
  Of the legions of the Dead!
YESTERDAY AND TO-MORROW
  Yesterday I held your hand,
  Reverently I pressed it,
  And its gentle yieldingness
  From my soul I blessed it.
  But to-day I sit alone,
  Sad and sore repining;
  Must our gold forever know
  Flames for the refining?
  Yesterday I walked with you,
  Could a day be sweeter?
  Life was all a lyric song
  Set to tricksy meter.
  Ah, to-day is like a dirge,--
  Place my arms around you,
  Let me feel the same dear joy
  As when first I found you.
  Let me once retrace my steps,
  From these roads unpleasant,
  Let my heart and mind and soul
  All ignore the present.
  Yesterday the iron seared
  And to-day means sorrow.
  Pause, my soul, arise, arise,
  Look where gleams the morrow.
THE CHANGE
  Love used to carry a bow, you know,
    But now he carries a taper;
  It is either a length of wax aglow,
    Or a twist of lighted paper.
  I pondered a little about the scamp,
    And then I decided to follow
  His wandering journey to field and camp,
    Up hill, down dale or hollow.
  I dogged the rollicking, gay, young blade
    In every species of weather;
  Till, leading me straight to the home of a maid
    He left us there together.
  And then I saw it, oh, sweet surprise,
    The taper it set a-burning
  The love-light brimming my lady's eyes,
    And my heart with the fire of yearning.
THE CHASE
  The wind told the little leaves to hurry,
    And chased them down the way,
  While the mother tree laughed loud in glee,
    For she thought her babes at play,
  The cruel wind and the rain laughed loudly,
    We'll bury them deep, they said,
  And the old tree grieves, and the little leaves
    Lie low, all chilled and dead.
SUPPOSE
  If 'twere fair to suppose
    That your heart were not taken,
  That the dew from the rose
    Petals still were not shaken,
  I should pluck you,
    Howe'er you should thorn me and scorn me,
  And wear you for life as the green of the bower.
  If 'twere fair to suppose
    That that road was for vagrants,
  That the wind and the rose,
    Counted all in their fragrance;
  Oh, my dear one,
    By love, I should take you and make you,
  The green of my life from the scintillant hour.
THE DEATH OF THE FIRST BORN
  Cover him over with daisies white
    And eke with the poppies red,
  Sit with me here by his couch to-night,
    For the First-Born, Love, is dead.
  Poor little fellow, he seemed so fair
    As he lay in my jealous arms;
  Silent and cold he is lying there
    Stripped of his darling charms.
  Lusty and strong he had grown forsooth,
    Sweet with an infinite grace,
  Proud in the force of his conquering youth,
    Laughter alight in his face.
  Oh, but the blast, it was cruel and keen,
    And ah, but the chill it was rare;
  The look of the winter-kissed flow'r you've seen
    When meadows and fields were bare.
  Can you not wake from this white, cold sleep
    And speak to me once again?
  True that your slumber is deep, so deep,
    But deeper by far is my pain.
  Cover him over with daisies white,
    And eke with the poppies red,
  Sit with me here by his couch to-night,
    For the First-Born, Love, is dead.
BEIN' BACK HOME
  Home agin, an' home to stay--
  Yes, it's nice to be away.
  Plenty things to do an' see,
  But the old place seems to me
  Jest about the proper thing.
  Mebbe 'ts 'cause the mem'ries cling
  Closer 'round yore place o' birth
  'N ary other spot on earth.
  W'y it's nice jest settin' here,
  Lookin' out an' seein' clear,
  'Thout no smoke, ner dust, ner haze
  In these sweet October days.
  What's as good as that there lane,
  Kind o' browned from last night's rain?
  'Pears like home has got the start
  When the goal's a feller's heart.
  What's as good as that there jay
  Screechin' up'ards towards the gray
  Skies? An' tell me, what's as fine
  As that full-leafed pumpkin vine?
  Tow'rin' buildin's--? yes, they're good;
  But in sight o' field and wood,
  Then a feller understan's
  'Bout the house not made with han's.
  Let the others rant an' roam
  When they git away from home;
  Jest gi' me my old settee
  An' my pipe beneath a tree;
  Sight o' medders green an' still,
  Now and then a gentle hill,
  Apple orchards, full o' fruit,
  Nigh a cider press to boot--
  That's the thing jest done up brown;
  D'want to be too nigh to town;
  Want to have the smells an' sights,
  An' the dreams o' long still nights,
  With the friends you used to know
  In the keerless long ago--
  Same old cronies, same old folks,
  Same old cider, same old jokes.
  Say, it's nice a-gittin' back,
  When yore pulse is growin' slack,
  An' yore breath begins to wheeze
  Like a fair-set valley breeze;
  Kind o' nice to set aroun'
  On the old familiar groun',
  Knowin' that when Death does come,
  That he'll find you right at home.
THE OLD CABIN
  In de dead of night I sometimes,
    Git to t'inkin' of de pas'
  An' de days w'en slavery helt me
    In my mis'ry--ha'd an' fas'.
  Dough de time was mighty tryin',
    In dese houahs somehow hit seem
  Dat a brightah light come slippin'
    Thoo de kivahs of my dream.
  An' my min' fu'gits de whuppins
    Draps de feah o' block an' lash
  An' flies straight to somep'n' joyful
    In a secon's lightnin' flash.
  Den hit seems I see a vision
    Of a dearah long ago
  Of de childern tumblin' roun' me
    By my rough ol' cabin do'.
  Talk about yo' go'geous mansions
    An' yo' big house great an' gran',
  Des bring up de fines' palace
    Dat you know in all de lan'.
  But dey's somep'n' dearah to me,
    Somep'n' faihah to my eyes
  In dat cabin, less you bring me
    To yo' mansion in de skies.
  I kin see de light a-shinin'
    Thoo de chinks atween de logs,
  I kin hyeah de way-off bayin'
    Of my mastah's huntin' dogs,
  An' de neighin' of de hosses
    Stampin' on de ol' bahn flo',
  But above dese soun's de laughin'
    At my deah ol' cabin do'.
  We would gethah daih at evenin',
    All my frien's 'ud come erroun'
  An' hit wan't no time, twell, bless you,
    You could hyeah de banjo's soun'.
  You could see de dahkies dancin'
    Pigeon wing an' heel an' toe--
  Joyous times I tell you people
    Roun' dat same ol' cabin do'.
  But at times my t'oughts gits saddah,
    Ez I riccolec' de folks,
  An' dey frolickin' an' talkin'
    Wid dey laughin' an dey jokes.
  An' hit hu'ts me w'en I membahs
    Dat I'll nevah see no mo'
  Dem ah faces gethered smilin'
    Roun' dat po' ol' cabin do'.
DESPAIR
  Let me close the eyes of my soul
    That I may not see
  What stands between thee and me.
  Let me shut the ears of my heart
    That I may not hear
  A voice that drowns yours, my dear.
  Let me cut the cords of my life,
    Of my desolate being,
  Since cursed is my hearing and seeing.

  Tim Murphy's gon' walkin' wid Maggie O'Neill,
          O chone!
  If I was her muther, I'd frown on sich foolin',
          O chone!
  I'm sure it's unmutherlike, darin' an' wrong
  To let a gyrul hear tell the sass an' the song
  Of every young felly that happens along,
          O chone!
  An' Murphy, the things that's be'n sed of his doin',
          O chone!
  'Tis a cud that no dacent folks wants to be chewin',
          O chone!
  If he came to my door wid his cane on a twirl,
  Fur to thry to make love to you, Biddy, my girl,
  Ah, wouldn't I send him away wid a whirl,
          O chone!
  They say the gossoon is indecent and dirty,
          O chone!
  In spite of his dressin' so.
          O chone!
  Let him dress up ez foine ez a king or a queen,
  Let him put on more wrinkles than ever was seen,
  You'll be sure he's no match for my little colleen,
          O chone!
  Faith the two is comin' back an' their walk is all over,
          O chone!
  'Twas a pretty short walk fur to take wid a lover,
          O chone!
  Why, I believe that Tim Murphy's a kumin' this way,
  Ah, Biddy jest look at him steppin' so gay,
  I'd niver belave what the gossipers say,
          O chone!
  He's turned in the gate an' he's coming a-caperin',
          O chone!
  Go, Biddy, go quick an' put on a clane apern,
          O chone!
  Be quick as ye kin fur he's right at the dure;
  Come in, master Tim, fur ye're welcome I'm shure.
  We were talkin' o' ye jest a minute before.
          O chone!
TILL THE WIND GETS RIGHT
  Oh the breeze is blowin' balmy
    An the sun is in a haze;
  There's a cloud jest givin' coolness
    To the laziest of days.
  There are crowds upon the lakeside,
    But the fish refuse to bite,
  So I'll wait and go a-fishin'
    When the wind gets right.
  Now my boat tugs at her anchor,
    Eager now to kiss the spray,
  While the little waves are callin'
    Drowsy sailor come away,
  There's a harbor for the happy,
    And its sheen is just in sight,
  But I won't set sail to get there,
    Till the wind gets right.
  That's my trouble, too, I reckon,
    I've been waitin' all too long,
  Tho' the days were always
    Still the wind is always wrong.
  An' when Gabriel blows his trumpet,
    In the day o' in the night,
  I will still be found waitin',
    Till the wind gets right.
A SUMMER NIGHT
  Summah is de lovin' time--
    Do' keer what you say.
  Night is allus peart an' prime,
    Bettah dan de day.
  Do de day is sweet an' good,
    Birds a-singin' fine,
  Pines a-smellin' in de wood,--
    But de night is mine.
  Rivah whisperin' "howdy do,"
    Ez it pass you by--
  Moon a-lookin' down at you,
    Winkin' on de sly.
  Frogs a-croakin' f'om de pon',
    Singin' bass dey fill,
  An' you listen way beyon'
    Ol' man whippo'will.
  Hush up, honey, tek my han'
    Mek yo' footsteps light;
  Somep'n' kin' o' hol's de lan'
    On a summah night.
  Somep'n' dat you nevah sees
    An' you nevah hyeahs,
  But you feels it in de breeze,
    Somep'n' nigh to teahs.
  Somep'n' nigh to teahs? dat's so;
    But hit's nigh to smiles.
  An' you feels it ez you go
    Down de shinin' miles.
  Tek my han', my little dove;
    Hush an' come erway--
  Summah is de time fu' love,
    Night-time beats de day!
AT SUNSET TIME
  Adown the west a golden glow
    Sinks burning in the sea,
  And all the dreams of long ago
    Come flooding back to me.
  The past has writ a story strange
    Upon my aching heart,
  But time has wrought a subtle change,
    My wounds have ceased to smart.
  No more the quick delight of youth,
    No more the sudden pain,
  I look no more for trust or truth
    Where greed may compass gain.
  What, was it I who bared my heart
    Through unrelenting years,
  And knew the sting of misery's dart,
    The tang of sorrow's tears?
  'Tis better now, I do not weep,
    I do not laugh nor care;
  My soul and spirit half asleep
    Drift aimless everywhere.
  We float upon a sluggish stream,
    We ride no rapids mad,
  While life is all a tempered dream
    And every joy half sad.
NIGHT
  Silence, and whirling worlds afar
    Through all encircling skies.
  What floods come o'er the spirit's bar,
    What wondrous thoughts arise.
  The earth, a mantle falls away,
    And, winged, we leave the sod;
  Where shines in its eternal sway
    The majesty of God.
AT LOAFING-HOLT
  Since I left the city's heat
  For this sylvan, cool retreat,
  High upon the hill-side here
  Where the air is clean and clear,
  I have lost the urban ways.
  Mine are calm and tranquil days,
  Sloping lawns of green are mine,
  Clustered treasures of the vine;
  Long forgotten plants I know,
  Where the best wild berries grow,
  Where the greens and grasses sprout,
  When the elders blossom out.
  Now I am grown weather-wise
  With the lore of winds and skies.
  Mine the song whose soft refrain
  Is the sigh of summer rain.
  Seek you where the woods are cool,
  Would you know the shady pool
  Where, throughout the lazy day,
  Speckled beauties drowse or play?
  Would you find in rest or peace
  Sorrow's permanent release?--
  Leave the city, grim and gray,
  Come with me, ah, come away.
  Do you fear the winter chill,
  Deeps of snow upon the hill?
  'Tis a mantle, kind and warm,
  Shielding tender shoots from harm.
  Do you dread the ice-clad streams,--
  They are mirrors for your dreams.
  Here's a rouse, when summer's past
  To the raging winter's blast.
  Let him roar and let him rout,
  We are armored for the bout.
  How the logs are glowing, see!
  Who sings louder, they or he?
  Could the city be more gay?
  Burn your bridges! Come away!
WHEN A FELLER'S ITCHIN' TO BE SPANKED
  W'en us fellers stomp around, makin' lots o' noise,
  Gramma says, "There's certain times come to little boys
  W'en they need a shingle or the soft side of a plank;"
  She says "we're a-itchin' for a right good spank."
    An' she says, "Now thes you wait,
    It's a-comin'--soon or late,
  W'en a feller's itchin' fer a spank."
  W'en a feller's out o' school, you know how he feels,
  Gramma says we wriggle 'roun' like a lot o' eels.
  W'y it's like a man that's thes home from out o' jail.
  What's the use o' scoldin' if we pull Tray's tail?
    Gramma says, tho', "Thes you wait,
    It's a-comin'--soon or late,
  You'se the boys that's itchin' to be spanked."
  Cats is funny creatures an' I like to make 'em yowl,
  Gramma alwus looks at me with a awful scowl
  An' she says, "Young gentlemen, mamma should be thanked
  Ef you'd get your knickerbockers right well spanked."
    An' she says, "Now thes you wait,
    It's a-comin'--soon or late,"
  When a feller's itchin' to be spanked.
  Ef you fin' the days is gettin' awful hot in school
  An' you know a swimmin' place where it's nice and cool,
  Er you know a cat-fish hole brimmin' full o' fish,
  Whose a-goin' to set around school and wish?
    'Tain't no use to hide your bait,
    It's a-comin,--soon or late,
  Wen a feller's itchin' to be spanked.
  Ol' folks know most ever'thing 'bout the world, I guess,
  Gramma does, we wish she knowed thes a little less,
  But I alwus kind o' think it 'ud be as well
    Ef they wouldn't alwus have to up an' tell;
    We kids wish 'at they'd thes wait,
    It's a-comin'--soon or late,
  Wen a feller's itchin' to be spanked.
THE RIVER OF RUIN
  Along by the river of ruin
  They dally--the thoughtless ones,
  They dance and they dream
  By the side of the stream,
  As long as the river runs.
  It seems all so pleasant and cheery--
  No thought of the morrow is theirs,
  And their faces are bright
  With the sun of delight,
  And they dream of no night-brooding cares.
  The women wear garlanded tresses,
  The men have rings on their hands,
  And they sing in their glee,
  For they think they are free--
  They that know not the treacherous sands.
  Ah, but this be a venturesome journey,
  Forever those sands are ashift,
  And a step to one side
  Means a grasp of the tide,
  And the current is fearful and swift.
  For once in the river of ruin,
  What boots it, to do or to dare,
  For down we must go
  In the turbulent flow,
  To the desolate sea of Despair.
TO HER
  Your presence like a benison to me
    Wakes my sick soul to dreamful ecstasy,
  I fancy that some old Arabian night
  Saw you my houri and my heart's delight.
  And wandering forth beneath the passionate moon,
    Your love-strung zither and my soul in tune,
  We knew the joy, the haunting of the pain
    That like a flame thrills through me now again.
  To-night we sit where sweet the spice winds blow,
    A wind the northland lacks and ne'er shall know,
  With clasped hands and spirits all aglow
    As in Arabia in the long ago.
A LOVE LETTER
  Oh, I des received a letter f'om de sweetest little gal;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  She's my lovely little sweetheart an' her name is Sal:
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  She writes me dat she loves me an' she loves me true,
  She wonders ef I'll tell huh dat I loves huh, too;
  An' my heaht's so full o' music dat I do' know what to do;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  I got a man to read it an' he read it fine;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  Dey ain' no use denying dat her love is mine;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  But hyeah's de t'ing dat's puttin' me in such a awful plight,
  I t'ink of huh at mornin' an' I dream of huh at night;
  But how's I gwine to cou't huh w'en I do' know how to write?
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  My heaht is bubblin' ovah wid de t'ings I want to say;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  An' dey's lots of folks to copy what I tell 'em fu' de pay;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
  But dey's t'ings dat I's a-t'inkin' dat is only fu' huh ears,
  An' I couldn't lu'n to write 'em ef I took a dozen years;
  So to go down daih an' tell huh is de only way, it 'pears;
        Oh, my; oh, my.
AFTER MANY DAYS
  I've always been a faithful man
    An' tried to live for duty,
  But the stringent mode of life
    Has somewhat lost its beauty.
  The story of the generous bread
    He sent upon the waters,
  Which after many days returns
    To trusting sons and daughters,
  Had oft impressed me, so I want
    My soul influenced by it,
  And bought a loaf of bread and sought
    A stream where I could try it.
  I cast my bread upon the waves
    And fancied then to await it;
  It had not floated far away
    When a fish came up and ate it.
  And if I want both fish and bread,
    And surely both I'm wanting,
  About the only way I see
    Is for me to go fishing.
LIZA MAY
  Little brown face full of smiles,
  And a baby's guileless wiles,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  Eyes a-peeping thro' the fence
  With an interest intense,
      Liza May.
  Ah, the gate is just ajar,
  And the meadow is not far,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  And the road feels very sweet,
  To your little toddling feet,
      Liza May.
  Ah, you roguish runaway,
  What will toiling mother say,
      Liza May, Liza May?
  What care you who smile to greet
  Everyone you chance to meet,
      Liza May?
  Soft the mill-race sings its song,
  Just a little way along,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  But the song is full of guile,
  Turn, ah turn, your steps the while,
      Liza May.
  You have caught the gleam and glow
  Where the darkling waters flow,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  Flash of ripple, bend of bough,
  Where are all the angels now?
      Liza May.
  Now a mother's eyes intense
  Gazing o'er a shabby fence,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  Then a mother's anguished face
  Peering all around the place,
      Liza May.
  Hear the agonizing call
  For a mother's all in all,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  Hear a mother's maddened prayer
  To the calm unanswering air,
      Liza May.
  What's become of--Liza May?
  What has darkened all the day?
      Liza May, Liza May.
  Ask the waters dark and fleet,
  If they know the smiling, sweet
      Liza May.
  Call her, call her as you will,
  On the meadow, on the hill,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  Through the brush or beaten track
  Echo only gives you back,
      Liza May.
  Ah, but you were loving--sweet,
  On your little toddling feet,
      Liza May, Liza May.
  But through all the coming years,
  Must a mother breathe with tears,
      Liza May.
THE MASTERS
  Oh, who is the Lord of the land of life,
    When hotly goes the fray?
  When, fierce we smile in the midst of strife
    Then whom shall we obey?
  Oh, Love is the Lord of the land of life
    Who holds a monarch's sway;
  He wends with wish of maid and wife,
    And him you must obey.
  Then who is the Lord of the land of life,
    At setting of the sun?
  Whose word shall sway when Peace is rife
    And all the fray is done?
  Then Death is the Lord of the land of life,
    When your hot race is run.
  Meet then his scythe and, pruning-knife
    When the fray is lost or won.
TROUBLE IN DE KITCHEN
  Dey was oncet a awful quoil 'twixt de skillet an' de pot;
  De pot was des a-bilin' an' de skillet sho' was hot.
  Dey slurred each othah's colah an' dey called each othah names,
  Wile de coal-oil can des gu-gled, po'in oil erpon de flames.
  De pot, hit called de skillet des a flat, disfiggered t'ing,
  An' de skillet 'plied dat all de pot could do was set an' sing,
  An' he 'lowed dat dey was 'lusions dat he wouldn't stoop to mek
  'Case he reckernize his juty, an' he had too much at steak.
  Well, at dis de pot biled ovah, case his tempah gittin' highah,
  An' de skillet got to sputterin', den de fat was in de fiah.
  Mistah flan lay daih smokin' an' a-t'inkin' to hisse'f,
  Wile de peppah-box us nudgin' of de gingah on de she'f.
  Den dey all des lef hit to 'im, 'bout de trouble an' de talk;
  An' howevah he decided, w'y dey bofe 'u'd walk de chalk;
  But de fiah uz so 'sgusted how dey quoil an' dey shout
  Dat he cooled 'em off, I reckon, w'en he puffed an' des went out.
CHRISTMAS
  Step wid de banjo an' glide wid de fiddle,
    Dis ain' no time fu' to pottah an' piddle:
  Fu' Christmas is comin', it's right on de way,
    An' dey's houahs to dance 'fo' de break o' de day.
  What if de win' is taihin' an' whistlin'?
    Look at dat' fiah how hit's spittin' an' bristlin'!
  Heat in de ashes an' heat in de cindahs,
    Ol' mistah Fros' kin des look thoo de windahs.
  Heat up de toddy an' pas' de wa'm glasses,
    Don' stop to shivah at blowin's an' blas'es,
  Keep on de kittle an' keep it a-hummin',
    Eat all an' drink all, dey's lots o' a-comin'.
  Look hyeah, Maria, don't open dat oven,
    Want all dese people a-pushin' an' shovin'?
  Res' f'om de dance? Yes, you done cotch dat odah,

  Eat up dem critters, you men folks an' wimmens,
    'Possums ain' skace w'en dey's lots o' pu'simmons.
ROSES AND PEARLS
  Your spoken words are roses fine and sweet,
  The songs you sing are perfect pearls of sound.
  How lavish nature is about your feet,
  To scatter flowers and jewels both around.
  Blushing the stream of petal beauty flows,
  Softly the white strings trickle down and shine.
  Oh! speak to me, my love, I crave a rose.
  Sing me a song, for I would pearls were mine.
RAIN-SONGS
  The rain streams down like harp-strings from the sky;
    The wind, that world-old harpist sitteth by;
  And ever as he sings his low refrain,
    He plays upon the harp-strings of the rain.
A LOST DREAM
  Ah, I have changed, I do not know
  Why lonely hours affect me so.
  In days of yore, this were not wont,
  No loneliness my soul could daunt.
  For me too serious for my age,
  The weighty tome of hoary sage,
  Until with puzzled heart astir,
  One God-giv'n night, I dreamed of her.
  I loved no woman, hardly knew
  More of the sex that strong men woo
  Than cloistered monk within his cell;
  But now the dream is lost, and hell
  Holds me her captive tight and fast
  Who prays and struggles for the past.
  No living maid has charmed my eyes,
  But now, my soul is wonder-wise.
  For I have dreamed of her and seen
  Her red-brown tresses' ruddy sheen,
  Have known her sweetness, lip to lip,
  The joy of her companionship.
  When days were bleak and winds were rude,
  She shared my smiling solitude,
  And all the bare hills walked with me
  To hearken winter's melody.
  And when the spring came o'er the land
  We fared together hand in hand
  Beneath the linden's leafy screen
  That waved above us faintly green.
  In summer, by the river-side,
  Our souls were kindred with the tide
  That floated onward to the sea
  As we swept toward Eternity.
  The bird's call and the water's drone
  Were all for us and us alone.
  The water-fall that sang all night
  Was her companion, my delight,
  And e'en the squirrel, as he sped
  Along the branches overhead,
  Half kindly and half envious,
  Would chatter at the joy of us.
  'Twas but a dream, her face, her hair,
  The spring-time sweet, the winter bare,
  The summer when the woods we ranged,--
  'Twas but a dream, but all is changed.
  Yes, all is changed and all has fled,
  The dream is broken, shattered, dead.
  And yet, sometimes, I pray to know
  How just a dream could hold me so.
A SONG
  Thou art the soul of a summer's day,
  Thou art the breath of the rose.
      But the summer is fled
      And the rose is dead
  Where are they gone, who knows, who knows?
  Thou art the blood of my heart o' hearts,
  Thou art my soul's repose,
      But my heart grows numb
      And my soul is dumb
  Where art thou, love, who knows, who knows?
  Thou art the hope of my after years--
  Sun for my winter snows
      But the years go by
      'Neath a clouded sky.
  Where shall we meet, who knows, Who knows?
MISCELLANEOUS

WHEN WINTER DARKENING ALL AROUND
  When winter covering all the ground
    Hides every sign of Spring, sir.
  However you may look around,
    Pray what will then you sing, sir?
  The Spring was here last year I know,
    And many bards did flute, sir;
  I shall not fear a little snow
    Forbid me from my lute, sir.
  If words grow dull and rhymes grow rare,
    I'll sing of Spring's farewell, sir.
  For every season steals an air,
    Which has a Springtime smell, sir.
  But if upon the other side,
    With passionate longing burning,
  Will seek the half unjeweled tide,
    And sing of Spring's returning.
FROM THE PORCH AT RUNNYMEDE
  I stand above the city's rush and din,
    And gaze far down with calm and undimmed eyes,
  To where the misty smoke wreath grey and dim
    Above the myriad roofs and spires rise;
  Still is my heart and vacant is my breath--
    This lovely view is breath and life to me,
  Why I could charm the icy soul of death
    With such a sight as this I stand and see.
  I hear no sound of labor's din or stir,
    I feel no weight of worldly cares or fears,
  Sweet song of birds, of wings the soothing whirr,
    These sounds alone assail my listening ears.
  Unwhipt of conscience here I stand alone,
    The breezes humbly kiss my garment's hem;
  I am a king--the whole world is my throne,
    The blue grey sky my royal diadem.
EQUIPMENT
  With what thou gavest me, O Master,
    I have wrought.
  Such chances, such abilities,
    To see the end was not for my poor eyes,
  Thine was the impulse, thine the forming thought.
  Ah, I have wrought,
    And these sad hands have right to tell their story,
  It was no hard up striving after glory,
    Catching and losing, gaining and failing,
  Raging me back at the world's raucous railing.
    Simply and humbly from stone and from wood,
  Wrought I the things that to thee might seem good.
  If they are little, ah God! but the cost,
    Who but thou knowest the all that is lost!
  If they are few, is the workmanship true?
    Try them and weigh me, whate'er be my due!
EVENING
  The moon begins her stately ride
    Across the summer sky;
  The happy wavelets lash the shore,--
    The tide is rising high.
  Beneath some friendly blade of grass
    The lazy beetle cowers;
  The coffers of the air are filled
    With offerings from the flowers.
  And slowly buzzing o'er my head
    A swallow wings her flight;
  I hear the weary plowman sing
    As falls the restful night.
TO PFRIMMER
(Lines on reading "Driftwood.")
  Driftwood gathered here and there
  Along the beach of time;
  Now and then a chip of truth
  'Mid boards and boughs of rhyme;
  Driftwood gathered day by day,--
  The cypress and the oak,--
  Twigs that in some former time
  From sturdy home trees broke.
  Did this wood come floating thick
  All along down "Injin Crik?"
  Or did kind tides bring it thee
  From the past's receding sea
  Down the stream of memory?
TO THE MIAMI
  Kiss me, Miami, thou most constant one!
    I love thee more for that thou changest not.
  When Winter comes with frigid blast,
  Or when the blithesome Spring is past
    And Summer's here with sunshine hot,
  Or in sere Autumn, thou has still the pow'r
  To charm alike, whate'er the hour.
  Kiss me, Miami, with thy dewy lips;
    Throbs fast my heart e'en as thine own breast beats.
  My soul doth rise as rise thy waves,
  As each on each the dark shore laves
    And breaks in ripples and retreats.
  There is a poem in thine every phase;
  Thou still has sung through all thy days.
  Tell me, Miami, how it was with thee
    When years ago Tecumseh in his prime
  His birch boat o'er thy waters sent,
  And pitched upon thy banks his tent.
    In that long-gone, poetic time,
  Did some bronze bard thy flowing stream sit by
  And sing thy praises, e'en as I?
  Did some bronze lover 'neath this dark old tree
    Whisper of love unto his Indian maid?
  And didst thou list his murmurs deep,
  And in thy bosom safely keep
    The many raging vows they said?
  Or didst thou tell to fish and frog and bird
  The raptured scenes that there occurred?
  But, O dear stream, what volumes thou couldst tell
    To all who know thy language as I do,
  Of life and love and jealous hate!
  But now to tattle were too late,--
    Thou who hast ever been so true.
  Tell not to every passing idler here
  All those sweet tales that reached thine ear.
  But, silent stream, speak out and tell me this:
    I say that men and things are still the same;
  Were men as bold to do and dare?
  Were women then as true and fair?
    Did poets seek celestial flame,
  The hero die to gain a laureled brow,
  And women suffer, then as now?
CHRISTMAS CAROL
    Ring out, ye bells!
    All Nature swells
  With gladness at the wondrous story,--
    The world was lorn,
    But Christ is born
  To change our sadness into glory.
    Sing, earthlings, sing!
    To-night a King
  Hath come from heaven's high throne to bless us.
    The outstretched hand
    O'er all the land
  Is raised in pity to caress us.
    Come at his call;
    Be joyful all;
  Away with mourning and with sadness!
    The heavenly choir
    With holy fire
  Their voices raise in songs of gladness.
    The darkness breaks
    And Dawn awakes,
  Her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes.
    The rocks and stones
    In holy tones
  Are singing sweeter than the thrushes.
    Then why should we
    In silence be,
  When Nature lends her voice to praises;
    When heaven and earth
    Proclaim the truth
  Of Him for whom that lone star blazes?
    No, be not still,
    But with a will
  Strike all your harps and set them ringing;
    On hill and heath
    Let every breath
  Throw all its power into singing!
A SUMMER PASTORAL
  It's hot to-day. The bees is buzzin'
    Kinder don't-keer-like aroun'
  An' fur off the warm air dances
    O'er the parchin' roofs in town.
  In the brook the cows is standin';
    Childern hidin' in the hay;
  Can't keep none of 'em a workin',
    'Cause it's hot to-day.
  It's hot to-day. The sun is blazin'
     Like a great big ball o' fire;
  Seems as ef instead o' settin'
    It keeps mountin' higher an' higher.
  I'm as triflin' as the children,
    Though I blame them lots an' scold;
  I keep slippin' to the spring-house,
    Where the milk is rich an' cold.
  The very air within its shadder
    Smells o' cool an' restful things,
  An' a roguish little robin
    Sits above the place an' sings.
  I don't mean to be a shirkin',
    But I linger by the way
  Longer, mebbe, than is needful,
  'Cause it's hot to-day.
  It's hot to-day. The horses stumble
    Half asleep across the fiel's;
  An' a host o' teasin' fancies
    O'er my burnin' senses steals,--
  Dreams o' cool rooms, curtains lowered,
    An' a sofy's temptin' look;
  Patter o' composin' raindrops
    Or the ripple of a brook.
  I strike a stump! That wakes me sudden;
    Dreams all vanish into air.
  Lordy! how I chew my whiskers;
    'Twouldn't do fur me to swear.
  But I have to be so keerful
    'Bout my thoughts an' what I say;
  Somethin' might slip out unheeded,
    'Cause it's hot to-day.
  Git up, there, Suke! you, Sal, git over!
    Sakes alive! how I do sweat.
  Every stitch that I've got on me,
  Bet a cent, is wringin' wet.
  If this keeps up, I'll lose my temper.
    Gee there, Sal, you lazy brute!
  Wonder who on airth this weather
    Could 'a' be'n got up to suit?
  You, Sam, go bring a tin o' water;
    Dash it all, don't be so slow!
  'Pears as ef you tuk an hour
    'Tween each step to stop an' blow.
  Think I want to stand a meltin'
    Out here in this b'ilin' sun,
  While you stop to think about it?
    Lift them feet o' your'n an' run.
  It ain't no use; I'm plumb fetaggled.
    Come an' put this team away.
  I won't plow another furrer;
    It's too mortal hot to-day.
  I ain't weak, nor I ain't lazy,
    But I'll stand this half day's loss
  'Fore I let the devil make me
    Lose my patience an' git cross.
IN SUMMER TIME
  When summer time has come, and all
  The world is in the magic thrall
  Of perfumed airs that lull each sense
  To fits of drowsy indolence;
  When skies are deepest blue above,
  And flow'rs aflush,--then most I love
  To start, while early dews are damp,
  And wend my way in woodland tramp
  Where forests rustle, tree on tree,
  And sing their silent songs to me;
  Where pathways meet and path ways part,--
  To walk with Nature heart by heart,
  Till wearied out at last I lie
  Where some sweet stream steals singing by
  A mossy bank; where violets vie
  In color with the summer sky,--
  Or take my rod and line and hook,
  And wander to some darkling brook,
  Where all day long the willows dream,
  And idly droop to kiss the stream,
  And there to loll from morn till night--
  Unheeding nibble, run, or bite--
  Just for the joy of being there
  And drinking in the summer air,
  The summer sounds, and summer sights,
  That set a restless mind to rights
  When grief and pain and raging doubt
  Of men and creeds have worn it out;
  The birds' song and the water's drone,
  The humming bees' low monotone,
  The murmur of the passing breeze,
  And all the sounds akin to these,
  That make a man in summer time
  Feel only fit for rest and rhyme.
  Joy springs all radiant in my breast;
  Though pauper poor, than king more blest,
  The tide beats in my soul so strong
  That happiness breaks forth in song,
  And rings aloud the welkin blue
  With all the songs I ever knew.
  O time of rapture! time of song!
  How swiftly glide thy days along
  Adown the current of the years,
  Above the rocks of grief and tears!
  'Tis wealth enough of joy for me
  In summer time to simply be.
A THANKSGIVING POEM
  The sun hath shed its kindly light,
    Our harvesting is gladly o'er
  Our fields have felt no killing blight,
    Our bins are filled with goodly store.
  From pestilence, fire, flood, and sword
    We have been spared by thy decree,
  And now with humble hearts, O Lord,
    We come to pay our thanks to thee.
  We feel that had our merits been
    The measure of thy gifts to us,
  We erring children, born of sin,
    Might not now be rejoicing thus.
  No deed of ours hath brought us grace;
    When thou were nigh our sight was dull,
  We hid in trembling from thy face,
    But thou, O God, wert merciful.
  Thy mighty hand o'er all the land
    Hath still been open to bestow
  Those blessings which our wants demand
    From heaven, whence all blessings flow.
  Thou hast, with ever watchful eye,
    Looked down on us with holy care,
  And from thy storehouse in the sky
    Hast scattered plenty everywhere.
  Then lift we up our songs of praise
    To thee, O Father, good and kind;
  To thee we consecrate our days;
    Be thine the temple of each mind.
  With incense sweet our thanks ascend;
    Before thy works our powers pall;
  Though we should strive years without end,
    We could not thank thee for them all.
NUTTING SONG
  The November sun invites me,
  And although the chill wind smites me,
  I will wander to the woodland
    Where the laden trees await;
  And with loud and joyful singing
  I will set the forest ringing,
  As if I were king of Autumn,
    And Dame Nature were my mate,--
  While the squirrel in his gambols
  Fearless round about me ambles,
  As if he were bent on showing
    In my kingdom he'd a share;
  While my warm blood leaps and dashes,
  And my eye with freedom flashes,
  As my soul drinks deep and deeper
    Of the magic in the air.
  There's a pleasure found in nutting,
  All life's cares and griefs outshutting,
  That is fuller far and better
    Than what prouder sports impart.
  Who could help a carol trilling
  As he sees the baskets filling?
  Why, the flow of song keeps running
    O'er the high walls of the heart.
  So when I am home returning,
  When the sun is lowly burning,
  I will once more wake the echoes
    With a happy song of praise,--
  For the golden sunlight blessing,
  And the breezes' soft caressing,
  And the precious boon of living
    In the sweet November days.
LOVE'S PICTURES
  Like the blush upon the rose
    When the wooing south wind speaks,
  Kissing soft its petals,
    Are thy cheeks.
  Tender, soft, beseeching, true,
    Like the stars that deck the skies
  Through the ether sparkling,
    Are thine eyes.
  Like the song of happy birds,
    When the woods with spring rejoice,
  In their blithe awak'ning,
    Is thy voice.
  Like soft threads of clustered silk
    O'er thy face so pure and fair,
  Sweet in its profusion,
    Is thy hair.
  Like a fair but fragile vase,
    Triumph of the carver's art,
  Graceful formed and slender,--
    Thus thou art.
  Ah, thy cheek, thine eyes, thy voice,
    And thy hair's delightful wave
  Make me, I'll confess it,
    Thy poor slave!
THE OLD HOMESTEAD
  'Tis an old deserted homestead
    On the outskirts of the town,
  Where the roof is all moss-covered,
    And the walls are tumbling down;
  But around that little cottage
    Do my brightest mem'ries cling,
  For 'twas there I spent the moments
    Of my youth,--life's happy spring.
  I remember how I used to
    Swing upon the old front gate,
  While the robin in the tree tops
    Sung a night song to his mate;
  And how later in the evening,
    As the beaux were wont to do,
  Mr. Perkins, in the parlor,
    Sat and sparked my sister Sue.
  There my mother--heaven bless her!--
    Kissed or spanked as was our need,
  And by smile or stroke implanted
    In our hearts fair virtue's seed;
  While my father, man of wisdom,
    Lawyer keen, and farmer stout,
  Argued long with neighbor Dobbins
    How the corn crops would turn out.
  Then the quiltings and the dances--
    How my feet were wont to fly,
  While the moon peeped through the barn chinks
    From her stately place on high.
  Oh, those days, so sweet, so happy,
    Ever backward o'er me roll;
  Still the music of that farm life
    Rings an echo in my soul.
  Now the old place is deserted,
    And the walls are falling down;
  All who made the home life cheerful,
    Now have died or moved to town.
  But about that dear old cottage
    Shall my mem'ries ever cling,
  For 'twas there I spent the moments
    Of my, youth,--life's happy spring.
ON THE DEATH OF W. C.
  Thou arrant robber, Death!
  Couldst thou not find
  Some lesser one than he
  To rob of breath,--
  Some poorer mind
  Thy prey to be?
  His mind was like the sky,--
    As pure and free;
  His heart was broad and open
    As the sea.
  His soul shone purely through his face,
  And Love made him her dwelling place.
  Not less the scholar than the friend,
    Not less a friend than man;
  The manly life did shorter end
    Because so broad it ran.
  Weep not for him, unhappy Muse!
  His merits found a grander use
  Some other-where. God wisely sees
  The place that needs his qualities.
  Weep not for him, for when Death lowers
  O'er youth's ambrosia-scented bowers
  He only plucks the choicest flowers.
AN OLD MEMORY
  How sweet the music sounded
    That summer long ago,
  When you were by my side, love,
    To list its gentle flow.
  I saw your eyes a-shining,
    I felt your rippling hair,
  I kissed your pearly cheek, love,
    And had no thought of care.
  And gay or sad the music,
    With subtle charm replete;
  I found in after years, love
    'Twas you that made it sweet.
  For standing where we heard it,
    I hear again the strain;
  It wakes my heart, but thrills it
    With sad, mysterious pain.
  It pulses not so joyous
    As when you stood with me,
  And hand in hand we listened
    To that low melody.
  Oh, could the years turn back, love!
    Oh, could events be changed
  To what they were that time, love,
    Before we were estranged;
  Wert thou once more a maiden
    Whose smile was gold to me;
  Were I once more the lover
    Whose word was life to thee,--
  O God! could all be altered,
    The pain, the grief, the strife,
  And wert thou--as thou shouldst be--
    My true and loyal wife!
  But all my tears are idle,
    And all my wishes vain.
  What once you were to me, love,
    You may not be again.
  For I, alas! like others,
    Have missed my dearest aim.
  I asked for love. Oh, mockery!
    Fate comes to me with fame!
A CAREER
  "Break me my bounds, and let me fly
  To regions vast of boundless sky;
  Nor I, like piteous Daphne, be
  Root-bound. Ah, no! I would be free
  As yon same bird that in its flight
  Outstrips the range of mortal sight;
  Free as the mountain streams that gush
  From bubbling springs, and downward rush
  Across the serrate mountain's side,--
  The rocks o'erwhelmed, their banks defied,--
  And like the passions in the soul,
  Swell into torrents as they roll.
  Oh, circumscribe me not by rules
  That serve to lead the minds of fools!
  But give me pow'r to work my will,
  And at my deeds the world shall thrill.
  My words shall rouse the slumb'ring zest
  That hardly stirs in manhood's breast;
  And as the sun feeds lesser lights,
  As planets have their satellites,
  So round about me will I bind
  The men who prize a master mind!"
  He lived a silent life alone,
  And laid him down when it was done;
  And at his head was placed a stone
  On which was carved a name unknown!
ON THE RIVER
  The sun is low,
  The waters flow,
  My boat is dancing to and fro.
  The eve is still,
  Yet from the hill
  The killdeer echoes loud and shrill.
  The paddles plash,
  The wavelets dash,
  We see the summer lightning flash;
  While now and then,
  In marsh and fen
  Too muddy for the feet of men,
  Where neither bird
  Nor beast has stirred,
  The spotted bullfrog's croak is heard.
  The wind is high,
  The grasses sigh,
  The sluggish stream goes sobbing by.
  And far away
  The dying day
  Has cast its last effulgent ray;
  While on the land
  The shadows stand
  Proclaiming that the eve's at hand.
POOR WITHERED ROSE
  _A Song_
  Poor withered rose, she gave it me,
  Half in revenge and half in glee;
  Its petals not so pink by half
  As are her lips when curled to laugh,
  As are her cheeks when dimples gay
  In merry mischief o'er them play.
  _Chorus_
      Forgive, forgive, it seems unkind
      To cast thy petals to the wind;
      But it is right, and lest I err
      So scatter I all thought of her.
  Poor withered rose, so like my heart,
  That wilts at sorrow's cruel dart.
  Who hath not felt the winter's blight
  When every hope seemed warm and bright?
  Who doth not know love unreturned,
  E'en when the heart most wildly burned?
  Poor withered rose, thou liest dead;
  Too soon thy beauty's bloom hath fled.
  'Tis not without a tearful ruth
  I watch decay thy blushing youth;
  And though thy life goes out in dole,
  Thy perfume lingers in my soul.
WORN OUT
  You bid me hold my peace
    And dry my fruitless tears,
  Forgetting that I bear
    A pain beyond my years.
  You say that I should smile
    And drive the gloom away;
  I would, but sun and smiles
    Have left my life's dark day.
  All time seems cold and void,
    And naught but tears remain;
  Life's music beats for me
    A melancholy strain.
  I used at first to hope,
    But hope is past and, gone;
  And now without a ray
    My cheerless life drags on.
  Like to an ash-stained hearth
    When all its fires are spent;
  Like to an autumn wood
    By storm winds rudely shent,--
  So sadly goes my heart,
    Unclothed of hope and peace;
  It asks not joy again,
    But only seeks release.
JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY
(From a Westerner's Point of View.)
  No matter what you call it,
    Whether genius, or art,
  He sings the simple songs that come
    The closest to your heart.
  Fur trim an' skillful phrases,
    I do not keer a jot;
  'Tain't the words alone, but feelin's,
    That tech the tender spot.
  An' that's jest why I love him,--
    Why, he's got sech human feelin',
  An' in ev'ry song he gives us,
    You kin see it creepin', stealin',
  Through the core the tears go tricklin',
    But the edge is bright an' smiley;
  I never saw a poet
    Like that poet Whitcomb Riley.
  His heart keeps beatin' time with our'n
    In measures fast or slow;
  He tells us jest the same ol' things
    Our souls have learned to know.
  He paints our joys an' sorrers
    In a way so stric'ly true,
  That a body can't help knowin'
    That he has felt them too.
  If there's a lesson to be taught,
    He never fears to teach it,
  An' he puts the food so good an' low
    That the humblest one kin reach it.
  Now in our time, when poets rhyme
    For money, fun, or fashion,
  'Tis good to hear one voice so clear
    That thrills with honest passion.
  So let the others build their songs,
    An' strive to polish highly,--
  There's none of them kin tech the heart
    Like our own Whitcomb Riley.
A MADRIGAL
  Dream days of fond delight and hours
    As rosy-hued as dawn, are mine.
    Love's drowsy wine,
  Brewed from the heart of Passion flowers,
    Flows softly o'er my lips
    And save thee, all the world is in eclipse.
  There were no light if thou wert not;
    The sun would be too sad to shine,
    And all the line
  Of hours from dawn would be a blot;
    And Night would haunt the skies,
    An unlaid ghost with staring dark-ringed eyes.
  Oh, love, if thou wert not my love,
    And I perchance not thine--what then?
    Could gift of men
  Or favor of the God above,
    Plant aught in this bare heart
    Or teach this tongue the singer's soulful art?
  Ah, no! 'Tis love, and love alone
    That spurs my soul so surely on;
    Turns night to dawn,
  And thorns to roses fairest blown;
    And winter drear to spring--
    Oh, were it not for love I could not sing!
A STARRY NIGHT
  A cloud fell down from the heavens,
    And broke on the mountain's brow;
  It scattered the dusky fragments
    All over the vale below.
  The moon and the stars were anxious
    To know what its fate might be;
  So they rushed to the azure op'ning,
    And all peered down to see.
A LYRIC
  My lady love lives far away,
  And oh my heart is sad by day,
  And ah my tears fall fast by night,
  What may I do in such a plight.
  Why, miles grow few when love is fleet,
  And love, you know, hath flying feet;
  Break off thy sighs and witness this,
  How poor a thing mere distance is.
  My love knows not I love her so,
  And would she scorn me, did she know?
  How may the tale I would impart
  Attract her ear and storm her heart?
  Calm thou the tempest in my breast,
  Who loves in silence loves the best,
  But bide thy time, she will awake,
  No night so dark but morn will break.
  But though my heart so strongly yearn,
  My lady loves me not in turn,
  How may I win the blest reply
  That my void heart shall satisfy.
  Love breedeth love, be thou but true,
  And soon thy love shall love thee, too;
  If Fate hath meant you heart for heart,
  There's naught may keep you twain apart.
HOW SHALL I WOO THEE
  How shall I woo thee to win thee, mine own?
    Say in what tongue shall I tell of my love.
  I who was fearless so timid have grown,
    All that was eagle has turned into dove.
  The path from the meadow that leads to the bars
  Is more to me now than the path of the stars.
  How shall I woo thee to win thee, mine own,
    Thou who art fair and as far as the moon?
  Had I the strength of the torrent's wild tone,
    Had I the sweetness of warblers in June;
  The strength and the sweetness might charm and persuade,
  But neither have I my petition to aid.
  How shall I woo thee to win thee, mine own?
    How shall I traverse the distance between
  My humble cot and your glorious throne?
    How shall a clown gain the ear of a queen?
  Oh teach me the tongue that shall please thee the best,
  For till I have won thee my heart may not rest.

PREFACE 
 
     Acknowledgement of the following magazines, religious and secular papers, in which some of the verses herein originally appeared, is hereby made: "Detroit Young Women" (the former publication of the Young Women's Christian Association of Detroit), "Detroit Club Woman," Detroit Leader, Detroit Free Press and the Christian Recorder, Philadelphia. ' Under the title "The Heart of Christmas," a gift booklet was printed in 1917, containing the verse for "Festival Days." These with others, hitherto unpublished, have been included in this little volume and sent forth in the hope that they may be of interest to a wider circle of readers. 
 
                                                                           THE AUTHOR. 
 November, 1921. 
A FOREWORD 
 
      The crying need of the world to-day was adequately stated in the Summer (1919) number of "Le Livre Contemporain." "The war," says this writer, "showed the utter futility of materialism — of the age of science, and if civilization is not to fail again, we must center our lives and ambitions not on things material, but rather on things of the spirit." 
      The verses found in this slender volume are an expression of this life of the spirit. Their author, like Wordsworth, or even more like Milton, triumphs over every 'vicissitude of fortune because her mind is fixed upon the eternal, hence nothing temporal can permanently depress her spirit or destroy her abiding joy and peace. Such writers, whether unknown or well- known, have a message for mankind; and those who pause and read these lines will have their minds and hearts refreshed and strengthened, and their spiritual eyes uplifted to the Lord, from whence cometh our help. 
                                                                      THERESA SMITH, B. Pd.

MEDITATIONS 
 
 "EXCEEDING RICHES" 
  (Eph. ii : 7-8) 
 
O grace Divine, it saves me now! 
      With riches free doth me endow; 
 I once was blind, but now I see 
      Redemption plann'd so wondrously! 
 
 O grace Divine, it saves me now! 
      And sets God's favor on my brow; 
 It plants my feet where angels tread, 
      With life eternal crowns my head! 
 
 O grace Divine, it saves me now! 
       My Saviour's mercy I avow, 
 But shall not know till face to face 
      "The exceeding riches of His grace!”
 
 THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE 
 
 Tis not spoken by the tongue of man 
      Nor uttered by his voice; 
 It needeth not interpreter 
      To make the heart rejoice. 
 
 We hear it in each glad new day 
      That comes to me and you; 
 In starry gleams at night it speaks 
      From heaven's o'er-arching blue. 
 
 Its sweeter sounds are treble tones, 
      The thunder is its base; 
  If 'tis a voice most powerful, 
      'Tis also full of grace. 
 
 'Tis gone abroad thro' all the earth, 
      Where'er men see and hear, 
 Nature's myriad voices tell 
      The Mighty God is near. 
 MADE ONE BY THE GLORY 
 
 You have seen at sunset how the crimson and the gold 
 Unite in wondrous radiance that doth all things enfold: 
 The lowly cottter's dwelling and stately walls of stone, 
 In lavish'st adornment is this golden splendor thrown. 
 'Tis the miracle of eventide when day's discordant story  
 Is harmonized to beauty by the sun's departing glory. 
 
 No one knows the glory that was our Saviour's own 
 Before He left the light and life about the Father's throne, 
 But is it -not the greatest thing in His high-priestly prayer 
 That He should in that happy state permit us all to share? 
 That here, perhaps at eventide, all creeds' confusing story 
 Shall merged be in one by the greatness of His glory ! 
 HOW MUCH MORE? 
 (Heb. 9:14) 
 Forthwith every need supply, 
 If a loving earthly parent 
      Heareth when his children cry, 
 If he always gladly seeketh 
 Shall not God, our Heavenly Father, 
      Who is rich in boundless store, 
 Good things give to him that asketh, 
      Give in bounty, how much more? 
 
 If, again, that earthly parent 
      Would not substitute a stone 
 For the bread that nature craveth, 
      When the cry comes from his own, 
 Shall not God, our Heavenly Father, 
      On our thirsty spirits pour 
 All the quick'ning of His Spirit, 
      Fullest measure, how much more? 
 
 If the blood of bulls and fatlings, 
      Freely on the altar given, 
 Brought to mankind—erring, sinful, 
      Gift of cleansing down from Heaven, 
 Shall not then the blood of Jesus 
      Wash us, purge us and restore 
 Our dead consciences to service, 
      By its power, how much more? 
 
 How much more! O, how much more! 
      Than the richest parent's store, 
 Shall not God, our Heavenly Father, 
      On us His Holy Spirit pour? 
 Shall not Christ, our blessed Saviour, 
      More than offerings of yore, 
 Purge us, cleanse us, "How much more?” 
 LOVE'S WORK 
 
 Oh, the life that loves is the life that lives, 
           That lives and never dies. 
 To the soul that loves the Saviour gives 
           A home beyond the skies. 
 
 Oh, the heart that loves is the heart that grows 
           That grows more like to Him; 
 To the heart that loves the Saviour shows 
           Himself, the light within. 
 
 For love alone makes life worth while, 
            And love is from above; 
 It clothes us with the Saviour's smile, 
           For God Himself is love. 
 "CALL ME ISHI" 
 (Hosea 2:16) 
 
 "Call me Ishi," Church of God, 
 I for thee the wine-press trod, 
 All my glory did forego 
 To woo thee from the Prince of woe, 
           "Call me Ishi." 
 
 "Call me Ishi," lonely one; 
 I will be thy shield and sun; 
 I'll thine every need supply; 
 When in danger, I'll be nigh; 
           "Call me Ishi." 
 
 "Call me Ishi," nevermore 
 Other lovers to adore; 
 Thee, I in righteousness betroth, 
 Mine alone from now henceforth, 
           "Call me Ishi." 
 A PRAYER FOR THE TIMES—1914 
 
 Oh, in these days of war's array, 
 We would unceasing daily pray, 
 Where gay externals nigh had won us 
 Lord, let Thy beauty be upon us; 
 
 Above all grace of form or skin, 
 Lord, make us beautiful within ; 
 Like Moses, may our faces shine 
 With that rare glory caught from Thine. 
 
 In lieu of robes of costly price, 
 Lord, may Thine estimate suffice: 
 And we esteem it passing fair 
 The Spirit's lowly garb to wear. 
 
 THE "GREATER ONE" 
 (Luke 11:31) 
 
 Exerywhere you reverent turn, 
 Can you not in truth discern 
 Here the presence-room of One 
 Greater than King Solomon? 
 
 In the blue of yon clear sky, 
 On the grass where pearls lie, 
 In the pure, ambient air, 
 Speaks there not Jehovah's care? 
 
 In the peace that reigns at dawn 
 On a glorious summer morn, 
 Breathes there not assurance clear 
 That the Prince of Peace is here? 
 
 In the matin-song of bird. 
 This sweet undertone is heard; 
 "It is I, Be of good cheer! 
 Lo, the 'Greater One is here!" 
 "MORE THAN OTHERS" 
  (Matt. 5:47) 
 
 The "more than others" people, 
      Don't you love them though! 
 In business, church and social life, 
      How they keep the world aglow! 
 
 Going always one mile farther 
      Than a friend requests: 
 Working ever somewhat harder, 
      While some tired one rests. 
 
 Loving where no love is given, 
      When there's no reward: 
 Saluting not alone their brethren 
      Following their Lord. 
 
 These "more than others" people, 
      What a vital place they fill! 
 And their ranks are never crowded, 
      Won't you join their guild? 
 
 A DEDICATION 
 
 Holy Spirit, I give myself to Thee, 
      Do as Thou wilt with me: 
      Chasten, reprove, refine, 
      So Christ's life may shine 
      Through me to men, 
 And souls be born again! 
 
 Holy Spirit, I give myself to Thee, 
      That Thou my Guide mayst be 
      In all the paths of Truth, 
      So that aspiring youth 
      May Christ's own image see, 
 Reflected clear in me! 
 
 Spirit of prayer and praise, 
      Grant in these latter days, 
      When wolves attack the fold 
      And love oft waxeth cold, 
      That I, baptized anew, 
 Mav stand steadfast and true! 
 
 "GOOD THINGS TO COME" 
 (Heb. 9:11) 
 
 Such things as prophets in the days of old 
 Did so much long- Jehovah would unfold; 
 Just how the daily sacrifice should cease, 
 And leave no need of temple veil and priest; 
 How One, a lamb before his shearers dumb, 
 Should be for man of offerings the sum, 
 The fruitage of their hopes—"Good things to come." 
 
 Such things as in the fullness of the time 
 Did come to pass, making the Earth sublime; 
 So that the chosen Twelve could all rejoicing say: 
 Our eyes have seen the life, the Truth, the Way; 
 Within the temple courts no need of traffic's hum, 
 Henceforth its rites and ritual are dumb 
 Before the Word made flesh: "the good things to come." 
 
 Such things the Master must have had in view 
 When to the Twelve He said: "Much greater shall ye do"; 
 Such things as came with Pentecost, and since that day 
 Have blazed for the Church a shining way; 
 Such things as make all other voices dumb 
 To those who know their Christ as Priest, the sum 
 Of present joys; and still—"Good things to come!" 
 GOD'S SCALES 
 
 How much weigh you to God? 
 His are unerring scales, 
 So finely set the balances 
 Adjustment never fails. 
 
 Are you so full of faith, 
 And deeds of holy love, 
 That they'll amply weigh for you 
 With Him who dwells above? 
 
 Is yours the moral worth, 
 And more, the heart so free, 
 That you can meet His final test: 
 "Leave all and follow me?" 
 
 How much weigh you to God? 
 For after all our vaunting, 
 None at last would hear Him say: 
 "Weighed, and found wanting." 
 "HE THAT KEEPETH ISRAEL" 
 (Ps. 121:4) 
 
 Sometimes, o'erworn by many cares. 
 We are too weary for our prayers; 
 Then, how assuring it is to know, 
 As we to rest confiding go 
 That He who doth His Israel keep 
 Hath not our human need of sleep; 
 
 That dear ones, near and far away, 
 For whom we may not conscious pray, 
 Are kept, and we have peace serene, 
 Because there watches One between 
 Who safely guards His scatter'd sheep, 
 And doth dot not cease His watch for sleep. 
 
 And then how oft when dawns the day; 
 When we to work betake our way, 
 Though open-eyed we fail to see 
 The snares escap'd by you and me. 
 Because He who ever guards His sheep 
 Doth neither slumber take nor sleep ! 
 "PLEASURES FOREVERMGRE" 
 (Ps. 16:11) 
 
 O ye, so burdened here with care,  
      No time for pleasure have to spare; 
 And ye whose purses are too short 
      To surplus leave for happy sport, 
 Who spend, perhaps, what you might save 
      To make another's path less grave, 
 Because vour hearts are running o'er 
      With love for One who sorrows bore, 
 For you, of pleasures, He hath store 
      At His right hand forevermore! 
 
 O ye, whose wage no margin yields 
      For gladsome strolls in verdant fields; 
 For leisure hours to idly spend 
      On ocean's beach till summer's end: 
 Or cruise 'mid Nature's lovely scenes— 
      Adown her myriad inland streams; 
 O ye whose scanty little store 
      Forbids much wandering from the shore, 
 Yet, rich in faith, your pleasures soar. 
      At His right hand forevermore! 
 
 "At His right hand?" It is not far, 
      Indeed, 'tis just beyond the bar. 
 You breathe not long the close land-air, 
      Which seems so very hard to bear, 
 When other barks put out in glee, 
      Know all the fresh joys of the sea; 
 But you shall know as saints of yore. 
      To suffer is to taste life's core, 
 And on those higher pleasures pore, 
      At His right hand forevermore ! 
 A LESSON FROM GIDEON 
 
 What riches in the Word one finds 
      In reading 'twixt the marginal lines! 
  There, in the wars by Judges told, 
      What vistas doth this fact unfold: 
 The Spirit of God did rest upon 
      Or "clothe itself with Gideon!" 
 Gideon, just the earthly dress 
      Through which the Spirit did His best; 
 Just the mouth and hands and feet 
      To make the work of God complete. 
 
 Oh, in these days when so much care 
      Is given to the clothes we wear, 
 When we more than we like to own, 
      Think so much of a pretty gown, 
 How it doth kindle us to read 
      This line about the Spirit's need! 
 That He, to follow God's behest, 
      Must take us for His earthly dress! 
 For this, O Spirit, make us meet
      To be Thy garb, Thy work complete! 
 SOME PROMISED BLOOMS 
 (Isa. 61:11) 
 
 Though anemone and violet 
      Regale the woodland ways, 
 Some fairer blooms are promised yet 
      E'en righteousness and praise. 
 
 Which, as Earth puts forth her bud, 
      And causeth things to grow. 
 He, who sendeth all of good, 
      Shall for all nations sow. 
 
 Hence, flowers silent heralds are, 
      For as they spring and grow, 
 We know there hasteth, tho' afar, 
      His own great floral show. 
 A CONTRAST 
 
      "Nothing is known," 
      The Cynic said, 
 And sadly bowed his learned head. 
 "We mortals here—a mimic show— 
 May much surmise, but nothing know. 
 The Past? evolution disagree; 
 The Present? so near, no one rightly sees; 
 The Future? mere wild hypotheses." 
 
           "One I know," 
            The Christian said, 
 And raised aloft his trusting head. 
 "The One who keeps my sacred trust, 
 Redeems us from the mocking dust. 
 "The Past? God the dower; 
 The Present? kept by His power; 
 The Future? Faith's crowning hour." 
 ASPIRATIONS 
 
      O, Christ of Galilee, 
      Make Thyself known to me! 
 Thou, who didst the hungry feed, 
 Let me know something of the need 
      Of hungry souls: 
 That none may empty go away 
 For want of word that I should say. 
 
      O, Christ of Bethany, 
      Make Thyself known to me! 
 Thou, whom households loved to greet, 
 Let me learn also at Thy feet 
      The love that folds 
 All human loves within its own 
 And scatters joy as light is sown. 
 
      O, Christ of Calvary, 
      Make Thyself known to me! 
 Thou who gavest all so willingly, 
 Let mine be just such love for Thee, 
      That naught withholds; 
 Nor counteth not the human cost 
 Which spreads the glory of Thy cross. 
 IS YOUR NAME AHISAMACH? 
 (Suggested by a lesson in the "Drop-in-Bible Class," Y.W.C.A.) 
 
 Of all those queer old Hebrew names, 
 Which each a special meaning claims, 
 There is none one would more gladly own 
 Than that by Bezeleel's helper borne: 
 Ahisamach, "supporter of a brother," 
 Would you not love above all other? 
 
 Upon your arm does some one lean? 
 By some one's side can you be seen, 
 In some dark, crucial, trying hour, 
 To save her from the Tempter's power; 
 Swift to supply a sister's lack, 
 Is your name. Ahisamach? 
 
 Have you the love that some one needs? 
 Some heart that sadly droops and bleeds 
 For fellowship and some true friend 
 To whom to go, on whom depend, 
 For help along life's upward track, 
 Is your name Ahisamach? 
 
 When one is fainting beneath her load, 
 And tired, too, because of the road, 
 Is yours the ready word of cheer 
 To make that load less hard to bear? 
 Or to lift it from a sister's back, 
 Is your name Ahisamach? 
 
 Oh, life would easier, sweeter be, 
 For other souls near you and me, 
 Should we so wholly in Him trust, 
 His strength so perfect be in us, 
 He to our names could add this other, 
 "Ahisamach, supporter of a brother." 
 "BERECHAH" 
 (2 Chron. 20) 
 
 Forth to meet their enemies, 
      Those men of Judah went— 
 At the word of God by the prophet 
      Who to their king was sent— 
 In the dewv dawn of the morning,
      To the wilderness of Tekoa, 
 With no arms or ammunition, 
      Save to shout God's praises o'er! 
 
 They march'd to meet three armies, 
      Who had up against them come; 
 But, fearing not, they trusted God, 
      Who sent their praise shafts home ; 
 For the "liers-in-wait" were angel bands, 
      And more confused were they 
 Than if the men of Judah had 
      With weapons won the day. 
 
 Then, after the unfought battle 
      And the taking of great spoil, 
 When their foes all were vanquish'd 
      Without their martial toil, 
 Because the battle was the Lord's, 
      And He had fought for them, 
 They paused on the homeward journey 
      For a glad thanksgiving hymn; 
 
 Paused in a lowly valley, 
      Where, their gratitude expressing 
 In songs so high and jubilant, 
      Made it the vale of "Blessing." 
 From that blest day and forward, 
      For the hearts uplifted there, 
 They called that joyous trysting-place, 
      "Valley of Berechah." 
 COMMUNION 
 
 Just to go apart with Jesus, 
 Just to hear His still, small voice; 
 Just to wait upon His message, 
 Just to know He is my choice: 
 
 Just to hear my Saviour speaking 
 In the stillness of my soul; 
 Just to have the waves of blessing 
 O'er my waiting spirit roll; 
 
 O, 'tis sweetest of all pleasures 
 Thus to steal away to Him! 
 Thus to be alone with Jesus 
 And to feel His peace within. 
 
 I would often seek my Saviour, 
 I would never leave His side; 
 I would go forth in His presence, 
 And would in Him e'er abide ! 
 FULLEST LIFE 
 
 If Christ were living full in me, 
 How radiant my life would be! 
 How lost ones would Thy glory see, 
 If my poor heart continually 
 Kept open house alway for Thee! 
 
 Lord, of that living water give, 
 That I may in Thy fullness live; 
 O grant that there may daily be, 
 That well upspringing glad in me, 
 Refreshing, 'midst life's stress and strife. 
 Thy well-spring of eternal life! 
 If Christ were living full in me, 
 How luminous my life would be! 
 How it would shine far out to sea 
 And heaven-ward point unerringly 
 Had Christ abiding place with me! 
 
 If Christ were living full in me, 
 His risen life so rich and free, 
 How He would lead to victory. 
 And life abundant mine would be, 
 Self crucified and merged in Thee! 
 'THOUGH OUR OUTWARD MAN PERISH" 
  (2 Cor. 4:16) 
 
 "Though our outward man perish," 
      Worn by work and care, 
 If the Holy Spirit nourish, 
      The inner grows more fair. 
 
 "Though our outward man perish," 
      Grows weak to human view, 
 As the Holy One doth cherish, 
      The inner man's made new. 
 
 “Though our outward man perish," 
      At the call of mother clay, 
 The inner man shall flourish 
      Unto the perfect day! 
 "ACCOUNTED WORTHY" 
 (Luke 21:34-36) 
 
 To stand before the Son of man 
                Unshrinkingly, 
 When from His face, in that dread day, 
 Heaven and earth shall flee away, 
 To be accounted worthy then to stand, 
 Upright and calm at His right hand, 
 Our Lord, alone, makes known the way: 
                "Watch and pray!" 
 
 To stand before the Son of man 
                Preparedly; 
 Not freighted so with earthly cares; 
 That day approach us unawares; 
 But, like those virgins, wise, to be 
 Ready the bridegroom's face to see, 
 Our Lord alone makes known the way: 
               "Watch and pray!" 
 
 To stand before the Son of man 
                Victoriously, 
 When that unnumbered host shall come 
 For word of welcome, or of doom; 
 To be deemed worthy palms to wave, 
 White-robed, among the final brave, 
 In that fire-testing, judgment-day; 
 Said He, the Life, the Truth, the Way: 
                "Watch and pray !" 
 "JEHOVAH SHAMMAH" 
 (Ezek. 48:35) 
 
 A vision of the ideal city, 
      The exiled prophet saw, 
 And set it forth in all the beauty 
      That dwells in perfect law. 
 
 A city where Jehovah's glory,
      Once lost thro' sin and pride, 
 In this seer's redemption story 
      Is seen to ever abide. 
 
 A city where a river floweth, 
      Which doth such vigor give, 
 That it is said, where'er it goeth. 
      All living things shall live. 
 
 A name was to the city given. 
      That told what made it fair: 
 As it for God had humbly striven, 
      'Twas called: "The Lord is there." 
 THE WINNOWING-FAN 
 
 When o'er the rich and golden grain 
 There swept that quaint old winnowing-fan, 
 So swiftly parted was chaff from wheat, 
 The threshing-floor became a judgment seat: 
 Where husks were burned or blown away, 
 And the grain stored up for a coining day. 
 
 Thus John, while pondering it all o'er, 
 In the wilderness by the Dead Sea's shore, 
 Saw how this odd, old winnowing-fan 
 Portrayed the work of the Son of man: 
 How the clear light of His righteousness 
 Would be henceforth man's winnowing test 
 
 So true this picturesque metaphor, 
 Once used by John, who went before! 
 For still wherever Christ has come, 
 He's brought this sifting process home: 
 We're blown like chaff to the winds amain, 
 Or Ave rest in His garner as golden grain. 
 A NAME 
 
 So well he wrote and with such power, 
      Such logic, clear and keen, 
 Men call the epistles from his pen 
      Of very right —"Pauline." 
 
 They breathe the spirit of a man 
      Who, counting not the price. 
  So loved and served that he could say, 
      "For me to live is Christ." 
 
 In after years how it must thrill 
      And mould the life, I ween, 
 When parents o'er baptismal vows 
      Have named a child—"Pauline." 
 "WE AN INCORRUPTIBLE" 
 
 What things men do for crowns that fade, 
      For laurels lasting but a day! 
 What willing sacrifice is made 
      For just a wreath that will decay! 
 
 We, listed in a race where all 
      Receive unfading crowns of life, 
 May count those transient garlands small 
      To be but victors in this strife ! 
 THE CALL 
 
 The great "I Am" still speaks to men, 
 Still hears the needy's cry, I ken; 
 Where they in hopeless chains are bound, 
 Some one will find it "holy ground," 
 And turn from keeping sheep to see 
 The old Mount Horeb mystery: 
 Why burns the bush with living flame, 
 And yet its outline is the same! 
 In that hour on his ears shall fall 
 The great, all-thrilling service call: 
 And, awed and doubtful though he be, 
 He'll humbly answer, "Lord, send me." 
 KINSHIP WITH CHRIST 
  (Matt. 12:50) 
 
 Perhaps we may not trace our line 
 On pages where the records shine 
 With deeds of worth in town or state, 
 Which place some men among the great; 
 
 Perhaps earth-honored pedigree 
 Has fallen not to you and me; 
 But, list ye to the King of kings, 
 As He a higher kinship brings! 
 
 "Whoso," said He in tenderest love, 
 "Shall do my Father's will, above, 
 The same is kindred unto me— 
 Shall mother, brother or sister be!" 
 
 Father, we pray, Thy Spirit send, 
 Grant as our aim, our life's great end; 
 To kinship have with the King of kings, 
 And the deathless fame such record brings. 
 'THEY SHALL SEE HIS FACE" 
 
 However cloudy be their days,
 However strenuous their ways, 
 They know, who put their trust in Him, 
 These things that "wear the thickness thin,” 
 But bring them nearer to the place 
 Where "they shall see His face!" 
 
 O Face! that just to look upon 
 Shall mean their highest ideals won! 
 For when they see that visage fair, 
 They shall themselves its likeness wear. 
 Earth's fiercest tests shall leave no trace 
 When "they shall see His face!" 
 
 Oh, how it shoots through all the years 
 A light that dissipates their tears! 
 Who love Him know, whate'er betide, 
 That one day they'll be satisfied: 
 That day when they, O wondrous grace, 
 Behold that thorn-crowned, holy Face! 
 "THIS BEGINNING OF MIRACLES" 
 
 "Fill the water-pots with water," 
       They rilled them to the brim 
 At this word the Master spake 
       When Mary turned to Him; 
 Now draw out and bear, He said, 
      Lo, following His behests, 
 The festal wine is crimson red 
      They bear unto those guests! 
 Then that one whom Jesus loved, 
      Divined the wondrous story, 
 That this beginning sign there proved— 
      Made manifest His glory. 
 'THAT I MAY KNOW HIM" 
 (PhiL 3:16) 
 
 To know Him! O aim sublime, 
 Surpassing all the quests of time; 
 Pursuit of gold, of wealth or fame 
 Holds no such charm as Jesus' name! 
 To know Him! On coming morrows 
 To better know the Man of Sorrows— 
 The Christ our heavenly Father sent— 
 Is purpose high and life well spent. 
 
 To "know Him!" the Apostle flings 
 This word as he enraptured sings: 
 "All other things I count but dross 
 To know the glory of the cross!" 
 
 "NEITHER" 
 
 Neither rites, nor creeds, nor churchly forms 
           Avail with God above: 
 One thing alone His word requires: 
           Faith which works by love. 
 
 Neither Jew, nor Greek, nor bond, nor free; 
           No man by birth is known; 
 From Scythian shores or isles of Greece, 
           They all in Christ are one. 
 
 No one is high, no one is low,— 
            There is no great nor small ; 
 All human lines sink out of view 
           And Christ is all in all! 
 "THREE THINGS" 
 (On hearing: a sermon to children from Gen. 26:25) 
 
 Three things within the narrative 
      Are writ of one of old, 
 Whose name meant Laughter, and whose 
      Life held symbols manifold; 
 
 Wherever on his journeyings 
      This pilgrim chose to dwell, 
 He altar built, pitched his tent, 
      And then he digged a well. 
 
 An altar and a tenting-place 
      Should our life's story tell; 
 Then thirsty ones who follow us 
      Will find a living well. 
 GOD'S "BEST," NOT OURS 
 
 God cannot fully use the man 
 Whose aim is just "the best" he can; 
 To fill our souls with holy fire, 
 More than our "best" does He require. 
 
 It burned upon the lips of Paul 
 Who more abundant wrought than all; 
 With His strength as my guarantee, 
 All things can be performed by me. 
 
 Thus, the searching service test 
 Is not our boastful human "best;" 
 But through us and how mightily 
 Has worked the Christ of Galilee. 
 
 REMEMBERED LANDS 
 
 O land, remembered after years 
      Of waste and devastation, 
 O land, sought out by God again, 
      Thy people made a nation! 
 
 O exiled sires who loyal wept 
      By streams of Babylon, 
 The "Pleasant land" of your desire 
      His thoughts did dwell upon. 
 
 Till He restored the glory land, 
      He had first for you espied; 
 The sorrow of thy widowed years 
      His wrath hath satisfied. 
 
 Thy sons no more "Forsaken" art, 
      Nor thou termed "Desolate," 
 The Lord hath called thee "Beulah" land 
      And given thee new estate. 
 O Palestine and Africa, 
      Now stretching forth your hands, 
 Again thou shalt His glory see, 
      As His remembered lands ! 
 "AHAVA" 
 
 At Ahava, stream of Persia, 
 There we halted, fasted, pray'd 
 That o'er the robber-ridden desert 
 We might journey unafraid. 
 
 On Jehovah, God of battles, 
 We had rested, trusted, stay'd, 
 Now, in this, our hour of testing, 
 Could we seek for lesser aid? 
 
 By Ahava, stream of Persia, 
 Fears were routed, worsted, laid; 
 For our children, wives and treasure, 
 God our confidence was made. 
 
 From Ahava, stream of Persia, 
 With no visual guard of men; 
 But with God's "good hand" upon us 
 Safe we reached Jerusalem! 
 THE UNIVERSAL CALL 
 (Ps. 50:1) 
 
 From lands of dawn and rising sun 
 To where his westering course is run, 
 There comes to this old, teeming earth, 
 Thro' cypress shade and scenes of mirth, 
           The call of God. 
 
 No ear there is so dull but hears, 
 Somewhere adown the path of years, 
 The voice that heeds not class nor clan 
 But finds the longing heart of man— 
           The call of God. 
 
 More swift than wireless thro' the air. 
 While suns from morn to evening wear, 
 This summons comes that bids us rest, 
 That satisfies the heart's deep quest— 
           The call of God. 
 "THE LEGION OF THE LARK" 
 
 "Legion of the Lark," great Caesar called 
 Those daring men he chose from captive Gaul 
 To be his body-guard, and follow him 
 Thro' all his future wars and vict'ries grim;  
 Because they bore upon their helmets high 
 The image of that bird of song in upper sky; 
 For Caesar loved to have those warriors near 
 Who met the brunt of battle with songs of cheer. 
 
 His "Legion of the Lark" are soldiers of the King, 
 Who on the moral battlefield know how to fight and sing; 
 Who defeat the Prince of darkness in his most subtle ways, 
 As nothing so appals him as constant prayer and praise; 
 Thus those Christian soldiers, who season with a song 
 Every stern engagement, are God's Legion of the strong; 
 And we may well imagine their sweetest notes will come 
 As a final strain of triumph when they are soaring home. 
 "NOT OTHERWISE" 
 
 Into a room where a sick one lay, 
      One day her pastor came to pray. 
 He thought to find the maiden sad, 
      And pondered long what words he had 
 To comfort bring where want and pain 
      Had done the work of that dread twain. 
 "’Tis hard to bear, I know," he said, 
      Taking a seat beside her bed. 
 She looked at him in pained surprise, 
      And spoke, as a light shone in her eyes, 
           "I would not have it otherwise." 
 
 "Not otherwise! how can you say 
      With life now in its opening day? 
 It must be hard to just lie here— 
      Within this room so void of cheer?" 
 He watched her face in wonder now, 
      Such radiance lighted eye and brow; 
 "Why you, yourself, have often told 
      How Christ gives blessings manifold. 
 I've found it true; in His will lies 
      All peace, and leaves no room for sighs; 
           I would not have it otherwise!" 
 
 The man of God went on his way, 
      Hers was the ministry that day; 
 Within that barren, upper room, 
      He'd found his sermons lived at home; 
 The calm which comes, he'd often said, 
      When all is on the altar laid— 
 Into his house, to think it o'er, 
      He passed and closed his study door. 
 There he, too, came to realize 
      That this was life's one greatest prize: 
           Not to "Have it otherwise." 
 
 "THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE BEFORE" 
 (Phil. 3:13) 
 
 "Those things which are before," 
  The things that give us wings to soar 
 In vision to that heavenly land, 
 Where our Christ reigns at God's right hand, 
 Blest end of all I seek and preach, 
 Towards these I reach! 
 Those things which make the cloudy days, 
 All bright with special hymns of praise, 
 That seeing, one doth plainly say, 
 "I seek a kingdom far away," 
 The things that transcend human speech, 
 Towards these I reach! 
 
 "Those things" on high which are before, 
 Mean climbing days are never o'er; 
 That as the Old Year's shades are falling, 
 I upward press to God's "high calling," 
 In Christ, the end of all I teach, 
 Towards Him I reach! 
 "THAT BREAD OF LIFE" 
 
 (Suggested by a Sunday School Lesson on the Giving of Manna) 
 
 Christ, "that bread of life, 
      If daily in the strife, 
 We did but feast on Thee, 
       How strong our lives would be! 
 
 O Christ, "that Bread of life, 
      As doctrines false are rife, 
 O may our tempters see 
      We are faring well on Thee! 
 They who on manna fed, 
      Did eat and they are dead; 
 Be Thou our souls supply, 
      That we may never die ! 
 GOD'S SECRET 
 
 (Ps. 25:14) 
 
 Precious pacts we have with dear ones, 
      Sweetest things in secret said 
 Only for the ears of near ones: 
      Hearts that to our hearts are wed. 
 
 But sweeter far to those that fear Him 
      Is the secret of the Lord, 
 Only shared with those most near Him: 
      Hearts with Him in blest accord. 
 Highest motive to revere Him: 
      That His life for ours was spent; 
 Just because He'd have us near Him 
      Wide the temple veil was rent ! 
 OMNIPOTENCE 
 
           A whole Red Sea 
 Is quite impassable to you and me; 
 But God's power at man's impossible starts, 
 And, lo, each Red Sea He divides in parts! 
 CHRIST’S ACQUAINTANCESHIP 
 
 He to the sad and sorrow-worn 
      Affords a swift and sure relief, 
 Because He, who hath our nature borne, 
      Acquainted was with grief. 
 
 One thing, howe'er, was never writ 
      In that Book—our fondest treasure—  
 That He, who is the source of it, 
      Acquainted was with pleasure! 
 A PRAYER 
 
 Use me, Lord, use me for my race, 
 To send their status up a pace; 
 To make their merits better known; 
 Hasten their coming to their own! 
 
 Use me, Lord, use me for Thy Church, 
 May lost ones never vainly search 
 For the glow of my small light 
 Out upon the world's dark night! 
 
 Use me, Lord, use for Thyself alone, 
 The life that's ransom'd by Thine own; 
 May it a living letter be— 
 With a message straight from Thee! 
 "NO MORE SEA" 
 (Suggested by a poem in the Literary Digest, regretting the absence of the sea from heaven) 
 
      "There shall be no more sea," 
 For endless sorrow rests 
 Upon its ever-heaving crests; 
 In that land where many mansions be,
 Sorrow and sighing away shall flee, 
      There could be "no more sea." 
 
      "There shall be no more sea," 
 For the wicked are like its troubled waves, 
 Whom nothing quiets, nothing saves ; 
 In that realm where all is melody, 
 And peace as a river flows on in majesty, 
       There can be no more sea! 
 
      "There shall be no more sea!" 
 The sea divides, and causes salt, salt tears; 
 Begets forebodings and unbidden fears; 
 There souls exult; no partings know, nor sighs, 
 As God doth wipe away all tears from our eyes. 
      "There shall be no more sea!" 
 
      "There shall be no more sea!" 
 I am glad this word was said— 
 The sea shall cease to be when it gives up its dead!  
 For when we are transplanted to that home above, 
 There'll only be one ocean—the ocean of God's love! 
 
 "UNREST" 
 
 They tell us there's unrest today, 
 That men grope blindly for the Way; 
 That the price we've paid for liberty 
 Is a world-drifting "all at sea." 
 
 They tell us that old truths are dead; 
 That the last word has not been said; 
 Love's waxen cold and faith diminished; 
 So we've forgotten: ‘It is finished.' 
 
 Tell, tell us (but it is not so), 
 That men know not the way to go; 
 For still there's Christ and Calvary, 
 The Risen One, saying: "Come unto me." 
 
 Though times may change, the Truth endures, 
 And Christ's touch still man's fever cures; 
 And still He calls to rest and peace; 
 He breaks the bow, makes wars to cease. 
 
 No talk of "change" must faith dissever, 
 Since Christ's the same "today, forever," 
 Our yesterdays—lived in His name— 
 Still point the path to deathless fame. 
 
 "THE OLD PATHS" 
 
 (Jer. 6:16) 
 
 Those old lov'd paths across the scented fields, 
 Where we so lightly trod the well-worn way, 
 Inhaling fragrance of the new-mown hay, 
 Or perfume which the sweet white clover yields; 
 Till scent of hay and clover magic wields 
 And visions new each care-free, happy day, 
 When papa's loving hand-clasp seem'd to say: 
 Here's all the shelter of a thousand shields! 
 Those ancient paths, anent the seer's behest, 
 As he, while streaming tears his eyes o'erfill, 
 Bade Israel forsake her wayward quest, 
 Bear they a likeness to these ways of rest? 
 It must be so, for we are children still, 
 And those "old paths" our Heavenly Father's will. 
FESTIVAL DAYS 
 
 THE NEW YEAR AND SONG 
 
 Start the New Year singing, 
 Keep God's praises ringing, 
 Cheer to sad hearts bringing; 
 Start the New Year singing! 
 
 Start the New Year singing, 
 Keep Hope's pinions winging, 
 Wide the glad notes flinging; 
 Start the New Year singing! 
 
 Start the New Year singing, 
 To the old tunes clinging, 
 They with grace are ringing; 
 Start the New Year singing! 
 
 Start the New Year singing, 
 Song is faith upspringing, 
 Victory's gates outswinging; 
 Start the New Year singing! 
 FACING THE FUTURE 
 (Isa. 55:12) 
 
 As we life's journey tread, 
 Though mountains loom ahead, 
 We need not faint nor fear, 
 For the hills shall disappear; 
 Lo, as we onward march along, 
 We'll find them cleft with sons:! 
 THE NEW YEAR 
 
 What a word is this for the glad New Year, 
 To send us forth with a heart of cheer! 
 We shall place our regnant banners here: 
 'The set of their faces was forward!" 
 
 The year spreads out as an open book, 
 There is no time for a backward look; 
 We've closed the account, a reck'ning took—
 The set of our faces is forward. 
 
 There's an upward path and a shining way, 
 A light that falls from the King of day, 
 And we shall win in the battle's fray, 
 The set of our faces is forward! 
 
 THE MESSAGE OF EASTER 
 
 In the gray down of Easter morn, 
 Joy to the world was newly born; 
 In the empty tomb and riven gloom 
 Sprang Hope—a Star-to earth illume. 
 
 In the low word which Mary stirred, 
 Such magic rang that we have heard; 
 Our names He calls and on us falls 
 The rapture that our lives enthralls. 
 
 Death's chain is broken, to us the token 
 Then to the women sweetly spoken; 
 The night is o'er, He goeth before;
 Go spread the news from shore to shore. 
 
 By lives of light, show forth the might 
 That broke the pow'r of Death that night; 
 Give every soul by sin imprison'd 
 A chance to know that Christ has risen! 
 "BECAUSE HE LIVES" 
 
 As by the death of Him who was 
       Holy and undefiled, 
 We to the Maker of mankind 
      Have now been reconciled, 
 Much more, then, by His risen life, 
      Which He so freely gives. 
 We here are conquerors in the strife; 
      We live because He lives. 
 
 As by the path of death He went 
      Fearless and undismayed, 
 We, too, within our narrow house 
      May trustingly be laid; 
 For there we shall not long abide,
      Because He ever lives. 
 We shall rise upward to His side 
       In the new life He gives. 
 
 "CHILDREN OF THE RESURRECTION” 
 (Luke 20:36) 
 
 A name all permeate with power 
 And beauteous as hte Easter flower, 
 Is that, we read, is on them called 
 Who're counted worthy of that world, 
 Rich blossom of their earth selection: 
      "Children of the resurrection." 
 
 Who dropp'd, with flesh, the ways of men 
 And rose with Him to live again— 
 Lives pure as holy angels are, 
 Sans spot, or wrinkle or a flaw, 
 By seal divine is their election: 
      "Children of the resurrection." 
 
 Offsprings, they, upon whose brow 
 Death's shadow never cometh now. 
 Of earth, once mortals' paths they trod,
 Of heaven, now the sons of God, 
 Theirs is for aye the life perfection: 
      "Children of the resurrection." 
 "THERE WAS DARKNESS" 
 
 The earth is bright today, 
 Because Christ went the way 
      Of Calvary. 
 The gloom and darkness there 
 Have made the whole earth fair 
 On us God's face doth shine 
 Because 'twas hid from Thine 
      On Calvary. 
 Out of Thy three hours' nig'ht 
 Has come our grace of light! 
 THE CHILDREN'S HOSANNAS 
 
 Christ loved their guileless praise 
      And would not them deny; 
 King of the hearts of men, He knew 
      They would not change their cry: 
 Today, hosannas on their tongues, 
      The next, "Away to die!" 
 
 Christ heard and spake to those 
      Who'd chide their joyous ways, 
 "Have ye not read 'tis said of old, 
      In David's tuneful lays, 
 That God hath chosen such as these 
      To set forth perfect praise?" 
 
 Christ knew Earth understood 
      The children's happy chorus; 
 And said that had they silent been, 
      The stones had spoken for us! 
 Oh, may we never hold our peace, 
      When the Spirit stealeth o'er us! 
 THE FIRST EASTER MORNING 
 
 I'm glad that women linger'd longest 
      Where "they crucified Him." 
 I'm glad their love was true and strongest 
      That they ne'er denied Him! 
 
 I'm glad that three of them were first 
      At day's faint dawning, 
 To find that He death's chains had burst 
      On earth's first Easter morning! 
 
 I'm glad it was a woman's name 
      Held His first greeting; 
 When Mary to the garden came— 
      Oh, that wondrous meeting! 
 THANKSGIVING 
 
 Every day, if praise be given, 
 Contains a little bit of heaven; 
 Every day if met with cheer, 
 Is just "the best day of the year." 
 
 Each hath given its full share 
 Towards the harvests rich and fair; 
 Each has kept, in tears or mirth, 
 God's ancient covenant with earth. 
 
 A twelvemonth of such wealthy days 
 Merits the Nation's song of praise; 
 Calls each soul to come away 
 And joyful keep Thanksgiving Day. 
 
 To quit the busy paths we've trod, 
 And spend at least one day with God, 
 Who says, My habitat with Israel 
 Is in the place where praises dwell. 
 
 OUR SOURCE OF STRENGTH 
 
 To live the whole year's busy length, 
      And at its close stand with the strongs 
 Upon our lips the victor's song. 
      God's joy must be our 'biding strength. 
 It sings in all the ripened grain, 
      Our golden fields from east to west, 
 With flocks and harvests richly blest, 
      Are bars of His great triumph strain. 
 
 It wells in every battle fought,
       (By tongue or pen, or by the sword, 
 That nations may with right accord) 
      Which has for lasting progress wrought. 
 
 But finds its fullest, highest chord 
      In those who, following His ways, 
 Have made their lives a psalm of praise, 
      As daily walked they with their Lord! 
 
 Thus our whole great nation's strength 
      Lies in the things of God's delight: 
 In Mercy, Justice, Truth and Right, 
      Throughout her breadth and border's length. 
 WHEN THE HEART KEEPS CHRISTMAS 
 
 Still there shines that glory light, 
 Which made the skies so passing bright 
 Upon that far-off Holy Night, 
           When the heart keeps Christmas. 
 
 Still unto our Lord and King, 
 We, as the Wise Men, haste to bring 
 Our costliest and most precious thing. 
           When the heart keeps Christmas. 
 
 Still to all who 'round us dwell. 
 With glad and reverent lips we tell 
 The tidings of ''Emanuel"— 
           When the heart keeps Christmas. 
 THE HEART OF CHRISTMAS 
 
 'Twere sad indeed at Christmas time,
 With all the sleigh-bells' merry chime,
 The auto's noisy puff and gong, 
 To fail to catch the angel's song. 
 
 But sadder still to have our eyes 
 So chained to what about us lies; 
 To raise them not for the vision higher, 
 The radiance of that heavenly choir. 
 
 Saddest, if seeking here and there 
 For Christmas bargains cheap and rare;
 For gifts to make our fellow men, 
 We miss the road to Bethlehem. 
 
 For then, indeed, the hymn would cease 
 Ere we had caught its note of Peace; 
 And, missing the chant, the sight sublime, 
 We'd lose the heart of Christmas-time. 
 
 MARY'S PART 
 
 To the shepherds came the music 
      Of that seraphic angel throng,
 That made the plains of Bethlehem 
      Reverberate with their song. 
 Theirs, too, was the joy of seeing, 
      When the angels had gone away, 
 The Babe, who, as 'twas told them, 
      In a lowly manger lay. 
 But, more blest than outward vision, 
      Or the rustle of angel wings, 
 Is that word one said of Mary: 
      She ponder’d and "kept these things." 
 
 For the sweetest song hath ending, 
      And the vision will not stay; 
 But the gain of once-heard music 
      Lies just in Mary's way. 
 To the inner ear of the Spirit 
      Will come that wondrous song, 
 And its words of joy and comfort 
      Their bliss for aye prolong 
 Thro' the common days that follow 
      'Midst cold traffic's busy mart, 
 If our is the stored-up treasure 
      And Mary's pondering part. 
 GOD'S GIFT 
 
 Oh, friends, who also have started 
      On the road to the City of Light, 
 Let us keep, in rapture, clear-hearted, 
      The memory of that "Holy Night." 
 When a Saviour to mortals was given; 
      When the clouds with joy were riven 
 As the heavenly visitants came, 
      Out of a brightness aflame. 
 To make known the infant's name; 
      And all Earth's corners to fill 
 With peace to men and good will! 
      Aye, these are the things in December, 
 We love, best of all, to remember. 
      May we never from their anchorage drift, 
 But keep fast hold of God's Gift! 
MISCELLANEOUS 
 
 ROBERT BROWNING 
 (May 7, 1912; born May 7, 1812) 
 
 The Joy that sees the roses, 
      Jeweled with heavenly dew; 
 The bloom that May discloses, 
      Beauteous for me and you; 
 
 The Love that's lyric-human, 
      Euterpe's rarest wine, 
 That fiinds its "Star" in woman, 
      Its Christ, the One Divine; 
 
 The Faith that walks "breast forward," 
      Bouyantly the emerald sod; 
 That meets Death as no coward, 
      Clear-eyed, so "sure of God"; 
 
 Are ours because one morning, 
      A century's flight away, 
 To earth came Robert Browning. 
      In the "blossom month" of May. 
 THE CLUB WOMAN 
 
 Hers to fill the vacant place 
      And do the thing that none else sees; 
 To all life's vexing problems face 
      And many an unfair burden ease; 
 
 To stand beside the working girl, 
      And all who, silent, suffer wrong; 
 To soften commerce's busy whirl 
      With just a little bit of song; 
 
 To be in home, in church and state 
      A power that ever makes for good, 
 Whose purpose is to elevate 
      And nobler make all womanhood; 
 
 To so enlarge the mind and eye 
      That life, tho' immanent with Duty, 
 Over it the humblest may descry 
      The perfect rainbow arc of Beauty; 
 
 To have it broadly understood, 
      Thro' ways that seem but purely human, 
 That naught which makes for sisterhood 
      Is foreign to the true club woman. 
 ROBIN REDBREAST 
 (Written for a little child) 
 
 Robin Redbreast the other day
 Came with merry notes to say: 
 "Winter's snow has gone away." 
 He lighted on my garden fence, 
 And twittered cheerily from thence; 
 So glad was he that it was Spring, 
 He couldn't tarry long to sing, 
 But soon again was on the wing; 
 For, having news so very good, 
 He flew to tell the neighborhood; 
 While I was very glad that he 
 Had cheered me with his company; 
 That sight of him I had not miss'd, 
 Being on Red Robin's calling list! 
 ANNIVERSARY SONG 
 TUNE: "Battle Hymn of the Republic." 
 (Written for and sung at Detroit Y.W.C.A. February, 1916.) 
 
 To-day we have a sisterhood that wide its flag unfurls, 
 And sends afar its bugle note to ever-widening worlds, 
 Because fifty years ago there was some one who thought of girls! 
 We girls are marching on. 
 
                          CHORUS : 
       Praise Jehovah for our founders! 
       Praise Jehovah for our founders! 
       Praise Jehovah for our founders! 
       We girls are marching on! 
 
 To shield them from the Tempter who so swift  his arrow hurls, 
 And daily seeks to them engulf in follies' madd'ning whirls, 
 Just fifty years ago there was some one who thought of girls! 
 We girls are marching on ! 
 
 To show those hours have enterprise that're girt with song of merles, 
 To teach them how to work aright and seek all goodly pearls, 
 Just fifty years ago this month somebody thought of girls! 
 We girls are marching on! 
 
 ANNIVERSARY HYMN* 
 TUNE: "How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds." 
 
 We meet within this sacred place, 
      Rich with our hopes and fears, 
 Glad sons of Ethiopia's race, 
      To mark a hundred years. 
 
 Since Allen, our great founder, stood 
      On that historic day, 
 For Christ and human brotherhood 
      To all who own His sway. 
 
 Thro' fire and flood and slav'ry's night, 
      Within a weary land, 
 Our Zion proved a beacon light, 
      Her priests a helping hand. 
 
 So beautiful their rev'rent feet, 
      As they the Gospel spread, 
 'Tis ours to catch its martial beat, 
      The music of their tread! 
 
 To-day upon this hallowed ground, 
      To crown our jubilee, 
 We'd own, with fervor newly found, 
  The Man of Galilee!

 OUR TERCENTENARY  
 (1620-1920) 
 
 Three wonder-holden centuries have flown 
 Since first we claimed this country as our own; 
 O, Spirit Divine, we pray Thee on us come, 
 Forbid that they should pass us silent, dumb; 
 But may we see, as writ in living fire, 
 Some thrilling word that shall all hearts inspire 
 Thrown 'cross the scroll of each one hundred years, 
 Which mark a Nation's growth—its hopes and fears. 
 To fittingly epitomize and vocal make 
 These bygone centuries—a torch to onward take! 
 
 This trinity of cycles, we reverently would say 
 First, shows us God the Father who led the Pilgrims all the way 
 As they in work and worship as comrades bravely stood, 
 We read its living message in the great word— 
                BROTHERHOOD! 
 Then seeing God, the Son, who truly makes men free, 
 With pen immersed in crimson we spelled out 
                LIBERTY! 
 The closing of the triad brings us to this hour 
 And with awed gaze we read the Spirit's gift 
                of POWER! 
 
 Yet, God of our fathers, we cannot fully celebrate 
 Until we know this land once more is consecrate 
 To God, the Father of us all, 
 To the Anointed One, who knows no great and no small. 
 And to the Holy Ghost who would send us onward from this hour, 
 A mighty nation—clothed with living Power. 
 "THE WINGS OF THE MORNING." 
 
 They are pinions zepher blown 
 From some far-off seraph zone; 
 They are unseen ships of air, 
 That will waft us otherwhere. 
 
 They are cherub chariots free 
 To the utmost paths of sea, 
 Waiting each diurnal round 
 On our Fancy "outward bound." 
 A WINTER PICTURE 
 
 Oh, the sunlight on the snow! 
 And the little twigs aglow! 
 Thro' the wooing of Jack Frost 
 All uncomeliness is lost, 
 When a winter morning's sun 
 Smiles on what the night has done. 
 
 Oh, the sunlight on the snow! 
 And the barren shrubs aglow! 
 Tis a beauty close at hand, 
 For the parks are fairyland, 
 And trees yester'eve so bare 
 Now crystal pennants wear! 
 
 Oh, pity those who do not know 
 The charm of sunlight on the snow; 
 Whose sun-kiss'd eyes have never seen 
 The trees in all their wintry sheen! 
 
 ANNIVERSARY HYMN 
 (Celebrating the 80th Anniversary of the founding of Bethel A.M.E. Church, Detroit., Michigan, May 29, 1921.) 
 
 TUNE: "Federal Street, L.M." 
 
 When we reflect on all God's ways, 
       His dealings with our Zion here, 
 We can but lift our hearts in praise 
       For blessings on each passing year. 
 
 For all the countless deeds of love, 
       For victories His grace hath brought, 
 We grateful lift our eyes above 
        And humbly cry, "What hath God wrought!" 
 
 For eighty years our Bethel's kept 
       The faith, once given to the saints, 
 Spotless and pure, though oft she's wept, 
       And upward sent her tears and plaints. 
 
 From small beginnings we have grown, 
       From days of debt and hours of stress, 
 Till lo! we now this temple own, 
       And here two thousand Christ confess! 
 
 We thank God that He keeps her still, 
       And calls this Bethel—House of God; 
 With forward look to do Thy will 
       We follow where our fathers trod! 
 
 "SCHOOL, DRIVE SLOWLY”
 
 A little sign in white and red, 
       Designed and set most duly, 
 To check autoists, speeding ahead, 
       Reads: "School, drive slowly." 
 
 That little ones to daily tasks 
       May safely go and wholly, 
 The City warns and frequent asks 
       This: "School, drive slowly." 
 
 A little sign, when thought controls, 
       Is writ 'cross life most truly; 
 Lest injury should hap to souls, 
       Heed: "School, drive slowly." 
 LOST—OUR LITTLE GIRLS 
 
 What's become of little girls 
       Who used to wear such pretty dresses, 
 That they've lost all but their curls— 
       And loss of these ofttimes distresses? 
 
 What's become of little girls? 
       They don't look dainty any more; 
 So early shaped to fashion's whirls, 
       They'll ne'er be women at the core! 
 When you see the tots at play, 
       Which is Sally, which is Jim? 
 For your life you couldn't say, 
       Though your eyesight isn't dim. 
 
 O, Dame Fashion, keep your sway, 
       If you must, 'mid social whirls: 
 But restore Ye Olden Day— 
       Give us back our little girls! 
 
 OUR FLAG 
 (June 14, 1777, to June 14, 1914) 
 
 Banner of our country's magnificent domain, 
 We hail thy anniversary that comes to us again! 
 Proudly we review these one hundred and odd years 
 Since at a cost unreckon'd of precious blood and tears, 
 Liberty and Right proclaimed their sovran sway, 
 And, sweeping the might of crowned heads away, 
 Unfurled a new Republic's sacred ensign here, 
 And lit the lamp of Progress on this western hemisphere. 
 
 Flag that proudly waves from east to western sea, 
 Thrice baptized in crimson by thy passion to be free! 
 Thine ideal a nation where all men equal are, 
 And each is reprsented in his state's resplendent star. 
 Oh, still this soil is hallow'd long as thy starry folds 
 Wave grandly over veterans of the days that tried men's souls; 
 To-day before a patriot would see thy laurel's less, 
 He to the steel of conflict would bare his loyal breast; 
 In this high expectation which doth each bosom thrill— 
 That all "thy ancient glory shall play about thee still!" 
 THE SYMBOL OF THE RED CROSS 
 
 They've hungry children fed 
 Where bullets terror spread, 
 That's why their cross is red! 
 
 Their steps in mercy led 
 Where human blood was shed, 
 That's why their cross is red! 
 
 They've words of comfort sped 
 To souls to sorrow wed, 
 That's why their cross is red! 
 
 They've the glad Evangel read 
 Beside the soldier's bed, 
 That's why their cross is red! 
 
 "To serve," I came, Christ said, 
 He who on Calvary bled; 
 That's why their cross is red!
 
 A WAR-TIME PRAYER—1917. 
 
 Father, in heaven, Thy purposes prove, 
 Through the dark shadows, may we feel Thy love! 
 Christ, our Redeemer, who alone sets men free, 
 Guide, guard our soldiers, who cross the blue sea! 
 Tried in war's furnace, may the fires refine; 
 Called on to suffer, may we not repine; 
 Purg'd of our vanity, shorn of our pride; 
 Out from the trenches, we'd rise purified;
 Let democracy's triumph, distinctions efface, 
 All men be brothers, regardless of race!
 
 THE SOURCE OF WARS 
 (James 4:1) 
 
 "Whence come wars?" the apostle cries, 
       In eager wish to set men's eyes 
 On those secret hidden things 
       From which trouble constant springs. 
 Come they not, as flame from embers, 
       From those lusts within your members? 
 Hidden far from human gaze, 
       In your hearts, there starts the blaze. 
 
 Coverings of another's wealth,
       Desire to take his land by stealth, 
 Marshal hosts no gas nor high grenade 
       With strength to kill hath e'er been made. 
 Church of God, just here's your place: 
       War's not vanquish'd save by grace; 
 If you would "leadership" maintain, 
       Tell the OLD STORY o'er again! 
 WHEN THE HEART KEEPS CHRISTMAS 
 
 Still there shines that glory light, 
 Which made the skies so passing bright 
 Upon that far-off Holy Night, 
       When the heart keeps Christmas. 
 
 Still unto our Lord and King, 
 We, as the Wise Men, haste to bring 
 Our costliest and most precious thing, 
       When the heart keeps Christmas. 
 
 Still to all who 'round us dwell, 
 With glad and reverent lips we tell 
 The tidings of "Emanuel,"— 
       When the heart keeps Christmas.

WE WHO FROM WESTERN WINDOWS
We who from western windows gaze upon sunset skies
     See in their changing splendors promise that satisfies—
Of tender gloam of twilight and night with soothing blest—
     With soft enfolding darkness and quiet, grateful rest.
We who in morning's promise often have found defeat, 
     Bowed beneath heavy burdens, fainted with noonday heat;
Who have with trembling fingers, lifted the cup of pain, 
     Grieved o'er the bitter losses, cherished the meager gain; 
Found in the dust and mire wonderful gems of truth—
     We call to you, ye dwellers, in your fair House of Youth
Call from our western windows to your unfolding day,
     Hail all the stress and struggles waiting you o'er its way. 
Knowing that after sorrow you will hold joy more sweet
     After the threatened failure achievement more complete;
After the task has driven to your last fiber's test
     You then will know how gracious is Heaven's gift of rest;
That for the farther reaches of your aspiring souls
     You will gain strength and courage making the nearer goals.
Certain if you have striven well, you at length shall know
     All of the joy and blessing ot evening's sunset glow.
A VISION
Sometimes a vision flashes out to me
Of more abundant life that is to be!
It may be when some woe-worn face has smiled;
Or when, ere the day's dawning, sweet and clear, 
A bird-song breaks on my dreamy-drowsy ear;
Or when has laughed a happy little child,—
Sometimes a vision flashes out to me
Of more abundant life that is to be!
Anon, it is when in some squalid place
A lovely blossom lifts its tiny face;
A mother's lullaby at twilight time;
A night-star's glow from heaven's deeper hue;
The rainbow mirrored in a drop of dew;
The Sabbath-morning bells' uplifting chime,—
Sometimes a vision flashes out to me
Of more abundant life to be!
Then all the present things that hurt and vex, 
The questionings that trouble and perplex, 
For a brief moment seem to fade away;
And the swift glimpse of life's full treasure-trove,
Its unspent wealth of beauty, joy, and love, 
Give surety of the coming "better day,”—
Sometimes a vision flashes out to me
Of more abundant life that is to be!
A BLOSSOM IN AN ALLEY
A blossom in a window, in a city's alley dark—
I see it, and my smoldering laith leaps to a glowing spark.
For I can read its message of all-pervading good, 
Its earnest of a sweeter life, a closer brotherhood.
For the same urge that guided the rough hand that place it there, 
Inspired wealth's richest garden, teeming with exotics rare
And Beauty, answering, reck'd not of hovel or of hall—
But that a human soul had craved and she had felt its call!
O, ye who, patient, seek the eternal verities
'Mid intricate mazes of our life's diversities
Of creed and caste and calling, and perchance have failed the mark,—
Go see a blossom growing in a city's alley dark!
THY SONG
As thy heart bids thee, sing thy song
     So true and sweet,
The busy, heedless, passing throng
     Will pause to greet
With answering smile, perchance, or tear,
     Thy sweet, true strain,
And feel with thee a kinship near
     In joy or pain.
Or, live thy song, 'tis in thy heart 
     To sing or live;
Life's melody will miss the part
     Thou dost not give—
In other hearts along thy way
     Chords slumbering
Touched by the music of thy lay
     May wake and sing.
THE EFFORT SMALL.
One cup of water where a thousand thirst,
     One hand to succor where a thousand die,
Yet, to withhold thy meager aid thou durst
     Not, tho, for impotence, thy soul must cry.
Fulfill today Love's impulse, do the deed
     Infinitesimal beside the need—
Tomorrow, Justice may, with open hand
     Scatter the needed good broadcast the land!
YOUR LITTLE
Your little deed of uplift
     May set some fallen soul
Upon a safer pathway
     Toward a higher goal.
Your little creed lived simply—
     In league with all divine—
May, in the lives of many 
     In bright reflection shine.
Your little pure devotion
     May make the great world heed
And help fulfill your vision
     Of service to some need.
Your little cheerful giving
     Of self with meager gold 
May, with divine increasing
     Become the hundredfold.
Your little righteous protest
     Uttered with courage strong
May send afar conviction
     Against outstanding wrong.
Your little note of gladness
     Sung clear and sweet and true
May start a wondrous chorus
     Singing in tune with you.
And e'er a blest reaction
     Shall bring you rarest gain—
Your little will uplift you
     Unto life's higher plane!
LIFE
A warp of joy and a woof of sorrow,
The sun today and a cloud tomorrow
     And life the whole.
Nor light nor shade, nor mirth nor mourning—
Blent in the web in rare adorning—
     May we control. 
A Master mind with infinite kindness
And ken transcending our human blindness
     The whole hath planned.
And the pattern grows with true precision
Tho we tollow not with our hounded vision, 
     The skillful Hand.
THE SNOWDROP
Ah, little flow'r, thy pale, pure face,
Lifted from earth's breast cold and drear, 
Wears in its beauty sweeter grace
Than summer flow’rs, brings truer cheer;
For thou, from winter's meager store
Thy meed of loveliness didst press.
June's lavishness could give no more;
From nature's stint thou conned no less.
COMPENSATION
The raindrops swift descending
     Are gems, pellucid, round;
Too soon—the Fancy ending.
     They break upon the ground!
But Nature's compensation
     Waits on Spring's budding hours–
Thy gems disintegration
     Will bring her gift of flowers!
A MEMORY
After some little outing of a night—
     A picture-play, a concert in the parks 
Home coming, you went first into the dark
     And found the button and turned on the light.
And I would linger like a timid child
     Upon the threshold 'till you turned and smiled.
It was a little idyl without word—
     I on the threshold like a timid child,
You in the light assuring as you smiled—
     A ripple where the tender depths had stirred.
And then, the last Home coming, that last night 
     And you have entered first, and I the while 
Upon the threshold 'till you turn and smile 
     And beckon me, with you, into the light.
THE GIFT BENEFICENT
An Eden barred, pronounced the fiat dread,
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread—
We read with troubled hearts and holden eyes
Til life reveals a blessing in disguise;
A grief falls heavily upon the mind,
Then work becomes from Heaven a boon most kind,
The daily task a gift beneficent,
Soothing to patience, and at length, content.
SATISFIED IDEALS
The poet clothes his noblest thought
     In words that glow as jewels bright,
The artist's potent brush has brought 
     His dream of beauty into light;
The last skilled stroke, a building stands 
     An honor to the workman's hands;
The mother plies, till shining, clean,
     Her humble home might house a queen.
They each have striven and each one feels
The joy of satisfied ideals.
Upon the sill in this same hour
God brings to perfect bloom a flower!
FULFILLMENT
If, tho my far-spent strength must fail
     With cherished goal in sight,
I can with my last effort hail
     Him who hath scaled the height;
If music I would fain express
     Elude me while I long
I yet can sing with cheerfulness
     Found in another's song, 
Count not the feebler effort lost
     Nor failure wholly mine–
Perchance I gained at dearer cost
     Fulfilment more divine!
BLUE AND GRAY
A patch of blue in the sky's dark gray 
And hope upsprings for a shining day;
But patch of gray on the blue o'erhead 
And hope for a shining day has fled.
If blue o'erspreads or if melts the gray, 
From either there follows a perfect day.
Or blue, or gray—is my meaning clear?—
We may always hope and we should not fear.
EASTER PICTURES
Fair Easter in time's cloistered gallery
Are pictures rare and beautiful of thee,
Soft and subdued by lenten thot and prayer,
My chastened heart would con the lessons there.
Lo, Salem's "upper room" and paschal board,
Passion swayed human group, a tender Lord 
Serves, towel-girt. Humility divine!
Behold thy pattern, prideful heart of mine!
The somber scene of Gethsemane's dark shade, 
Overwrought nature in deep slumber laid;
Alone the Christ, the bitter cup of pain
Pressed to his lips. O, heart, dost thou complain—
And push aside the chalice marah brimmed?
Linger thou, here, thine eyes erewhile tear-dimmed,
Nor turn away till thou at length hast won
The strength to say, "Thy will, not mine, be done."
Lo, next the judgement hall and abject 
Hate Strikes with his puny arm. God, incarnate, 
Silent, endures! Well may the scene appall, 
Yet, learn thou here, Love that "endureth" all. 
A hill outside the gate with brow cross-capped
Circled with motley, gaping crowd; gloom-wrapped 
In strange eclipse; thunder, and cruel jeers,
A soul's last prayer, and women's heart-wrung tears.
Calvary! and a world's salvation bought
O, heart, canst fathom the great love that brought 
The heavy price that in last death-throe cries
"Tis finished!" and, pain-spent and bleeding dies?
Above the dew-damp garden, stars of night
Shine thro the gloom of morning's dim twilight;
And women, timid, yet by love o'erswayed,
Approach the tomb wherein their Lord was laid.
To their sad quest a shining angel said,
"Why seek the living here among the dead?"
Words half divined- a light of glad surprise 
Struggles for mastery in tear dimmed eyes!
"Not here!" O, heart, that sadly mourns today 
Or loved or hopes entombed, lo, rolled away 
The stone; hear angel accents true and sweet 
The same glad message to thy fears repeat!
She, who loved much, that much had been forgiven, 
Lingers, —twixt hope and doubt her heart still riven, 
And asks, "Where is my Lord?" Like music heard
When myriad leaves are by soft zephyrs stirred,
Or brooklet sings; sweeter than wondrous chord
Of thousand harp strings, on her ear, one word—
"Mary!" Her joyful impulse, and the sense
Of touch restrained. Seek thou, my heart from hence.
The mastery of passions' grosser strife 
And the preaches of the spirit's life!
So seeks my heart at holy Eastertide
For truths which are eternal, and abide!
EARTHBOUND
So filled are our ears with earth's dissonant jars,
     Its janglings that vex and annoy,
We may not hear the singing of morning stars,
     And the Sons of God shouting for joy;
So held are our eyes by the shadows of night
     Closing in o'er earth's fear tortured day
We may not see beside us the Presence of light
     That is walking with us by the day.
Ah, wherefore hold we our senses earthbound—
     Conscious only of discord and blight—
So, to lose the rare waves of harmonious sound,
     And the rapture of heavenly sight?
GOD'S ANSWER
Set thine ideal, and strive and dare 
With effort fervent as a prayer;
Nor doubt: the failures thou wilt meet,
That to thy scanning seem defeat 
May be God's answer, and control 
The higher reaches of thy soul.
From heights well gained in coming years
Thou'lt bless what erst had roused thy fears.
LIFE'S PENDULUM
Life's pendulum swings toward the wrong
     Its arc's extremest length;
But courage still, brave heart, and sing,
     For lo, for its receding swing,
Abiding faith shall find ere long,
     It so has gathered strength!
LOVE'S SERVICE
Let me find service in life's humblest need
     For, in Love's balance weighs the smallest deed.
The hand of succor lifting to its nest
     The fallen fledgling, follows love's behest
As truly as when hastening to bring 
     The cup of water to revive a king!
The way leads e'er to unreached heights above
     Whence we are lifted by our deeds of love.
Thou, all-enfolding Love that marketh all,
     King in extremis and a sparrow's fall,
Teach us all service in itself divine, 
     Or to the greatest, or the least of Thine!
OUR CHOOSING
A place to fill; a task to do;
A song to sing; a light to shine.
High born or lowly—I, or you—
Not in the choosing yours or mine
But this: how bright the light, how true 
The task, the song, how near divine.
SHE HATH DONE WHAT SHE COULD
One tender scene stands out to me
     In that rich life at Galilee:
Tired, throbbing feet, and ointment rare, 
     And soothing touch of unbound hair;
The "what she could,” a loving deed,
     That met a lowly human need.
Ah, what we can may not be much,—
     Sympathy's soft, magnetic touch, 
Or kindly glance, or gentle word,
     Sent from a heart that love hath stirred,
Yet down the years one deed will shine
     To say such service is divine.
LIGHT
"God said, Let there be light: and there was light"
     O'er-mastering supreme chaotic night!
And the cold, dark earth grew warm and rife 
     With myriads ot strange, primeval life!
O, light! Life's wonder-lamp to baby eyes, 
     Luring their first wide gaze of sweet surprise!
The treasury from whence awakened Art
     Draws beauty's message to the human heart.
Day's benediction in the shining west;
     And morning gladness calling from our rest,
Effulgent, beautiful, fore'er a sign
     To mortals of the gracious Light Divine!
MUSIC
In spite of life's frenzied struggles,
     Spite of its sorrows and stings,
Serene the spirit of music
     Sits in the soul and sings.
And erst a grand oratorio
     Into life's harmony swells,
Erst a soft cadence of sorrow
     Up from a slave's heart wells.
Or in the high or the lowly,
     Still God's great, beautiful gift—
Music, to bind souls in kinship, 
     Music, to soothe and uplift!
THE SINGER
My Country! Thy great progress reaching on—
     Thy last grown small beside thy newer great
Achievement, in the lull of plaudits hear anon
     A lonely Singer's voice within thy gate!
A dusky, dulcet singer, and his song
     A plaintive melody that bears the trace 
Of all the sorrow, all the bitter wrong
     That swept the heartstrings of a bow'd race.
Of slavery's centuries of poignant pain;
     Freedom's high hope and vanished roseate dream,
Its weary struggle against odds to gain
     The still receding heights where shines the gleam.
O, is it naught to you, ye passers by,
     Unhindered to your vantage on the height,
This minstrelsy of sorrow, this lone cry 
     Of brother calling to you from the night?
Pause, and give heeding while ye still ascend,
     Into full measure of your progress raise
This dark-hued singer, bring his voice to blend 
     In one grand paean of our country's praise!
THE TROOPER AT CARRIZAL
Over the sun-baked wastes of Mexico,
     Upon a hot trail, rode the trooper band, 
Not questioning, when they had heard command 
     To reach their country's ruthless bandit foe.
Following a treacherous truce to ambush dire, 
     Sensing too late their peril, yet the while
Fighting their hopeless fight with song and smile, 
     They faced the dread machine gun's cruel fire.
O brave black soldiers, ye have laid your toll 
     Upon the altar of war's flaming hate—
Vain sacrifice to god insatiate!
     We pass your names to history's honor roll.
Yet, with this prayer: O, gracious Prince of Peace
     Weld Thou the bands of human brotherhood;
Make Thy names meaning clearer understood
     Till war and strife o'er all the earth shall cease!
THE OFFERING
I was not keen to offer up my son—
     E'en when I saw white mothers give their all
Proudly to Freedom, answering the call 
     Of our common country. For, upon
My soul heavily pressed the galling load
     Of preiudices mass accumulate.
Though I had stifled bitterness and hate,
     And rendered true allegiance while the goad
Of race-thrusts hurt, I could not give my boy.
     Twas thus I writhed, when, lo, my struggling soul,
Illumined by a vision of the whole
     Intent of Freedom, offered him with joy!
THE NEWER SACRIFICE
Armistice Day at Arlington, 1921
For one great moment in that Silence held
     As if the strifes of all the earth were quelled,
Beside the Bier with bowed and reverent head,
     We paid vicarious homage to our dead.
Exalted in this passion's brief surcease,
     Our visions shaped a newer gift to Peace—
Not death, O God, again the awful price, 
     But life henceforth the offered sacrifice!
Life, cleansed from Hate that bars the coming good, 
     And stays our dream of human brotherhood;
From Greed that clamors for unrighteous gain, 
     And Pride that heeds not weaker human pain, 
From deadly armament for human strife
     O God, our gift a cleansed, a sweeter life!
AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL UNVEILING
May 30, 1922
Times ceaseless cycles brought the Golden Year 
And seven, and brought one perfect, shining day,
With skies cerulean, waters sparkling, clear,
A crowning loveliness of lovely May;
And, in a nation's evolution, brought 
This pile magnificent, that wakened Art, 
Seeking her acme of expression, wrought 
In beauty to reveal a nation's heart!
And time brought freedom's vintage—one who came
To tell the progress of a franchised race,
And for its blest achievements to acclaim
A race's homage in this hallowed place.
Lincoln, beloved, of those who gathered here 
In this great nation's tribute to bear part,
None brought thy memory reverence more sincere 
Than that which voiced a race's grateful heart!
Spirit benign, while here we feel thy touch, 
Thy mystic nearness in this pregnant hour,
Give us a newer message—not in such
Tones as Gettysburg—but the fuller power 
Of spirit speech to spirit; here unfold 
The deep, intrinsic sense of that new birth 
Of freedom thy prophetic lips foretold
Should have its glorious advent on our earth!
THE TORCH BEARER
The Late Booker T. Washington,
Founder of Tuskagee Institute.
Up from the portals dark of slavery's night, 
     The dusky, untried youth, emerging came;
His feet set on the trail, his heart aflame
     With a great purpose: He would reach the light
Freedom held forth, and for his needy race
     Would touch his torch and bear it torth to teach,
To lead his people till they rose to reach
     The goal where progress needs must give them place.
Ah! woe for us, the once uplifted hand
     Lies nerveless; that a hush the world can feel
Reigns where erstwhile a voice with strong appeal 
     Rang out for righteous standards in our land!
O, Washington, thy light we ill can spare,
     And thy great leadership, the strength, the grace 
Of thy rich life spent to uplift a race 
     With self-effacement, and achievement rare!
A PATTERN OF SERVICE
Hollis B. Frissell, late President of Hampton Institute
He came and brought to us a pattern true
     Of service, loyalty and brotherhood,
And, passing, left it sacred that we do
     Our share of striving for the common good.
O, loved exemplar, for the world's sore need
     Of service, brotherhood and loyalty
Our lives shall in their copy show our meed
     Of tribute to thy blessed memory!
THE HAMPTON SPIRIT
Oh, Hampton, one never could make thee a song,
     Except as his life did the singing
In service that would thy great spirit prolong—
     And send it thro centuries ringing!
IN PROTEST
So they've sought a new sensation for this modern jazzing craze
     In the ruthless syncopation of those sweet old plaintive lays
That the souls of their forefathers, 'neath affliction's heavy rod,
     Coined from bitterness of sorrow as they reached for touch with God;
When they stole "away to Jesus" at the end of life's hard day
     And in loneliness of spirit "couldn't hear nobody pray;"
Or, with faith at last triumphant, sang of "freedom? that would come,
     Of "Sweet Chariot," low swinging, sent to bear their spirits home;
Or of God who could deliver as in times of sacred lore;
     Of the chill of death's "deep river," crossed to Canaan's blissful shore!
O ye unthinking heritors of this rare and sacred trust—
     Of a race's soul's outpouring—jazz in pleasure if you must;
But give rein to modern fancy for the rhythmic thrills you crave,
     Leave, O leave untouched, unsullied, those dear songs your fathers gave!
HER VOICE
She stood where the spotlight focused 
     And the hushed, expectant throng
Felt the unstudied grace ot her form and face
     As they waited for her song.
She sang, and the distilled sweetness 
     Of each lilting, liquid note
Bore our hearts along with the quaint old song
     That flowed from her dusky throat.
But my fancy tricked me strangely:
     I closed my weary eyes
And the lights became the shadow and flame
     Of Southern twilight skies;
And my head once more was pillowed
     On a softly sheltering breast
And a sweet low voice made my heart rejoice
     As it lulled me to childhood's rest.
UNITY
Ethnic diverseness, clannish clash and strife
Obscure the blessed unities of life.
In class and clique the rich and poor pass by
     And give no sign. Then a deep, human cry
Of pain arrests the throng, stills noisome mart;
     And sympathy sends answer, throe for throe.
Pain-beat for pain-beat, throbs a great world's woe,
     And a vast pity flows as from one heart.
Doctrine and dogma, warring sect and creed,
     Divide the Church, nor fill the pschyic need—
The brother-call innate of soul to soul;
     But, "Love thy neighbor," One of Galilee 
Hath said, and welds by the divine decree
     A golden link that unifies the whole.
MY HERITAGE
Ancestors of the ships! Sad voyagers,
Whom Destiny, inscrutable, silent, strange,
Forced through the wide flung portals of a new
Civilization in the making; fastened
Inseparably to her great future; left it hers 
To make of thee a blessing or a curse!
I trace back to their source from crude reactions
Thy tested spirits gave to hard experience,
Impulses primitive, which I own,
My heritage!
Captured, enchained and o'er the fateful trail 
Urged by the captor's cruel lash and goad,
While quivering flesh weltered beneath the strokes, 
And screams of pain disturbed the heavy air 
That late had stirred with shrieks of ecstasy, 
When the successful chase drove from his lair 
The jungle quarry, and the spear's true aim
Had given his reeking carcass to adorn 
The triumphal return!
Leaving behind what in their savage breasts
Sounded the depths of human feeling—
The smoky hut, primeval germ of home;
The rendezvous where tom-tom's call had drawn
The tribe's ensemble for a common end—
Or war's grave council or the joy of chase;
Or votive offering to offended gods,
When dread disease had raised a vengeful hand,
And smote with hectic flame.
On, and the via doloroso endeth not
Till where the slaver's ship at anchor rides.
Then, the last look upon a land beloved
The groan bespeaking a new sense of pain
That waking, pierced to bleeding their poor hearts;
Thrust in the foul 'tween decks, settled into 
A spiritless apathy, unbroken save
When death's cold, kindly hand, laid on some brow
Vouchsafed a kind release!—
O, my dark-hued ancestors, beneath the goad and flail 
Treading for me, vicarious, civilization's trail,
Along that way of sorrow, I reach back o'er the years 
And trace my poignant throw-back, my heritage of tears!
* * * 
Exiled, enslaved, and by taskmaster held
To the hard delving of a sterner soil.
And yet their souls rebounding from despair
Follow the rhythm of recurring strokes 
And ease their rigor with the labor song!—
O, Men of darker visage, it is not mine to ask 
Why heavy lay upon thee civilization's task
To hew and delve and hammer incath driver's good and thong—
But, that thy souls reacted with the crude labor song—
My grateful spirit reaches back o'er the weary way 
To bless thee that with singing I break my task today!
* * * 
Women of Africa, pitying angels wept
Over the tragic scenes by which was marked
Thy passage into slavery from its shores, 
I may not lift the vail!
Rather to vision thee, bondswomen, mothers,
Taking fair infant charges to thy breasts 
Yielding them warm sustenance, tending them 
With gentle ministering, comforting them;
Soothing their restlessness and thine own hearts
With the soft cadence of sweet melodies
So plaintive and so tender, so unique,
That voiced the visions of thy yearning souls 
And have enriched the music of our world!
O, ye, who in your bondage made servitude divine 
Through beautiful devotion, motherhood's crown is thine!
Across the years between us, I touch your gentle souls 
And feel their rare adorning—the patience that controls
Sorrow; the hope upspringing beneath oppression's rod 
The meekness, the long suffering, the simple trust in God!
UNDER THE TREES
A little respite from the city, rife 
     With clang and clamor of its whirring life 
Of mechanism, then, the drone of bees, 
     And shrill cicadas' note beneath the trees!
And twilight, and the sounds of homing herds, 
     And the soft twitterings of nesting birds, 
And whispered wooing of the scented breeze, 
     And sleep's oblivion beneath the trees.
Ah, loosed from feverish strivings, it were best 
     If, sinking to our everlasting rest,
Nature's sweet symphony of sounds like these
     Might lull to final slumber 'neath the trees!
MY THANKSGIVING
For patience under cruel stress
     To stifle racial bitterness,
Nor swerve in the extremity
     From my own soul's nobility.
To question the unrighteous line—
     Measuring by equity divine—
Yet foster beauty, sweetness, grace
     Within the circumscribed place.
For vision of this height sublime,
     Set for my soul and strength to climb
Father of all, I thank Thee!
THE UNBROKEN CHAIN
Human affection binds us as a chain
     Strong as the power of our devoted hearts;
A link is missed, and with a throb of pain
     We sense the void! the tear unbidden starts!
But, should we weep? — The chain is still unriven
     Tho we the missing link may not discern
Lost to our vision in the light of Heaven—
     We have this hope een while our spirits yearn,—
That some time, when the striving all is o'er— 
     And we uplifted to immortal plane
United we will count the links once more 
     And find them all in an unbroken chain.
SERVICE IN COMMUNITY LIFE
Strong, that no human soul may pass
     Its warm, encircling unity;
Wide, to include all creed, all class—
     This, the ideal community.
And so encircled, all and each—
     Aroused to know the common good, 
Striving, shall in the striving reach 
     A closer human brotherhood.
A PLEA FOR THE CHILDREN
Have you seen the little children of the city's hidden places
Seen their poor, ill-nourished bodies and their wizened, wistful faces?
In the wearying night-watches, have you heard their feeble crying
Neath the stress of hard conditions restless, fevered, even dying?
O, ye people, fortune-favored, think ye not these heirs of sorrow—
Men and women, in the making for our country's great tomorrow—
Will arraign you in that future that today you have neglected
To provide where they so needed and their mute appeal rejected?
Little ones of olden story—the Christ's loving arms enfolding,
While he breathed His tender blessing, they His kindly face beholding—
Proto-types are of these children, and His sacred trust is given
You to make these little comrades open paths to Him and Heaven. 
Bring them, then, from depths of squalor, out into God's open spaces,
Where they charm with happy laughter, and with rate unstudied graces
Bring them into childhood's kingdom, help them grow in health and sweetness
Souls and minds and bodies rounding into beautiful completeness!
CHRISTMAS EVE: THE ANSWER FROM NO MAN'S LAND
Comes again love's great hour of discord's brief reprieve.
And the world's heart beats timing to bells of Christmas eve;
Light speaks from lowly windows to light in stately hall
And the sweet Christmas spirit holds us erstwhile in thrall.
Far over seas wild surging night with a rev' rent hand
Has set her stars for candles alight on No Man's Land, 
And to that ground so holy, under their gleaming light 
Come hero-souls unnumbered keeping a tryst tonight.
O, ye, who have won knowledge thro' sacrificial pain,
Break silence, send the answer for which our senses strain,
What of love's final triumph? When will earth's tumult cease?
When will the Christmas morning usher the golden peace?
Hark! the reverberation of the night's chiming bells,
Back to our souls up lifted the age-old chorus swells, 
They, and the angels are sending Bethlehem's answer again,—
"Glory to God in the highest! On earth Peace, Good Will to men!"
INTER-RACIAL COOPERATION
Men have set up a barrier which controls
Such human circumstance as, if our feet
Shall enter here, or there; the while large souls
Concerned with Life's grave call, have risen to meet
Across the unity of noble thought, 
And lofty purpose, and constructive deed,
Oblivious to all else—and so have wrought
Together for the world's compelling need!
THE MEETING
They called an out door meeting and all the country folk
From near and far were gathered — one from the city spoke.
From "firstly," reaching onward he lengthened his harangue
His raucus voice the echoes sent back in answering clang.
But straying went my senses from the bombastic words,
Intrigued by murmuring tree-tops and minstrelsy of birds;
And rhythmic, noiseless motion of drifting clouds o'er-head
Till, ere they turned from wandering, the "lastly" had been said.
Silent beside my neighbors I went my homeward way, 
Hearing their loud discussions, having no words to say 
Only a nameless feeling, like worship or a prayer, 
Too sacred for expression, too intimate to share.
THE WINGS OF GOD
"He shall cover thee with His feathers, 
And under His wings shalt thou trust?"—
     So David, the harpist sings 
     His beautiful psalm of wings— 
Of a wondrous vision of refuge
For myriad kindred of dust.
Where at length the prince and the beggar
From different ways they have trod,
     A-weary alike of pain
     Of loss and the surfeit of gain,
Each may seek a comforting shelter
Beneath the outspread wings of God.
So unlike their day of endeavor—
Unlike is the guerdon it brings—
     But, losing or pain or pride 
     In longing at eventide
For His rest, as birds to their homing
They come to His hovering wings.
I FOLLOW
Come harbingers of winter,
     Bleak winds and leaden skies
Moved by an urge instinctive,
     The wingéd migrant flies,
Led o'er the path unswerving
     To sunlit land afar
Of warm aerial current 
     And shining southern star.
Like guided bird I follow
     The impulse of my soul
Having within the vision 
     Of a celestial goal;
Follow the trend unerring 
     Of an upreaching trail;
The gleam divine that beckons;
     My Guide that will not fail!
HYMN TO THE NEW FREEDOM
Hail thee, New Freedom, earth's heroes defended
To extreme effort, thy momentous birth, 
With dread Autocracy fiercely contended,
Till the arch foe, smitten, fled from our earth.
Welcome the dawn of thy glad natal morning,
Triumphing over War's horrible night,
Waking our earth to new promise, adorning
Her stricken places with its healing light.
Welcome the truth that our souls is obsessing
Age-old, yet newly inborne from above—
‘Goodwill to men,’ must uphold Peace's blessing,
Man's rule of life, must be God's 'Rule of Love?’
God, in this hour of our regeneration,
Compassed by souls who unstintingly paid
The price supreme, that the world, that this Nation, 
Still should go on unoppressed, unafraid,
Make us true heirs of their fervid endeavor,
Worthy what they have so valiantly won—
Freedom, equality, justice, forever
A sacred trust, may we still 'carryon'.
At the gateway of an era unfolding,
Cleave us a pathway with Thy truth and light,
Walking therein, each a brother beholding,
Grant each to render a brother his right.
So, make us newly a united Nation, 
A sovereign people whose God Thou still art, 
One in our country's profound adoration, 
To her great future each bearing his part.
GOD'S SPEECH
"God don speak like a na'chel man,
  He speaks so His chillen can un'erstan.”
                                                  -Negro Spiritual.
In winds' soft whisperings like a caress;
And gentle falling of the rain in Spring;
And constant round of love's small ministering
Blent into humble lives to cheer and bless.
In the deep silence of uncharted wood;
And in the majesty of tempest's roar;
In boom of waves upon the lonely shore;
In providence of simple daily food.
In divine languor after pain's relief;
In mystic midnight growing of the corn;
And the clean freshness of the early morn;
Comfort, that is faith's aftermath of grief 
In varied ways, God spoke into the drear 
Condition of their lives, His children heard 
And made their song so rare, so sweet, that stirred 
The hearts of all the world to pause and hear!
LITTLE IDEALS
Home tasks, we complain give us little ideals— 
The cleaning and budgeting, cooking of meals—
So taxing they weary, so trivial they pall—
They hold us we feel from life's loftier call;
We reach and we rub till all polished and clean
A room's hidden corners not like to be seen.
(So in larger affairs we are apt to be true
And clean in the things we are called on to do.)
We stretch slender purse-string till each debt is paid 
And qualms of a scrupulous conscience allayed,
(And the Christ-standard reach for a man to his brother—
"Owe no man anything but to love one another.")
We cook frugal meals with the calories right 
And keep bodies fit for stern labor's grim fight.
(Well seasoned with love they make souls true and strong
To win in the battle of right against wrong.)
     Ah, little ideals, little chores in the home!
     Our dreams lead us forth wider pathways to roam, 
     We fail, we succeed, gather wealth or grow poor 
     But the ideal divine came within that loved door!

FOREWORD
I have always loved poetry, still my wish has been, to be not a poet, but a novelist. But it seems that the Muse had other plans for me and I have always found myself giving expression to my thoughts in verse. Thoughts that I have intended to express in long chapters of prose, I have expressed in just a few verses of poetry; and I sometimes tell my friends that the writing of poetry has been thrust upon me—I write it because I must—and in presenting this little volume to the public, I do it, not so much with the wish for popularity or fame, but with the satisfaction that I have obeyed the command of my somewhat despotic Muse.
I have endeavored to be sincere and fair in all the subjects treated, especially in those pertaining to my people, whom I love very dearly. So in this book and also in my first book, “Songs from the Wayside,” I have endeavored to present both sides of the subject, knowing that no problem can be truly solved in any other way.
A Garland of Poems
UNCLE RUBE ON CHURCH QUARRELS
Brethren, I’m jes’ plum’ disgusted
   How de churches’ takin’ on;
’Clare I’s nevah seen mo’ fussin’
   ’Mong de churches since I’s bawn.
All a-squabblin’ an’ a-fightin’,
   Some ’bout dis an’ some ’bout dat,
Ev’ry whaur you go to meetin’,
   ’Pears you run into a spat.
Baptist, Methodist an’ Christian,
   Most nigh ev’ry church you name,
Done put on de Injun war paint,
   An’ I say, it makes me shame;
Makes me shame to see ou’ churches
   Stoopin’ down to sich disgrace;
Jes’ a laughin’ stock fah sinners,
   An’ a scandal to de race.
Done forgot all ’bout their mission
   Done forgot ’bout savin’ souls,
An’ a-settin’ good examples,
   An’ a-teachin’ self control.
Yes! done laid aside de Bible
   An’ gone pell-mell to de fray,
Usin’ all de tricks uv sinners
   Makin’ things come out their way.
Jes’ won’t give no year to reason,
   Heads as hawd as any rock,
Drivin’ ’way de earnest seekers,
   An’ a-starvin’ uv de flock.
I say: Shame upon de churches,
   Lettin’ Satan have sich sv xy,
When you know dat you kin whop him,
   Ef you fight de propah way.
Fust, we’s bound to come together,
   ’Case one man can’t do it all,
An’ ef we don’t have no union.
   Tell you what—we’s go’n’ to fall.
An’ we moist be mo’ in earnest
   See dat ou’ own hawts is true,
Puttin’ down ou’ spite an’ envy,
   Trustin’ God to help us through.
Ef you’s got a triflin’ preacher,
   Who’s a-travelin’ Satan’s rout,
An’ has jined himself to sinners,
   Rise an’ turn de roscal out.
Don’t be ’fraid to come agin him,
   Callin’ him God’s chosen man;
Don’t you know ef God had called him,
   He would give him grace to stan’?
Ef He helps de earnest layman.
   To walk worthy in His cause,
Do you think He’d fail de preacher
   Who’s a-try’n’ to keep His laws?
Even ef de Lo’d has called him,
   An’ he falls into a sin,
Handle him; ef he is worthy,
   He’ll survive de discipline.
Dat’s de way God taught de prophets,
   All dem old time holy men,
Dat ef dey would bear His message,
   Dey must keep their ga’ments clean.
We must drop ou’ foolish notions,
   ’Case we’s all got common sense,
An’ de Lo’d ain’t go’n’to ’scuse us,
   On de plea uv ignerence.
Fah we promised Him we’d serve Him,
   When from sin He set us free,
So we’s bound to fight de debil,
   Make no diff’rence whaur he be.
Den, ef you has got a leader,
   Who’s a earnest upright man,
I say, children gather ’round him
   An’ hoi’ up dat preacher’s hands.
Fah dah’s folks will watch a preacher,
   An’ ef he don’t show his heels,
Dey ain’t got no mo’ use fah him,
   Dan ‘a wiagon wid five wheels’.
Fust to shout when he preach morals
   ’Most too high fah human reach,
But dey jes’ can’t stand him children,
   Ef he practice what he preach.
Now ef you can’t drop sich membahs,
   Keep dem undah good control,
(Seems dem ol’ wolves in sheep’s clothin’
   Will git into every fold.)
An’ woe to de church my children,
   Ef dey git de upper hand,
Fah God’s troops does sorry marchin’,
   When dey’s led by Satan’s band.
'Taint de hollerin’ an’ de shoutin’,
   Dat’s a-makin’ uv de saint,
Nor de prayin’ an’ de groanin’,
   No my bredren, ’deed it ain’t!
’Tis de life dat you’s a-livin’,
   Not de shout, de prayer, de groan—
Fah de Bible says, mjy bredren,
   “By deir fruits dey shall be known.”
So it ain’t no use to holler,
   ’Tain’t no use to jump an’ shout,
Ef you ain’t a-livin’ holy,
   Mind! “Your sins will find you out.”
An’ it is de churches’ duty,
   When dese dawk deeds come to light,
To use all de powah God gives dem,
   Tryin’ to set de matter right.
Dat’s de reason dat ou’ churches,
   Often fall below de rnawk,
It’s because dey’re shieldin’ membahs,
   When dey know their deeds is dawk.
An’ it is dem very membahs,
   Who, when trouble comes along,
Well nigh tear de church to pieces,
   Fightin’ always fah de wrong.
Now I know it ain’t so easy
   Fah to do de things I say,
But de best we git my children,
   Comes by struggle, not by play.
An’ you know dat right is mighty,
   Faihde Lo’d is on dat side;
An’ de earnest undertakin’,
   He is always dah to guide.
Now I'm go’n’ to set down children,
   Won’t take no mo’ uv yo’ time,
Fah it seems dah’s no end to me,
   When I’m talkin’ long dis line.
So I’ll jes’ say in conclusion,
   Trust in God, an’ press right on!
Fah you’ll be here fightin’ children,
   When ol’ Uncle Rube is gone.
YOU’LL HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE ROAD
You have left the straight highway of duty,
For the dark winding pathway of sin;
You have cast off the precepts of childhood,
For the doctrine of world hardened men;
And you wonder why peace has departed,
Why life seems a wearisome load.
You are lost in the forest of error.
You’ll have to come back to the road.
You have learned to speak lightly of goodness,
And say that religion’s a sham,
You find many faults with the Bible
And scoff at salvation’s great plan;
You say all the world is dishonest—
Ev’ry man at heart is a rogue;
And you wonder why life is so bitter;
You have wandered away from the road.
You laugh at the men and the women
Who have learned to make conscience their guide,
And you say that life is far sweeter
To those who drift with the tide,
Then you seek in the gay halls of pleasure,
The peace that has left your abode,
But you’ll ever seek vainly, my brother,
You’ll have to come back to the road.
You’ll have to come back to the precepts,
You learned in your childhood’s pure day;
Come back to the faith pure and simple,
Ere the world had lured you away;
Come back to the sweet sacred story
Of the Friend who bears ev’ry load;
Come back from the far distant country,
You’ll have to come back to the road.
 DREAM SHADOWS
Sweet thoughts and vague dreams come to me,
   As o’er the fields the soft winds blow;
The golden sun shines brilliantly,
   The shifting shadows come and go.
And ah, those sweet elusive dreams,
   Come ever drifting from afar,
As golden as the bright sunbeams.
   As shifting as the shadows are.
I try to grasp them—all in vain;
   They linger lightly in my mind,
Then like vague forms, are gone again,
   Leaving a half-sweet pain behind.
Perchance they’re ghosts of childish dreams,
   That filled my fancy long ago,
Ere yet I’d drifted down life’s stream,
   To where the deeper waters flow.
Perchance they’re tones from spiritland,
   So vague so far away, they seem
To me, who cannot understand,
   But echoes of a childish dream.
Ah well, whatever they may be,
   These vague sweet dreams that come and go,
I know they always come to me,
   On days like this, when soft winds blow.
BE SWEET
A happy song sprite is coming my way,
   And flooding the air with sweet melody;
He sings in my ears as I pass down the street:
   “I bring you a message: Be sweet; be sweet.
“The message is old as the years are long;
   And I bring it alike to the weak and the strong,
To the young and the old and to all whom I meet,
   What e’er your condition—Be sweet; be sweet.
“The thoughts that are wicked I’d frighten away;
   The words that are' bitter I never would say,
The tale that is spiteful I would not repeat,
   Just heed you my message: Be sweet; be sweet.
“The pathway of life is oft dreary at best,
   The sigh often stifles the smile and the jest;
Then cast not your hindrance to clog weary feet,
   Be kindly and helpful; be sweet, be sweet.”
Still merrily singing, away flew the sprite,
   And soon the bright vision was lost to my sight;
But his song still remains, and I ever repeat,
   When life would grow bitter: Be sweet; be sweet.
 BECAUSE WE KNOW
No matter how the cold winds blow,
   How deep the snow drifts in the vales,
Down in our hearts we know, we know
   Spring breezes follow wintry gales.
We know the flowers will come again,
   And with their sweetness fill the air;
We know we’ll look across the plain,
   And see the verdure everywhere.
And so we face the winter’s storm,
   Its piercing winds, its sleet and snow,
With hearts where hope is burning warm,
   Because we know; because wo know.
And thus it is when woes befall;
   When to our lives the dark days come;
We know that God is over all,
   That brightness ever follows gloom.
We know as sure as spring will come
   To prove we did not hope in vain,
So sure a happy day, will dawn,
   When joy shall triumph over pain.
So oft along the darksome way,
   We walk with faces all aglow;
The star of hope shines steadily,
   Because we know; because we know.
THE PRINCE OF PEACE
(Xmas, 1916)
The Prince of Peace! oh name most sweet and holy!
   Dear name through which a dying world may live,
That sheds like blessings on the high and lowly,
   The only name that endless life can give.
The Prince of Peace! oh theme of wondrous story,
   Tale, that no mortal e’er can understand—
The Son of God, disrobed of all His glory,
   Descends to earth, to die for sinful man.
The Prince of Peace! oh name so fitly given,
   By men of old unto the Holy Child,
Who willingly forsook the joys of heaven,
   That God and mankind might be reconciled.
Oh Prince of Peace, though war may rend the nation,
   And cast its dreadful blight o’er all the land,
In thy own time, oh God of all creation,
   Thou wilt subdue the creatures of thy hand.
Ah, they may rise in pride of power and station,
   And strive to set at naught thy holy will.
But thou art king of ev’ry warring nation;
   They must bow down when thou sayest:
“Peace; be still.”
And so today in praise we lift our voices,
   Oh Prince of Peace, for love that ne’er shall cease;
While ev’ry soul that in thy love rejoices.
   Sends up its prayer for universal peace.
 
 “SHOWIN’ OFF”
Showin’ off! dat’s one fault children,
Dat’s a-harmin’ of de race;
An’ wuss thing—you’s like to find it
Lurkin’ in mos’ any place.
Find it ’mongst de older people,
And de youngsters dat you meet,
You kin see it in de churches,
In de homes, an’ on de street.
’Tain’t no use to try to stop it,
Seems it’s bound to have its way,
Spoutin’ round amongst ou’ people,
An’ its got a mighty sway.
Dah! it‘s gone into de pulpit;
See dat preacher?—Preachin’ fine!
Ev’rybody’s eye is on him,
An’ he shows a well trained mind.
But dat scamp is at his elbow,
Whisp’ring folly in his ear,
An’ dat man begins to holler,
Like he thinks de folks can’t hear;
Commence racin’ bout dat platform,
Like he don’t know whut he’s ’bout—
Done got puffed up wid attention—
Go’n’ to make some sistah shout.
An’ dem sistahs rise respondin’,
Makin’ sich a great to do,
’Case dey’re bound to show dat preacher
Dat dey’s got de spirit too.
Can’t say I don’t b’lieve in shoutin’,
’Case I b’long to dat 01’ School
An’ you know dat mos’ ol’ timers
Will stick up fah ol’ time rules.
But I mus’ be straight about it,
Speak de truth since I commence,
So, ef we will keep on shoutin’,
I say: Let us shout wid sense!
I don’t blame de younger people
Sometimes, when I see dem. scoff,
’Case mos’ all uv dis great shoutin’s
Nothin’ else but showin’ off.
Showin’ off! Great patience! Children,
Once I saw two cullud men,
Git to' quar’lin’ ’bout some trifle,
Half in fun when dey begin,
Till dey saw de folks wus watchin’,
Den deir wrath rose like a gale!
Nex’ dey took one to de dead house,
An’ de othah one to jail.
I come down de street a walkin’,
Feelin’ mighty good an’ spry,
See two well-dressed men a-talkin’,
One looks up an’ ketch my eye;
Den his voice is raised in laughtah,
Augerment, or mighty scoff,
An’ thinks I: Lawd help dat dawky,
He’s done gone to showin’ off.
Showin’ off has made good women,
Fill deir homes wid costly things
Pictures, furniture an’ cawpets,
Well nigh fine enough fur kings.
Den go straight into dat washtub,
Whaur dey labor night an’ day,
Till dey’s nigh worn to a shadah,
Giftin’ money ’nough to pay.
’Tain’t no use in talkin’ children,
I could go on fah a hou’
Till you’d git tired hear’n’ me fellin'
 ’Bout fool things I’s seen fo’ now—
Dawkies standin’ ’bout de sidewalks,
Showin’ off to passersby,
Till dey spile a good location;
Makin’ ’gainst both you an’ I.
’Case you know de unfair white folks—
Put us all into one boat:
“Won’t have dawkies livin’ ’round us!”
Yes, jes’ set us all afloat.
Well, I won’t go any furder,
Fah you all know whut I mean,
An’ mos’ all dese things I’m tellin’,
Ev’ry one uv you have seen.
Well, sometimes it sets me laughin’,
Den, it almost makes me cry:
People lookin’ o’er deir shoulders,
Tryin’ to ketch deir neighbor’s eye,
’Stid uv lookin’ whaur dey’s goin’;
Nex’ dey’s fell into de trough,
Children, do git down to bis’ness;
Quit dat tomfool showin’ off!
TO OBEY IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
than the fat of rams. 1 Samuel 15:22.
“To obey is better than sacrifice:”
Rang- clearly in his ears.
And knew he not when he turned away,
That in the after years,
With heart and soul grown sick of strife,
He would recall this day,
And learn the meaning of the words:
’Tis better to obey.
But he chose his way, and heeded not
His Master’s clear command;
To him, obedience seemed tame,
And sacrifice so grand.
He filled his life with mighty deeds,
And toiled without surcease,
He brought great gifts unto his Lord,
But sought in vain for peace.
And when death came, with silent tread,
To bear his life away,
His earnest prayer was: “Lord forgive;
’Tis better to obey.”
“To obey is better than sacrifice;”
Again the words ring clear,
And a woman heedless passes on,
Refusing now to bear.
Love’s sheltered path is offered her,
She firmly turns away—
“I’ll choose the path of sacrifice,
’Tis selfish to obey.”
 “How can I hear the song of joy
And deem its music sweet,
While all around the suffering ones
Are sinking at my feet?
Ah no! Their bitter cries of pain
Would haunt me when I’d pray;
I’ll choose the path of sacrifice,
’Tis selfish to obey.”
She chose her path and heeded not
Another cry of pain,
Because it came from one with strength,
With power and worldly gain.
But after years had past away,
She saw that strong man fail,
Saw him his power and strength abuse,
Saw worldliness prevail,
She looked upon his blighted life,
And knew he’d failed to stand,
Because he lacked the saving touch,
Of woman’s helping hand.
And knew she then, why, years before,
The Master bade her stay;
And she too prays: “Dear Lord, forgive,
’Tis better to obey.”
However great the sacrifice,
The old words still ring true;
’Tis better far to do with might,
What God would have us do.
To take in faith the lot he gives.
What e’er false guides may say;
For whether it be joy or pain,
’Tis better to obey.
BE TRUE TO THE BEST
Be true to the good that is in you,
   The strongest, the cleanest, the best;
Though now it be weak and deficient,
   In time ’twill surmount all the rest.
Be true to the thought that is finest,
   And give the good impulse your heed,
’Tis the noble thought and the impulse
   That warms into life the good deed.
’Tis the patient, sincere cultivation
   Of all that is pure in, the heart,
That chokes out the weeds of dissension,
   And bids evil motives depart.
Seek ever the truest, the highest,
   As knights on a Holy Quest;
For your life can ne’er be a failure,
   If you’re always true to the best.
 PAP’S ADVICE
I ain’t got no patience with you;
   Biggest fool I ever saw;
Tell you, I wa’n’t no sich coward,
   When I went to court your ma!
Jes’ because the gal refused you,
   Fust time that you asked her hand,
You must go ’round here half crazy,
   Brace up boy, an’ be a man!
Say your ma is vexed at Jessie,
   Thinks she’s try’n’ to spile your life?
Did she say how oft I asked her,
   ’Fore she said she’d be my wife?
An’ ef I had got discouraged,
   Failin’ then to do my pawt,
Left her to her woman’s notions,
   ‘Spec’ she’d broken both our hawts.
There’s a dozen different reasons
   Why a gal will tell you “no”,
An’, I say, you jes’ be thankful,
   ’Long as ’tain’t another beau.
Sometimes it is only shyness,
   Sometimes pride as like as not,
That sets up a mighty struggle,
   When it finds that she is caught.
Then again she will refuse you,
   ’Cause she doesn’t know her mind,
While down in her hawt, unknowin’,
   She's a-lovin’ all the time.
An’ ef you be mighty keerful,
   You kin show her where she stands;
It’s your place to do the courtin’,
   Brace up boy, an’ be a man!
An’ whatever be the reason,
   Mind you what I say tonight:
Don’t you leave the field of battle,
   Till you’re sure you’ve lost the fight.
For a good an’ noble woman,
   One that makes a faithful wife,
Is well wuth a man’s best efforts,
   You will find in after life.
Your ol’ pap knows all s' out it,
   For he’s been all ’long there son,
An’ sometimes the hawdest fightin’
   Comes jes’ ’fore the battle’s won.
OCTOBER
Beautiful, beautiful, golden mid autumn,
   Infinitely sweet, and infinitely sad,
Tinged with a pathos that no soul can fathom,
   Making us grave, and making us glad.
Flooding the earth with a rare, golden sunshine,
   Filling the air with a mystical haze,
Stealing the odor from fruit tree and grape vine,
   Wafting it out to sweeten the days.
Dyeing the trees with the hues of the rainbow,
   Lading the barns with a bounteous store,
While the south winds sweep o’er the green meadows,
   Merrily driving the bright leaves before.
Gladly we welcome thy mystical presence,
   After the burden of summer’s fierce heat;
Gladly inhale we thy health-giving essence,
   Lending new vigor to tired lagging feet.
Though in the sunlight there’s lurking a shadow,
   While in our joy there’s a note that is sad,
Yet, willing captives, thy footsteps we follow,
   Making us grave and making us glad.
Beautiful, mystical, golden mid autumn,
   Whence comes the spell thou hast cast o’er the earth?
Whence comes thy power, oh magical season,
   Blending so perfectly, sadness and mirth?
LIFE AND DEATH
Written in memory of Dr. Booker T. Washington, the
noted colored educator and lecturer.
We live, and how intense is life!
So full of stress, so full of strife,
So full of hopes, so full of fears,
Of joy and sorrow, smiles and tears;
And oh how fruitless is the quest,
Unless we’re striving for the best.
We die; and oh how sad is death!
How sad, when we relinquish breath,
When all life’s glory slips away,
And leaves us but a mass of clay.
How sad, and oh how dark the night,
Unless we’ve found eternal light!
This, of our brother we can say—
We meet to honor him. today,
Because he fought life’s battle well;
He stood where heaviest missiles fell.
Oft wounded in the crucial test,
Still, ever striving for the best.
Still striving, he has fallen now,
We’ve placed the laurel on his brow,
While in our hearts, we wonder why
God called this man so soon to die.
We wonder; oh, how blind are we!
His rugged path we could not see;
We only saw his wealth and fame,
His noble station, honored name.
We need not envy him his place,
Who seeks to lift a trodden race.
 God knew how hard and well he’d fought,
The noble deeds his hands had wrought;
God heard the deep sighs of his breast,
He heard—and gave the warroir rest.
And shall we weep and say ’tis night,
When he has found eternal light?
IN ANGEL’S GUISE
Darkness abounds; what seemed at first 
   to be the voice of God,
Has proven but an empty sound 
   by wayward fancy made;
I walk alone; and though deep gloom
   enshrouds my path,
   I’m not afraid.
For this I know: though voices false
   may whisper in my ear,
As on I go, and seek to lure my steps away
   to paths unknown,
God will not let my feet go far astray,
   He’ll keep His own.
I feel no fear; although His presence
   now I can not feel,
I know He’s near, to guard and guide,
   to give the strength I ask,
And when the devil comes in angel’s guise,
   To lift his mask.
THE FLIRT
No indeedy! I’m not caring,
   Let them hang around and pine,
If I didn’t break their fool hearts,
   They would be a-breaking mine.
Men are mighty funny creatures,
   Keep things on the highest shelves,
Then they’ll break their necks to get them,
   Jumpin’ fit to kill themselves.
Keep things down where they can reach them.
   And just see them pass them by!
Still a-lookin’ and a-jumpin’
   For the things they know’s too high.
No indeedy! I ain’t caring!
   Though they pine an’ fume an’ fret,
And just break their necks a-trying
   None of them have won me yet.
HE HAS ALWAYS CARED FOR ME
No, my Lord has never failed me,
And how can I doubt him now?
Though the winds howl fiercely ’round me,
And the spray is on my brow,
Though the billows wildly raging,
Lash my ship far out to sea,
Naught I fear, and naught can harm me,
He has always cared for me.
Oft before, on life’s wide ocean,
Storms have tossed my ship at will,
But always, in His good season,
He has spoken: “Peace; be still”;
And I do not fear to trust Him,
Though full dark the way may be,
For I know, deep in my bosom,
He has always cared for me.
No, my Lord has never failed me;
In life’s darkest, saddest hour
He has made me feel His presence,
Feel His all-sustaining power,
And when joy has been my portion,
He has made mine eyes to see,
His kind hand in all my gladness,
He has always cared for me.
Then, can I with this assurance
Go in fear along life’s way,
Mindless that a Friend so faithful,
Guards my path from day to day?
No! my doubting sinks before it,
And my heart cries joyfully:
“Blessed Lord! I’ll ever trust Him,
He has always cared for me.”
 THE NEW SCHOOLHQUSE
Mt. Healthy, Ohio
“We want a new schoolhouse” the wise neighbors said;
“A school on a modern plan; 
A school that that our townsmen can point to with pride,
As one of the best in the land;
For the great hand of Progress is seen ev’rywhere;
And our dear old town must have her full share.
“Besides, they are crowded, the teachers all say;
The old building here is too small,
New scholars are coming in day after day,
We’ll have to accommodate all.”
So they talked and they planned and wise was their scheme,
But the new school house was still but a dream.
The architect came with his papers and plans,
And he laid before them his sheet,
That showed how the school should be inside and out,
And how it would look when complete.
When he’d finished, the building could almost be seen,
And yet the new schoolhouse was still but a dream.
And then came the workmen with muscular arms,
With strong and capable hands,
Who turned into substance the wise neighbors’ dream,
And the architects well ordered plans.
So today we behold, with faces abeam,
This beautiful building—this realized dream.
And as we assemble, with speeches and song,
To dedicate this, our new school,
We would say to the pupils: Be faithful; be strong;
Let honor and diligence rule.
And dream your bright dreams, for bright dreams are your due;
But remember 'tis work that makes them come true.
 CONQUEST
The battle was fierce; he was worn and spent,
   And beaten down in the fight,
But he faintly said, as he sank to the earth,
   “I’ll die with my face to the light.”
“The goal that I sought, I never shall reach,
   I feel the approach of night,
But I’ll die with my face towards the setting sun,
   I’ll die with my face to the light.”
Bewildered he gazed on the golden crown,
   That in heaven greeted his sight,
But the Father said: “He is conqueror
   Who dies with his face to the light." 
HE HAS BIDDEN ME GO FORWARD
He has bidden me go forward,
   In a path I've never trod,
And I’m not afraid to venture,
   Not afraid to trust my God.
For in all my years of service
   He has been so true a guide,
That I dare tread any pathway,
   When I know He’s at my side.
And since He bids me go forward,
   Though I cannot see the way,
Yet I will not doubt nor falter,
   But will trustingly obey.
For through darkness or through sunlight,
   Through the cold or through the heat,
If o’er shadowed by His presence.
   To obey His will is sweet.
 
HE COMES NO MORE
I am thinking tonight, as the old year dies,
   Of one who has passed to the other shore;
And my heart is sad when I realize,
   How true are the words: “They return more.”
For crowiding each other, the years rush by,
   And we gather to watch them breathe their last;
But he never comes with his smiling eye,
   To watch with us, as he did in the past.
And he never comes when we meet to sing
   The songs that he loved so well to hear;
Nor e’en when the troubles and cares press in,
   To lighten our hearts with his words of cheer.
And he never comes—But why should I start
   The blood from that half-healed wound again?
For it’s God alone who can soothe the heart,
   When its beating time to that sad refrain.
Oh, list! the bells are beginning to ring,
   And my heart is filled with a vague unrest;
But I know whatever the year may bring,
   Will come from the One who knows what is best.
INGRATES
They come to us with bleeding hearts,
   And eyes by tears made wet;
We bind their wounds, we dry their tears,
   They leave us,—and forget.
When grim ill-fortune comes their way,
   We find them at our door.
We welcome them with outstretched hand,
   And share with them our store.
And when our time of trial comes,
   Our day of stress or pain,
It finds us knocking at their door,
   We knock,—but knock in vain.
 TEMPTATION
She read the story of a love most deep,
A love wherein all thoughts of self were lost;
A love that sowed and asked not: “Shall I reap?”
A love that never paused to count the cost.
And thoughtfully she laid the book aside,
The face of him who sought her for his bride
Came to her heart, and bitterly she cried:
If this is love, I feel no love for him
Then what is this that bids me make this choice?
I seem to hear amid the shadows dim
The calm insistent whisper of a voice
That bids me listen to his earnest plea,
But now a darksome doubt is haunting me,
If this is love, I know it can not be.
Is it because I know that he is good,
That people say his heart is pure as gold,
I’ve let my fancy wander as it would,
And lightly grasp the prize I may not hold?
And still the voice says: “Listen to his plea”
But oh I fear ’tis pride and vanity,
That bids me venture where I cannot see.
And love for love has been the age long cry
Of hearts that struggle through the maze of life,
And naught but love, pure love, can satisfy,
Can win the race, or triumph in the strife.
Then shall I listen to his earnest plea,
And give him naught but pride and vanity,
When he would give his best, his all to me?
And yet, ah me! that voice will not be still;
That voice that bids me listen to his plea;
Worn with the strife, I let it have its will,
And only pray, harm may not come to me.
The voice within is ever urging me,
His voice without is pleading constantly,
I fain would yield and ask not what it be.
Ah, as I’m yielding light breaks o’er my way,
I gladly rouse me from my troubled dream,
And see with eyes made clear by heaven’s day,
The surging dashing falls just down the stream.
And thankfully I steer my boat ashore,
1 know beyond a doubt, the strife is o’er;
I hear the Voice—the Tempter’s voice no more.
 OUR SOLDIERS
Written on the occasion of the colored troops
leaving Cincinnati for Camp Sherman, to train
for the World War.
Today the din of Europe’s strife,
Is sounding at our very door;
No longer heard, with bated breath,
As echoes from a foreign shore.
No more the distant war alarms,
For at our door, they call to arms.
They call to arms—and our own boys
Must answer that grim call today;
Oh, how our fond hearts follow them,
As gallantly they march away
With steady tread and fearless eye,
To bravely do or bravely die.
We’ve prayed for others, kinsmen dear,
And others, friends who’ve marched away,
But there’s a new note in the prayer,
That rises to the throne today.
And Europe’s battle fields seem near,
Since those we love must soon be there.
Yet, fear we not for our brave boys,
Our colored troops that march away,
For ne’er yet has a swarthy son,
Disgraced the flag they bear today.
Forgetting wrongs When foes come in,
They never fail the call for men!
OUR HEROES
Written on the occasion of the return of the
colored troops to Cincinnati, Ohio from the World War.
We crowded on the pavements,
   To see our boys march by;
Our soldier boys, with faces grave,
   But vict’ry in their eyes.
They left a few short months ago,
   For Europe’s battle din;
They left us, jolly laughing boys,
   They came back grave faced men.
For theirs it was, to blaze the way,
   On that dread field of blood;
They shrank not from the giant task,
   But fearlessly they stood,
And held their ground like iron men,
   And fought as demons fight,
Their foes were fiends for tyranny,
   But they were fiends for right!
Ah no! those black boys knew no fear;
   Knew no such word as “yield”;
The German troops in terror, fled
   Before their deadly steel.
They blazed the way to victory;
   We cheer till out of breath,
To see them marching, stalwart men
   Back from that field of death.
 Yes, back again with laurels won;
   Our hearts are boating high;
We knew they’d fight as heroes fight,
   And die as heroes die.
We knew that when they fought in France,
   They’d gain an honored place,
For there they judge men by their deeds,
   Regardless of their race.
The whole world knows the story now,
   Then, will their homeland dare,
To still withhold the liberty,
   They fought so well to share?
Now let us pause, with faces bowed,
   While reverent silence reigns;
In mem’ry of those valiant boys,
   Who came not back again.
 
AUTUMN-TIME
’Tis Autumn-time, ’tis autumn,
   I know it by the trees,
I know it by the mystic haze.
   That hangs above the leas.
I know it by the moaning winds,
   And by the sobbing rain,
And all the multitude of signs,
   That follow in her train.
The farmers, bringing in the corn;
   The frost-nipped flower and vine
The children laden down with nuts;
   All speak of autumn-time.
And oh, some days are golden,
   And some are gray and sad,
So like our lives is autumn-time,
   Mingled with grave and glad.
 COMMUNION PRAYER
I feel oh, so unworthy, Lord,
   To drink thy cup today,
But when thy dear voice bids me come,
   I dare not stay away.
I’ve tried so hard to do thy will,
   So hard to worthy be,
But oh, dear Lord I fail so oft,
   When I would honor thee.
I know not why thou bidst me come,
   Unless dear Lord it be
That thou wouldst prove thy mercy great,
   And tender love to me.
So I receive with grateful heart,
   Oh blessed Savior mine,
In memory of thy sacrifice,
   This sacred bread and wine.
THE COMMON LOAD
Awed by the sight of earth’s o’erwhelming woe,
   The ceaseless cry of suff’ring human kind,
I said: “Be still”; unto my troubled soul,
   “Their weight of grief is greater far than thine.
“Thou art but weary with the common load;
   The burden that all human hearts must bear;
Why press thou selfishly unto the Lord,
   To pour into His ear thy petty care?”
I ceased my plaint, and plodded on my way,
   But longer ever longer grew the road,
Until at last, worn out, I knew not why,
   I sank half-fainting ’neath a nameless load.
And lying there, too weak to think or pray,
   The scene in far Judea came to me,
When weary mothers brought their little ones
   And pressed them babbling, to the Master’s knee.
And His disciples bade them stand aside:
   “Why vex the Master wtih thy cares so small,”
But Jesus, knowing said: “Forbid them not.”
   And blessed the little children one and all.
The vision vanished, but I understood;
   And gladly leaned I on the gentle breast
Of Him who says to ev’ry weary one:
   “Come unto me, and I will give thee rest.”
 
 GOIN’ TO FOOT IT ALL THE WAY
(Aunt Betty Testifies)
Brothers an’ sisters, I’ve been trav’lin’
Many years on heaben’s road;
I ain’t lookin’ for no char’ot,
Ain’t a-frettin’ ’bout my load,
I ain't mindin’ my oP ga’ments
’Cause the dust has made them gray,
’Took my cross upon my shoulder,
Goin’ to foot it all the way.
I don’t ’spect to find all roses
While I’m trav’lin’ on this road,
’Cause I know that ev’ry Christian’s
Got to bear some sort of load;
Got to walk some paths of sorrow,—
Got to watch and fight and pray,
I done took my cross up brothers,
Goin’ to foot it all the way.
Jesus didn’t have no char’ot
When He went to Calvary,
With His cross upon His shoulder,
There to die for you and me.
Tho’ the burden was so heavy,
That He sank upon the way,
An’ good Simon had to help Him—
Goin’ to foot it all the way!
Yes indeed! I’m goin’ to foot it;
Be the journey short or long;
When I’m weak I’ll be a prayin’,
An’ a-singin’ when I’m strong;
An’ the Lo’d will bid me welcome,
When I reach eternal day,
Bless God! On my way to glory!
Goin’ to foot it all the way!
EASTER, 1919
Easter with skies transcendently bright,
   Easter with hyacinths blooming;
Easter with message of hope and light,
   Gladly we welcome thy coming.
War and disease have swept o’er the land,
   Leaving it wounded and bleeding;
Come, for the world disconsolate stands,
   Come with thy balm for its healing.
Millions see naught besides the white cross,
   Where a brave soldier lies sleeping;
Millions bewail grim pestilence’s cost,
   Come thou, and silence their weeping.
Tell the sad hearts that Christ conquered death,
   Give them the message from heaven,
Incense more sweet than hyacinth’s breath—
   Christ has thrown open the prison.
Come to the tomb in the garden today,
   Where the great stone is now rolled away,
Then hear the angel triumphantly say:
   “He is not here: he is risen.”
 A REPROOF
You had no cause to speak that unkind word,
   What matter if her faults to you were plain?
You saw her staggering ’neath her heavy load;
   Why add your wormwood to her bitter pain?
You know her heart is always kind and true,
   Whate’er her foibles or her faults may be;
You know when care or trouble comes to you,
   She’s ever ready with her sympathy.
And all must need plead guilty to some fault,
   Then why in face of grim Misfortune’s frown,
Make it a sword to stab a fellow-man?
   ’Tis never brave to strike when one is down.
OUR DECEASED LEADER
Written in memory of Herbert Moninger, A. M.
B. D. well known leader in Sunday School work,
Cin., Ohio, and read at memorial service.
We thought his work only half finished,
   But God said: “His work is all done;”
And swinging ajar heaven’s portals,
   Said: “Enter thou brave faithful one.
“Thou hast finished the work that I gave thee—
   To shed a new light on my Word—
Well done thou good faithful servant,
   Enter thou the joy of thy Lord!”
But we stood like sheep without shepherd,
   Like men when their brave leader falls,
In the midst of a fierce raging battle,
   When he answered his Master’s call.
And our hearts rose up in rebellion—
   Why had the Lord called him to go,
While still his great work seemed unfinished
   While still the world needed him so?
Then came, like a soft benediction.
   The mem’ry of what he had taught,
And it soothed our hearts into silence,
   With the healing balm that it brought.
He taught us God’s goodness and wisdom;
   He taught us to bow to His will;
And though he is no longer with us,
   We follow his teaching still.
And now that our God in His wisdom
   Has taken our dear leader home,
We bow, though not understanding,
   And whisper: “Thy will be done.”
 “I HAVE LIVED FOR THIS HOUR”
Written in memory of Mrs. Mattie Sikes.
All worn out with sickness, and dying, she lay;
   They watched with sad faces, her life ebb away;
“Is it well?” some one asked as she sank ’neath Death’s pow’r,
   “Oh yes”, came the answer, “I have lived for this hour.”
“Long, long years ago I chose Him my guide,
   Have striven through life to keep close to His side;
And now at the end, He is still my High Tower;
   I’ve nothing to fear; I have lived for this hour.”
Ah blest life of service! she made Christ her king,
   And then she lay dying, but Death had no sting,
A bright crown of splendor, and heaven her dower
   Oh, ’tis well worth a lifetime to live for that hour!
OUR IDOLS
We set up idols in our hearts,
   That hide our God from view,
And worship them so fervently,
   Not knowing what we do.
We bring to them for sacrifice,
   Our dearest hopes, our all—
Then wake to find them wood or stone;
   God help us, when they fall!
 THERE CAME WISE MEN
The world pressed hard; his faith was dim,
   And he could not hear the Christmas hymn,
The angels sang o’er hills afar,
   Where wond’ring awestruck shepherds were.
He could not go with the joyful men,
   To the manger-crib in Bethlehem,
The world pressed hard; he’d lost the way,
   And he could not find where the Christ-child lay.
The Christmas shoppers filled the street,
   While happy children, close at his feet,
Gazed long, with eyes all wonder wide,
   Through windows decked for Christmastide;
Their faces bright with a faith as deep,
   As the men of old who watched the sheep;
And he sighed and said, as he went his way:
   “The angels’ song is for such as they.”
“For such as they; not busy men
   Who must meet the world’s dire stress and sin.
Who need must battle with giant might,
   Or be trampled down in the bitter fight.”
And he sighed again as he pressed his way
   Through shoppers, chatting merrily,
With parcels every shape and size,
   And the Christmas gladness in their eyes.
Then he glimpsed in the throng, a face so drear,
   That it seemed to blight the Christmas cheer;
And all day long, persistent, grim,
   That gloomy sad face haunted him.
Till there came to his heart, an impulse strong,
   To make the sad ones hear the song.
“What matter if no song I hear?
   I can bring to others the Christmas cheer.”
And he followed where e’er that impulse led.
   Through the crush and din he pressed ahead:
Where e’er there were deeds of love to do,
   That impulse led—unerring, true.
And he unquestioning, followed on;
   Then found at last, that his doubts were gone,
And the impulse strong that had led him afar,
   Transformed into a radiant star.
He followed the star through the crush and din,
   And lo! it led to Bethlehem;
To Bethlehem! Oh wondrous ray!
   To the manger crib, where the Christ-child lay.
And he found as he knelt to worship there,
   Where the angel chant late filled the air,
That shepherds knelt, but not alone,
   There were Wise Men too at the manger throne.
 THE MINOR KEY
“Oh for a song” the poet sighs,
   “To stir men’s hearts and make them rise
To heights of nobleness!
   A song whose clarion notes will ring,
Long after I have ceased to sing,
   And heal life’s bitterness.
Alas! this is the fate for me:
   To ever sing in a minor key.”
A thousand hearts echo the sigh,
   Brave hearts that struggle on alone,
With aspirations pure and high,
   With deeds forgotten or unknown.
They hear the proud world laud the great,
   They watch the cheering crowds go by,
And bitterly lament their fate—
   Oh foolish hearts, subdue that cry!
What matter if the world forgets,
   Thy deeds to laud, thy tale to tell?
If God remembers, all is well;
   With Him who sees not as we see,
No life is tuned to minor key.
THE CHRISTMAS CHOIRS
’Tis Christmas morn; and o’er the earth
The sound of music rings;
For Christ is born, and joyfully
The choir of angels sings.
To Bethlehem the shepherds come,
To find the infant king;
To Bethlehem the wise men come
Their praise and gifts to bring;
And back to heaven sweeps the choir,
That came His birth to sing.
’Tis Christmas morn; and o’er the earth
The sound of music rings;
For human hearts have caught the song,
And joyfully they sing.
The simple ones and wise ones come,
To worship Christ the king,
And e’en the little ones have come
Their infant praise to bring;
And over all, the human choir
Its joyful anthems sing.
 AUNT MANDY’S GRANDCHILDREN
“Look here children! who’s this coming?
   Why it’s old Aunt Mandy Payne,
With her basket and her bundle
   And that big old-fashioned cane.
“Come right in! Give me your basket;
   How’ve you been, you sweet old dear?”
“Oh I’ve had a sight uv trouble
   Chile, since last time I wus here.”
“You don’t say! (Give me that bundle)
   (Now you children run and play)
And w'hat were you saying Auntie?”
   “Why Nell’s Jane has run away.”
“You don’t say so! What a pity!
   Nell was careless with that girl;
Let her run down there to Turner’s;
   Wouldn’t have done it for the world.”
“Well, Jane was Nell’s only gal child,
   An’ she couldn’t say her “no”;
But it wusn’t ’cause Nell spilte her
   Dat made dat chile take on so.
“Run away wid dat low dawky,
   An’ she’s not yet turned sixteen;
Married to dat triflin’ rascal—
   ‘Who’d she marry?’ Turner’s ’Gene!
“Yes done run away an’ miarried,
   An’ sich talk you never heard;
Turned to sassin’ me an’ Nellie,
   No! we couldn’t say a word.
“Said ’she guessed she knew her bizness,
   Mother Turner wus her friend,
She had been more sympathetic
   Than we two had ever been.
“Umph! that jes‘ set Nellie crazy!
   An’ it made me mighty sick,
But I seed as quick as lightnin’
   Somepin’ else—the chile wus tricked!
“Yes indeed! dat’s wlhat’s de matter,
   An’ I jes’ tol’ Nellie so;
Fust she tried to talk me out’it,
   But at last she let me go.
“An’ I want to tell you honey”
   (Here Aunt Mandy’s voice grew low)’
Dah’s a spell on all Nell’s children
   Dat is whut I’d have you know!
“Fust ’twas Jim; he took to stealin’;
   Den Bob took runnin’ roun’
Wid dem triflin’ low-life dawkies
   Dat you find in ev’ry town.
“Now it’s Jennie—Nellie’s baby,
   An’ I spec’ ’twill break her hawt;
Oh a spell is on dem children,
   Kinder b’lieved it frum de stawt.
“An’ I jes’ ’bout know who done it;
   I’m a-watching ev’ry sign;
An’ I’ll tell you all about it,
   When I’ve satisfied my mind.”
Then, Aunt Mandy, nodding wisely,
   Went ‘to see de chaps a while,’
And the younger woman watched her,
   With a thoughtful, half-sad smile.
 “Poor old fashioned, love blind granny!
   Any one outside could see
How they humored all those children
   What the consequence would be.
“So she thinks it’s conjuration;
   Hard to change when one is old;
Well, if that will help her bear it,
   Let her b’lieve it, dear old soul!”
SPRING’S PROMISE
The Spring returns, and all the land is beaming;
   The birds come back from Southland’s sunny clime;
The earth with signs of waking life is teeming.
   All move in harmony to nature’s time.
The grass is springing up in yonder meadow,
   The trees are putting forth their tender leaves;
Across miy window flits a tiny shadow—
   The birds are nesting ’neath the cottage eaves.
Where e’er I turn there’s hope and joy and gladness,
   And life, new life, sweet springtime’s agelong sign.
And yet, for some there rings a note of sadness—
   Spring comes with life, but leaves their dead behind.
Ah, well may come glad Easter at this season,
   When waking life on hill and field and plain,
Wrings from sad hearts the cry of blind unreason
   For those they know can never come again.
But Easter comes, proclaiming: “He is risen!”
   “Come see the place where once thy Lord didst lay;
And know ye this: that when He broke His prison.
   The stone from ev’ry tomb was rolled away!”
Oh blessed hope unto all sad hearts given!
   And waking life on hill and field and plain,
Rings sweet with promise sent to us from heaven.
   Look up! Rejoice! thy dead shall live again.
 THE SETTLEMENT WORKER’S PRAYER
I pray for those about me here,
   I strive to make them good and true,
And then my heart cries: “God help me”
   For oh my Lord, I need thee too.
They bring their tales of woe to me;
   They ask me Lord, what they shall do;
I bring them with their woes to thee,
   And oh I bring my burdens too.
Dear Lord, I would not selfish be,
   But thou knowest well my strength is small,
And oh thou knowest too dear Lord,
   That should I falter, they might fall.
And so I earnest pray to thee.
   That thou wouldst make them good and true;
And when thy blessing comes to them,
   Oh, loving Savior, bless me too.
CONSECRATION
Oh God, whose wisdom, well I know
   Can still this world’s unrest,
Set up thy kingdom in my heart;
   I dare not pray for less.
How can I bid men call on thee,
   To still their troubled souls
While aught but thy almighty pow’r
   Within my heart controls?
I fain would tell men how thy pow’r
   Has kept my hot heart still,
And thou canst do the same for them,
   I know thou canst and will.
No strength of mine, nor intellect,
   Have saved me from the fall,
So trusting in thy pow’r alone,
   I consecrate my all.
Rule thou supreme within my heart,
   Oh, God of righteousness!
That I may bring thy healing balm,
   To others in distress.
 LET US GET BACK TO GOD
Oh, men and women, high and low,
   Who ev’ry path have trod,
And know not whither now to go,
   Let us get back to God!
The world is full of dark unrest,
   Of woe and strife and sin,
Of hearts, hard, bitter and distressed,
   Worn out with problems grim.
And women wailing drearily,
   And men with fury red,
Their hands o’erfilled with luxury,
   And yet they cry for bread.
They see not blessings when they come;
   They’re blinded by unrest;
Their lips to gratitude are dumb,
   They know not happiness.
Dark Envy with his blighting train
   Is sweeping through the land.
And peace and happiness lay slain
   Beneath his blasting hand.
Men covet talent, wealth and fame,
   And join in envy’s strife,
Neglecting gifts God gave to them,
   To make a useful life.
They scorn the simple laws he gave,
   To make the least sublime,
And so o’er earth there sweeps a wave
   Of restlessness, and crime.
No pow’r on earth can stay this tide,
   Or lift us from the clod,
No pow’r on earth nor ocean wide,
   Let us get back to God!
The God Who e’er did sovereign hold,
   Though earthly monarchs fell;
The God of Abraham of old,
   The God of Israel.
The mighty God who ever leads
   His hosts to victory,
And heals their wounds, supplies their needs,
   Unless they disobey.
But ever since the world began,
   When nations hold their sway,
Regardless of Jehovah’s plan,
   He turns his face away.
He turns His face away and then—
   Behold Confusion’s reign!
Of war and pestilence and sin,
   Unrest, and greed for gain.
And nowhere find they happiness,
   But ’neath His staff and rod,
With all our problems and unrest,
   Let us get back to God!
 FAINT HEART
You say you love the lady fair,
   Your heart is full of woe;
I wonder if, oh craven heart,
   You’ve ever told her so!
You blame her for her haughty pride,
   And say she ought to know;
I blame you for your cowardice
   If you’ve not told her so.
And even if she’s heard your sighs,
   And thinks your love is true,
If you have never said a word,
   What can the lady do?
Despite the many theories
   And all the notions new,
The modest maid still waits, until
   Her lover comes to woo.
So if you ask me for advice,
   I say with ne’er a doubt,
That if your love is worth the name,
   You’ll write or speak it out.
THE MOTHERS DEAR
The mothers dear: God bless them
   The mothers young and fair;
The mothers dear: God bless them!
   With silver in their hair.
The mothers dear: God bless them!
   The mothers old and young,
Throughout all generations
   Their praises will be sung.
The men of ev’ry station,
   Wealth, poverty and fame,
When asked to judge the mother,
   Their verdict is the same.
We hear from highest places
   Familiar words, but true:
“I owe to my dear mother
   The worthy deeds I do.”
We hear another saying:
   Who trod the whirlwind’s track,
“My mother’s love and counsel
   Found me and brought me back.”
And to their testimonies,
   We gladly add our own:
That our own faithful mother
   Was sweetest ever known.
And while with grateful homage
   The mothers’ praise we sing,
Let’s breathe a prayer for that one
   Who has no wedding ring.
 MORE THlAN NINETY YEARS
On the ninety-first anniversary of Union
Baptist Church, Cincinnati, Ohio.
If they could be with us today,
As we review the work we’ve done,
I wonder, friends, what they would say,
Those veterans of ’31.
They wrought when hope was burning low
   For men of color in this land;
Before God struck with mighty blow,
   And slavery fell beneath his hand.
And still they wrought with courage strong,
   This little band of freemen true,
And proved they, to the doubting throng,
   What this down-trodden race could do.
They dared to do what colored men
   Of weaker courage dared not do—
They strove to be intelligent,
   And still unto their God be true.
God understood for What they strove
   And stooped to cherish and protect:
For one of Satan’s strongest foes,
   Is God-directed intellect.
So this church struggled on and grew,
   Her battle e’er for God and right;
With aim still high and ideals true,
   She stands today, a beacon light!
Yes all these years this church has stood;
   Those early warriors are gone;
Yet all these years, the fight for good,
   Has e’er been bravely carried on.
The years will pass, and still she’ll stand;
   Though she has faults, yet she will win;
For ev’ry church, as ev’ry man,
   Must battle with besetting sin.
’Tis trusting God that cleaves the way;
   She’s trusted more than ninety years;
Were those old founders here today,
   They would be smiling through their tears.
 RAYMOND G. DANDRIDGE
Cincinnati’s Invalid Poet
An angel came to scatter gifts
   Among earth’s restless throng,
And to this noble invalid,
   He gave the gift of song.
So lying helpless, on his couch,
   He sings from day to day,
Despite discouragement and pain
   That press him constantly.
Too brave to beat with helpless wings
   Against his prison bars—
God gave those helpless wings the strength
   To soar among the stars.
For with his book of verse in hand,
   We read it page by page,
And think: Birds sing t'heir sweetest songs
   Oft times within a cage.
He fights his battle with a strength,
   We scarce can understand;
Despite his helplessness and pain,
   He’s every inch a man.
I DREAM
   I dream, I dream;
I dream because it’s sweet to dream;
I know the dream will ne’er come true,
Another’s voice is calling you,
And you will answer “yes” some day,
And follow him where e’er he may.
   And yet, I dream.
   I dream, I dream;
I dream because hope is not dead;
It still lives on; I know not why;
For well I know some day ’twill die,
And I shall feel a stab of pain,
And know I can not dream again;
   Till then, I dream.
 BUT HERE BY HIS SIDE IT IS CALM
We press close, close to the Master,
   And “Lead us Lord” we pray;
For out in the world the storm -beats hard,
   And many are losing their way.
Out there is the boom of the thunder,
   And the clouds are sweeping low;
The cries of the lost and the wounded,
   As, staggering on, they go.
Out there with no guide for their footsteps,
   For their bleeding hearts no balm,
Out there the storm rages fiercely,
   But here by His side it is calm.
Out there where the fierce storm is raging,
   Men sell their souls for gain;
And women forget they are women,
   In the strife for things that are vain.
Out there are soldiers who follow
   But ever afar from their Guide;
They know not the blessed communion,
   Of those who keep close to his side.
'Tis there that we learn how His presence,
   Can brighten the darkness of night,
Why he tells us his yoke is easy,
   The burden He gives us is light.
CHILDHOOD AND MAY
Far, far adown the aisles of time,
The sprites are dancing merrily.
Their faces beam, their bright eyes shine,
But lo! tis but a memory.
A memory of childhood days,
When earth was full of sprites and fays.
They blightely walked the woodland ways;
Or scampered through the waving grass,
And peeping out, with cunning gaze,
Would watch the happy children pass.
So very near, yet out of sight;
Ah, cunning were those childhood sprites.
And bears were wise in those fair days,
They were not always rough and wild,
Oft times they’d take a child to raise,
And how we longed to be that child!
Ah happy thought! ambition rare,
To be reared by good Mother Bear.
And oh, the springtime of that day!
The season to our hearts most dear.
And springtime’s crown—the first of May,
The sweetest day in all the year.
May Day, with skies forever fair,
And scent of blossoms everywhere.
And how the birds sang in the trees!
Such songs ne’er now from bird throats rise
Such humming insects, buzzing bees,
Such gorgeous flowers and butterflies!
No wonder fairies, sprites and fays,
Roamed o’er the earth on those May Days.
 We did not dance in childish glee,
Around the May pole on that day,
But happy as the birds were we,
And celebrated our own way.
May Day we cast our shoes aside.
And barefoot, trod the meadows wide.
Such races, such athletic feats!
Then, that our feet from weights were free.
Our field day program was complete,
And light of foot as deer were we.
While those who did not love such play,
Roamed through the woods the livelong day.
Ah, far adown the aisles of time,
The sprites are dancing merrily.
Their faces beam, their bright eyes shine,
They’re keepers of our memory!
Our memory of childhood time,
When earth was full of mirth and rhyme.
A CALL TO SERVICE
He bids me rise; he bids me go
To grapple with the mighty foe;
He bids me speak; he bids me stand,
I dare not counter his command,
For He’s my God, my king.
I go, though round my path the darts
Fall thick and fast—may pierce my heart;
I dare not falter in the fight,
He bids me stand— the God of Might,
And He’s my Lord, my king.
I go, though see I not the way,
I go; my task is to obey;
The mighty God who gave me breath,
’Tis His to give me life or death,
Mine to obey my King.
A voice above the roaring sea
Says naught of harm shall come to me,
And though sometimes my courage fails,
I know ’tis but the flesh that quails,
My soul says: “All is well.”
And so with all my strength I go,
To grapple with the mighty foe;
The foe that fain would crush my race;
I meet him boldly face to face;
I fear not his ferocity
For God is mightier than he,
And in his strength I’ll win.
 BEREAVEMENT
The Angel of Death claims our loved ones;
He claims them again and again;
But we never get used to the partings,
And we never get used to the pain;
So our hearts are, heavy—so heavy
And our tears are falling like rain.
So dear to our hearts are our loved ones,
And each holds a place all his own;
A place that belongs to no other
We ever shall know, or have known,
And a place forever is vacant
When one from the circle has flown.
No wonder we weep when death calls them,
E’en though we know they’re at rest;
No wonder the Father bends closer
That we may lean on his breast;
For the hardest of all of life’s lessons
Is: learning His way is the best.
WHAT MEAN THIS BLEATING OF THE SHEEP?
And Samuel said, What meaneth then this
bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing
of the oxen which I hear?
1 Samuel 15:14.
America, proud freedom’s land,
   Thy flag is trailing in the dust!
Where are thy boasted precepts grand,
   Thy pledge of faith: “In God We Trust?”
Thou criest to the world’s oppressed,
   Who stretch to thee appealing hands,
“Come hither, come! here end thy quest,
   Thou’lt find a refuge in this land.”
“This land of love and liberty,
   Far-famed in history and song;
Where Justice holds supremacy,
   Where God is feared and faith is strong.”
Oh, cease thy boasting freedom’s land!
   ’Twere sweeter far to hear thee weep;
If thou hast heeded God’s command,
   What mean this bleating of the sheep?
Thy founders fled, with hearts aflame
   With freedom’s fire, across the waves;
Ere long, to them the Tempter came,
   And offered them a band of slaves.
Alas! they failed, those founders proud,
   And as they gained in freedom’s power,
There followed ever, like a cloud,
   The shadow of that testing hour.
 And when they stood, from England free,
   A voice came from that shadow deep,
E’en while they shouted “Victory”,
   “What mean this bleating of the sheep?”
For lo! they rose at Freedom’s call,
   And rent their galling chains away,
But left the black man still a thrall,
   Without a hope of Freedom’s day.
Arid so that warning shadow spread,
   Until it covered all the land;
And civil war, the nation’s dread,
   Clutched at its throat with bloody hands.
And brother strove with brother then,
   Upon that awful field of blood,
Until the fettered African,
   Before the world, a free man stood.
Alas! they did not loose his bands
   Because they hated slavery.
But that their fair united land,
   Might ever undivided be.
And so they broke the galling chains,
   And bade the African go free;
But cast a stigma on his name,
   That blighted all his liberty.
In this great Freedom’s land he saw
   That other nations refuge found,
While prejudice’s cruel law
   In chains of thralldom held him bound.
He saw the laws that make men free,
   For him grow feeble from disuse;
And boasted Christian charity
   Sink to oppression and abuse.
Again we hear the solemn words,
   Forerunner of King Saul’s defeat—
“What mean this lowing of the herds,
   What mean this bleating of the sheep?”
For more than fifty years have passed,
   Since you declared the black man free,
And still your fetters hold him fast,
   Bound in that other slavery.
You care not that he’s proved his worth,
   You care not for his loyalty;
The land that gave the black man birth
   Has proved his deadly enemy.
You block his pathway to success,
   By force, deceit, and strategy;
And oft your brutal prejudice,
   Finds outlet in the mob’s wild sway.
You cause’for mobs you’d glorify:
   The black man’s crime ’gainst womanhood.
And while you flaunt the baleful lie,
   You hound the women of his blood.
Yes, hound them till you bring them low,
   Protected by your laws unjust;
Then call them vile names, when you know
   They’re but the victims of your lust.
How dare you boast of chivalry,
   And haste to shed the black man’s blood,
While you, like wolves, feast greedily
   On unprotected womanhood?
You, lifting guilty hands to God,
   Vow universal liberty;
While ’neath your feet, the trampled sod
   Reeks with the blood of tyranny.
 Your brother’s blood, though dark his face,
   Shed by the fiendish mob’s decree;
His crime? A member of that race
   You’ve held long years in slavery.
You dragged him, bleeding, through the streets.
   To where you’d built a ghastly pyre;
You tortured him like savage beasts,
   Then cast him, living, in the fire.
Your mothers with their babes were there,
   To view that feast of fire and blood;
Your sisters, wives and sweethearts fair,
   God pity such base womanhood!
Oh proud, vain women of the South,
   You also have a work to do!
For jealous pride has sealed your mouths
   Till you’ve become the victims too.
Too proud to own your sister’s wrongs,
   Or say your men do aught amiss,
You languish in your broken homes,
   Or join in revels such as this.
Yes, revels that should make you blush;
   Instead, you lend a helping hand
To make your lauded Sunny South
   The fest’ring plague spot of the land.
Arise! Arise! count not the cost!
   Where is your boasted Southern fire?
That nation is forever lost
   Whose women sink into the mire.
America, proud freedom’s land,
   Your flag is trailing in the dust!
Where are your boasted precepts grand,
   Your pledge of faith: “In God We Trust?”
Did you thus trust Almighty God,
   The blacks would have their liberty;
Nor would you wait until His rod
   Drives you again to set them free.
How dare you say you trust your God,
   And keep your mob and Ku Klux Klan?
Did you thus trust Almighty God,
   You’d scourge the monsters from the land!
Had you such faith, your Freedom’s vow,
   You made to God, you’d dare to keep;
And He would not be asking now:
   “What mean this bleating of the sheep?”
He asked that question years ago,
   And well you know the price you paid;
Your streaming blood, your cries of woe,
   A bitter lamentation made.
He speaks again; you’ll not obey;
   You raise weak arms against his might,
But soon there’ll come a bitter day
   When he will scourge you to the right.
E’en now your wards from foreign lands,
   Are forging chains of Anarchy;
And while you chain the African,
   They’ll bind you in their slavery.
You welcome knaves to liberty,
   But scorn the loyal African;
You’ll learn the worth of loyalty,
   When Anarchy invades the land.
Beware, America, the proud!
   Thou’lt surely bitter harvest reap;
Once more there comes in accents loud:
   “What mean this bleating of the sheep?”
 Seek not like King Saul by device
   An answer to that question deep;
Who said it was for sacrifice,
   He spared the cattle and the sheep.
For God beheld his sinful heart,
   And spoke the words of doom to S$ul;
Unless thou from this sin depart,
   America, thou too, shalt fall!
OUR SIDE OF THE RACE PROBLEM
I come to you, my countrymen,
   Come with and earnest plea,
I pray the God of Israel,
   That you’ll lend ear to me.
For, like those murm’ring men of old,
   You wander in distress;
You’ve left Egyptian slavery,
   To find the wilderness.
You’ve left the land of Pharaoh,
   And deem that you are free,
But lo! a hundred foes arise,
   To claim your liberty.
I speak not of the barriers,
   Your proud White brothers place,
I’m speaking of the deadly foes,
   That rise in your own race.
Division, lust and slavishness,
   Envy and jealousy.
Your disrespect for your own race,
   And lack of charity.
The proud white man betrays your trust,
   Your faith he never blunts.
Him you forgive a hundred times,
   Your poor black brother—once.
You gladly see the white man rise
   To wealth or to renown,
But when a black man fain would rise,
   Your envy drags him down.
 You care not for the pain you give,
   Your motto seems to be:
“No colored man upon this earth
   Shall be ahead of me.”
How can we rise if none excel?
   Where will our leaders be?
Our envy and our selfishness
   Destroy our unity.
We cannot be the Christian race
   That we profess to be,
And lack the greatest grace of all,
   The grace of charity.
’Tis easier to close our eyes
   And soar in heavenly flight,
Than plod along life’s rugged way
   And treat each other right.
But though we soar in rhapsody,
   And view the realms above,
We’ll fail—and we shall always fail,
   Until we learn to love.
You say more faith and joy and hope
   Than any race have we;
The Bible says that these are naught,
   Devoid of charity.
That charity that envieth not,
   That’s patient, true and kind;
Sweet charity! the only grace
   Our scattered race can bind.
Oh be not like the Pharisees,
   Who other faiths abhorred,
And placed their faith above all men’s—
   Then crucified their Lord.
You say that slav’ry’s blasting- curse
   Still has you in its toils;
E’en though it be, yours is the task
   To loose the serpent’s coils.
Despite the white man’s prejudice,
   Despite his treachery,
You still will cast your race aside,
   To give him loyalty.
The white man comes with lustful love,
   A deadly serpent’s slime,
You deem it honor and romance,
   When it but leads to crime.
You give the children of such love
   A high and honored place;
You scorn the black man’s baseborn child,
   And shrink from that disgrace.
While white men’s blood at any cost,
   You count among your gains,
They hate your blood, and brand the man
   With one drop in his veins.
Oh friends of mine, how can you rise
   To power and liberty,
With such distorted slavish views
   Of pride and chastity.
How can you rise? how can you rise
   With such a weight as this?
You sanction by your self-disdain
   The white man’s prejudice.
You would the white man’s equal be,
   With strength his onslaughts meet.
Then ’stead of standing at his side,
   You grovel at his feet.
 What gain you by your servile mein,
   Your meek and lowly place?
For when you kneel to shun his blows
   He kicks you in the face.
Arise! Arise! stand on your feet,
   For take this truth from me:
No nation e’er has yet been known
   To crawl to liberty.
The law may give us equal rights,
   The boon our nation craves,
But if we stand not on our feet,
   We’re still the white man’s slaves.
God made all nations of one blood,
   And we his servants be,
Then dare we cast his word aside,
   And bow to man’s decree?
You call it by a gentler name,
   And hope to ’scape the rod—
Wrong will be wrong and sin be sin,
   As long as God is God.
Whenever God gives a command
   He gives strength to obey,
’Tis only wlien our faith is weak,
   We fail to find the way.
Then rise, ye men of pure black blood,
   And mixed blood—brothers all,
Away with slavish vanities,
   Arise at manhood’s call!
Your people, in the foeman’s toils,
   Cry out for liberty,
Yours is the task, to rise like men,
   And help them to be free.
Cast envy and intrigue aside;
   Join in the nobler strife—
Help your divided race to rise
   Into the broader life.
Yours is the task their rights to gain,
   Their safety to secure,
And fight as other men have fought,
   To keep your women pure.
Your women! oh ’tis God alone,
   Knows what they’ve had to bear,
Of slavery’s curse, and aftermath
   They’ve had a double share.
Your arms by slav’ry paralyzed,
   Have proved a feeble stay,
In consequence, too oft, too oft
   They’ve been the white man’s prey.
But when you learn to stand like men,
   To cherish and protect.
To sympathize instead of blame,
   You’ll win their deep respect.
’Tis only by the power of God,
   That they have bravely stood,
And kept their courage and their faith,
   Their strength and womanhood.
Your women! oh you need not fear,
   That they will not be true,
For when you bravely lead the way,
   They’ll gladly follow you.
And now be patient, friends of mine,
   I have just one more plea,
God bids me speak, and oh my friends
   I dare not silent be.
 My plea to ministers of God:
   You too must take your stand,
And teach your people what it means
   To be a godly man.
If God has called you from the world,
   His ministers to be,
Then walk before the world like men
   Of strength and purity.
’Tis true that Satan often hurls
   His sharpest darts your way,
But if you truly trust in God,
   You need not be his prey.
God holds his children safe within
   The hollow of his hand;
Then if he’s called you to his work,
   He’ll give you grace to stand.
For shepherds cannot lead their flocks
   The straight and narrow way,
While they themselves are wandering,
   And going far astray.
Men wonder why so oft you fail,
   When comes the crucial hour—
You sacrifice sincerity,
   And godliness for power.
Led on by pride, you often make,
   A lordship of your call,
When Christ has said: that he who leads
   Must servant be of all.
Know you what meant he when he said:
   Leaders must servants be?
He meant: They serve their fellowmen,
   With Christ’s humility.
Humility that makes all tasks
   However great or small,
A noble service for our God,
   Who’s king and Lord of all.
And oh you ministers give heed,
   Or God, who understands,
Will give the task He’s given you,
   Into more faithful hands.
Lead on your flocks, oh men of God,
   And this your watchword be:
All glory to the King of kings,
   Who gives us victory.
Teach them to truly worship God,
   Not idle dreamers be;
Help them to learn the law of love,
   And live consistently.
Lead on! and may God give you strength
   And courage to endure;
For if a fallen race would rise,
   Her prophets must be pure.
 THE BONDS OF SERVICE
 
We strain at the chains that bind us,
And struggle to be free;
We’d leave our burdens behind us,
And fly to liberty.
We’d cast off the things that fret us,
The trials hard to bear,
The many cares that beset us,
The duties ever near.
Yet, somewhere I’ve heard so truly,
The echo still remains,
That he who would live life nobly,
Is bound by a hundred claims.
And only those who are selfish
Can boast full liberty,
How noble the bonds of service!
Why struggle to be free?
SHE PRAYED
One morning in the long ago,
   I stole in from my play,
But paused beside the open door
   To hear my mother pray.
My mother who had lain so long,
   Upon a bed of pain,
And knew full well that health and strength,
   Would ne’er be hers again.
She prayed; I stood in childish awe
   And listened to her prayer;
She prayed as only mothers pray,
   She knew not I was there.
She prayed for her three little girls,
   Such tiny maids were we;
I wondered vaguely at her fears,
   Too young the path to see.
She prayed; awestruck, I listened there;
   She told God all her fears,
As I stole back to play again.
   That prayer was in my ears.
The memory of many things,
   Slipped from my childish brain.
But oh, the mem’ry of that prayer,
   Forever shall remain.
One little maiden stole away,
   Ere two short years had gone,
And joined the mother whom she loved *
   The others journeyed on.
 And when I see how safe they’ve come,
   Through all the changing years,
I whisper with a grateful heart:
   “God heard my mother’s prayers.”
SOMETIME, SOMEWHERE
Sometime, somewhere in ev’ry life,
There comes the need of God;
We may not recognize the truth,
Or cast it off in pride of youth
Or manhood’s sophistry,
But there can be no substitute
When comes that need of God.
Along life’s beach what wrecks are strewn,
And ships have gone to ports unknown
Tossed by storms that prevail,
When man bows not his stubborn will,
Nor lets the Master say “Be still,”
To winds that toss and flail.
Sometime, somewhere, in ev’ry life
There comes the need of God;
Where e’er you be, whoe’er you are,
Your ship will have a broken spar,
Your life will bear imperfect fruit,
If seek you for a substitute,
When comes that need of God.
 CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
Scot dashed into his sick wife’s room;
   “What’s happened Dick?” she said.
Breathless, he flung a heavy sack
   Beneath his sick wife’s bed.
He scarce had time to turn around,
   For in two minutes more,
The farmers close upon his heels,
   Were knocking at his door.
“Dick Scot, we’ve come to search your house!
   ’Bout caught you in the trick;
Come now, you needn’t say a word,
   We’re goin’ to do it Dick!”
“Well, search de house den, ef you will,
   An’ git thu wid it quick,
But don’t you dah to search dat room
   Wha’ my po‘ wife lays sick.”
“Scot, you had chickens in that sack,
   You know as well as I,
You bought your groceries yesterday,
   We ain’t goin’ let you by.
“We count on searching ev’ry room,
   For Jones here saw you run;
I’ll bet you’ve hid the chickens there”—
   Scot sprang and seized his gun.
Then standing in the sick room door,
   With blazing eyes, said Scot:
“De fust man steps across dis sill,
   I shoots him on de spot!
“I know you’s got no ’spects fah me,
   I know you, ev’ry one;
Ef I cain’t check you wid my words,
   I’ll Check you wid my gun.
“01’ Dick Scot knows a thing er two;
   You whitefolks ain’t de law;
You come hyar try’n to play wid me,
   You’ll find de lion’s paw.
“Yes search de house! Yes search de house!
   Who keers fur ol’ black Dick?
But don’t you dah to come in hyar,
   Wha’ my po’ wife lays sick.”
The farmers searched the other rooms
   And, grumbling, went away;
Scot packed his things that very night,
   And moved to town next day.
He knew the alley where he’d go
   The farmers never went,
So on the air, as he drove off,
   A ringing laugh he sent.
“Shame on you Dick;” his sick wife said;
   ‘Well honey, whut’s de use,
Nigh all we git fum dese white folks
   Is scoffin’ an’ abuse.”
No neighbors near, none saw him go;
   And when three days had gone
They came—and found the house and yard,
   With feathers overstrewn.

A NOTE ON BLUES
The first eight and the last nine poems in this book are
written after the manner of the Negro folk-songs known
as Blues. The Blues, unlike the Spirituals, have a strict
poetic pattern: one long line repeated and a third line to
rhyme with the first two. Sometimes the second line in
repetition is slightly changed and sometimes, but very
seldom, it is omitted. The mood of the Blues is almost
always despondency, but when they are sung people laugh.
BLUES 
HEY!
Sun's a settin',
This is what I'm gonna sing.
Sun's a settin';
This is what I'm gonna sing:

An' de road is hard an' long.

Lookin' for a box car
To roll me to de South.
Homesick blues, Lawd,
'S a terrible thing to have.
Homesick blues is
A terrible thing to have.
To keep from cryin'
I opens ma mouth an' laughs.
RAILROAD AVENUE
RAILROAD AVENUE
Dusk dark
On Railroad Avenue.
Lights in the fish joints,
Lights in the pool rooms.
A box-car some train
Has forgotten
In the middle of the
Block.
A player piano,
A victrola.
   942
   Was the number.
A boy
Lounging on a corner.
A passing girl
With purple powdered skin.
   Laughter
   Suddenly
   Like a taut drum.
   Laughter
   Suddenly
   Neither truth nor lie.
   Laughter
Hardening the dusk dark evening.
   Laughter
Shaking the lights in the fish joints,
Rolling white balls in the pool rooms,
And leaving untouched the box-car
Some train has forgotten.
BRASS SPITOONS
Clean the spitoons, boy.
   Detroit,
   Chicago,
   Atlantic City,
   Palm Beach.
Clean the spitoons.
The steam in hotel kitchens,
And the smoke in hotel lobbies,
And the slime in hotel spitoons:
Part of my life.
   Hey, boy!
   A nickel,
   A dime,
   A dollar
Two dollars a day.
   Hey, boy!
   A nickel,
   A dime,
   A dollar,
   Two dollars
Buys shoes for the baby.
House rent to pay.
Gin on Saturday,
Church on Sunday.
   My God!
Babies and gin and church
and women and Sunday
all mixed up with dimes and
dollars and clean spitoons
and house rent to pay.
   Hey, boy!
A bright bowl of brass is beautiful to the Lord.
Bright polished brass like the cymbals
Of King David's dancers,
Like the wine cups of Solomon.
   Hey, boy!
A clean spitoon on the altar of the Lord.
A clean bright spitoon all newly polished, –
At least I can offer that.
Com’ mere, boy!
RUBY BROWN
She was young and beautiful
And golden like the sunshine
That warmed her body.
And because she was colored
Mayville had no place to offer her,
Nor fuel for the clean flame of joy
That tried to burn within her soul.
One day,
Sitting on old Mrs. Latham's back porch
Polishing the silver,
She asked herself two questions
And they ran something like this:
What can a colored girl do
On the money from a white woman's kitchen?
And ain't there any joy in this town?
Now the streets down by the river
Know more about this pretty Ruby Brown,
And the sinister shuttered houses of the bottoms
Hold a yellow girl
Seeking an answer to her questions.
The good church folk do not mention
Her name any more.
But the white men,
Habitués of the high shuttered houses,
Pay more money to her now
Than they ever did before,
When she worked in their kitchens.
THE NEW CABARET GIRL
That little yaller gal
Wid blue-green eyes:
If her daddy ain't white
Would be a surprise.
She don't drink gin
An' she don't like corn.
I asked her one night
Where she was born.
An' she say, Honey,
I don't know
Where I come from
Or where I go.
That crazy little yaller gal
Wid blue-green eyes:
If her daddy ain't 'fay
Would be a surprise.
An' there she sets a cryin'
In de cabaret
A lookin' all sad
When she ought to play.
My God, I says,
You can't live that way!
Babe, you can't
Live that way!
CLOSING TIME
Starter!
   Her face is pale
   In the doorway light.
   Her lips blood red
   And her skin blue white.
Taxi!
   I'm tired.
Deep ... River… 
   O, God, please!
The river and the moon hold memories.
   Cornets play.
   Dancers whirl.
   Death, be kind
   What was the cover charge, kid?
To a little drowned girl.
PRIZE FIGHTER
Only dumb guys fight.
   If I wasn't dumb
   I wouldn't be fightin'.
   I could make six dollars a day
   On the docks
   And I'd save more than I do now.
Only dumb guys fight.
CRAP GAME
Lemme roll 'em, boy.
I got ma tail curled!
If a seven don't come
'Leven ain't far away.
An' if I craps,
Dark baby,
Trouble
Don't last all de time.
Hit 'em, bones!
BALLAD OF GIN MARY
Carried me to de court,
Judge was settin' there.
Looked all around me,
Didn't have a friend nowhere.
Judge Pierce he says, Mary.
Old Judge says, Mary Jane,
Ever time I mounts this bench
I sees yo' face again.
O, Lawd!     O, Lawd!
O, Lawd ... Lawdee!
Seems like bad licker,
Judge, won't let me be.
Old Judge says you's a drunkard.
Fact is you worries me.
Gwine give you eighteen months
So licker'll let you be.
Eighteen months in jail !
O, eighteen months locked in!
Won't be so bad in jail.
But I'll' miss ma gin.
O, please sir, Judge, have mercy!
Have mercy, please, on me!
Old hard-faced Judge says eighteen months
Till licker'll let you be.
DEATH OF DO DIRTY: A ROUNDER'S SONG
O, you can't find a buddy
Any old time
'Ll help you out
When you ain't got a dime.
He was a friend o'mine.
They called him Do Dirty,
Cause he was black
An' had cut his gal
An' shot a man in de back.
Ma friend o' mine.
But when I was hungry,
Had nothin' to eat,
He bought me corn bread
An' a stew o' meat.
Good friend o' mine.
An' when de cops got me
An' put me in jail
If Dirty had de money,
He'd go ma bail.
O, friend o'mine.
That night he got kilt
I was standin' in de street.
Somebody comes by
An' says yo' boy is gettin' beat.
Ma friend o mine.
But when I got there
An' seen de ambulance
A guy was sayin'
He ain't got a chance.
Best friend o mine.
An' de ones that kilt him, –
Damn their souls, – 
I'm gonna fill 'em up full o'
Bullet holes.
Ma friend o mine.
ELEVATOR BOY
I got a job now
Runnin' an elevator
In the Dennison Hotel in Jersey.
Job ain't no good though.
No money around.
   Jobs are just chances
   Like everthing else.
   Maybe a little luck now,
   Maybe not.
   Maybe a good job sometimes:
   Step out o' the barrel, boy.
Two new suits an'
A woman to sleep with.
   Maybe no luck for a long time.
   Only the elevators
   Goin' up an' down,
   Up an' down,
   Or somebody elses' shoes
   To shine,
   Or greasy pots in a dirty kitchen.
I been runnin' this
Elevator too long
Guess I'll quit now.
PORTER
I must say
Yes, sir,
To you all the time, .
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
All my days
Climbing up a great big mountain
Of yes, sirs!
Rich old white man
Owns the world.
Gimme yo' shoes
To shine.
Yes, sir!
SPORT
Life
For him
Must be
The shivering of
A great drum
Beaten with swift sticks
Then at the closing hour
The lights go out
And there is no music at all
And death becomes
An empty cabaret
And eternity an unblown saxophone
And yesterday
A glass of gin
Drunk long
Ago.
SATURDAY NIGHT
Play it once.
O, play some more.
Charlie is a gambler
An' Sadie is a whore.
   A glass o' whiskey
   An' a glass o’ gin:
   Strut, Mr. Charlie,
   Till de dawn comes in.
Pawn yo' gold watch
An' diamond ring.
Git a quart o' licker,
Let's shake dat thing!
   Skee-de-dad!    De-dad!
   Doo-doo-doo!
   Won't be nothin' left
   When de worms git through
   An' you's a long time
   Dead
   When you is
   Dead, too.
So beat dat drum, boy!
Shout dat song:
Shake 'em up an' shake 'em up
All night long
   Hey!    Hey!
   Ho …  Hum!
   Do, it, Mr. Charlie,
   Till de red dawn come.
GLORY! HALLELUIAH!
JUDGMENT DAY
They put ma body in de ground,
Ma soul went flyin' o' de town.
Lord Jesus!
Went flyin' to de stars an' moon
A shoutin' God, I's comin' soon.
O Jesus!
Lord in heaben,
Crown on His head,
Says don't be 'fraid
Cause you ain't dead.
Kind Jesus!
An' now I'm settin' clean an' bright
In de sweet o' ma Lord's sight, – 
   Clean an' bright,
      Clean an' bright.
PRAYER MEETING
Glory!    Halleluiah!
De dawn's a-comin'!
Glory!    Halleluiah!

In the amen-corner of the
Ebecanezer Baptist Church.
A black old woman croons, – 
De dawn's a-comin'!
FEET O' JESUS
At de feet o' Jesus,
Sorrow like a sea.
Lordy, let yo' mercy
Come driftin' down on me.
At de feet o' Jesus,
At yo' feet I stand.
O, ma little Jesus,
Please reach out yo' hand.
PRAYER

Which way to go?
I ask you this:
Which sin to bear?
Which crown to put
Upon my hair?

Somewhere in yo' sky.
   Yes, Lord!

But de angels wings is white as snow,

An' a sinner in yo' sight.
Have mercy, Lord!
BEALE STREET LOVE
BEALE STREET LOVE
Love
Is a brown man's fist
With hard knuckles
Crushing the lips,
Blackening the eyes, – 
Hit me again,
Says Clorinda.
CORA
I broke ma heart this mornin'.
Ain't got no heart no mo'.
Next time a man comes near me
Gonna shut an' lock ma door
Cause they treats em mean, – 
The ones I loves.
They always treats me mean. 
WORKIN' MAN
I works all day
Wid a pick an' a shovel.
Comes home at night, – 
It ain't nothin' but a hovel.
I calls for ma woman
When I opens de door.
She's out in de street, –
Ain't nothin' but a 'hore.
I does her good
An' I treats her fine,
But she don't gimme lovin'
Cause she ain't de right kind.
I'm a hard workin' man
An' I sho pays double
Cause I tries to be good
An' gits nothin' but trouble.
BAD LUCK CARD
Cause you don't love me
Is awful, awful hard.
Gypsy done showed me
Ma bad luck card.
There ain't no good left
In this world for me.
Gypsy done tole me, —
Unlucky as can be.
I don't know what
Po’ weary me can do.
Gypsy says I'd kill ma self
If I was you.
BABY
Albert!
Hey, Albert!
Don't you play in dat road.
   You see dem trucks
   A goin' by.
   One run ovah you
   An' you die.
Albert, don't you play in dat road.
EVIL WOMAN
I ain't gonna mistreat ma
Good gal any more.
I'm just gonna kill her
Next time she makes me sore.
I treats her kind but
She don't do me right.
She fights an' quarrels most
Ever night.
I can't have no woman's
Got such low-down ways,
Cause a blue-gummed woman
Ain't de style now days.
I brought her from de South
An' she's goin' on back
Else I'll use her head
For a carpet tack.
A RUINED GAL
Standin' by de lonesome riverside
After de boat's done gone,
   Po' weary me
   Won't be nobody's bride
   Cause I is long gone wrong.
Standin' by de weary riverside
When de boat comes in,
   Po' lonesome me
   Won't meet nobody
   Cause I ain't got no friend.
By de edge o' de weary riverside
Night-time's comin' down.
   Ain't nothin' for a ruined gal
   But jump overboard an' drown.
O, de lonesome riverside,
O, de wicked water.
   Damn ma black old mammy's soul
   For ever havin' a daughter.
MINNIE SINGS HER BLUES
Cabaret, cabaret!
That's where ma man an' me go.
Cabaret, cabaret!
That's where we go, –
Leaves de snow outside
An' our troubles at de door.
Jazz band, jazz band!
Ma man an' me dance.
When I cuddles up to him
No other gal's got a chance.
Baby, O, Baby,
I'm midnight mad.
If ma daddy didn't love me
It sho would be sad.
If he didn't love me
I'd go away
An' dig me a grave this very day.
Blues  …     blues !
Blue, blue, blues !
I'd sho have them blues.
DRESSED UP
I had ma clothes cleaned
Just like new.
I put 'em on but
I still feels blue.
I bought a new hat,
Sho is fine,
But I wish I had back that
Old gal o’ mine.
I got new shoes, – 
They don't hurt ma feet,
But I ain't got nobody
For to call me sweet.
BLACK GAL
I's always been a workin' girl.
I treated Albert fine.
Ain't cut him wid no razor,
Ain't never been unkind.
Yet it seems like always
Men takes all they can from me
Then they goes an' finds a yaller gal
An' lets me be.
I dressed up Albert Johnson.
I bought him suits o'clothes,
An' soon as he got out de barrel
Then out ma door he goes.
Yet I ain't never been no bad one.
Can't help it cause I'm black.
I hates them rinney yaller gals
An' I wants ma Albert back.
Ma little, short, sweet, brownskin boy, – 
Oh, God, I wants him back!
FROM THE GEORGIA ROADS
SUN SONG
Sun and softness,
Sun and the beaten hardness of the earth,
Sun and the song of all the sun-stars
Gathered together, —
Dark ones of Africa,
bring you my songs
To sing on the Georgia roads.
MAGNOLIA FLOWERS
The quiet fading out of life
In a corner full of ugliness.
I went lookin' for magnolia flowers
But I didn't find 'em.
I went lookin' for magnolia flowers in the dusk
And there was only this corner
Full of ugliness.
'Scuse me,
I didn't mean to stump ma toe on you, lady.
There ought to be magnolias
Somewhere in this dusk.
'Scuse me,
I didn't mean to stump ma toe on you.
MULATTO
I am your son, 'white man!
Georgia dusk
And the turpentine woods.
One of the pillars of the temple fell.
You are my son!
like hell!
The moon over the turpentine woods.
The Southern night
Full of stars,
Great big yellow stars.
Juicy bodies
Of nigger wenches
Blue black
Against black fences.
O, you little bastard boy,
What's a body but a toy?
The scent of pine wood stings the soft night air.
     What's the body of your mother?
Silver moonlight everywhere.
     What's the body of your mother?
Sharp pine scent in the evening air.
A nigger night,
A nigger joy,
A little yellow
Bastard boy.
Naw, you ain't my brother .
Niggers ain't my brother.
Not ever.
Niggers ain't my brother.
The Southern night is full of stars,
Great big yellow stars.
     O, sweet as earth,
     Dusk dark bodies
     Give sweet birth
To little yellow bastard boys.
Git on back there in the night,
You ain't white.
The bright stars scatter everywhere.
Pine wood scent in the evening air.
     A nigger night,
     A nigger joy.
I am your son, white man!
A little yellow
Bastard boy.
RED SILK STOCKINGS
Put on yo' red silk stockings,
Black gal.
Go out an' let de white boys
Look at yo' legs.
Ain't nothin' to do for you, nohow,
Round this town, —
You's too pretty.
Put on yo' red silk stockings, gal,
An' tomorrow's chile'll
Be a high yaller.
Go out an' let de white boys
Look at yo' legs.
JAZZ BAND IN A PARISIAN CABARET
Play that thing,
Jazz band!
Play it for the lords and ladies,
For the dukes and counts,
For the whores and gigolos,
For the American millionaires,
And the school teachers
Out for a spree.
Play it,
Jazz band!
You know that tune
That laughs and cries at the same time.
You know it
    May I?
    Mais oui.
    Mien Gott!
    Parece una rumba.
Play it, jazz band!
You've got seven languages to speak in
And then some,
Even if you do come from Georgia.
    Can I go home wid yuh, sweetie?
    Sure.
SONG FOR A DÁRK GIRL
Way Down South in Dixie
    (Break the heart of me)
They hung my black young lover
To a cross roads tree.
Way Down South in Dixie
    (Bruised body high in air)
I asked the white Lord Jesus
    What was the use of prayer.
Way Down South in Dixie
    (Break the heart of me)
Love is a naked shadow
    On a gnarled and naked tree.
MAMMY
I'ın waiting for ma mammy, —
    She is Death.
Say it very softly.
Say it very slowly if you choose.
I'm waiting for ma mammy, —
Death.
LAUGHERS

Loud laughers in the hands of Fate —

Elevator-boys,
Ladies' maids,
Crap-shooters,
Cooks,

Nurses of babies,
Loaders of ships,

Loud-mouthed laughers in the hands
   Of Fate.

LAMENT OVER LOVE
I hope ma chile'll

An' I ain't goin' there to swim.
Goin' down to de river,
Ain't goin' there to swim.
Ma true love's left me, an’
I'm goin' there to think about him.
Love is like whiskey,
Love is like red, red wine.
Love is like whiskey,
O, like sweet red wine.
If you wants to be happy
You got to love all de time.
I'm goin' up in a tower
Tall as a tree is tall.
Say up in a tower
Tall as a tree is tall.
Gonna think about ma man an'
Let ma fool-self fall.

            THE BALLAD OF THE BROWN GIRL
            OH, THIS is the tale the grandams tell
            In the land where the grass is blue,
            And some there are who say 'tis false,
            And some that hold it true.
            ·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·⁠·
            Lord Thomas on a summer's day
            Came to his mother's door;
            His eyes were ringed for want of sleep;
            His heart was troubled sore.
            He knelt him at his mother's side;
            She stroked his curly head,
            "I've come to be advised of you;
            Advise me well," he said.
            "For there are two who love me well—
            I wot it from each mouth—
            And one's Fair London, lily maid,
            And pride of all the south
            She is full shy and sweet as still
            Delight when nothing stirs;
            My soul can thrive on love of her,
            And all my heart is hers."
            His mother's slender fingers ploughed
            Dark furrows through his hair,
            "The other one who loves you well,
            Is she as sweet and fair?"
            "She is the dark Brown Girl who knows
            No more-defining name,
            And bitter tongues have worn their tips
            In sneering at her shame."
            "But there are lands to go with her,
            And gold and silver stores."
            His mother whispered in his ear,
            "And all her heart is yours."
            His mother loved the clink of gold,
            The odor and the shine
            Of larders bowed with venison
            And crystal globes of wine.
            "Oh, love is good," the lady quoth,
            "When berries ripe and sweet,
            From every bush and weighted vine
            Are crying, 'Take and eat'."
            "But what is best when winter comes
            Is gold and silver bright;
            Go bring me home the nut-brown maid
            And leave the lily-white."
            He sent his criers through the land
            To cry his wedding day,
            But bade them at Fair London's road
            To turn the other way.
            His bridal day dawned white and fair,
            His heart held night within;
            He heard its anguished beats above
            The jocund wedding din.
            The Brown Girl came to him as might
            A queen to take her crown;
            With gems her fingers flamed and flared;
            Her robe was weighted down
            Her hair was black as sin is black
            And ringed about with fire;
            Her eyes were black as night is black
            When moon and stars conspire;
            Her mouth was one red cherry clipt
            In twain, her voice a lyre.
            Lord Thomas took her jewelled hand,
            The holy words were said,
            And they have made the holy vow
            To share one board and bed.
            But suddenly the furious feast
            Is shattered with a shout;
            Lord Thomas trembles at the word,
            "Fair London is without."
            All pale and proud she stands without,
            And will not venture in;
            He leaves the side of his nut—brown bride
            To bid her enter in.
            Her skin was white as almond milk
            Slow trickling from the flower;
            Her frost-blue eyes were darkening
            Like clouds before a shower;
            He picked its strings and played a tune And sang it to the dead
            He picked its strings and played a tune
            And sang it to the dead.
            Her thin pink lips were twin rosebuds
            That had not come to flower,
            And crowning all, her golden hair
            Was loosened out in shower.
            He has taken her by her slim white hand,
            (Oh, light was her hand in his)
            But the touch ran wild and fierce and hot,
            And burned like a brand in his.
            "Lord Thomas," she said; her voice was low,
            "I come unbidden here,
            But I have come to see your bride
            And taste your bridal cheer."
            He has taken her by her slim white hand
            And led her to his bride,
            And brown and white have bent them low,
            And sat them side by side.
            He has brimmed a cup with the wedding wine,
            He has placed it in her hand,
            She has raised it high and smiled on him
            Like love in a distant land.
            "I came to see your bonny bride,
            I came to wish you well,"
            Her voice was clear as song is clear;
            Clear as a silver bell.
            "But, Thomas, Lord, is this your bride?
            I think she's mighty brown;
            Why didn't you marry a fair, bright girl
            As ever the sun shone on?
            For only the rose and the rose should mate,
            Oh, never the hare and the hound,"
            And the wine he poured for her crimson mouth
            She poured upon the ground.
            The flow of wine and jest has ceased,
            The groom has flushed and paled,
            The Brown Girl's lips are moist and red
            Where her sharp white teeth assailed.
            Dark wrath has climbed her nut-brown throat,
            And wrath in her wild blood sings,
            But she tramples her passions underfoot
            Because she comes of kings.
            She has taken her stand by her rival's side,
            "Lord Thomas, you have heard,
            As I am yours and you are mine
            By ring and plighted word,
            Avenge me here on our bridal day."—
            Lord Thomas spoke no word.
            The Brown Girl's locks were held in place
            By a dagger serpentine;
            Thin it was and long and sharp,
            And tempered well and fine.
            And legend claimed that a dusky queen,
            In a dusky dream-lit land,
            Had loved in vain, and died of it,
            By her own slim twilight hand.
            The Brown Girl's hair has kissed her waist,
            Her hand has closed on steel;
            Fair London's blood has joined the wine
            She sullied with her heel.
            Lord Thomas caught her as she fell,
            And cried, "My sweet, my fair,
            Dark night has hid the golden sun,
            And blood has thicked the air.
            The little hand that should have worn
            A golden band for me,
            The little hand that fluttered so
            Is still as death can be."
            He bent and kissed the weeping wound
            Fresh in her heart's young core,
            And then he kissed her sleeping mouth
            That would not waken more.
            He seized the Brown Girl's rippling hair
            That swung in eddies loose,
            And with one circle of his arm
            He made a hairy noose.
            He pulled it till she swooned for pain,
            And spat a crimson lake;
            He pulled it till a something snapped
            That was not made to break.
            And her he loved he brought and placed
            By her who was his bride,
            And brown and white like broken buds
            Kept vigil side by side.
            And one was like a white, white rose
            Whose inmost heart has bled,
            And one was like a red, red rose
            Whose roots have witherèd.
            Lord Thomas took a golden harp
            That hung above his head;
            He picked its strings and played a tune
            And sang it to the dead.
            "O lovers never barter love
            For gold or fertile lands,
            For love is meat and love is drink,
            And love heeds love's commands."
            "And love is shelter from the rain,
            And scowling stormy skies;
            Who casts of love must break his heart,
            And rue it till he dies"
            And then he hugged himself and grinned,
            And laughed, "Ha, ha," for glee;
            But those who watched knew he was mad,
            And shudderèd to see.
            And some made shift to go to him,
            But there was in his eye
            What made each man to turn aside
            To let his neighbor by.
            His mother in a satin gown
            Was fain to go to him,
            But his lips curled back like a gray wolf's fang,
            When the huntsmen blow to him.
            "No mother of mine, for gold's the god
            Before whose feet you fall;
            Here be two dead who will be three,
            And you have slain us all.
            Go dig one grave to hold us all
            And make it deep and wide;
            And lay the Brown Girl at my feet,
            Fair London by my side."
            And as he spoke his hand went up,
            And singing steel swept down,
            And as its kiss betrayed his heart,
            Death wore a triple crown.
            And in the land where the grass is blue,
            In a grave dug deep and wide,
            The Brown Girl sleeps at her true lord's feet,
            Fair London by his side.

Foreword by Alain Locke
FOREWORD
In the title of her first volume, The Heart of a Woman, Georgia Douglas Johnson chose with singular felicity, indeed with the felicity of instinct, her special domain in art. And as she proceeds with maturing power and courage of expression in this third volume, it becomes all the more apparent that the task which she has set herself is the documenting of the feminine heart. Any poetic expression of life from this point of view that achieves a genuine authenticity and sincerity of emotion is as welcome as it is rare. For the emotions of woman, time-old though they be and hackneyed over as in a sense they really are, are still but half expressed. They have yet to be carried beyond the platitudes and the sentimentalizations of a man-made tradition.
Yet in the wholesome stripping off of mediaeval brocades and the laces of classic conceits, it has often occurred to us to question whether the imposition of futurist patterns and the cubist cut of the current intellectual modes has given us any more vital or adequate a revelation of the flesh and blood figure of the "eternal feminine."
"Clothes are but clothes," as Carlyle would say: modern feminist realism has but overlaid the vitally human with another convention, and interposed another cloak. How long shall we make a sphinx of woman, who herself now yearns to throw off along with the mystery, the psychological vestments of disguise. Our author puts it pointedly in "Paradox,"-
Alas! you love me better cold
Strange as the pyramids of old
Responselessly . . .
So, like a veil, my poor disguise
Is draped to save me from your eyes
Deep challenges.
Fain would I fling this robe aside
And from you, in your bosom hide
Eternally.
Voicing this yearning of woman for candid self-expression, Mrs. Johnson invades the province where convention has been most tyrannous and inveterate,--the experience of love. And here she succeeds where others more doctrinally feminist than she have failed; for they in over-sophistication, in terror of platitudes and the commonplace, have stressed the bizarre, the exceptional, in one way or another have over-intellectualized their message nad overleapt the common elemental experience they would nevertheless express. Mrs. Johnson, on the contrary, in a simple declarative style, engages with an ingenuous declarative style, engages with ingenuous directness the moods and emotions of her themes. 
Through you I entered Heaven and Hell 
Knew rapture and despair.
Here is the requisite touch, certainly for the experiences of the heart. Greater sophistication would spoil the message. Fortunately, to the gift on a lyric style, delicate in touch, rhapsodic in [t]one, authentic in timbre, there has been added a temperamental endowment of ardent sincerity of emotion, ingenuous candor of expression, and, happies of all for the particular task, a naive and unsophisticated spirit. 
By way of a substantive message, Mrs. Johnson’s philosophy of life is simple, unpretentious, but wholesome and spiritually invigorating. On the one hand, she belongs with those who, under the leadership of Sara Teasdale, have been rediscovering the Sapphic cult of love as the ecstasy of life, that cult of enthusiasm which leaps over the dilemma of optimism and pessimism, and accepting the paradoxes, pulses in the immediacies of life and rejoices openly in th glory of experience. In a deeper and somewhat more individual message, upon which she only verges, and which we believe will later be her most mature and original contribution, Mrs. Johnson probes under the experiences of love to the underlying forces of natural instinct which so fatalistically control our lives. [Especially is this evident in her suggestion of the tragic poignancy of Motherhood, where the consummation of love seems also the expiation of passion, and where, between the antagonisms of the dual role of Mother and Lover, we may suspect the real dilemma of womanhood to life.]
Whatever the philosophical yield, however, we are grateful for the prospect of such lyricism. Seeking a pure lyric gold, Mrs. Johnson has gone straight to the mine of the heart. She has dug patiently in the veins of her own subjective experience. What she has gleaned has been treasured for the joy of the search and for its own intrinsic worth, and not exploited for the values of show and applause. Above all, her material has been expressed with a candor that shows that she brings to the poetic field what it lacks most,-- the gift of the elemental touch. Few will deny that, with all its other excellences, the poetry of the generation needs just this touch o make it more vitally human and more spontaneously effective.

THE CYCLE
I Closed My Shutters Fast Last Night
I closed my shutters fast last night,
Reluctantly and slow,
So pleading was the purple sky
With all the lights hung low;
I left my lagging heart outside 
Within the dark alone, 
I heard it singing through the gloom
A wordless, anguished tone.
Upon my sleepless couch I lay 
Until the tranquil morn
Came through the silver silences
To bring my heart forlorn,
Restoring it with calm caress
Unto its sheltered bower,
While whispering: “Await, wait
Your golden, perfect hour.”
Footsteps
Passing ever, early, late,
No fond footsteps seek my gate,
But down the winding road they wend
To some other journey’s end.
Yet,--I would not have them wait
Here within my guarded gate,
Certain footsteps I shall know,
And for them I listen low!
Oh Night of Love
Oh night of love, your rapt ecstatic hours
Were mine, the languor of their pale perfume
Pervades me, kisses in a fountain-fire,
Surround me,--fetter and consume.
Oh night of love, your groves of strange content
Project a thralldom over comind days;
Exalted, derelict, and blind I went
Unmindfully along Life’s misty ways. 
Autumn
Believe me–when I say
That love like yours, at this belated hour,
Overwhelms me,--
Stills the fount of thought!
I move as one new-born–
And strange to swift transitions
As from my prison door
I gaze
Into a blinding sunlight!
Thralldom
Your voice keeps ringing down the day
   In accents soft and mild,
   With which you have beguiled
   And wooed me as a child.
Your presence bounds my every way
   And thrills me in its fold
   With phantom hands that hold
   Like cherished chains of gold. 
Separation
Within your pulsing day 
There must be little space
For visions of my face
To lure your thoughts away.
Yet, I would have it so,
To be alone the pain
That saddens love’s refrain.
Pray God you never know!
Proving
Were you a leper bathed in wounds
   And by the world denied,
I’d share your fatal exile
   As a privilege, with pride.
You are the very sun, the moon,
   The starlight of my soul,
The sounding motif of my heart 
   Its impetus and goal!
Interim
The days lie dark between our jeweled meetings
Like wintry burials.
My heart bows low before the cheerless hearth
Until your voice rings through the gloom
And bids me
Wake!
And live!
Good-Bye
Let’s say ‘Good-bye’
Nor wait Love’s latest breath
Poised now so lightly on the wing of Death,
While yet within our eye one fervent gleam 
Remains to hallow this, a passing dream:
Yes, yes ‘Good-bye,’
For it is best to part
While Love’s low light still burns
Within the heart!
Love's Miracle
So like a boundless, soundless sea
The miracle of love to me
With all the world a rosy dream
Sailing upon a silver stream,
While I, a fairy in mid-air,
Am dancing, dancing everywhere.
Hark! do you hear the thunder peal?
I care not what it would reveal,
Tomorrow will be yesterday
When I am shivering and gray:
I will not heed the prompter's ring
Let others answer, I shall sing
And dance the merrier--away!
I'll live and live and live--today!
A Paradox
I know you love me better cold
Strange as the pyramids of old
Responselessly.
but I am frail, and spent and weak
With surging torrents that bespeak
A living fire.
So, like a veil, my poor disguise
Is draped to save me from your eyes' 
Deep challenges.
Fain would I fling this robe aside
And from you, in your bosom hide
Eternally.
Alas! you love me better cold
Like frozen pyramids of old
Unyieldingly? 
How My Heart Sinks
How my heart sinks when I behold the sad reflection of my face,
A wan and wistful wound, wiht o, such meagre grace;
How can you hold me dear withal and conjure charms withdrawn.
Or does the Autumn twilight hold a charm unknown to dawn?
Hold! Do not speak! some day perchance, I'll read the message dire
Within the ashes of the flame, the aftermath of fire,
Ere then perhaps I shall have found the highways of the soul
Where one may read uncrucified, the blood-words of the scroll.
Till then, uphold illusion's veil before my gaze the while
That I may gather strength to fuse from agony, a smile! 
To Time
Day by day the threads of white
Muliply, Oh! hour-glass!
How passing swift your bright sands pass,
Fain would I hold you,
Linger, bide
Until these surges shall subside,
That sweep me forward unto bliss,
Oh! charging sun, I bid you rest,
Break not your arrow in my breast!
Welt
Would I might mend the fabric of my youth
Which daily flaunts its tatters to my eyes, 
Would I might compromise awhile with truth
Until love's moon, now waxing, wanes and dies.
For I would go a further while with you
And draing this Cup of Joy so passing fair,
Which meets my parching lips like cooling dew
'Ere time has brush cold fingers through my hair.
Review
I fear my power impotent
To hold you leal and full content,
Some hapless look or word perchance
Dispels the glamor of romance;
I tremble lest some stranger fair
Arrest you,--cause you to compare
The meagre charms which I possess
With some resplendent loveliness.
How far removed from Youth's command
The trembling sceptre in my hand,
As miserly within the glass
I mark Love's fleeting hours pass. 
Illusion
Oh! for the veils of my far-away youth,
Shielding my heart from the blaze of the truth;
Why did I stray from their foldings and grow
Into the sadness that follows--to know.
Impotent atom with desolate gaze
Treading Life's treacherous, intricate maze--
Oh for the veils, for the vails of my youth
Shielding my heart from the blaze of the truth!
Parody
You came,
The tapestries of love
Were shining in the sun,
My wishes settled down content
About you as you stood. 
I looked into your cryptic eyes
And thought I understood;
But no,--
The splendor of your gaudy robe
Grew dimmer day by day,
I wondered,
Searched within my soul to seize the mystery.
The answer staggered me,
Aghast,
Like one at bay,
I gazed with open eyes of thought upon you,
God! 'twas true--
A mockery, a parody, 
Had come to me--in you!
Delusion
You gave me your hand,
I held it to be
The last word, the dear word,
The soul's entity;
I cherished it, treasured it,
Only to find
I held but a gauntlet--
That I had been blind!
Sunset
And now-- 
As one who closes up the house and goes uncaring where
He may forget the scenes of home 'mid foreign climes and air,
I bar the chamber of my heart and seal the past within
To wander down the city's road amid the whirr and din.
The long years seem impassable, the morning has no smile,
With naught behind these barring doors and nothing else worth while,
Like some lone pilgrim without hope, I stumble on my way, 
Who lifts no futile plea for  sun, but asks for clouds less grey.
Finis
I looked death calmly in the face
And placed my hand within his hand
And said:
"Come, come, let us away
For I have lost the magic key
Opening the portals of desire---
My wishes cumber in the dust,
And life is stagnant
         in
                  my
                            heart!
CONTEMPLATION
Ivy 
I am a woman
Which means
I am insufficient
I need---
something to hold me
Or perhaps uphold.
I am a woman.
Joy
There's nothing certain, nothing sure
Save sorrow. Fragile happiness
Was never fashioned to endure;
For joy repels the perfect claim
And answers to no certain name;
How furtively we scan the mist
Perchance amid the gloom to find
Some moments rare and rapture-kist.
One Day
God-by dear day of sunshine, rain
In flooding torrents pours
Its liquid footsteps on my roof,
Its fingers on my doors.
While I sit tranquilly within
And tell my beads of joy,
Holding a peace within my heart
Which nothing can destroy. 
Attar
Fire---tears---
And the torture-chamber,
With the last maddening  turn of the screw---
Only thus
Is one precious drop distilled 
Of the attar of rose
Of the heart.
Youth's Progeny
Oh the sad little dreams of the dime yesteryear
Lying cold, still and stark in the dust of their bier,
How the hear hurries back, all the long weary way,
Just to bid them good-night at the close of the day.
I Wnder
I wonder---
      as I see them pass unheeded down the way,
(The women who were once beloved, imperious and gay)
Holding with frail, pale hands the cup
Of Life's discarded wine
If memories 
Are bliss enough
To make the dregs---divine!
Values
All the pretty baubles spread
Are not the answer to my need,
These tinseled trappings but beguile
This journeying, while deep within
A want unspeakable resides,
That throbs and throbs unceasingly,---
So hungering,--- no banquet spread
Can tempt it, and no golden wine
Make it forget: I balance it---
The world flies upward in the scale!
Always, unsoothed, unquieted,
It aches and aches across the days
And sears the nights that sum my life.
Armageddon
In the silence and the dark
I fought with dragons;
I was battered, beaten sore
But rose again;
On my knees I fought still rising
In my pain;
In the dark I fought with dragons.
Weary tears
Cease your flowing,
Even now, the dawn appears!
Le Soir
Mute-lipped---
            unquestioning grim-visaged Fate,
I cleave the shadows toward the Western Gate;
And yet---
            my lagging heart still holds
Mute-arms outstretched
Unto earth's gleaming folds.
Who knows? 
            perhaps Hop'es blossoms spray
In lush profusion
O'er the edge of day!
Treasure
What matters though love's dream shall pass,
Since from the throbbing hour-glass
One golden-throated moment prest
Its attared incense to my breast.
Since I have known the purple gleam
That lifts above me---can I deem
The way unlighted--when I go 
Encircled by love's afterglow?
Retrospection
After all---
             mine is the joy
Which naught can lessen or destroy.
For love has led my flying feet
Where immortelles are springing sweet,
And everlasting skies of gold
Are memories, when earth is cold
And though our future paths should lie
Estranged, as star-ways, through the sky,
I shall not look reproof, nor find
Within this pass a charge unkind,
And lightly sorrow shall be met
For I can never know regret. 
INTERMEZZI
Springtime
Again it is the vibrant May,
   The bursting buds, the leafing trees,
   The fragrant, undulating breeze,
   Call to my heart in subtlest way:
   Come! come! it is a holiday.
The stremlet with unending song,
   Beneath its silver veil of mist
   Seems flowing, flowing, to some tryst,
   While I---with inner surges strong,
   Find incomplete the day, and long.
Destiny
I know my love is seeing me
As restless rivers seek the sea,
Across the night, across the days
That snare the intervening ways.
I know my love is seeking me
As Time must seek Eternity,
When nights are very still I hear
His footsteps, coming, coming near!
Envoys
Love calls me tonight
In the beat of the rain
Through the cold little drops
On my bare window-pane;
Calls and calls through the dark
Like a whispered refrain
Tapping soft on my heart
Through the bare window pane. 
I Want to Die While You Love Me

I want to die while you love me,
   While yet you hold me fair,
While laughter lies upon my lips
   And lights are in my hair.
 

I want to die while you love me,
   And bear to that still bed,
Your kisses turbulent, unspent
   To warm me when I’m dead.
 

I want to die while you love me
   Oh, who would care to live
Till love has nothing more to ask
   And nothing more to give?

Ecstasy
Not less than this, beloved,
This beaming, highmost ray
That sweeps in royal splendor
Across our perfect day.
Not less than this,---far rather 
That we should say 'adieu,'
With every rose in Eden
Abloom for me and you.
Pledge
With kisses I'll awake you love
So tenderly at morn,
The pledges of my fealty
Diunally reborn.
We'll thread life's way together love,
And when the fading light
Dips softly over western hills
I'll kiss your eyes good-night.
Your Eyes
Your eyes---
Dark pools, so calm and deep,
A thousand ages in them sleep,
A dreaming world within them lies,
And all my hopes 
Of paradise!
Amour
Kis me!
And let the hours bloom triumphantly 
Before life's little sun has set
And I am old.
Love me!
The day is fleet
And I . . . .
Am far too passionate 
To die!
Finality
When love's triumphant day is done,
Go forward! leave me to the night
Beneath the coldly staring stars,
The waiting winter and its blight.
For I would never hold the heart
That mutely quivers to be free,
Unfurl your restless wings--away!
And leave the emptiness to me. 
In Love
I lived in Hell the other day
Its fires wrapt me angrily,
But now their horrors fall and fade
Like ghosts that memory has made.
I lived in Hell even today,
How sift the fierce flames die away---
Submerged with kisses, I forget,
With tears upon my pillows yet.
Fiction
Ah! love!
I shall not seek to penetrate
Your webbed gauze 
Nor tease my heart
By queries deep,
But hold you tenderly;
The day is evening,
And I must cull my flowers
'Ere dark.
Dead Days
Dead days of rapture and espair
   I would your hours exhume,
Renew their wildness once again
   Their rigors and perfume.
PENSEROSO
Break, Break My Heart
Break, break my heart
For love is done,
The pale light trails the dying sun---
And night awaits--no hope---no stars
Darkness
Hide my scars!
Little King
From worshipping I now arise
Stunned and aghast, with opoen eyes
I see the real, the little you
I thought so gallant, brave and true.
A pity yet is mine, I fear,
Since wherefore comes this falling tear,
For none among your fawning throng
Will love you well, nor love you long.
Romance
When I was young
             I used to say:
romance will come risding by
And I shall surely smile
And play with him awhile.
When I grew older
             then I said:
romance may come riding by
I wonder shall I smile
And play with him awhile?
But now---
             Alas! I only say:
Romance never will come by
And I shall never smile
He has been dead the while!
Falling Gods
Confusion, desuetude and gloom,
   The travailing of sound,
Fell desolation in my soul,
   And agony profound;
The gods are falling heavily
   And for all time to be,
And never more my heart shall know
   A shrine to Deity!
Armour
You cannot hurt me any more
   For I am armored now
And I can look into your face
   With cool, unfevered brow.
The tranquil river meets the sea,
   My life flows on at rest,
Unurged, untorn, but oh, my God!
   I love the old way best!
Divide
Your lightes breath may fan my cheek
Your whisper stir me when you speak,
And yet---
The teeming planets play
Between your heart---and mine
Today.
Return
Now, 
Like the pines intoning
Though some solitary gloom
My errant throughts go pattering
About love's ancient tomb,
And though no breath of incense rare
Lies round the shattered cup,
A banquet weird, the fragments
Where the ghost of love 
May sup.
Song of the Sinner
Just a bit of ashes
Grey, grey ashes---spent---
God! how fierce the fires burned
Down to this continent.
Just a bit of ashes, 
Not a single spark
Lives in this residuum
Crumbling cold and dark.
Just a bit of ashes---
To the judgment day,
I go with my memories---
Pray, sweet virgin, pray!
Celibacy
Where is the love that might have been
flung to the far ends of Earth?
In my body stamping around,
In my body like a hound
Leashed and restless---
Biding time!
CADENCE
Offering
I seek no tokens of you dear
   I only ask to give
The purple flower of my heart
   And you will let it live.
I ask no fealty or plight,
   I only pray that you
May find earth's barren places bright
   Perhaps, because it grew.
And when for you the final sun
   Moves toward the darkening West,
I shall be lingering to place
   Love's flower on your breast. 
Estrangement
Some day I shall be dead, and pride
   Which kept me from your feet,
Shall be the burden of the song
   My cold lips shall repeat.
And some day when you too shall find
   A pillow in the sod,
Would you then spurn an hour with me
   Above---where daisies nod?
Recessional 
Consider me a memory---a dream
That passed away,
Or yet, a flower that has blown and shattered---
In a day;
For passion sleeps, alas, and keeps no vigil
With the years,
And wakens to no conjuring
Of orison or tears.
Consider me a melody 
That served its simple turn,
Or but the residue of fire
That settles in the urn,
For love defies puring reasoning
And undeterred flows
Within---without 
The vassal heart!
Its reasoning---
Who knows? 
Sepulchre
I have mounded the corpse of my sorrow
   And wreathed it with roses fair
That none who may pass on the morrow
   May know what lies buried there. 
Curtain 
When one has lived
'Tis not so hard
To fold the hands,
To say, "Good-night,"
and creep away 
Behind the dark:
But 'tis not strange
The heart rebels
When sounds of night 
Ring down the day
That was a weary, joyless way
From early dawn
To setting sun:
How eagerly we trail the light
For crumbs of happiness we fend,
And struggle, struggle---to the end!
Afterglow
Through you I entered heaven and hell,
Knew rapture and despair,
I flitted o'er the plains of earth
And scaled each shining stair:
Drank deep the waters of content,
And drained the cup of gall,
Was regal and was impotent,
Was suzerain and thrall.
Now, by Reflection's placide pool
On evening's mellowed brow,
I smile across the backward way
And pledge anew my vow;
For every glancing, golden gleam,
I offer gladly---pain!
And I would give a thousand world
To live it all again!
