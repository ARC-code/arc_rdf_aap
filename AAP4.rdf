AN ANTHOLOGY OF VERSE
BY
AMERICAN NEGROES
EDITORIAL NOTE
This book is published because it represents meritorious work in the study of a field of American literature hitherto somewhat neglected and for the purpose of providing for both white people and Negroes material in convenient form for the study of a body of poetic work in which both races are naturally interested.
White students are interested because the authors of these poems have achieved their capacity for this form of expression along side of and in close association with their own people. Negroes are interested because these selected poems are evidence of the actual accomplishment of the members of their race.
 Trinity College is glad to lend this encouragement to the study of achievements in which both races in America have just reasons to feel pride.

PREFACE
This volume, except for some later additions, was ready for the press in 1921 , when it would have been a pioneer in the field. Though it has lost this primacy through the recent appearance of two other volumes, we feel that there is still a place for it in that it gives fuller representation to the older poets and includes some contemporary poets omitted by the later books. Our own sins of omission in this latter field — and there are so many Negroes writing respectable verse today that doubtless we have overlooked many desirable poems — must be left to the charity of the reader and to the chance of a second edition in which, proverbially, all things are to be made perfect. As Southern white men who desire the most cordial relations between the races we hope that this volume will help its white readers more clearly to understand the Negro's feelings on certain questions that must be settled by the coöperation of the two races. From the same point of view we hope that Negro readers, too accustomed, perhaps, to a debilitating literary patronage , will not misinterpret as unfriendly a critical attitude in which we have tried to supplant patronage with honest, unbiased appraisal. In the content of this volume Professor White is responsible for the Introduction and for the Bibliographical and Critical Notes ; Professor Jackson is responsible for the biographical sketches ; the choice of selections is a matter of joint responsibility .
It is a pleasure to acknowledge our indebtedness to Dr. J. H. Dillard , of the Jeanes Foundation , who has shown a friendly interest in the work and has helped with several valuable suggestions; to Dr. W. T. Laprade, of Trinity College, who supervised its publica tion for the Trinity College Press ; to all of the surviving poets represented in this book, most of whom have coöperated cordially in furnishing biographical data and in giving permission to quote their verse ; to The Century Magazine for the poems of J. D. Corrothers; The Crisis for poems by Countee P. Cullen and Jessie R. Fauset ; The Southern Warkman for the poem of Sarah C. Fernandez ; the Cornhill Co. for poems by Joseph Seaman Cotter, Jr., Charles Bertram Johnson and Georgia Douglas Johnson ; the R. G. Badger Co. for poems by Walter Everette Hawkins ; The Stratford Co. for poems by Leslie Pinckney Hill ; Neale and Co. for poems by John Wesley Holloway ; the Brimmer Co. for poems by Georgia Douglas Johnson ; The Grafton Press for poems by H. Cordelia Ray ; Sherman , French and Co. for poems by George Reginald Margetson ; Harcourt, Brace and Co. for poems by Claude McKay ; and to Dodd, Mead and Co. for poems by Paul Laurence Dunbar .

       <collex:text>The Slave Mother
Heard you that shriek? It rose
So wildly on the air,
It seem’d as if a burden’d heart
Was breaking in despair.
Saw you those hands so sadly clasped—
The bowed and feeble head—
The shuddering of that fragile form—
That look of grief and dread?
Saw you the sad, imploring eye?
Its every glance was pain,
As if a storm of agony
Were sweeping through the brain.
She is a mother pale with fear,
Her boy clings to her side,
And in her kyrtle vainly tries
His trembling form to hide.
He is not hers, although she bore
For him a mother’s pains;
He is not hers, although her blood
Is coursing through his veins!
He is not hers, for cruel hands
May rudely tear apart
The only wreath of household love
That binds her breaking heart.
His love has been a joyous light
That o’er her pathway smiled,
A fountain gushing ever new,
Amid life’s desert wild.
His lightest word has been a tone
Of music round her heart,
Their lives a streamlet blent in one—
Oh, Father! must they part?
They tear him from her circling arms,
Her last and fond embrace.
Oh! never more may her sad eyes
Gaze on his mournful face.
No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks
Disturb the listening air:
She is a mother, and her heart
Is breaking in despair.
Bury Me in a Free Land
Make me a grave where'er you will,
In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill;
 Make it among earth's humblest graves,
But not in a land where men are slaves.
I could not rest if around my grave
I heard the steps of a trembling slave;
His shadow above my silent tomb
Would make it a place of fearful gloom.
I could not rest if I heard the tread
Of a coffle gang to the shambles led,
And the mother's shriek of wild despair
Rise like a curse on the trembling air.
I could not sleep if I saw the lash
Drinking her blood at each fearful gash,
And I saw her babes torn from her breast,
Like trembling doves from their parent nest.
I'd shudder and start if I heard the bay
Of bloodhounds seizing their human prey,
And I heard the captive plead in vain
As they bound afresh his galling chain.
If I saw young girls from their mother's arms
Bartered and sold for their youthful charms,
My eye would flash with a mournful flame,
My death-paled cheek grow red with shame.
I would sleep, dear friends, where bloated might
Can rob no man of his dearest right;
My rest shall be calm in any grave
Where none can call his brother a slave.
I ask no monument, proud and high,
To arrest the gaze of the passers-by;
All that my yearning spirit craves,
Is bury me not in a land of slaves.

       <collex:text>To the Student
Who flees the regions of the lower mind,
Where these distempers breathe on every wind:
Infectious dogmatisms, noxious hate,
Old snarly spleen, and troublesome debate,
Dull bigotry, and stupid ignorance,
Proud egotism, empty arrogance,
And famous hollowness, and brilliant woe—
And would to knowledge's high places go,
Must first in humble prayer approach the Throne
Of the Almighty Mind, and there make known
The purposes that swell an honest heart;
Then on the path before him, meekly start:
Asking of others who have been that way,
What of the country, and what of the day?
Being certain ever to give earnest heed
To where the steps of hoar experience lead.
Mark him who ventures these means to despise,
And tho' his works in gloomy grandeur rise,
Awe strike all earth, and threaten e'en the skies;
Yea, "tho' he flourish like a green bay tree,"
His life will a stupendous [ stupeduous ] failure be.
Tis vain to soar aloft on borrowed wing,
Or drink success from favor's flowing spring.
Let him who journeys upward, learn the way,
By toiling step by step, and day by day.
Each hardship mounted, easier makes the next,
And leaves his pathway by one less perplext.
Lo! where yon dreamer looks on glory's hill,
Hopes to ascend without the manly will,
Bends round and round some open pass to try
With easy access, and ascend on high;
Waits for some helper till the day is past,
And night o'ertakes a sycophant at last.
But honest courage, see with manful strides,
Walks on and enters at the steepest sides,
Climbs long and slowly up his rugged path,
Awaits no aid, relies on what he hath,
Grows independent as his way proceeds,
As progress roughens, less the distance heeds,
Till lo! the utmost hights his footsteps meet,
With fames and fortunes lying at his feet.
Then Kings delight to honor Glory's son,
And loud applauses in his footsteps run.
Then mankind crave the favor of his eyes,
And heap his lasting tributes to the skies.
Ye Bards of England
England, cannot thy shores boast bards as great,
And hearts as good as ever blest a State?
When arts were rude and literature was young,
And language faltered with an uncouth tongue;
When science trembled on her little hight,
And poor religion blundered on in night;
When song on Rome's vast tomb, or carved in Greek,
Like epitaphs with marble lips did speak,
Thy Chaucer singing with the Nightingales,
Poured forth his heart in Canterbury tales,
With rude shell scooped from English pure, and led
The age that raised the muses from the dead.
And gentle Thompson, to thy mem'ry dear,
Awake his lyre and sang the rolling year.
The dropping shower the wild flower scented mead,
The sober herds that in the noon shade feed,
The fragrant field, the green and shady wood,
The winding glen, and rocky solitude,
The smiles of Spring and frowns of Winter gray,
Alike employed his pure and gentle lay.
The wrath of gods, and armies dread suspense,
Celestial shouts and shock of arms immense,
In all his song ne'er move us to alarm,
But earth's pure sounds and sights allure and charm.
To Missolonghi's chief of singers too,
Unhappy Byron is a tribute due.
A wounded spirit, mournful and yet mad,
A genius proud, defiant, gentle, sad.
'Twas he whose Harold won his Nation's heart,
And whose Reviewers made her fair cheeks smart;
Whose uncurbed Juan hung her head for shame,
And whose Mazzeppa won unrivaled fame.
Earth had no bound for him. Where'er he strode
His restless genius found no fit abode.
The wing'd storm and the lightning tongued Jungfrau,
Unfathomable Ocean, and the awe
Of Alpine shades, the avalanche's groan,
The war-rocked empire and the falling throne,
Were toys his genius played with. Britain, then
Urn Byron's dust—a prodigy of men.
But Shakspeare, the inimitable boast
Of everybody and of every coast;
The man, whose universal fitness meets
Response in every heart of flesh that beats,
No tongue can tell him. One must feel his hand
And see him in his plays, to understand.
All thought to him intuitively's known,
The prate of clowns, and wisdoms of the throne,
The sophist's puzzles and the doctor's rules,
The skill of warriors and the cant of fools.
When Shakespeare wrote, the tragic muse saw heights,
Before nor since ne'er tempted in her flights.

       <collex:text>Preface
A good deal has been written on the folk creations of the American Negro: his music, sacred and secular; his plantation tales, and his dances; but that there are folk sermons, as well, is a fact that has passed unnoticed. I remember hearing in my boyhood sermons that were current, sermons that passed with only slight modifications from preacher to preacher and from locality to locality. Such sermons were, "The Valley of Dry Bones," which was based on the vision of the prophet in the 37th chapter of Ezekiel; the "Train Sermon," in which both God and the devil were pictured as running trains, one loaded with saints, that pulled up in heaven, and the other with sinners, that dumped its load in hell; the "Heavenly March," which gave in detail the journey of the faithful from earth, on up through the pearly gates to the great white throne. Then there was a stereotyped sermon which had no definite subject, and which was quite generally preached; it began with the Creation, went on to the fall of man, rambled through the trials and tribulations of the Hebrew Children, came down to the redemption by Christ, and ended with the Judgment Day and a warning and an exhortation to sinners. This was the framework of a sermon that allowed the individual preacher the widest latitude that could be desired for all his arts and powers. There was one Negro sermon that in its day was a classic, and widely known to the public. Thousands of people, white and black, flocked to the church of John Jasper in Richmond, Virginia, to hear him preach his famous sermon proving that the earth is flat and the sun does move. John Jasper's sermon was imitated and adapted by many lesser preachers.
I heard only a few months ago in Harlem an up-to-date version of the "Train Sermon." The preacher styled himself "Son of Thunder" -- a sobriquet adopted by many of the old-time preachers -- and phrased his subject, "The Black Diamond Express, running between here and hell, making thirteen stops and arriving in hell ahead of time."
The old-time Negro preacher has not yet been given the niche in which he properly belongs. He has been portrayed only as a semi-comic figure. He had, it is true, his comic aspects, but on the whole he was an important figure, and at bottom a vital factor. It was through him that the people of diverse languages and customs who were brought here from diverse parts of Africa and thrown into slavery were given their first sense of unity and solidarity. He was the first shepherd of this bewildered flock. His power for good or ill was very great. It was the old-time preacher who for generations was the mainspring of hope and inspiration for the Negro in America. It was also he who instilled into the Negro the narcotic doctrine epitomized in the Spiritual, "You May Have All Dis World, But Give Me Jesus." This power of the old-time preacher, somewhat lessened and changed in his successors, is still a vital force; in fact, it is still the greatest single influence among the colored people of the United States. The Negro today is, perhaps, the most priest-governed group in the country.
The history of the Negro preacher reaches back to Colonial days. Before the Revolutionary War, when slavery had not yet taken on its more grim and heartless economic aspects, there were famed black preachers who preached to both whites and blacks. George Liele was preaching to whites and blacks at Augusta, Ga., as far back as 1773, and Andrew Bryan at Savannah a few years later.*
           
 The most famous of these earliest preachers was Black Harry, who during the Revolutionary period accompanied Bishop Asbury as a drawing card and preached from the same platform with other founders of the Methodist Church. Of him, John Ledman in his History of the Rise of Methodism in America says, "The truth was that Harry was a more popular speaker than Mr. Asbury or almost anyone else in his day." In the two or three decades before the Civil War Negro preachers in the North, many of them well-educated and cultured, were courageous spokesmen against slavery and all its evils.
The effect on the Negro of the establishment of separate and independent places of worship can hardly be estimated. Some idea of how far this effect reached may be gained by a comparison between the social and religious trends of the Negroes of the Old South and of the Negroes of French Louisiana and the West Indies, where they were within and directly under the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England. The old-time preacher brought about the establishment of these independent places of worship and thereby provided the first sphere in which race leadership might develop and function. These scattered and often clandestine groups have grown into the strongest and richest organization among colored Americans. Another thought--except for these separate places of worship there never would have been any Spirituals.
The old-time preacher was generally a man far above the average in intelligence; he was, not infrequently, a man of positive genius. The earliest of these preachers must have virtually committed many parts of the Bible to memory through hearing the scriptures read or preached from in the white churches which the slaves attended. They were the first of the slaves to learn to read, and their reading was confined to the Bible, and specifically to the more dramatic passages of the Old Testament. A text served mainly as a starting point and often had no relation to the development of the sermon. Nor would the old-time preacher balk at any text within the lids of the Bible. There is the story of one who after reading a rather cryptic passage took off his spectacles, closed the Bible with a bang and by way of preface said, "Brothers and sisters, this morning -- I intend to explain the unexplainable find out the undefinable -- ponder over the imponderable -- and unscrew the inscrutable."
- - -
The old-time Negro preacher of parts was above all an orator, and in good measure an actor. He knew the secret of oratory, that at bottom it is a progression of rhythmic words more than it is anything else. Indeed, I have witnessed congregations moved to ecstasy by the rhythmic intoning of sheer incoherencies. He was a master of all the modes of eloquence. He often possessed a voice that was a marvelous instrument, a voice he could modulate from a sepulchral whisper to a crashing thunder clap. His discourse was generally kept at a high pitch of fervency, but occasionally he dropped into colloquialisms and, less often, into humor. He preached a personal and anthropomorphic God, a sure-enough heaven and a red-hot hell. His imagination was bold and unfettered. He had the power to sweep his hearers before him; and so himself was often swept away. At such times his language was not prose but poetry. It was from memories of such preachers there grew the idea of this book of poems.
- - -
In a general way, these poems were suggested by the rather vague memories of sermons I heard preached in my childhood; but the immediate stimulus for setting them down came quite definitely at a comparatively recent date. I was speaking on a Sunday in Kansas City, addressing meetings in various colored churches. When I had finished my fourth talk it was after nine o'clock at night, but the committee told me there was still another meeting to address. I demurred, making the quotation about the willingness of the spirit and the weakness of the flesh, for I was dead tired. I also protested the lateness of the hour, but I was informed that for the meeting at this church we were in good time. When we reached the church an "exhorter" was just concluding a dull sermon. After his there were two other short sermons. These sermons proved to be preliminaries, mere curtain-raisers for a famed visiting preacher. At last he arose. He was a dark-brown man, handsome in his gigantic proportions. He appeared to be a bit self-conscious, perhaps impressed by the presence of the "distinguished visitor" on the platform, and started in to preach a formal sermon from a formal text. The congregation sat apathetic and dozing. He sensed that he was losing his audience and his opportunity. Suddenly he closed the Bible, stepped out from behind the pulpit and began to preach. He started intoning the old folk-sermon that begins with the creation of the world and ends with Judgment Day. He was at once a changed man, free, at ease and masterful. The change in the congregation was instantaneous. An electric current ran through the crowd. It was in a moment alive and quivering; and all the while the preacher held it in the palm of his hand. He was wonderful in the way he employed his conscious and unconscious art. He strode the pulpit up and down in what was actually a very rhythmic dance, and he brought into play the full gamut of his wonderful voice, a voice -- what shall I say? -- not of an organ or a trumpet, but rather of a trombone,* the instrument possessing above all others the power to express the wide and varied range of emotions encompassed by the human voice -- and with greater amplitude.
           
 He intoned, he moaned, he pleaded--he blared, he crashed, he thundered. I sat fascinated; and more, I was, perhaps against my will, deeply moved; the emotional effect upon me was irresistible. Before he had finished I took a slip of paper and somewhat surreptitiously jotted down some ideas for the first poem, "The Creation."
- - -
At first thought, Negro dialect would appear to be the precise medium for these old-time sermons; however, as the reader will see, the poems are not written in dialect. My reason for not using the dialect is double. First, although the dialect is the exact instrument for voicing certain traditional phases of Negro life, it is, and perhaps by that very exactness, a quite limited instrument. Indeed, it is an instrument with but two complete stops, pathos and humor. This limitation is not due to any defect of the dialect as dialect, but to the mould of convention in which Negro dialect in the United States has been set, to the fixing effects of its long association with the Negro only as a happy-go-lucky or a forlorn figure. The Aframerican poet might in time be able to break this mould of convention and write poetry in dialect without feeling that his first line will put the reader in a frame of mind which demands that the poem be either funny or sad, but I doubt that he will make the effort to do it; he does not consider it worth the while. In fact, practically no poetry is being written in dialect by the colored poets of today. These poets have thrown aside dialect and discarded most of the material and subject matter that went into dialect poetry. The passing of dialect as a medium for Negro poetry will be an actual loss, for in it many beautiful things can be done, and done best; however, in my opinion, traditional Negro dialect as a form for Aframerican poets is absolutely dead. The Negro poet in the United States, for poetry which he wishes to give a distinctively racial tone and color, needs now an instrument of greater range than dialect; that is, if he is to do more than sound the small notes of sentimentality. I said something on this point in The Book of American Negro Poetry, and because I cannot say it better, I quote: "What the colored poet in the United States needs to do is something like what Synge did for the Irish; he needs to find a form that will express the racial spirit by symbols from within rather than by symbols from without -- such as the mere mutilation of English spelling and pronunciation. He needs a form that is freer and larger than dialect, but which will still hold the racial flavor; a form expressing the imagery, the idioms, the peculiar turns of thought and the distinctive humor and pathos, too, of the Negro, but which will also be capable of voicing the deepest and highest emotions and aspirations and allow of the widest range of subjects and the widest scope of treatment." The form of "The Creation," the first poem of this group, was a first experiment by me in this direction.
The second part of my reason for not writing these poems in dialect is the weightier. The old-time Negro preachers, though they actually used dialect in their ordinary intercourse, stepped out from its narrow confines when they preached. They were all saturated with the sublime phraseology of the Hebrew prophets and steeped in the idioms of King James English, so when they preached and warmed to their work they spoke another language, a language far removed from traditional Negro dialect. It was really a fusion of Negro idioms with Bible English; and in this there may have been, after all, some kinship with the innate grandiloquence of their old African tongues. To place in the mouths of the talented old-time Negro preachers a language that is a literary imitation of Mississippi cotton-field dialect is sheer burlesque.
Gross exaggeration of the use of big words by these preachers, in fact by Negroes in general, has been commonly made; the laugh being at the exhibition of ignorance involved. What is the basis of this fondness for big words? Is the predilection due, as is supposed, to ignorance desiring to parade itself as knowledge? Not at all. The old-time Negro preacher loved the sonorous, mouth-filling, ear-filling phrase because it gratified a highly developed sense of sound and rhythm in himself and his hearers.
- - -
 I claim no more for these poems than that I have written them after the manner of the primitive sermons. In the writing of them I have, naturally, felt the influence of the Spirituals. There is, of course, no way of recreating the atmosphere -- the fervor of the congregation, the amens and hallelujahs, the undertone of singing which was often a soft accompaniment to parts of the sermon; nor the personality of the preacher -- his physical magnetism, his gestures and gesticulations, his changes of tempo, his pauses for effect, and, more than all, his tones of voice. These poems would better be intoned than read; especially does this apply to "Listen, Lord," "The Crucifixion," and "The Judgment Day." But the intoning practiced by the old-time preacher is a thing next to impossible to describe; it must be heard, and it is extremely difficult to imitate even when heard. The finest, and perhaps the only demonstration ever given to a New York public, was the intoning of the dream in Ridgely Torrence's Rider of Dreams by Opal Cooper of the Negro Players at the Madison Square Theatre in 1917. Those who were fortunate enough to hear him can never, I know, forget the thrill of it. This intoning is always a matter of crescendo and diminuendo in the intensity -- a rising and falling between plain speaking and wild chanting. And often a startling effect is gained by breaking off suddenly at the highest point of intensity and dropping into the monotone of ordinary speech.
The tempos of the preacher I have endeavored to indicate by the line arrangement of the poems, and a certain sort of pause that is marked by a quick intaking and an audible expulsion of the breath I have indicated by dashes. There is a decided syncopation of speech -- the crowding in of many syllables or the lengthening out of a few to fill one metrical foot, the sensing of which must be left to the reader's ear. The rhythmical stress of this syncopation is partly obtained by a marked silent fraction of a beat; frequently this silent fraction is filled in by a hand clap.
One factor in the creation of atmosphere I have included -- the preliminary prayer. The prayer leader was sometimes a woman. It was the prayer leader who directly prepared the way for the sermon, set the scene, as it were. However, a most impressive concomitant of the prayer, the chorus of responses which gave it an antiphonal quality, I have not attempted to set down. These preliminary prayers were often products hardly less remarkable than the sermons.
- - -
The old-time Negro preacher is rapidly passing. I have here tried sincerely to fix something of him.

A Prayer
O Lord, we come this morning
Knee-bowed and body-bent
Before thy throne of grace.
O Lord -- this morning --
Bow our hearts beneath our knees,
And our knees in some lonesome valley.
We come this morning --
Like empty pitchers to a full fountain,
With no merits of our own.
O Lord -- open up a window of heaven,
And lean out far over the battlements of glory,
And listen this morning.
Lord, have mercy on proud and dying sinners --
Sinners hanging over the mouth of hell,
Who seem to love their distance well.
Lord -- ride by this morning --
Mount your milk-white horse,
And ride-a this morning --
And in your ride, ride by old hell,
Ride by the dingy gates of hell,
And stop poor sinners in their headlong plunge.
And now, O Lord, this man of God,
Who breaks the bread of life this morning --
Shadow him in the hollow of thy hand,
And keep him out of the gunshot of the devil.
Take him, Lord -- this morning --
Wash him with hyssop inside and out,
Hang him up and drain him dry of sin.
Pin his ear to the wisdom-post,
And make his words sledge hammers of truth --
Beating on the iron heart of sin.
Lord God, this morning --
Put his eye to the telescope of eternity,
And let him look upon the paper walls of time.
Lord, turpentine his imagination,
Put perpetual motion in his arms,
Fill him full of the dynamite of thy power,
Anoint him all over with the oil of thy salvation,
And set his tongue on fire.
And now, O Lord --
When I've done drunk my last cup of sorrow --
When I've been called everything but a child of God --
When I'm done travelling up the rough side of the mountain --
O -- Mary's Baby --
When I start down the steep and slippery steps of death --
When this old world begins to rock beneath my feet --
Lower me to my dusty grave in peace
To wait for that great gittin' up morning -- Amen.

       <collex:text>THE CREATION
A Negro Sermon
And God stepped out on space,
And He looked around and said,
“I’m lonely--
I’ll make me a world.”
And as far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said, “That’s good!”
Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,
And God rolled the light around in His hands
Until He made the sun;
And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said, “That’s good.”
Then God Himself stepped down—
And the sun was on His right hand
And the moon was on His left;
The stars were clustered about His head,
And the earth was under His feet.
And God walked, and where He trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then He stopped and looked, and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And He spat out the seven seas;
He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;
He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
And the lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around His shoulder.
Then God raised His arm and He waved His hand,
Over the sea and over the land,
And He said, “Bring forth. Bring forth.”
And quicker than God could drop His hand
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said, “That’s good.”
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that He had made.
He looked at His sun,
And He looked at His moon,
And He looked at His little stars;
He looked on His world,
With all its living things,
And God said, “I’m lonely still.”
Then God sat down
On the side of a hill where He could think;
By a deep, wide river He sat down;
With His head in His hands,
God thought and thought,
Till He thought, “I’ll make me a man”
Up from the bed of a river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled Him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand;
This Great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till He shaped it in His own image;
Then into it He blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen. Amen.
—James Weldon Johnson.

       <collex:text>Young man --
Young man --
Your arm's too short to box with God.
But Jesus spake in a parable, and he said:
A certain man had two sons.
Jesus didn't give this man a name,
But his name is God Almighty.
And Jesus didn't call these sons by name,
But ev'ry young man,
Ev'rywhere,
Is one of these two sons.
And the younger son said to his father,
He said: Father, divide up the property,
And give me my portion now.
And the father with tears in his eyes said: Son,
Don't leave your father's house.
But the boy was stubborn in his head,
And haughty in his heart,
And he took his share of his father's goods,
And went into a far-off country.
There comes a time,
There comes a time
When ev'ry young man looks out from his father's house,
Longing for that far-off country.
And the young man journeyed on his way,
And he said to himself as he travelled along:
This sure is an easy road,
Nothing like the rough furrows behind my father's plow.
Young man --
Young man --
Smooth and easy is the road
That leads to hell and destruction.
Down grade all the way,
The further you travel, the faster you go.
No need to trudge and sweat and toil,
Just slip and slide and slip and slide
Till you bang up against hell's iron gate.
And the younger son kept travelling along,
Till at night-time he came to a city.
And the city was bright in the night-time like day,
The streets all crowded with people,
Brass bands and string bands a-playing,
And ev'rywhere the young man turned
There was singing and laughing and dancing.
And he stopped a passer-by and he said:
Tell me what city is this?
And the passer-by laughed and said: Don't you know?
This is Babylon, Babylon,
That great city of Babylon.
Come on, my friend, and go along with me.
And the young man joined the crowd.
Young man --
Young man --
You're never lonesome in Babylon.
You can always join a crowd in Babylon.
Young man --
Young man --
You can never be alone in Babylon,
Alone with your Jesus in Babylon.
You can never find a place, a lonesome place,
A lonesome place to go down on your knees,
And talk with your God, in Babylon.
You're always in a crowd in Babylon.
And the young man went with his new-found friend,
And bought himself some brand new clothes,
And he spent his days in the drinking dens,
Swallowing the fires of hell.
And he spent his nights in the gambling dens,
Throwing dice with the devil for his soul.
And he met up with the women of Babylon.
Oh, the women of Babylon!
Dressed in yellow and purple and scarlet,
Loaded with rings and earrings and bracelets,
Their lips like a honeycomb dripping with honey,
Perfumed and sweet-smelling like a jasmine flower;
And the jasmine smell of the Babylon women
Got in his nostrils and went to his head,
And he wasted his substance in riotous living,
In the evening, in the black and dark of night,
With the sweet-sinning women of Babylon.
And they stripped him of his money,
And they stripped him of his clothes,
And they left him broke and ragged
In the streets of Babylon.
Then the young man joined another crowd --
The beggars and lepers of Babylon.
And he went to feeding swine,
And he was hungrier than the hogs;
He got down on his belly in the mire and mud
And ate the husks with the hogs.
And not a hog was too low to turn up his nose
At the man in the mire of Babylon.
Then the young man came to himself --
He came to himself and said:
In my father's house are many mansions,
Ev'ry servant in his house has bread to eat,
Ev'ry servant in his house has a place to sleep;
I will arise and go to my father.
And his father saw him afar off,
And he ran up the road to meet him.
He put clean clothes upon his back,
And a golden chain around his neck,
He made a feast and killed the fatted calf,
And invited the neighbors in.
Oh-o-oh, sinner,
When you're mingling with the crowd in Babylon --
Drinking the wine of Babylon --
Running with the women of Babylon --
You forget about God, and you laugh at Death.
Today you've got the strength of a bull in your neck
And the strength of a bear in your arms,
But some o' these days, some o' these days,
You'll have a hand-to-hand struggle with bony Death,
And Death is bound to win.
Young man, come away from Babylon,
That hell-border city of Babylon.
Leave the dancing and gambling of Babylon,
The wine and whiskey of Babylon,
The hot-mouthed women of Babylon;
Fall down on your knees,
And say in your heart:
I will arise and go to my Father.

       <collex:text>Go Down Death
A Funeral Sermon
Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She's resting in the bosom of Jesus.
Heart-broken husband -- weep no more;
Grief-stricken son -- weep no more;
Left-lonesome daughter -- weep no more;
She's only just gone home.
Day before yesterday morning,
God was looking down from his great, high heaven
Looking down on all his children,
And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
Tossing on her bed of pain.
And God's big heart was touched with pity,
With the everlasting pity.
And God sat back on his throne,
And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
Call me Death!
And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
That broke like a clap of thunder:
Call Death! -- Call Death!
And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.
And Death heard the summons,
And he leaped on his fastest horse,
Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
Up the golden street Death galloped,
And the hoofs of his horse struck fire from the gold,
But they didn't make no sound.
Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
And waited for God's command.
And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
Down in Yamacraw,
And find Sister Caroline.
She's borne the burden and heat of the day,
She's labored long in my vineyard,
And she's tired --
She's weary --
Go down, Death, and bring her to me.
And Death didn't say a word,
But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
And out and down he rode,
Through heaven's pearly gates,
Past suns and moons and stars;
On Death rode,
And the foam from his horse was like a comet in the sky;
On Death rode,
Leaving the lightning's flash behind;
Straight on down he came.
While we were watching round her bed,
She turned her eyes and looked away,
She saw what we couldn't see;
She saw Old Death. She saw Old Death
Coming like a falling star.
But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
He looked to her like a welcome friend.
And she whispered to us: I'm going home,
And she smiled and closed her eyes.
And Death took her up like a baby,
And she lay in his icy arms,
But she didn't feel no chill.
And Death began to ride again --
Up beyond the evening star,
Out beyond the morning star,
Into the glittering light of glory,
On to the Great White Throne.
And there he laid Sister Caroline
On the loving breast of Jesus.
And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
And the angels sang a little song,
And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
Take your rest, take your rest.
Weep not -- weep not,
She is not dead;
She's resting in the bosom of Jesus.

       <collex:text>Noah Built the Ark
In the cool of the day --
God was walking --
Around in the Garden of Eden.
And except for the beasts, eating in the fields,
And except for the birds, flying through the trees,
The garden looked like it was deserted.
And God called out and said: Adam,
Adam, where art thou?
And Adam, with Eve behind his back,
Came out from where he was hiding.
And God said: Adam,
What hast thou done?
Thou hast eaten of the tree!
And Adam,
With his head hung down,
Blamed it on the woman.
For after God made the first man Adam,
He breathed a sleep upon him;
Then he took out of Adam one of his ribs,
And out of that rib made woman.
And God put the man and woman together
In the beautiful Garden of Eden,
With nothing to do the whole day long
But play all around in the garden.
And God called Adam before him,
And he said to him:
Listen now, Adam,
Of all the fruit in the garden you can eat,
Except of the tree of knowledge;
For the day thou eatest of that tree,
Thou shalt surely die.
Then pretty soon along came Satan.
Old Satan came like a snake in the grass
To try out his tricks on the woman.
I imagine I can see Old Satan now
A-sidling up to the woman.
I imagine the first word Satan said was:
Eve, you're surely good looking.
I imagine he brought her a present, too,--
And, if there was such a thing in those ancient days,
He brought her a looking-glass.
And Eve and Satan got friendly --
Then Eve got to walking on shaky ground;
Don't ever get friendly with Satan.--
And they started to talk about the garden,
And Satan said: Tell me, how do you like
The fruit on the nice, tall, blooming tree
Standing in the middle of the garden?
And Eve said:
That's the forbidden fruit,
Which if we eat we die.
And Satan laughed a devilish little laugh,
And he said to the woman: God's fooling you, Eve;
That's the sweetest fruit in the garden.
I know you can eat that forbidden fruit,
And I know that you will not die.
And Eve looked at the forbidden fruit,
And it was red and ripe and juicy.
And Eve took a taste, and she offered it to Adam,
And Adam wasn't able to refuse;
So he took a bite, and they both sat down
And ate the forbidden fruit.--
Back there, six thousand years ago,
Man first fell by woman --
Lord, and he's doing the same today.
And that's how sin got into this world.
And man, as he multiplied on the earth,
Increased in wickedness and sin.
He went on down from sin to sin,
From wickedness to wickedness,
Murder and lust and violence,
All kinds of fornications,
Till the earth was corrupt and rotten with flesh,
An abomination in God's sight.
And God was angry at the sins of men.
And God got sorry that he ever made man.
And he said: I will destroy him.
I'll bring down judgment on him with a flood.
I'll destroy ev'rything on the face of the earth,
Man, beasts and birds, and creeping things.
And he did --
Ev'rything but the fishes.
But Noah was a just and righteous man.
Noah walked and talked with God.
And, one day, God said to Noah,
He said: Noah, build thee an ark.
Build it out of gopher wood.
Build it good and strong.
Pitch it within and pitch it without.
And build it according to the measurements
That I will give to thee.
Build it for you and all your house,
And to save the seeds of life on earth;
For I'm going to send down a mighty flood
To destroy this wicked world.
And Noah commenced to work on the ark.
And he worked for about one hundred years.
And ev'ry day the crowd came round
To make fun of Old Man Noah.
And they laughed and they said: Tell us, old man,
Where do you expect to sail that boat
Up here amongst the hills?
But Noah kept on a-working.
And ev'ry once in a while Old Noah would stop,
He'd lay down his hammer and lay down his saw,
And take his staff in hand;
And with his long, white beard a-flying in the wind,
And the gospel light a-gleaming from his eye,
Old Noah would preach God's word:
Sinners, oh, sinners,
Repent, for the judgment is at hand.
Sinners, oh, sinners,
Repent, for the time is drawing nigh.
God's wrath is gathering in the sky.
God's a-going to rain down rain on rain.
God's a-going to loosen up the bottom of the deep,
And drown this wicked world.
Sinners, repent while yet there's time
For God to change his mind.
Some smart young fellow said: This old man's
Got water on the brain.
And the crowd all laughed -- Lord, but didn't they laugh;
And they paid no mind to Noah,
But kept on sinning just the same.
One bright and sunny morning,
Not a cloud nowhere to be seen,
God said to Noah: Get in the ark!
And Noah and his folks all got in the ark,
And all the animals, two by two,
A he and a she marched in.
Then God said: Noah, Bar the door!
And Noah barred the door.
And a little black spot begun to spread,
Like a bottle of ink spilling over the sky;
And the thunder rolled like a rumbling drum;
And the lightning jumped from pole to pole;
And it rained down rain, rain, rain,
Great God, but didn't it rain!
For forty days and forty nights
Waters poured down and waters gushed up;
And the dry land turned to sea.
And the old ark-a she begun to ride;
The old ark-a she begun to rock;
Sinners came a-running down to the ark;
Sinners came a-swimming all round the ark;
Sinners pleaded and sinners prayed --
Sinners wept and sinners wailed --
But Noah'd done barred the door.
And the trees and the hills and the mountain tops
Slipped underneath the waters.
And the old ark sailed that lonely sea --
For twelve long months she sailed that sea,
A sea without a shore.
Then the waters begun to settle down,
And the ark touched bottom on the tallest peak
Of old Mount Ararat.
The dove brought Noah the olive leaf,
And Noah when he saw that the grass was green,
Opened up the ark, and they all climbed down,
The folks, and the animals, two by two,
Down from the mount to the valley.
And Noah wept and fell on his face
And hugged and kissed the dry ground.
And then --
God hung out his rainbow cross the sky,
And he said to Noah: That's my sign!
No more will I judge the world by flood --
Next time I'll rain down fire.

       <collex:text>The Crucifixion
Jesus, my gentle Jesus,
Walking in the dark of the Garden --
The Garden of Gethsemane,
Saying to the three disciples:
Sorrow is in my soul --
Even unto death;
Tarry ye here a little while,
And watch with me.
Jesus, my burdened Jesus,
Praying in the dark of the Garden --
The Garden of Gethsemane.
Saying: Father,
Oh, Father,
This bitter cup,
This bitter cup,
Let it pass from me.
Jesus, my sorrowing Jesus,
The sweat like drops of blood upon his brow,
Talking with his Father,
While the three disciples slept,
Saying: Father,
Oh, Father,
Not as I will,
Not as I will,
But let thy will be done.
Oh, look at black-hearted Judas --
Sneaking through the dark of the Garden --
Leading his crucifying mob.
Oh, God!
Strike him down!
Why don't you strike him down,
Before he plants his traitor's kiss
Upon my Jesus' cheek?
And they take my blameless Jesus,
And they drag him to the Governor,
To the mighty Roman Governor.
Great Pilate seated in his hall,--
Great Pilate on his judgment seat,
Said: In this man I find no fault.
I find no fault in him.
And Pilate washed his hands.
But they cried out, saying:
Crucify him!--
Crucify him!--
Crucify him!--
His blood be on our heads.
And they beat my loving Jesus,
They spit on my precious Jesus;
They dressed him up in a purple robe,
They put a crown of thorns upon his head,
And they pressed it down --
Oh, they pressed it down --
And they mocked my sweet King Jesus.
Up Golgotha's rugged road
I see my Jesus go.
I see him sink beneath the load,
I see my drooping Jesus sink.
And then they laid hold on Simon,
Black Simon, yes, black Simon;
They put the cross on Simon,
And Simon bore the cross.
On Calvary, on Calvary,
They crucified my Jesus.
They nailed him to the cruel tree,
And the hammer!
The hammer!
The hammer!
Rang through Jerusalem's streets.
The hammer!
The hammer!
The hammer!
Rang through Jerusalem's streets.
Jesus, my lamb-like Jesus,
Shivering as the nails go through his hands;
Jesus, my lamb-like Jesus,
Shivering as the nails go through his feet.
Jesus, my darling Jesus,
Groaning as the Roman spear plunged in his side;
Jesus, my darling Jesus,
Groaning as the blood came spurting from his wound.
Oh, look how they done my Jesus.
Mary,
Weeping Mary,
Sees her poor little Jesus on the cross.
Mary,
Weeping Mary,
Sees her sweet, baby Jesus on the cruel cross,
Hanging between two thieves.
And Jesus, my lonesome Jesus,
Called out once more to his Father,
Saying:
My God,
My God,
Why hast thou forsaken me?
And he drooped his head and died.
And the veil of the temple was split in two,
The midday sun refused to shine,
The thunder rumbled and the lightning wrote
An unknown language in the sky.
What a day! Lord, what a day!
When my blessed Jesus died.
Oh, I tremble, yes, I tremble,
It causes me to tremble, tremble,
When I think how Jesus died;
Died on the steeps of Calvary,
How Jesus died for sinners,
Sinners like you and me.

       <collex:text>And God called Moses from the burning bush,
He called in a still, small voice,
And he said: Moses -- Moses --
And Moses listened,
And he answered and said:
Lord, here am I.
And the voice in the bush said: Moses,
Draw not nigh, take off your shoes,
For you're standing on holy ground.
And Moses stopped where he stood,
And Moses took off his shoes,
And Moses looked at the burning bush,
And he heard the voice,
But he saw no man.
Then God again spoke to Moses,
And he spoke in a voice of thunder:
I am the Lord God Almighty,
I am the God of thy fathers,
I am the God of Abraham,
Of Isaac and of Jacob.
And Moses hid his face.
And God said to Moses:
I've seen the awful suffering
Of my people down in Egypt.
I've watched their hard oppressors,
Their overseers and drivers;
The groans of my people have filled my ears
And I can't stand it no longer;
So I'm come down to deliver them
Out of the land of Egypt,
And I will bring them out of that land
Into the land of Canaan;
Therefore, Moses, go down,
Go down into Egypt,
And tell Old Pharaoh
To let my people go.
And Moses said: Lord, who am I
To make a speech before Pharaoh?
For, Lord, you know I'm slow of tongue.
But God said: I will be thy mouth and I will be thy tongue;
Therefore, Moses, go down,
Go down yonder into Egypt land,
And tell Old Pharaoh
To let my people go.
And Moses with his rod in hand
Went down and said to Pharaoh:
Thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
Let my people go.
And Pharaoh looked at Moses,
He stopped still and looked at Moses;
And he said to Moses: Who is this Lord?
I know all the gods of Egypt,
But I know no God of Israel;
So go back, Moses, and tell your God,
I will not let this people go.
Poor Old Pharaoh,
He knows all the knowledge of Egypt,
Yet never knew --
He never knew
The one and the living God.
Poor Old Pharaoh,
He's got all the power of Egypt,
And he's going to try
To test his strength
With the might of the great Jehovah,
With the might of the Lord God of Hosts,
The Lord mighty in battle.
And God, sitting high up in his heaven,
Laughed at poor Old Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh called the overseers,
And Pharaoh called the drivers,
And he said: Put heavier burdens still
On the backs of the Hebrew Children.
Then the people chode with Moses,
And they cried out: Look here, Moses,
You've been to Pharaoh, but look and see
What Pharaoh's done to us now.
And Moses was troubled in mind.
But God said: Go again, Moses,
You and your brother, Aaron,
And say once more to Pharaoh,
Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews,
Let my people go.
And Moses and Aaron with their rods in hand
Worked many signs and wonders.
But Pharaoh called for his magic men,
And they worked wonders, too.
So Pharaohs' heart was hardened,
And he would not,
No, he would not
Let God's people go.
And God rained down plagues on Egypt,
Plagues of frogs and lice and locusts,
Plagues of blood and boils and darkness,
And other plagues besides.
But ev'ry time God moved the plague
Old Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
And he would not,
No, he would not
Let God's people go.
And Moses was troubled in mind.
Then the Lord said: Listen, Moses,
The God of Israel will not be mocked,
Just one more witness of my power
I'll give hard-hearted Pharaoh.
This very night about midnight,
I'll pass over Egypt land,
In my righteous wrath will I pass over,
And smite their first-born dead.
And God that night passed over.
And a cry went up out of Egypt.
And Pharaoh rose in the middle of the night
And he sent in a hurry for Moses;
And he said: Go forth from among my people,
You and all the Hebrew Children;
Take your goods and take your flocks,
And get away from the land of Egypt.
And, right then, Moses led them out,
With all their goods and all their flocks;
And God went on before,
A guiding pillar of cloud by day,
And a pillar of fire by night.
And they journeyed on in the wilderness,
And came down to the Red Sea.
In the morning,
Oh, in the morning,
They missed the Hebrew Children.
Four hundred years,
Four hundred years
They'd held them down in Egypt land.
Held them under the driver's lash,
Working without money and without price.
And it might have been Pharaoh's wife that said:
Pharaoh -- look what you've done.
You let those Hebrew Children go,
And who's going to serve us now?
Who's going to make our bricks and mortar?
Who's going to plant and plow our corn?
Who's going to get up in the chill of the morning?
And who's going to work in the blazing sun?
Pharaoh, tell me that!
And Pharaoh called his generals,
And the generals called the captains,
And the captains called the soldiers.
And they hitched up all the chariots,
Six hundred chosen chariots of war,
And twenty-four hundred horses.
And the chariots all were full of men,
With swords and shields
And shiny spears
And battle bows and arrows.
And Pharaoh and his army
Pursued the Hebrew Children
To the edge of the Red Sea.
Now, the Children of Israel, looking back,
Saw Pharaoh's army coming.
And the rumble of the chariots was like a thunder storm,
And the whirring of the wheels was like a rushing wind,
And the dust from the horses made a cloud that darked the day,
And the glittering of the spears was like lightnings in the night.
And the Children of Israel all lost faith,
The children of Israel all lost hope;
Deep Red Sea in front of them
And Pharaoh's host behind.
And they mumbled and grumbled among themselves:
Were there no graves in Egypt?
And they wailed aloud to Moses and said:
Slavery in Egypt was better than to come
To die here in this wilderness.
But Moses said:
Stand still! Stand still!
And see the Lord's salvation.
For the Lord God of Israel
Will not forsake his people.
The Lord will break the chariots,
The Lord will break the horsemen,
He'll break great Egypt's sword and shield,
The battle bows and arrows;
This day he'll make proud Pharaoh know
Who is the God of Israel.
And Moses lifted up his rod
Over the Red Sea;
And God with a blast of his nostrils
Blew the waters apart,
And the waves rolled back and stood up in a pile,
And left a path through the middle of the sea
Dry as the sands of the desert.
And the Children of Israel all crossed over
On to the other side.
When Pharaoh saw them crossing dry,
He dashed on in behind them --
Old Pharaoh got about half way cross,
And God unlashed the waters,
And the waves rushed back together,
And Pharaoh and all his army got lost,
And all his host got drownded.
And Moses sang and Miriam danced,
And the people shouted for joy,
And God led the Hebrew Children on
Till they reached the promised land.
Listen!-- Listen!
All you sons of Pharaoh.
Who do you think can hold God's people
When the Lord God himself has said,
Let my people go?

       <collex:text>In that great day,
People, in that great day,
God's a-going to rain down fire.
God's a-going to sit in the middle of the air
To judge the quick and the dead.
Early one of these mornings,
God's a-going to call for Gabriel,
That tall, bright angel, Gabriel;
And God's a-going to say to him: Gabriel,
Blow your silver trumpet,
And wake the living nations.
And Gabriel's going to ask him: Lord,
How loud must I blow it?
And God's a-going to tell him: Gabriel,
Blow it calm and easy.
Then putting one foot on the mountain top,
And the other in the middle of the sea,
Gabriel's going to stand and blow his horn,
To wake the living nations.
Then God's a-going to say to him: Gabriel,
Once more blow your silver trumpet,
And wake the nations underground.
And Gabriel's going to ask him: Lord
How loud must I blow it?
And God's a-going to tell him: Gabriel,
Like seven peals of thunder.
Then the tall, bright angel, Gabriel,
Will put one foot on the battlements of heaven
And the other on the steps of hell,
And blow that silver trumpet
Till he shakes old hell's foundations.
And I feel Old Earth a-shuddering --
And I see the graves a-bursting --
And I hear a sound,
A blood-chilling sound.
What sound is that I hear?
It's the clicking together of the dry bones,
Bone to bone -- the dry bones.
And I see coming out of the bursting graves,
And marching up from the valley of death,
The army of the dead.
And the living and the dead in the twinkling of an eye
Are caught up in the middle of the air,
Before God's judgment bar.
Oh-o-oh, sinner,
Where will you stand,
In that great day when God's a-going to rain down fire?
Oh, you gambling man -- where will you stand?
You whore-mongering man -- where will you stand?
Liars and backsliders -- where will you stand,
In that great day when God's a-going to rain down fire?
And God will divide the sheep from the goats,
The one on the right, the other on the left.
And to them on the right God's a-going to say:
Enter into my kingdom.
And those who've come through great tribulations,
And washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb,
They will enter in --
Clothed in spotless white,
With starry crowns upon their heads,
And silver slippers on their feet,
And harps within their hands;--
And two by two they'll walk
Up and down the golden street,
Feasting on the milk and honey
Singing new songs of Zion,
Chattering with the angels
All around the Great White Throne.
And to them on the left God's a-going to say:
Depart from me into everlasting darkness,
Down into the bottomless pit.
And the wicked like lumps of lead will start to fall,
Headlong for seven days and nights they'll fall,
Plumb into the big, black, red-hot mouth of hell,
Belching out fire and brimstone.
And their cries like howling, yelping dogs,
Will go up with the fire and smoke from hell,
But God will stop his ears.
Too late, sinner! Too late!
Good-bye, sinner! Good-bye!
In hell, sinner! In hell!
Beyond the reach of the love of God.
And I hear a voice, crying, crying:
Time shall be no more!
Time shall be no more!
Time shall be no more!
And the sun will go out like a candle in the wind,
The moon will turn to dripping blood,
The stars will fall like cinders,
And the sea will burn like tar;
And the earth shall melt away and be dissolved,
And the sky will roll up like a scroll.
With a wave of his hand God will blot out time,
And start the wheel of eternity.
Sinner, oh, sinner,
Where will you stand
In that great day when God's a-going to rain down fire?

Physically, if not mentally, Cordelia was a prostitute, meaning that although she had not yet realized the moral import of her wanton promiscuity nor become mercenary, she had, nevertheless, become quite blase and bountiful in the matter of bestowing sexual favors upon persuasive and likely young men. Yet, despite her seeming lack of discrimination, Cordelia was quite particular about the type of male to whom she submitted, for numbers do not necessarily denote a lack of taste and Cordelia had discovered after several months of active observation that one could find the qualities one admires or reacts positively to in a varied hodge-podge of outwardly different individuals.
The scene of Cordelia's activities was The Roosevelt Motion Picture Theatre on Seventh Avenue near 145th Street. Thrice weekly the program changed, and thrice weekly Cordelia would plunk down the necessary twenty-five cents evening admission fee, and saunter gaily into the foul-smelling depths of her favorite cinema shrine. The Roosevelt Theatre presented all of the latest pictures, also, twice weekly, treated its audiences to a vaudeville bill, then too, one could always have the most delightful physical contacts . . . hmm. . . .
Cordelia had not consciously chosen this locale nor had there been any conscious effort upon her part to take advantage of the extra opportunities afforded for physical pleasure. It had just happened that the Roosevelt Theatre was more close to her home than any other neighborhood picture palace, and it had also just happened that Cordelia had become almost immediately initiated into the ways of a Harlem theatre chippie soon after her discovery of the theatre itself.
It is the custom of certain men and boys who frequent these places to idle up and down the aisle until some female is seen sitting alone, to slouch down into a seat beside her, to touch her foot or else press her leg in such a way that it can be construed as accidental if necessary, and then, if the female is wise or else shows signs of willingness to become wise, to make more obvious approaches until, if successful, the approached female will soon be chatting with her baiter about the picture being shown, lolling in his arms, and helping to formulate plans for an after-theatre rendezvous. Cordella had, you see, shown a willingness to become wise upon her second visit to the Roosevelt. In a short while she had even learned how to squelch the bloated, lewd faced Jews and eager middle aged Negroes who might approach as well as how to inveigle the likeable little yellow or brown half men, embryo avenue sweetbacks, with their well modeled heads, stickily plastered hair, flaming cravats silken or broadcloth shirts, dirty underwear, low cut vests, form fitting coats, bell-bottom trousers and shiny shoes with metal cornered heels clicking with a brave, brazen rhythm upon the bare concrete floor as their owners angled and searched for prey.
Cordelia, sixteen years old, matronly mature, was an undisciplined, half literate product of rustic South Carolina, and had come to Harlem very much against her will with her parents and her six brothers and sisters. Against her will because she had not been at all anxious to leave the lackadaisical life of the little corn pone settlement where she had been born, to go trooping into the unknown vastness of New York, for she had been in love, passionately in love with one John Stokes who raised pigs, and who, like his father before him, found the raising of pigs so profitable that he could not even consider leaving Lintonville. Cordelia had blankly informed her parents that she would not go with them when they decided to be lured to New York by an older son who had remained there after the demobilization of the war time troops. She had even threatened to run away with John until they should be gone, but of course John could not leave his pigs, and John's mother was not very keen on having Cordelia for a daughter-in-law - those Joneses have bad mixed blood in 'em-so Cordelia had had to join the Gotham bound caravan and leave her lover to his succulent porkers.
However, the mere moving to Harlem had not doused the rebellious flame. Upon arriving Cordelia had not only refused to go to school and refused to hold even the most easily held job, but had also victoriously defied her harassed parents so frequently when it came to matters of discipline that she soon found herself with a mesmerizing lack home restraint, for the stress of trying to maintain themselves and their family in the new environment was far too much of a task for Mr. and Mrs. Jones to attend to facilely and at the same time try to control a recalcitrant child. So, when Cordelia had refused either to work or to attend school, Mrs. Jones herself had gone out for day's work, leaving Cordelia at home to take care of their five room railroad flat, the front room of which was rented out to a couple "living together," and to see that the younger children, all of whom were of school age, made their four trips daily between home and the nearby public school-as well as see that they had their greasy, if slim, food rations and an occasional change of clothing. Thus Cordelia's days were full-and so were her nights. The only difference being that the days belonged to the folks at home while the nights (since the folks were too tired or too sleepy to know or care when she came in or went out) belonged to her and to-well-whosoever will, let them come.
Cordelia had been playing this hectic, entrancing game for six months and was widely known among a certain group of young men and girls on the avenue as a fus' class chippie when she and I happened to enter the theatre simultaneously. She had clumped down the aisle before me, her open galoshes swishing noisily, her two arms busy wriggling themselves free from the torn sleeve lining of a shoddy imitation fur coat that one of her mother's wash clients had sent to her. She was of medium height and build, with overly developed legs and bust, and had a clear, keen light brown complexion. Her too slick, too naturally bobbed hair, mussed by the removing of a tight, black turban was of an undecided nature, i.e., it was undecided whether to be kinky or to be kind, and her body, as she sauntered along in the partial light had such a conscious sway of invitation that unthinkingly I followed, slid into the same row of seats and sat down beside her.
Naturally she had noticed my pursuit, and thinking that I was eager to play the game, let me know immediately that she was wise, and not the least bit averse to spooning with me during the evening's performance. Interested, and, I might as well confess, intrigued physically, I too became wise, and played up to her with all the fervor, or so I thought, of an old timer, but Cordelia soon remarked that I was different from mos' of des' sheiks, and when pressed for an explanation brazenly told me in a slightly scandalized and patronizing tone that I had not even felt her legs . . . !
At one o'clock in the morning we strolled through the snowy bleakness of one hundred and forty fourth street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues to the walk-up tenement flat in which she lived, and after stamping the snow from our feet, pushed through the double outside doors, and followed the dismal hallway to the rear of the building where we began the tedious climbing of the crooked, creaking, inconveniently narrow stairway. Cordelia had informed me earlier in the evening that she lived on the top floor-four flights up east side rear-and on our way we rested at each floor and at each half way landing, rested long enough to mingle the snowy dampness of our respective coats, and to hug clumsily while our lips met in an animal kiss.
Finally only another half flight remained, and instead of proceeding as was usual after our amourous demonstration I abruptly drew away from her, opened my overcoat, plunged my hand into my pants pocket, and drew out two crumpled one dollar bills which I handed to her, and then, while she stared at me foolishly, I muttered good-night, confusedly pecked her on her cold brown cheek, and darted down into the creaking darkness.
Six months later I was taking two friends of mine, lately from the provinces, to a Saturday night house-rent party in a well known whore house on one hundred and thirty-fourth street near Lenox Avenue. The place as we entered seemed to be a chaotic riot of raucous noise and clashing color all rhythmically merging in the red, smoke filled room. And there I saw Cordelia savagely careening in a drunken abortion of the Charleston and surrounded by a perspiring circle of handclapping enthusiasts. Finally fatigued, she whirled into an abrupt finish, and stopped so that she stared directly into my face, but being dizzy from the calisthenic turns and the cauterizing liquor she doubted that her eyes recognized someone out of the past, and, visibly trying to sober herself, languidly began to dance a slow drag with a lean hipped pimply faced yellow man who had walked between her and me. At last he released her, and seeing that she was about to leave the room I rushed forward calling Cordelia?-as if I was not yet sure who it was. Stopping in the doorway, she turned to see who had called, and finally recognizing me said simply, without the least trace of emotion,-'Lo kid. . . .
And without another word turned her back and walked into the hall to where she joined four girls standing there. Still eager to speak, I followed and heard one of the girls ask: Who's the dicty kid ? . . .
And Cordelia answered: The guy who gimme ma' firs' two bucks. . . .

A Play in Four Scenes
Place : A Southern City.
JOHN- A light brown-skinned Man
EMMALINE- A Black Woman
WESLEY - A boy who plays an accordion
EMMALINE'S DAUGHTER - A very white girl
EFFIE - - A mulatto girl
A RAILWAY CONDUCTOR
A DOCTOR
Several who play mouth organs, guitars, banjos.
Dancers, passengers, etc.
SETTING.--Early night. The inside of a "Jim Crow" railway coach. The car is parallel to the footlights. The seats on the down stage side of the coach are omitted. There are the luggage racks above the seats. The windows are all open. They are exits in each end of the car-right and left.
ACTION.--Before the curtain goes up there is the sound of a locomotive whistle and a stopping engine, loud laughter, The Many people speaking at once, goodnatured shrieks, strumming of stringed instruments, etc. The ascending curtain discovers a happy lot of Negroes boarding the train dressed in the gaudy, tawdry best of 1900. They are mostly in couples--each couple bearing a covered over market basket which the men hastily deposit in the racks as they scramble for seats. There is a little friendly pushing and shoving. One pair just miss a seat three times, much to the enjoyment of the crowd. Many "plug" silk hats are in evidence, also sun-flowers in button holes. The women are showily dressed in the the manner of the time, and quite conscious of their finery. Afew seats remain unoccupied.
Enter Effie (left) above, with a basket. One of the Men (standing, lifting his "plug" in a grand manner). Howdy do, Miss Effie, you'se lookin' jes lak a rose.
(Effie blushes and is confused. She looks up and down for a seat.) Fack is, if you wuzn't walkin' long, ah'd think you wuz a rose-(he looks timidly behind her and the others laugh). Looka here, where's Sam at?
EFFIE (tossing her head haughtily). I don't know an' I don't keer.
THE MAN (visibly relieved). Then lemme scorch you to a seat. (He takes her basket and leads her to a seat center of the car, puts the basket in the rack and seats himself beside her with his hat at a rakish angle.)
MAN (sliding his arm along the back of the seat). How come Sam ain't heah-y'll on a bust?
EFFIE (angrily). A The Man dat don't buy me nothin tuh put in mah basket, ain't goin' wid me tuh no cake walk. (The hand on the seat touches her shoulder and she thrusts it away). Take yo' arms from 'round me, Dinky! Gwan hug yo' Ada!
MAN (in mock indignation). Do you think I'd look at Ada when Ah got a chance tuh be wid you? Ah always wuz sweet on you, but you let ole Mullet-head Sam cut me out.
ANOTHER THE MAN (with head out of the window). Just look at de darkies coming! (With head insite coach.) Hey, Dinky! Heah come Ada wid a great big basket.
(Dinky jumps up from beside Effie and rushes to exit right. In a moment they re-enter and take a seat near entrance. Everyone in coach laughs. Dinky's girl turns and calls back to Effie.)
GIRL. Where's Sam, Effie?
EFFIE. Lawd knows, Ada.
GIRL. Lawd a mussy! Who you gointer walk de cake wid?
EFFIE. Nobody, Ah reckon. John and Emma gointer win it nohow. They's the bestest cakewalkers in dis state.
ADA. You'se better than Emma any day in de week. Cose Sam cain't walk lake John. (She stands up and scans the coach.) Looka heah, ain't John an' Emma going? They ain't on heah!
(The locomotive bell begins to ring.)
EFFIE. Mah Gawd, s'pose dey got left!
THE MAN (with head out of window). Heah they come, nip and tuck-whoo-ee! They'se gonna make it! (He waves excitedly.) Come on Jawn! (Everybody crowds the windows, encouraging them by gesture and calls. As the whistle blows twice, and the train begins to move, they enter panting and laughing at left. The only seat left is the one directly in front of Effie.)
DINKY (standing). Don't y'all skeer us no mo' lake dat! There couldn't be no cake walk thout y'all. Dem shad-mouf St. Augustine coons would win dat cake and we would have tuh kill 'em all bodaciously.
JOHN. It was Emmaline nearly made us get left. She says I wuz smiling at Effie on the street car and she had to get off and wait for another one.
EMMA (removing the hatpins from her hat, turns furiously upon him). You wuz grinning at her and she wuz grinning back jes lake a ole chessy cat!
JOHN (positively). I wuzn't.
EMMA (about to place her hat in rack). You wuz. I seen you looking jes lake a possum.
JOHN. I wuzn't. I never gits a chance tuh smile at nobody-you won't let me.
EMMA. Jes the same every time you sees a yaller face, you takes a chance. (They sit down in peeved silence for a minute.)
DINKY. Ada, les we all sample de basket. I bet you got huckleberry pie.
ADA. No I aint, I got peach an' tater pies, but we aint gonna tetch a thing tell we gits tuh de hall.
DINKY (mock alarm). Naw, don't do dat! It's all right tuh save the fried chicken, but pies is always et on trains.
ADA. Aw shet up! (He struggles with her for a kiss. She slaps him but finally yields.)
JOHN (looking behind him). Hellow, Effie, where's Sam?
EFFIE. Deed, I don't know.
JOHN. Y'all on a bust?
EMMA. None ah yo'bizness, you got enough tuh mind yo' own self. Turn 'round!
(She puts up a pouting mouth and he snatches a kiss. She laughs just as he kisses her again and there is a resounding smack which causes the crowd to laugh. And cries of "Oh you kid!" "Salty dog!")
(Enter conductor left calling tickets cheerfully and laughing at the general merriment.)
CONDUCTOR. I hope somebody from Jacksonville wins this cake.
JOHN. You live in the "Big Jack?"
CONDUCTOR. Sure do. And I wanta taste a piece of that cake on the way back tonight.
JOHN. Jes rest easy-them Augustiners aint gonna smell it. (Turns to Emma.) Is they, baby?
EMMA. Not if Ah kin help it.
Somebody with a guitar sings; "Ho babe, mah honey taint no lie."
(The conductor takes up tickets, passes on and exits right.)
WESLEY. Look heah, you cake walkers-y'all oughter git up and limber up yo' joints. I heard them folks over to St. Augustine been oiling up wid goose-grease, and over to Ocala they been rubbing down in snake oil.
A WOMAN'S VOICE. You better shut up, Wesley, you just joined de church last month. Somebody's going to tell the pastor on you.
WESLEY. Tell it, tell it, take it up and smell it. Come on out you John and Emma and Effie, and limber up.
JOHN. Naw, we don't wanta do our walking steps-nobody won't wanta see them when we step out at the hall. But we kin do something else just to warm ourselves up.
(Wesley begins to play "Goo Goo Eyel' on his accordian, the other instruments come in one by one and John and Emma step into the aisle and "parade" up and down the aisle--Emma holding up her skirt, showing the lace on her petticoats. They two-step back to their seat amid much applause.)
WESLEY. Come on out, Effie! Sam aint heah so you got to hold up his side too. Step on out. (There is a murmur of applause as she steps into the aisle. Wesley strikes up "I'm gointer live anyhow till I die." It is played quite spiritedly as Effie swings into the pas-me-la--)
WESLEY (in ecstasy). Hot stuff I reckon! Hot stuff I reckon! (The musicians are stamping. Great enthusiasm. Some clap time with hands and feet. She hurls herself into a modified Hoochy Koochy, and finishes up with an ecstatic yell.)
There is a babble of talk and laughter and exultation
JOHN (applauding, loudly). If dat Effie can't step nobody can.
EMMA. Course you'd say so cause it's her. Everything she do is pretty to you.
JOHN (caressing her). Now don't say that, Honey. Dancing is dancing no matter who is doing it. But nobody can hold a candle to you in nothing.
(Some men are heard tuning up-getting pitch to sing. Four of them crowd together in one seat and begin the chorus of "Daisies Won't Tell." John and Emma grow quite affectionate.)
JOHN (kisses her). Emma, what makes you always picking a fuss with me over some yaller girl.What makes you so jealous, nohow ? I don't do nothing.
(She clings to him, but he turns slightly away. The train whistle blows, there is a slackening of speed. Passengers begin to take down baskets from their racks.)
EMMA. John! John, don't you want me to love you, honey?
JOHN (turns and kisses her slowly). Yes, I want you to love me, you know I do. But I don't like to be accused o' ever light colored girl in the world. It hurts my feeling. I don't want to be jealous like you are.
(Enter at right Conductor, crying "St. Augustine, St. Augustine'' He exits left. The crowd has congregated at the two exits, pushing good-naturedly and joking. All except John and Emma. They are still seated with their arms about each other.)
EMMA (sadly). Then you don't want my love, John, cause I can't help mahself from being jealous. I loves you so hard, John, and jealous love is the only kind I got.
(John kisses her very feelingly.)
EMMA. Just for myself alone is the only way I knows how to love.
(They are standing in the aisle with their arms about each other as the curtain falls.)
SCENE II
Setting-A weather-board hall. A large room with the joists bare. The place has been divided by a curtain of sheets stretched and a rope across from left to right. From behind the curtain there are occasional sounds of laughter, a note or two on a stringed instrument or accordion. General stir. That is the dance hall. The front is the ante-room where the refreshments are being served. A "plank" seat runs all around the hall, along the walls. The lights are kerosene lamps with reflectors. They are fixed to the wall. The lunch-baskets are under the seat. There is a table on either side upstage with a white Man behind each. At one, ice cream is sold, at the other, roasted peanuts and large red and-white sticks of Peppermint candy.
People come in by twos and three, laughing, joking, horse-plays, gauchily flowered dresses, small waists, bulging hips and busts, hats worn far back on the head, etc. People from Ocala greet others from Palatka, Jacksonville, St. .Augustine, etc.
Some find seats in the ante-room, others pass on into the main hall.
Enter the Jacksonville delegation, laughing, pushing proudly.
DINKY. Here we is, folks-here we is. Geissler take dot cake on back tub Jacksonville where it belongs.
THE MAN. Gwen! Whut wid you mullet-head Jacksonville Coons know whut to do wid a cake. It's gointer stay right here in Augustine where de good cake walkers grow.
DINKY. Taint no 'Walkers' never walked till John and Emmaline prance out-you mighty come a tootin'.
Great laughing and joshing as more people come in. John and Emma are encouraged, urged on to win.
EMMA. Let's we git a seat, John, and set down.
JOHN. Sho will-nice one right over there. (They push over to wall seat, place basket underneath, and sit. Newcomers shake hands with them and urge them on to win.)
(Enter Joe Clarke and a small group. He is a rotund, expansive The Man with a liberal watch chain and charm.)
DINKY (slapping Clarke on the back). If you don't go 'way from here! Lawdy, if it aint Joe.
CLARKE (jovially). Ah thought you had done forgot us people in Eatonville since you been living up here in Jacksonville.
DINKY. Course Ah aint. (Turning.) Looka heah folks! Joe Clarke oughta be made chairThe Man uh dis meetin'-Ah mean Past Great-Grand Master of Ceremonies, him being the onliest mayor of de onliest colored town in de state.
GENERAL CHORUS. Yeah, let him be-thass fine, etc.
DINKY (setting his hat at a new angle and throwing out his chest). And Ah'll scorch him to de platform. Ahem
(Sprinkling of laughter as Joe Clarke is escorted i i nto next room by Dinky.)
(The musicians are arriving one by one during this time. A guitar, accordian, mouth organ, banjo, etc. Soon there is a rapping for order heard inside and the voice of Joe Clarke.)
JOE CLARKE. Git yo' partners one an' all for de gran' march! Git yo' partners, gent-mens!
The MAN (drawing basket from under bench). Let's we all eat first.
(John and Emma go buy ice-cream. They coquettishly eat from each other's spoons. Old The Man Lizzimore crosses to Effie and removes his hat and bows with a great flourish.)
LIZZIMORE. Sam ain't here t'night, is he, Effie.
EFFIE (embarrassed). Naw suh, he aint.Lizz. Well, you like chicken? (Extends arm to her.) Take a wing!
(He struts her up to the table amid the laughter of the house. He wears no collar.)
JOHN (squeezes Emma's hand). You certainly is a ever loving mamma-when you aint mad.
EMMA (smiles sheepishly). You oughtn't to make me mad then.
JOHN. Ah don't make you! You makes yo'self mad, den blame it on me. Ah keep on tellin' you Ah don't love nobody but you. Ah knows heaps uh half-white girls Ah could git ef Ah wanted to. But (he squeezes her hard again) Ah jus' wants you! You know what they say! De darker de berry, de sweeter de taste!
EMMA (pretending to pout). Oh, you tries to run over me an' keep it under de cover, but Ah won't let yuh. (Both laugh.) Les' we eat our basket!
JOHN. Alright. (He pulls the basket out and she removes the table cloth. They set the basket on their knees and begin to eat fried chicken.)
MALE Voice. Les' everybody eat-motion's done carried. (Everybody begins to open baskets. All have fried chicken. Very good humor prevails. Delicacies are swapped from one basket to the other. John and Emma offer the The Man next them some supper. He takes a chicken leg. Effie crosses to John and Emma with two pieces of pie on a plate.
EFFIE. Y'll have a piece uh mah blueberry pie -it's mighty nice! (She proffers it with a timid smile to Emma who "freezes" up instantly.)
Naw! We don't want no pie. We got cocoanut layer-cake.
JOHN. Ah-Ah think ah'd choose a piece uh pie, Effie. (He takes it.) Will you set down an' have a snack wid us? (He slides over to make room.)
EFFIE (nervously). Ah, naw, Ah got to run on back to mah basket, but Ah thought maybe y'll mout' want tuh taste mah pie. (She turns to go.)
JOHN. Thank you, Effie. It's mighty good, too. (He eats It. Effie crosses to her seat. Emma glares at her for a minute, then turns disgustedly away from the basket. John catches her shoulder and faces her around.)
JOHN (pleadingly). Honey, be nice. Don't act lak dat!
EMMA (jerking free). Naw, you done ruint mah appetite now, carryin' on wid dat punkin-colored ole gal.
JOHN. Whut kin Ah do? If you had a acted polite Ah wouldn't a had nothin' to say.
EMMA. Naw, youse jus' hog-wile ovah her cause she's half-white! No matter whut Ah say, you keep carryin' on wid her. Act polite? Naw Ah aint gonna be deceitful an' bust mah gizzard fuh nobody! Let her keep her dirty ole pie ovah there where she is!
JOHN (looking around to see if they are overheard). Sh-sh Honey, you mustn't talk so loud.
EMMA (louder). Ah-Ah aint gonna bite mah tongue! If she don't like it she can lump it. Mah back is broad-(John tries to cover her mouth with his hand). She calls herself a big cigar, but I kin smoke her.
(The people are laughing and talking for the most part and pay no attention. Effie is laughing and talking to those around her and does not hear the tirade. The eating is over and everyone is going behind the curtain. John and Emma put away their basket like the others, and sit glum. Voice of Master-of-ceremonies can be heard from beyond curtain announcing the pas-me-la contest. The contestants, mostly girls, take the floor. There is no music except the clapping of hands and the shouts of "Parse-me-lah" in time with the hand-clapping. At the end Master announces winner. Shadows seen on curtain.)
MASTER. Mathilda Clarke is winner-if she will step forward she will receive a beautiful wook fascinator. (The girl goes up and receives it with great hand-clapping and good humor.) And now since the roosters is crowin' foah midnight, an' most of us got to git up an' go to work tomorrow, The Great Cake Walk will begin. Ah wants de floor cleared, cause de representatives of de several cities will be announced an' we wants 'ern to take de floor as their names is called. Den we wants 'ern to do a gran' promenade roun'de hall. An' they will then commence to walk fuh de biggest cake ever baked in dis state. Ten dozen eggs-ten pounds of flour -ten pounds of butter, and so on and so forth..Now then-(he strikes a pose) for St. Augustine, Miss Lucy Taylor, Mr. Ned Coles.
(They step out amid applause and stand before stage.)
For Daytona, Miss Janie Bradley, Enoch Nixon
(Same business.)
For Ocala, Miss Docia Boger, Mr. Oscar Clarke
(Same business.)
For Palatka, Miss Maggie Lemmons, Mr. Senator Lewis
(Same business.)
And for Jacksonville the most popular "walkers" in de state Miss Emmaline Beazeby, Mr. John Turner.
(Tremendous applause. John rises and offers his arm grandiloquently to Emma.)
EMMA (pleadingly, and clutching his coat). John let's we all don't go in there with all them. Let's we all go on home.
JOHN (amazed). Why, Emma?
EMMA. Cause, cause all them girls is going to pulling and hauling on you, and-
JOHN (impatiently). Shucks! Come on. Don't you hear the people clapping for us and calling our names? Come on!
(He tries to pull her up-she tries to drag him back.)
Come on, Emma! Taint no sense in your acting like this. The band is playing for us. Hear 'em? (He moves feet in a dance step.)
EMMA. Naw, John, Ah'm skeered. -I-.
(He tries to break away from her. ing on fiercely.)
JOHN. I got to go -- I been practising almost a year -- l --we done come all the way down here. I can walk the cake, Emma--we got to -- I got to go in! (He looks into her face and sees her tremendous fear.) What you skeered about?
EMMA (hopefully). You won't go it-You'll come on go home with me all by ourselves. Come on John. I can't, I just can't go in there and see all them girls-Effie hanging after you-.
JOHN. I got to go in-(he removes her hand from his coat)-whether you come with me or not.
EMMA. Oh-them yaller wenches! How I hate em! They gets everything they wants-.
VOICE INSIDE. We are waiting for the couple from Jacksonville-Jacksonville! Where is the couple f rom-.
(Wesley parts the curtain and looks out.)
WESLEY. Here they is out here spooning! You all can't even hear your names called. Come on John and Emma.
JOHN. Coming. (He dashes inside. Wesley stands looking at Emma in surprise.)
WESLEY. What's the matter, Emma? You and John spatting again? (He goes back inside.)
EMMA (calmly bitter). He went and left me. If we is spatting we done had our last one. (She stands and clenches her fists.) Ah, mah God! He's in there with her-Oh, them half whites, they gets everything, they gets everything everybody else wants! The men, the jobs-everything! The whole world is got a sign on it. Wanted: Light colored. Us blacks was made for cobble stones. (She muffles a cry and sinks limp upon the seat.)
VOICE INSIDE. Miss Effie Jones will walk for Jacksonville with Mr. John Turner in place of Miss Emmaline Beazeley.
SCENE III-Dance Hall
Emma springs to her feet and flings the curtains wide open. She stands staring at the gay scene for a moment defiantly then creeps over to a seat along the wall and shrinks into the Spanish Moss, motionless.
Dance hall decorated with palmetto leaves and Spanish Moss-a flag or two. Orchestra consists of guitar, The Mandolin, banjo, accordian, church organ and drum.
MASTER (on platform). Couples take yo' places! When de music starts, gentlemen parade yo' ladies once round de hall, den de walk begins. (The music begins. Four men come out from behind the platform bearing a huge chocolate cake. The couples are "prancing" in their tracks. The men lead off the procession with the cake-the contestants make a grand slam around the hall.)
MASTER. Couples to de floor! Stan' back, ladies an' gentlemen-give 'em plenty room.
(Music changes to "Way Down in Georgia.Orchestra sings. Effie takes the arm that John offers her and they parade to the other end of the hall. She takes her place. John goes back upstage to the platform, takes off his silk hat in a graceful sweep as he bows deeply to Effie. She lifts her skirts and curtsies to the floor. Both smile broadly. They advance toward each other, meet midway, then, arm in arm, begin to "strut." John falters as he faces her, but recovers promptly and is perfection in his style. (Seven to nine minutes to curtain.) Fervor of spectators grows until all are taking part in some way-either hand-clapping or singing the words. At curtain they have reached frenzy.)
QUICK CURTAIN
(It stays down a few seconds to indicate ending of contest and goes up again on John and Effie being declared winners by Judges.)
MASTER (on platform, with John and Effie on the floor before him). By unanimous decision de cake goes to de couple from Jacksonville! (Great enthusiasm. The cake is set down in the center of the floor and the winning couple parade around it arm in arm. John and Effie circle the cake happily and triumphantly. The other contestants, and then the entire assembly fall in behind and circle the cake, singing and clapping. The festivities continue. The Jacksonville quartet step upon the platform and sing a verse and chorus of "Daisies won't tell." Cries of "Hurrah for Jacksonville! Glory for the big town," "Hurrah for Big Jack.")
A MAN (seeing Emma). You're from Jacksonville, aint you? (He whirls her around and around.) Aint you happy? Whoopee! (He releases her and she drops upon a seat. She buries her face in the moss.)
(Quartet begins on chorus again. People are departing, laughing, humming, with quartet cheering. John, the cake, and Effie being borne away in triumph.)
SCENE IV
Time--present. The interior of a one-room shack in an alley. There is a small window in the rear wall upstage left. There is an enlarged crayon drawing of a The Man and woThe Man-The Man sitting cross-legged, woThe Man standing 'With her hand on his shoulder. A center table, red cover, a low, cheap rocker, two straight chairs, a small kitchen stove at left with a wood-box beside it, a waterbucket on a stand close by. A hand towel and a wash basin. A shelf Of dishes above this. There is an ordinary oil lamp on the center table but it is not lighted when the curtain goes up. Some light enters through the window and falls on the woThe Man seated in the low rocker. The door is center right. A cheap bed- is against the upstage wall. Someone is on the bed but is lying so that the back is toward the audience.
ACTION-As the curtain rises, the woThe Man is seen rocking to and fro in the low rocker. A dead silence except for the sound of the rocker and an occasional groan from the bed. Once a faint voice says "water" and the woThe Man in the rocker arises and carries the tin dipper to the bed.
WOMAN. No mo' right away-Doctor says not too much. (Returns dipper to pail.-Pause.) You got right much fever -- I better go git the doctor agin.
(There comes a knocking at the door and she stands still for a moment, listening. It comes again and she goes to door but does not open it.)
WOMAN. Who's that?
VOICE OUTSIDE. Does Emma Beasely live here? EMMA. Yeah- (pause) -who is it?
VOICE. It's me-John Turner.
EMMA (puts hands eagerly on the fastening). John? did you say John Turner?
VOICE. Yes, Emma, it's me.
(The door is opened and the The Man steps inside.) EMMA. John! Your hand (she feels for it and touches it). John flesh and blood.
~JOHN (laughing awkwardly). It's me alright, old girl. just as bright as a basket of chips. Make a light quick so I can see how you look. I'm crazy to see you. Twenty years is a long time to wait, Emma.
EMMA (nervously). Oh, let's we all just sit in the dark awhile. (Apologetically.) I wasn't expecting nobody and my house aint picked up. Sit down. (She draws up the chair. She sits in rocker.)
JOHN. just to think! Emma! Me and Emma sitting down side by each. Know how I found you?
EMMA (dully). Naw. How?
JOHN (brightly). Soon's I got in town I hunted up Wesley and he told me how to find you. That's who I come to see, you!
EMMA. Where you been North somewheres? Nobody out where you got to.
JOHN. Yes, up North. Philadelphia.
EMMA. Married yet?
JOHN. Oh yes, seventeen years ago. But my wife is dead now and so I came as soon as it was decent to find you. I wants to marry you. I die happy if I didn't. Couldn't get over youcouldn't forget. Forget me, Emma?
EMMA. Naw, John. How could I?
JOHN (leans over impulsively to catch her hand). Oh, Emma, I love you so much. Strike a light honey so I can see you-see if you changed much. You was such a handsome girl!
EMMA. We don't exactly need no light, do we, John, tuh jus' set an' talk?
JOHN. Yes, we do, Honey. Gwan, make a light. Ah wanna see you.
(There is a silence.)
EMMA. Bet you' wife wuz some high-yaller dickty-doo.
JOHN. Naw she wasn't neither. She was jus' as much like you as Ah could get her. Make a light an' Ah'll show you her pictcher. Shucks, ah gotta look at mah old sweetheart. (He strikes a match and holds it up between their faces and they look intently at each other over it until it burns out.) You aint changed none atall, Emma, jus' as pretty as a speckled pup yet.
EMMA (lighter). Go long, John! (Short pause) member how you useter bring me magnolias?
JOHN. Do I? Gee, you was sweet! 'Member how Ah useter pull mah necktie loose so you could tie it back for me? Emma, Ah can't see to mah soul how we lived all this time, way from one another. 'Member how you useter make out mah ears had done run down and you useter screw 'em up agin for me? (They laugh.)
EMMA. Yeah, Ah useter think you wuz gointer be mah husban' then-but you let dat ole-.
JOHN. Ah aint gonna let you alibi on me lak dat. Light dat lamp! You cain't look me in de eye and say no such. (He strikes another,match and lights the lamp.) Course, Ah don't wanta look too bossy, but Ah b'lieve you got to marry me tuh git rid of me. That is, if you aint married.
EMMA. Naw, Ah aint. (She turns the lamp down.)
JOHN (looking about the room). Not so good, Emma. But wait till you see dat little place in Philly! Got a little "Rolls-Rough," too-gointer teach you to drive it, too.
EMMA. Ah been havin' a hard time, John, an' Ah lost you-oh, aint nothin' been right for me! Ah aint never been happy.
(John takes both of her hands in his.)
JOHN. You gointer be happy now, Emma. Cause Ah'm gointer make you. Gee Whiz! Ab aint but forty-two and you aint forty yet-we got plenty time. (There is a groan from the bed.) Gee, what's that?
EMMA (ill at ease). Thass mah chile. She's sick. Reckon Ah bettah see 'bout her.
JOHN. You got a chile? Gee, that great! Ah always wanted one. but didn't have no luck. Now we kin start off with a family. Girl or boy?
EMMA (slowly). A girl. Comin' tuh see me agin soon, John?
JOHN. Comin' agin? Ah aint gone yet! We aint talked, you aint kissed me an' nothin', and you aint showed me our girl. (,another groan, more prolonged.) She must be pretty sick-let's sec. (He turns in his chair and Emma rushes over to the bed and covers the girl securely, tucking her long hair under the covers, too-before he arises. He goes over to the bed and looks down into her face. She is mulatto. Turns to Emma teasingly.) Talkin' 'bout me liking high-yallers-yo husband musta been pretty near white.
EMMA (slowly). Ah, never wuz married, John.
JOHN. It's alright, Emma. (Kisses her warmly.) Everything is going to be O.K. (Turning back to the bed.) Our child looks pretty sick, but she's pretty. (Feels her forehead and cheek.) Think she oughter have a doctor.
EMMA. Ah done had one. Course Ah cain't git no specialist an' nothin' lak dat. (She looks about the room and his gaze follows hers.) Ah aint got a whole lot lake you. Nobody don't git rich in no white-folks' kitchen, nor in de washtub. You know Ah aint no school-teacher an' nothin' lak dat.
(John putrs-yo husband musta been pretty near white.
EMMA (slowly). Ah, never wuz married, John.
JOHN. It's alright, Emma. (Kisses her warmly.) Everything is going to be O.K. (Turning back to the bed.) Our child looks pretty sick, but she's pretty. (Feels her forehead and cheek.) Think she oughter have a doctor.

(John puts his arm about her.)
JOHN. It's all right, Emma. But our daughter is bad off-run out an' git a doctor--she needs one. Ah'd go if Ah knowed where to find one-you kin git one the quickest-hurry, Emma.
EMMA (looks from John to her daughter and back again.) She'll be all right, Ah reckon, for a while. John, you love me-you really want me sho' nuff ?
JOHN. Sure Ah do-think Ah'd come all de way down here for nothin'? Ah wants to marry agin.
EMMA. Soon, John?
JOHN. Real soon.
EMMA. Ah wuz jus'thinkin', mah folks is away now on a little trip-be home day after tomorrow -we could git married tomorrow.
JOHN. All right. Now run on after the doctor -we must look after our girl. Gee, she's got a full suit of hair! Glad you didn't let her chop it off. (Looks away from bed and sees Emma standing still.)
JOHN. Emma, run on after the doctor, honey. (She goes to the bed and again tucks the long braids of hair in, which are again pouring over the side of the bed by the feverish tossing of the girl.) What's our daughter's name?
EMMA. Lou Lillian. (She returns to the rocker uneasily and sits rocking jerkily. He returns to his seat and turns up the light.)
JOHN. Gee, we're going to be happy-we gointer make up for all them twenty years (another groan). Emma, git up an' gwan git dat doctor. You done forgot Ah'm de boss uh dis family now-gwan, while Ah'm here to watch her whilst you're gone. Ah got to git back to mah stoppin'-place after a while.
EMMA. You go git one, John.
JOHN. Whilst Ah'm blunderin' round tryin' to find one, she'll be gettin' worse. She sounds pretty bad-(takes out his wallet and hands her a bill)get a taxi if necessary. Hurry!
EMMA (does not take the money, but tucks her arms and hair in again, and gives the girl a drink). Reckon Ah better go git a doctor. Don't want nothin' to happen to her. After you left, Ah useter have such a hurtin' in heah (touches her bosom) till she come an' eased it some.
JOHN. Here, take some money and get a good doctor. There must be some good colored ones around here now.
EMMA (scornfully). I wouldn't let one of 'em tend my cat if I had one! But let's we don't start a f uss.
(John caresses her again. When he raises his head he notices the picture on the wall and crosses over to it with her-his arm still about her.)
JOHN. Why, that's you and me!
EMMA. Yes, I never could part with that. You coming tomorrow morning, John, and we're gointer get married, aint we? Then we can talk over everything.
JOHN. Sure, but I aint gone yet. I don't see how come we can't make all our arrangements now.
(Groans from bed and feeble movement.)
Good lord, Emma, go get that doctorl
(Emma stares at the girl and the bed and seizes a hat from a nail on the wall. She prepares to go but looks from John to bed and back again. She fumbles about the table and lowers the lamp. Goes to door and opens it. John offers the wallet. She refuses it.)
EMMA. Doctor right around the corner. Guess I'll leave the door open so she can get some air. She, won't need nothing while I'm gone, John. (She crosses and tucks the girl in securely and rushes out, looking backward and pushing the door wide open as she exits. John sits in the chair beside the table. Looks about him-shakes his head. The girl onthe bed groans, "water," "so hot." John looks him excitedly. Gives her a drink. Feels her head. Takes a clean handkerchief from his I and wets it and places it upon her forehead. raises her hand to the cool object. Enter Emma ning. When she sees John at the bed she is fz fury. She rushes over and jerks his shoulder arc, They face each other.)
EMMA. I knowed it! (She strikes him.) A white skin. (She rushes at him again. John i gers back and catches her hands.)
JOHN. Emma!
EMMA (struggles to free her hands). Let me in so I can kill you. Come sneaking in here lik pole cat!
JOHN (slowly, after a long pause). So this the woman I've been wearing over my heart like rose for twenty years! She so despises her own s] that she can't believe any one else could love it!
(Emma writhes to free herself.)
JOHN. Twenty years! Twenty years of adoration, of hunger, of worship! (On the verge
tears he crosses to door and exits quietly, closin the door after him.)
(Emma remains standing, looking dully about a if she is half asleep. There comes a knocking a, the door. She rushes to open it. It is the doctor White. She does not step aside so that he can enter
DOCTOR. Well, shall I come in?
EMMA (stepping aside and laughing a little) That's right, doctor, come in.
(Doctor crosses to bed with professional air Looks at the girl, feels the pulse and draws up the sheet over the face. He turns to her.)
DOCTOR. Why didn't you come sooner. I told you to let me know of the least change in her condition.
EMMA (flatly). I did come-I went for the doctor.
DOCTOR. Yes, but you waited. An hour more or less is mighty important sometimes. Why didn't you come?
EMMA (passes hand over face). Couldn't see
(Doctor looks at her curiously, then sympathetically takes out a small box of pills, and hands them to her.) Here, you're worn out. Take one of these every hour and try to get some sleep. (He departs.)
(She puts the pill-box on the table, takes up the low rocking chair and places it by the head of the bed. She seats herself and rocks monotonously and stares out of the door. I dry sob now and then. The wind from the open door blows out the lamp and she is seen by the little light from the window rocking in an even, monotonous gait, and sobbing.)

       <collex:text>From the Dark Tower
We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Nor always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap ;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made eternally to weep.
The night whose sable breast relieves the stark,
White stars is no less lovely being dark,
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall.
So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds.

       <collex:text>A Southern Road
Yolk-colored tongue
Parched beneath a burning sky,
A lazy little tune
Hummed up the crest of some
Soft sloping hill.
One streaming line of beauty
Flowing by a forest
Pregnant with tears.
A hidden nest for beauty
Idly flung by God
In one lonely lingering hour
Before the Sabbath.
A blue- fruited black gum,
Like a tall predella,
Bears a dangling figure,
Sacrificial dower to the raff,
Swinging alone,
A solemn, tortured shadow in the air.

       <collex:text>Jungle Taste
There is a coarseness
In the songs of black men
 Of the sea.
There is a weird strangeness
In the songs of black men
 Which sounds not strange
To me.
There is beauty
In the faces of black women,
Jungle beauty
And mystery.
Dark, hidden beauty
In the faces of black women
Which only black men
See.
Finality
Trees are the souls of men
Reaching skyward.
And while each soul
Draws nearer God
Its dark roots cleave
To earthly sod :
Death, only death
Brings triumph to the soul.
The silent grave alone
Can bare the goal.
Then roots and all
Must lie forgot
To rot.

       <collex:text>The Death Bed
All the time they were praying
He watched the shadow of a tree
Flicker on the wall.
There is no need of prayer,
He said,
No need at all.
The kin-folk thought it strange
That he should ask them from a dying bed.
But they left all in a row
And it seemed to ease him
To see them go.
There were some who kept on praying
In a room across the hall
And some who listened to the breeze
That made the shadows waver
On the wall.
He tried his nerve
On a song he knew
And made an empty note
That might have come,
From a bird's harsh throat.
And all the time it worried him
That they were in there praying
And all the time he wondered
What it was they could be saying.

I got a job now
Runnin an elevator
In the Dennison Hotel in Jersey,
Job aint no good though.
No money around.
Jobs are just chances
Like everything else.
Maybe a little luck now,
Maybe not.
Maybe a good job sometimes:
Step out o' the barrel, boy.
Two new suits an'
A woman to sleep with.
Maybe no luck for a long time.
Only the elevators
Goin' up an' down,
Up an' down,
Or somebody else's shoes
To shine,
Or greasy pots in a dirty kitchen.
I been runnin' this
Elevator too long.
Guess I'll quit now.

       <collex:text>Railroad Avenue
Dusk dark
On Railroad Avenue.
Lights in the fish joints,
Lights in the pool rooms.
A box car some train
Has forgotten
In the middle of the block.
A player piano,
A victrola .
942
Was the number.
A boy
Lounging on the corner.
A passing girl
With purple powdered skin.
Laughter
Suddenly
Like a taut drum.
Laughter
Suddenly
Neither truth nor lie.
Laughter
Hardening the dusk dark evening.
Laughter
Shaking the lights in the fish joints,
Rolling white balls in the pool rooms,
And leaving untouched the box car
Some train has forgotten.

       <collex:text>Then the golden hour
Will tick its last
And the flame will go down in the flower.
A briefer length of moon
Will mark the sea-line and the yellow dune.
Then we may think of this, yet
There will be something forgotten
And something we should forget.
It will be like all things we know :
A stone will fail; a rose is sure to go.
It will be quiet then and we may stay
Long at the picket gate,
But there will be less to say.

       <collex:text>Wedding Day
His name was Paul Watson and as he shambled down rue Pigalle he might have been any other Negro of enormous height and size. But as I have said, his name was Paul Watson. Passing him on the street, you might not have known or cared who he was, but any one of the residents about the great Montmartre district of Paris could have told you who he was as well as many interesting bits of his personal history.
He had come to Paris in the days before colored jazz bands were the style. Back home he had been a prize fighter. In the days when Joe Gans was in his glory Paul was following the ring, too. He didn't have that fine way about him that Gans had and for that reason luck seemed to go against him. When he was in the ring he was like a mad bull, especially if his opponent was a white man. In those days there wasn't any sympathy or nicety about the ring and so pretty soon all the ringmasters got down on Paul and he found it pretty hard to get a bout with anyone. Then it was that he worked his way across the Atlantic Ocean on big liner--in the days before colored jazz bands were the style in Paris. Things flowed along smoothly for the first few years with Paul's working here and there in the unfrequented places of Paris. On the side he used to give boxing lessons to aspiring youths or gymnastic young women. At that time he was working so steadily that he had little chance to find out what was going on around Paris. Pretty soon, however, he grew to be known among the trainers and managers began to fix up bouts for him. After one or two successful bouts a little fame began to come into being for him. So it was that after one of the prize-fights, a colored fellow came to his dressing room to congratulate him on his success as well as invite him to go to Montmartre to meet "the boys."
Paul had a way about him and seemed to get on with the colored fellows who lived in Montmartre and when the first Negro jazz band played in a tiny Parisian cafe Paul was among them playing the banjo. Those first years were without event so far as Paul was concerned. The members of that first band often say now that they wonder how it was that nothing happened during those first seven years, for it was generally known how great was Paul's hatred for American white people. I suppose the tranquility in the light of what happened afterwards was due to the fact that  the care in which they worked was one in which mostly French people drank and danced and then too, that was before there were so many Americans visiting Paris. However, everyone had heard Paul speak of his intense hatred of American white folks. It only took two Benedictines to make him start talking about what he would do to the first "Yank" that called him "n-----." But the seven years came to an end and Paul Watson went to work in a larger cafe with a larger band, patronized almost solely by Americans.
I've heard almost every Negro in Montmartre tell about the night that a drunken Kentuckian came into the cafe where Paul was playing and said:
"Look heah, Bruther, what you all doin' ovah heah?" "None ya bizness. And looka here, I ain't your brother, see ?" "Jac, do you heah that n-----talkin' lak that tah me?" As he said this, he turned to speak to his companion. I have often wished that I had been there to have seen the thing happen myself. Every tale I have heard about it was different and yet there was something of truth in each of them. Perhaps the nearest one can come to the truth is by saying that Paul beat up about four full-sized white men that night besides doing a great deal of damage to the furniture about the cafe. I couldn't tell you just what did happen. Some of the fellows say that Paul seized the nearest table and mowed down men right and left, others say he took a bottle, then again the story runs that a chair was the instrument of his fury. At any rate, that started Paul Watson on his seige against the American white person who brings his native prejudices into the life of Paris. 
 It is a verity that Paul was the "black terror." The last syllable of the word, n----, never passed the lips of a white man without the quick reflex action of Paul's arm and fist to the speaker's jaw. He paid for more glassware and cafe furnishings in the course of the next few years than is easily imaginable. And yet, there was something likable about Paul. Perhaps that's the reason that he stood in so well with the policemen of the neighborhood. Always some divine power seemed to intervene in his behalf and he was excused after the payment of a small fine with advice about his future conduct. Finally, there came the night when in a frenzy he shot the two American sailors.
They had not died from the wounds he had given them hence his sentence had not been one of death but rather a long term of imprisonment. It was a pitiable sight to see Paul sitting in the corner of his cell with his great body hunched almost double. He seldom talked and when he did his words were interspersed with oaths about the lowness of "crackers." Then the World War came. It seems strange that anything so horrible as that wholesale slaughter could bring about any good and yet there was something of a smoothing quality about even its baseness. There has never been such equality before or since such as that which the World War brought. Rich men fought by the side of paupers; poets swapped yarns with dry-goods salesmen, while Jews and Christians ate corned beef out of the same tin. Along with the general leveling influence came France's pardon of her prisoners in order that they might enter the army. Paul Watson became free and a French soldier. Because he was strong and had innate daring in his heart he was placed in the aerial squad and cited many times for bravery. The close of the war gave him his place in French society as a hero. With only a memory of the war and an ugly scar on his left cheek he took up his old life. His firm resolutions about American white people still remained intact and many chance encounters that followed the war are told from lip to lip proving that the war and his previous imprisonment had changed him little. He was the same Paul Watson to Montmartre as he shambled up rue Pigalle. Rue Pigalle in the early evening has a sombre beauty-gray as are most Paris streets and otherworldish. To those who know the district it is the Harlem of Paris and rue Pigalle is its dusky Seventh Avenue. Most of the colored musicians, that furnish Parisians and their visitors with entertainment live somewhere in the neighborhood of rue Pigalle. Some time during every day each of these musicians makes a point of passing through rue Pigalle. Little wonder that almost any day will find Paul Watson going his shuffling way up the same street. He reached the corner of rue de la Bruyere and with sure instinct his feet stopped. Without half thinking he turned into "the Pit." Its full name is The Flea Pit. If you should ask one of the musicians why it was so called, he would answer you to the effect that it was called "the pit" because all the "fleas" hang out there. If you did not get the full import of this explanation, he would go further and say that there were always "spades" in the pit and they were as thick as fleas. Unless you could understand this latter attempt at clarity you could not fully grasp what the Flea-Pit means to the Negro musicians in Montmartre. It is a tiny cafe of the genus that is called bistro in France. Here the fiddle players, saxophone blowers, drumbeaters and ivory ticklers gather at four in the afternoon for a porto or a game of billiards. Here the cabaret entertainers and supper musicians meet at one o'clock at night or thereafter for a whiskey and soda, or more billiards. Occasional sandwiches and a "quiet game" also play their parts in the popularity of the place. After a season or two it becomes a settled fact just what time you may catch so-and-so at the famous "Pit." The musicians were very fond of Paul and took particular delight in teasing him. He was one of the chosen few that all of the musicians conceded as being "regular." It was the pet joke of the habitues of the cafe that Paul never bothered with girls. They always said that he could beat up ten men but was scared to death of one woman. "Say fellow, when ya goin' a get hooked up?" "Can't say, Bo. Ain't so much on skirts." "Man alive, ya don't know what you're missin' -somebody little and cute telling ya sweet things in your ear. Paris is full of women folks." "I ain't much on 'em all the same. Then too, they're all white." "What's it to ya? This ain't America." "Can't help that. Get this-I'm collud, see? I ain't got nothing for no white meat to do. If a woman eva called me n----- I'd have to kill her, that's all!" "You for it, son. I can't give you a thing on this Mr. Jefferson Lawd way of lookin' at women. "Oh, tain't that. I guess they're all right for those that wants 'em. Not me!" "Oh you ain't so forty. You'll fall like all the other spades I've ever seen. Your kind falls hardest." And so Paul went his way-alone. He smoked and drank with the fellows and sat for hours in the Montmartre cafes and never knew the companionship of a woman. Then one night after his work he was walking along the street in his queer shuffling way when a woman stepped up to his side. "Voulez vous." "Naw, gowan away from here." "Oh, you speak English, don't you?" "You an 'merican woman?" "Used to be 'fore I went on the stage and got stranded over here." "Well, get away from here. I don't like your kind!"
"Aw, Buddy, don't say that. I ain't prejudiced like some fool women." "You don't know who I am, do you? I'm Paul Watson and I hate American white folks, see?" He pushed her aside and went on walking alone. He hadn't gone far when she caught up to him and said with sobs in her voice: "Oh, Lordy, please don't hate me 'cause I was born white and an American. I ain't got a sou to my name and all the men pass me by cause I ain't spruced up. Now you come along and won't look at me cause I'm white." Paul strode along with her clinging to his arm. He tried to shake her off several times but there was no use. She clung all the more desperately to him. He looked down at her frail body shaken with sobs, and something caught at his heart. Before he knew what he was doing he had said:
"Naw, I ain't that mean. I'll get you some grub. Quit your cryin'. Don't like seein' women folks cry. " It was the talk of Montmartre. Paul Watson takes a woman to Gavarnni's every night for dinner, He comes to the Flea Pit less frequently, thus giving the other musicians plenty of opportunity to discuss him. "How times do change. Paul, the woman-hater, has a Jane now." "You ain't said nothing, fella. That ain't all. She's white and an 'merican, too." "That's the way with these spades. They beat up all the white men they can lay their hands on but as soon as a gang of golden hair with blue eyes rubs up close to them they forget all they ever said about hatin' white folks." "Guess he thinks that skirt's gone on him. Dumb fool!" "Don' be no chineeman. That old gag don' fit for Paul. He cain't understand it no more'n we can. Says he jess can't help himself, everytime she looks up into his eyes and asks him does he love her. They sure are happy together. Paul's goin' to marry her, too. At first she kept saying that she didn't want to get married cause she wasn't the marrying kind and all that talk. Paul jus' laid down the law to her and told her he never would live with no woman without being married to her. Then she began to tell him all about her past life. He told her he didn't care nothing about what she used to be jus' so long as they loved each other now. Guess they'll make it." "Yeah, Paul told me the same tale last night. He's sure gone on her all right." "They're gettin' tied up next Sunday. So glad  it's not me. Don't trust these American dames. Me for the Frenchies." "She ain't so worse for looks, Bud. Now that he's been furnishing the green for the rags." "Yeah, but I don't see no reason for the wedding bells. She was right--she ain't the marrying kind, . . . and so Montmartre talked. In every cafe where the Negro musicians congregated Paul Watson was the topic for conversation. He had suddenly fallen from his place as bronze God to almost less than the dust.
The morning sun made queer patterns on Paul's sleeping face. He grimaced several times in his slumber, then finally half-opened his eyes. After a succession of dream-laden blinks he gave a great yawn, and rubbing his eyes, looked at the open window through which the sun shone brightly. His first conscious thought was that this was the bride's day and that bright sunshine prophesied happiness for the bride throughout her married life. is first impulse was to settle back into the covers and think drowsily about Mary and the queer twists life brings about, as is the wont of most bridgegrooms on their last morning of bachelorhood. He put this impulse aside in favor of dressing quickly and rushing downstairs to telephone to Mary to say "happy wedding day" to her. One huge foot slipped into a worn bedroom slipper and then the other dragged painfully out of the warm bed were the courageous beginnings of his bridal toilette. With a look of triumph he put on his new grey suit that he had ordered from an English tailor. He carefully pulled a taffeta tie into place beneath his chin, noting as he looked at his face in the mirror that the sear he had received in the army was very ugly--funny, marrying an ugly man like him. French telephones are such human faults. After trying for about fifteen minutes to get Central 32.01 he decided that he might as well walk around to Mary's hotel to give his greeting as to stand there in the lobby of his own, wasting his time. He debated this in his mind a great deal. They were to be married at four o'clock. It was eleven now and it did seem a shame not to let her have a minute or two by herself. As be went walking down the street towards her hotel he laughed to think of how one always cogitates over doing something and finally does the thing he wanted to in the beginning anyway.
~
Mud on his nice gray suit that the English tailor had made for him. Damn--gray suit--what did he have a gray suit on for, anyway. Folks with black faces shouldn't wear gray suits. Gawd, but it was funny that time when he beat up that cracker at the Periquet. Fool couldn't shut his mouth he was so surprised. Crackers--damn 'em--he was one n----- that wasn't 'fraid of 'em. Wouldn't he have a hell of a time if he went back to America where black was black. Wasn't white nowhere, black wasn't. What was that thought he was trying to get ahold of--bumping around in his head--something he started to think about but couldn't remember it somehow. The shrill whistle that is typical of the French subway pierced its way into his thoughts. Subway--why was he in the subway--he didn't want to go any place. He heard doors slamming and saw the blue uniforms of the conductors swinging on to the cars as the trains began to pull out of the station. With one or two strides he reached the last coach as it began to move up the platform. A bit out of breath he stood inside the train and looking down atwhat he had in his hand he saw that it was a tiny pink ticket. A first class ticket in a second class coach. The idea set him to laughing. Everyone in the car turned and eyed him, but that did not bother him. Wonder what stop he'd get off--funny how these French said descend when they meant get off--funny he couldn't pick up French--been here so long. First class ticket in a second class coach!--that was one on him. Wedding day today, and that damn letter from Mary. How'd she say it now, "just couldn't go through with it," white women just don't marry colored men, and she was a street woman, too. Why couldn't she have told him flat that she was just getting back on her feet at his expense. Funny that first class ticket he bought, wish he could see Mary--him a-going there to wish her "happy wedding day," too. Wonder what that French woman was looking at him so hard for? Guess it was the mud.

       <collex:text>Smoke, Lilies and Jade
HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING…TO WRITE OR DRAW…OR something…but it was so comfortable just to lay there on the bed…his shoes off…and think…think of everything…short disconnected thoughts…to wonder…to remember…to think and smoke…why wasn’t he worried that he had no money…he had had five cents…but he had been hungry…he was hungry and still…all he wanted to do was…lay there comfortably smoking…think…wishing he were writing…or drawing…or something…something about the things he felt and thought…but what did he think…he remembered how his mother had awakened him one night…ages ago…six years ago…Alex…he had always wondered at the strangeness of it…she had seemed so…so…so just the same…Alex…I think your father is dead…and it hadn’t seemed so strange…yet…one’s mother didn’t say that…didn’t wake one at midnight every night to say…feel him…put your hand on his head…then whisper with a catch in her voice…I’m afraid…ssh don’t wake Lam…yet it hadn’t seemed as it should have seemed…even when he had felt his father’s cool wet forehead…it hadn’t been tragic…the light had been turned very low…and flickered…yet it hadn’t been tragic…or weird…not at all as one should feel when one’s father died…even his reply of…yes he is dead…had been commonplace…hadn’t been dramatic…there had been no tears…no sobs…not even a sorrow…and yet he must have realized that one’s father couldn’t smile…or sing anymore…after he had died…everyone remembered his father’s voice…it had been a lush voice…a promise…then that dressing together…his mother and himself…in the bathroom…why was the bathroom always the warmest room in the winter…as they had put on their clothes…his mother had been telling him what he must do . . and cried softly…and that had made him cry too but you mustn’t cry Alex…remember you have to be a little man now…and that was all…didn’t other wives and sons cry more for their dead than that…anyway people never cried for beautiful sunsets…or music…and those were the things that hurt…the things to sympathize with…then out into the snow and dark of the morning…first to the undertaker’s…no first to Uncle Frank’s…Why did Aunt Lula have to act like that…to ask again and again…but when did he die…when did he die…I just can’t believe it…poor Minerva…then out into the snow and dark again…how had his mother expected him to know where to find the night bell at the undertaker’s…he was the most sensible of them all though…all he had said was…what…Harry Francis…too bad…tell mamma I’ll be there first thing in the morning…then down the deserted streets again…to grandmother’s…it was growing light now…it must be terrible to die in daylight…grandpa had been sweeping the snow off the yard…he had been glad of that because…well he could tell him better than grandma…grandpa…father’s dead…and he hadn’t acted strange either…books lied…he had just looked at Alex a moment then continued sweeping…all he said was…what time did he die…she’ll want to know…then passing through the lonesome street toward home…Mrs. Mamie Grant was closing a window and spied him…hallow Alex…an’ how’s your father this mornin’…dead…get out…tch tch tch an’ I was just around there with a cup a’ custard yesterday…Alex puffed contentedly on his cigarette…he was hungry and comfortable…and he had an ivory holder inlaid with red jade and green…funny how the smoke seemed to climb up that ray of sunlight…went up the slant just like imagination…was imagination blue…or was it because he had spent his last five cents and couldn’t worry…anyway it was nice to lay there and wonder…and remember…why was he so different from other people…the only things he remembered of his father’s funeral were the crowded church and the ride in the hack…so many people there in the church…and ladies with tears in their eyes…and on their cheeks…and some men too…why did people cry...vanity that was all…yet they weren’t exactly hypocrites…but why…it had made him furious…all these people crying…it wasn’t their father…and he wasn’t crying couldn’t cry for sorrow although he had loved his father more than…than…it had made him so angry that tears had come to his eyes…and he had been ashamed of his mother…crying into a handkerchief…so ashamed that tears had run down his cheeks and he had frowned…and some one…a woman…had said…look at that poor little dear…Alex is just like his father…and the tears had run fast…because he wasn’t like his father…he couldn’t sing…he didn’t want to sing…he didn’t want to sing…Alex blew a cloud of smoke…blue smoke…when they had taken his father from the vault three weeks later…he had grown beautiful…his nose had become perfect and clear…his hair had turned jet black and glossy and silky…and his skin was a transparent green…like the sea only not so deep…and where it was drawn over the cheek bones a pale beautiful red appeared…like a blush…why hadn’t his father looked like that always…but no…to have sung would have broken the wondrous repose of his lips and maybe that was his beauty…maybe it was wrong to think thoughts like these…but they were nice and pleasant and comfortable…when one was smoking a cigarette through an ivory holder…inlaid with red jade and green………..
he wondered why he couldn’t find work…a job…when he had first come to New York he had…and he had only been fourteen then…was it because he was nineteen now that he felt so idle…and contented…or because he was an artist…but was he an artist…was one an artist until one became known…of course he was an artist…and strangely enough so were all his friends…he should be ashamed that he didn’t work…but…was it five years in New York…or the fact that he was an artist…when his mother said she couldn’t understand him…why did he vaguely pity her instead of being ashamed…he should be…his mother and all his relatives said so…his brother was three years younger than he and yet he had already been away from home a year…on the stage…making thirty-five dollars a week…had three suits and many clothes and was going to help mother…while he…Alex…was content to lay and smoke and meet friends at night…to argue and read Wilde…Freud…Boccaccio and Schnitzler…to attend Gurdjieff meetings and know things…Why did they scoff at him for knowing such people as Carl…Mencken…Toomer…Hughes…Cullen…Wood…Cabell…oh the whole lot of them…was it because it seemed incongruous that he…who was so little known…should call by first names people they would like to know…were they jealous…no mothers aren’t jealous of their sons…they are proud of them…why then…when these friends accepted and liked him…no matter how he dressed…why did mother ask…and you went looking like that…Langston was a fine fellow…he knew there was something in Alex…and so did Rene and Borgia…and Zora and Clement and Miguel…and…and…and all of them…if he went to see mother she would ask…how do you feel Alex with nothing in your pockets…I don’t see how you can be satisfied…Really you’re a mystery to me…and who you take after…I’m sure I don’t know…none of my brothers were lazy and shiftless…I can never remember the time when they weren’t sending money home and when your father was your age he was supporting a family…where you get your nerve I don’t know…just because you’ve tried to write one or two little poems and stories that no one understands…you seem to think the world owes you a living…you should see by now how much is thought of them…you can’t sell anything…and you won’t do anything to make money…wake up Alex…I don’t know what will become of you……..
it was hard to believe in one’s self after that…did Wilde’s parents or Shelley’s or Goya’s talk to them like that…but it was depressing to think in that vein…Alex stretched and yawned…Max had died…Margaret had died…so had Sonia…Cynthia…Juan-Jose and Harry…all people he had loved…loved one by one and together…and all had died…he never loved a person long before they died…in truth he was tragic…that was a lovely appellation…The Tragic Genius…think…to go through life known as The Tragic Genius…romantic…but it was more or less true…Alex turned over and blew another cloud of smoke…was all life like that…smoke…blue smoke from an ivory holder…he wished he were in New Bedford…New Bedford was a nice place…snug little houses set complacently behind protecting lawns…half open windows showing prim interiors from behind waving cool curtains…inviting…like precise courtesans winking from behind lace fans…and trees…many trees…casting lacy patterns of shade on the sun dipped sidewalks…small stores…naively proud of their pseudo grandeur…banks…called institutions for saving…all naive…that was it…New Bedford was naive…after the sophistication of New York it would fan one like a refreshing breeze…and yet he had returned to New York…and sophistication…was he sophisticated…no because he was seldom bored…seldom bored by anything…and weren’t the sophisticated continually suffering from ennui…on the contrary…he was amused…amused by the artificiality of naiveté and sophistication alike…but maybe that in itself was the essence of sophistication or…was it cynicism…or were the two identical…he blew a cloud of smoke…it was growing dark now…and the smoke no longer had a ladder to climb…but soon the moon would rise and then he would clothe the silver moon in blue smoke garments…truly smoke was like imagination……..
Alex sat up…pulled on his shoes and went out…it was a beautiful night…and so large…the dusky blue hung like a curtain in an immense arched doorway…fastened with silver tacks…to wander in the night was wonderful…myriads of inquisitive lights…curiously prying into the dark…and fading unsatisfied…he passed a woman…she was not beautiful…and he was sad because she did not weep that she would never be beautiful…was it Wilde who had said…a cigarette is the most perfect pleasure because it leaves one unsatisfied…the breeze gave to him a perfume stolen from some wandering lady of the evening…it pleased him…why was it that men wouldn’t use perfumes. . . they should…each and every one of them liked perfumes…the man who denied that was a liar…or a coward…but if ever he were to voice that thought…express it…he would be misunderstood…a fine feeling that…to be misunderstood…it made him feel tragic and great…but maybe it would be nicer to be understood…but no…no great artist is…then again neither were fools…they were strangely akin these two…Alex thought of a sketch he would make…a personality sketch of Fania…straight classic features tinted proud purple…sensuous fine lips…gilded for truth…eyes…half opened and lids colored mysterious green…hair black and straight…drawn sternly mocking back from the false puritanical forehead…maybe he would make Edith too…skin a blue…infinite like night…and eyes…slant and gray…very complacent like a cat’s…Mona Lisa lips…red and seductive as…as pomegranate juice…in truth it was fine to be young and hungry and an artist…to blow blue smoke from an ivory holder……..
here was the cafeteria…it was almost as though it had journeyed to meet him…the night was so blue…how does blue feel…or red or gold or any other color…if colors could be heard he could paint most wondrous tunes…symphonious…think…the dulcet clear tone of a blue like night…of a red like pomegranate juice…like Edith’s lips…of the fairy tones to be heard in a sunset…like rubies shaken in a crystal cup…of the symphony of Fania…and silver…and gold…he had heard the sound of gold…but they weren’t the sounds he wanted to catch…no…they must be liquid…not so staccato but flowing variations of the same caliber…there was no one in the cafe as yet…he sat and waited…that was a clever idea he had had about color music…but after all he was a monstrous clever fellow…Jurgen had said that…funny how characters in books said the things one wanted to say…he would like to know Jurgen…how does one go about getting an introduction to a fiction character…go up to the brown cover of the book and knock gently…and say hello…then timidly…is Duke Jurgen there…or…no because if one entered the book in the beginning Jurgen would only be a pawn broker…and one didn’t enter a book in the center…but what foolishness…Alex lit a cigarette…but Cabell was a master to have written Jurgen…and an artist…and a poet…Alex blew a cloud of smoke…a few lines of one of Langston’s poems came to describe Jurgen…..
Somewhat like Ariel
Somewhat like Puck
Somewhat like a gutter boy
Who loves to play in muck.
Somewhat like Bacchus
Somewhat like Pan
And a way with women
Like a sailor man……..
[Editor's Note: Full poem by Langston Hughes here]
Langston must have known Jurgen…suppose Jurgen had met Tonio Kroeger…what a vagrant thought…Kroeger…Kroeger…Kroeger…why here was Rene…Alex had almost gone to sleep…Alex blew a cone of smoke as he took Rene’s hand…it was nice to have friends like Rene…so comfortable…Rene was speaking…Borgia joined them…and de Diego Padro…their talk veered to…James Branch Cabell…beautiful…marvelous…Rene had an enchanting accent…said sank for thank and souse for south…but they couldn’t know Cabell’s greatness…Alex searched the smoke for expression…he…he…well he has created a fantasy mire…that’s it…from clear rich imagery…life and silver sands…that’s nice…and silver sands…imagine lilies growing in such a mire…when they close at night their gilded underside would protect…but that’s not it at all…his thoughts just carried and mingled like…like odors…suggested but never definite…Rene was leaving…they all were leaving…Alex sauntered slowly back…the houses all looked sleepy…funny…made him feel like writing poetry…and about death too…an elevated crashed by overhead scattering all his thoughts with its noise…making them spread…in circles…then larger circles…just like a splash in a calm pool…what had he been thinking…of…a poem about death…but he no longer felt that urge…just walk and think and wonder…think and remember and smoke…blow smoke that mixed with his thoughts and the night…he would like to live in a large white palace…to wear a long black cape…very full and lined with vermilion…to have many cushions and to lie there among them…talking to his friends…lie there in a yellow silk shirt and black velvet trousers…like music-review artists talking and pouring strange liquors from curiously beautiful bottles…bottles with long slender necks…he climbed the noisy stair of the odorous tenement…smelled of fish…of stale fried fish and dirty milk bottles…he rather liked it…he liked the acrid smell of horse manure too…strong…thoughts…yes to lie back among strangely fashioned cushions and sip eastern wines and talk…Alex threw himself on the bed. . . removed his shoes…stretched and relaxed…yes and have music waft softly into the darkened and incensed room…he blew a cloud of smoke…oh the joy of being an artist and of blowing blue smoke through an ivory holder inlaid with red jade and green…
* * * * *
the street was so long and narrow…so long and narrow…and blue…in the distance it reached the stars…and if he walked long enough . . .far enough…he could reach the stars too…the narrow blue was so empty…quiet…Alex walked music…it was nice to walk in the blue after a party…Zora had shone again…her stories…she always shone…and Monty was glad…everyone was glad when Zora shone…he was glad he had gone to Monty’s party…Monty had a nice place in the village…nice lights…and friends and wine…mother would be scandalized that he could think of going to a party…without a copper to his name…but then mother had never been to Monty’s…and mother had never seen the street seem long and narrow and blue…Alex walked music…the click of his heels kept time with a tune in his mind…he glanced into a lighted cafe window…inside were people sipping coffee…men…why did they sit there in the loud light…didn’t they know that outside the street…the narrow blue street met the stars…that if they walked long enough…far enough…Alex walked and the click of his heels sounded…and had an echo…sound being tossed back and forth…back and forth…someone was approaching…and their echoes mingled . . .and gave the sound of castanets…Alex liked the sound of the approaching man’s footsteps…he walked music also…he knew the beauty of the narrow blue…Alex knew that by the way their echoes mingled…he wished he would speak…but strangers don’t speak at four o’clock in the morning…at least if they did he couldn’t imagine what would be said…maybe pardon me but are you walking toward the stars. . . yes, sir, and if you walk long enough…then may I walk with you I want to reach the stars too…perdone me señor tiene usted fósforo…Alex was glad he had been addressed in Spanish…to have been asked for a match in English…or to have been addressed in English at all…would have been blasphemy just then…Alex handed him a match…he glanced at his companion apprehensively in the match glow…he was afraid that his appearance would shatter the blue thoughts…and stars…ah…his face was a perfect compliment to his voice…and the echo of their steps mingled…they walked in silence…the castanets of their heels clicking accompaniment…the stranger inhaled deeply and with a nod of content and a smile…blew a cloud of smoke…Alex felt like singing…the stranger knew the magic of blue smoke also…they continued in silence…the castanets of their heels clicking rhythmically…Alex turned in his doorway…up the stairs and the stranger waited for him to light the room…no need for words…they had always known each other……..
as they undressed by the blue dawn…Alex knew he had never seen a more perfect being…his body was all symmetry and music…and Alex called him Beauty…long they lay…blowing smoke and exchanging thoughts…and Alex swallowed with difficulty…he felt a glow of tremor…and they talked and…slept…
Alex wondered more and more why he liked Adrian so…he liked many people…Wallie…Zora…Clement…Gloria…Langston…John… Gwenny…oh many people…and they were friends…but Beauty…it was different…once Alex had admired Beauty’s strength…and Beauty’s eyes had grown soft and he had said…I like you more than anyone Dulce…Adrian always called him Dulce…and Alex had become confused…was it that he was so susceptible to beauty that Alex liked Adrian so much…but no…he knew other people who were beautiful…Fania and Gloria…Monty and Bunny…but he was never confused before them…while Beauty…Beauty could make him believe in Buddha…or imps…and no one else could do that…that is no one but Melva…but then he was in love with Melva…and that explained that…he would like Beauty to know Melva…they were both so perfect…such compliments…yes he would like Beauty to know Melva because he loved them both…there…he had thought it…actually dared to think it…but Beauty must never know…Beauty couldn’t understand…indeed Alex couldn’t understand…and it pained him…almost physically…and tired his mind…Beauty…Beauty was in the air…the smoke…Beauty…Melva…Beauty…Melva…Alex slept…and dreamed……
he was in a field…a field of blue smoke and black poppies and red calla lilies…he was searching…on his hands and knees…searching…among black poppies and red calla lilies…he was searching and pushed aside poppy stems…and saw two strong white legs…dancer’s legs…the contours pleased him…his eyes wandered…on past the muscular hocks to the firm white thighs…the rounded buttocks…then the lithe narrow waist…strong torso and broad deep chest…the heavy shoulders…the graceful muscled neck…squared chin and quizzical lips…Grecian nose with its temperamental nostrils…the brown eyes looking at him…like…Monty looked at Zora…his hair curly and black and all tousled…and it was Beauty…and Beauty smiled and looked at him and smiled…said…I’ll wait Alex…and Alex became confused and continued his search…on his hands and knees…pushing aside poppy stems and lily stems…a poppy…a black poppy…a lily…a red lily…and when he looked back he could no longer see Beauty…Alex continued his search…through poppies…lilies…poppies and red calla lilies…and suddenly he saw…two small feet olive-ivory…two well turned legs curving gracefully from slender ankles…and the contours soothed him…he followed them…past the narrow rounded hips to the tiny waist…the fragile firm breasts…the graceful slender throat…the soft rounded chin…slightly parting lips and straight little nose with its slightly flaring nostrils …the black eyes with lights in them…looking at him…the forehead and straight cut black hair…and it was Melva…and she looked at him and smiled and said…I’ll wait Alex…and Alex became confused and kissed her…became confused and continued his search…on his hands and knees…pushed aside a poppy stem…a black-poppy stem…pushed aside a lily stem…a red-lily stem…a poppy…a poppy…a lily…and suddenly he stood erect… exultant…and in his hand he held…an ivory holder…inlaid with red jade . . .and green……..
and Alex awoke…Beauty’s hair tickled his nose …Beauty was smiling in his sleep…half his face stained flush color by the sun…the other half in shadow…blue shadow…his eyelashes casting cobwebby blue shadows on his cheek…his lips were so beautiful…quizzical…Alex wondered why he always thought of that passage from Wilde’s Salome…when he looked at Beauty’s lips…I would kiss your lips…he would like to kiss Beauty’s lips…Alex flushed warm…with shame…or was it shame…he reached across Beauty for a cigarette…Beauty’s cheek felt cool to his arm…his hair felt soft…Alex lay smoking…such a dream…red calla lilies…red calla lilies…and…what could it all mean…did dreams have meanings… Fania said…and black poppies…thousands…millions…Beauty stirred…Alex put out his cigarette…closed his eyes…he mustn’t see Beauty yet…speak to him…his lips were too hot…dry…the palms of his hands too cool and moist…through his half-closed eyes he could see Beauty…propped…cheek in hand…on one elbow…looking at him…lips smiling quizzically…he wished Beauty wouldn’t look so hard…Alex was finding it difficult to breathe…breathe normally…why must Beauty look so long…and smile that way…his face seemed nearer…it was…Alex could feel Beauty’s hair on his forehead…breathe normally…breathe normally…could feel Beauty’s breath on his nostrils and lips…and it was clean and faintly colored with tobacco…breathe normally Alex…Beauty’s lips were nearer…Alex closed his eyes…how did one act…his pulse was hammering…from wrists to finger tip…wrist to finger tip…Beauty’s lips touched his…his temples throbbed…throbbed…his pulse hammered from wrist to finger tip…Beauty’s breath came short now…softly staccato…breathe normally Alex…you are asleep…Beauty’s lips touched his…breathe normally…and pressed…pressed hard…cool…his body trembled…breathe normally Alex…Beauty’s lips pressed cool…cool and hard…how much pressure does it take to waken one…Alex sighed…moved softly…how does one act…Beauty’s hair barely touched him now…his breath was faint on…Alex’s nostrils and lips. . . Alex stretched and opened his eyes…Beauty was looking at him…propped on one elbow…cheek in his palm…Beauty spoke…scratch my head please Dulce…Alex was breathing normally now…propped against the bed head…Beauty’s head in his lap…Beauty spoke…I wonder why I like to look at some things Dulce…things like smoke and cats…and you…Alex’s pulse no longer hammered from…wrist to finger tip…wrist to finger tip…the rose dusk had become blue night…and soon…soon they would go out into the blue……..

It was eleven o’clock of a Spring night in Florida. It was Sunday. Any other night, Delia Jones would have been in bed for two hours by this time. But she was a wash-woman, and Monday morning meant a great deal to her. So she collected the soiled clothes on Saturday when she returned the clean things. Sunday night after church, she sorted them and put the white things to soak. It saved her almost a half day’s start. A great hamper in the bedroom held the clothes that she brought home. It was so much neater than a number of bundles lying around.
She squatted in the kitchen floor beside the great pile of clothes, sorting them into small heaps according to color, and humming a song in a mournful key, but wondering through it all where Sykes, her husband, had gone with her horse and buckboard.
Just then something long, round, limp and black fell upon her shoulders and slithered to the floor beside her. A great terror took hold of her. It softened her knees and dried her mouth so that it was a full minute before she could cry out or move. Then she saw that it was the big bull whip her husband liked to carry when he drove.
She lifted her eyes to the door and saw him standing there bent over with laughter at her fright. She screamed at him.
“Sykes, what you throw dat whip on me like dat? You know it would skeer me–looks just like a snake, an’ you knows how skeered Ah is of snakes.”
“Course Ah knowed it! That’s how come Ah done it.” He slapped his leg with his hand and almost rolled on the ground in his mirth. “If you such a big fool dat you got to have a fit over a earth worm or a string, Ah don’t keer how bad Ah skeer you.”
“You aint got no business doing it. Gawd knows it’s a sin. Some day Ah’m goin’ tuh drop dead from some of yo’ foolishness. ‘Nother thing, where you been wid mah rig? Ah feeds dat pony. He aint fuh you to be drivin’ wid no bull whip.”
“You sho is one aggravatin’ n------ woman!” he declared and stepped into the room. She resumed her work and did not answer him at once. “Ah done tole you time and again to keep them white folks’ clothes outa dis house.”
He picked up the whip and glared down at her. Delia went on with her work. She went out into the yard and returned with a galvanized tub and set it on the washbench. She saw that Sykes had kicked all of the clothes together again, and now stood in her way truculently, his whole manner hoping, praying, for an argument. But she walked calmly around him and commenced to re-sort the things.
“Next time, Ah’m gointer kick ’em outdoors,” he threatened as he struck a match along the leg of his corduroy breeches.
Delia never looked up from her work, and her thin, stooped shoulders sagged further.
“Ah aint for no fuss t’night Sykes. Ah just come from taking sacrament at the church house.”
He snorted scornfully. “Yeah, you just come from de church house on a Sunday night, but heah you is gone to work on them clothes. You ain’t nothing but a hypocrite. One of them amen-corner Christians–sing, whoop, and shout, then come home and wash white folks clothes on the Sabbath.”
He stepped roughly upon the whitest pile of things, kicking them helter-skelter as he crossed the room. His wife gave a little scream of dismay, and quickly gathered them together again.
“Sykes, you quit grindin’ dirt into these clothes! How can Ah git through by Sat’day if Ah don’t start on Sunday?”
“Ah don’t keer if you never git through. Anyhow, Ah done promised Gawd and a couple of other men, Ah aint gointer have it in mah house. Don’t gimme no lip neither, else Ah’ll throw ’em out and put mah fist up side yo’ head to boot.”
Delia’s habitual meekness seemed to slip from her shoulders like a blown scarf. She was on her feet; her poor little body, her bare knuckly hands bravely defying the strapping hulk before her.
“Looka heah, Sykes, you done gone too fur. Ah been married to you fur fifteen years, and Ah been takin’ in washin’ for fifteen years. Sweat, sweat, sweat! Work and sweat, cry and sweat, pray and sweat!”
“What’s that got to do with me?” he asked brutally.
“What’s it got to do with you, Sykes? Mah tub of suds is filled yo’ belly with vittles more times than yo’ hands is filled it. Mah sweat is done paid for this house and Ah reckon Ah kin keep on sweatin’ in it.”
She seized the iron skillet from the stove and struck a defensive pose, which act surprised him greatly, coming from her. It cowed him and he did not strike her as he usually did.
“Naw you won’t,” she panted, “that ole snaggle-toothed black woman you runnin’ with aint comin’ heah to pile up on mah sweat and blood. You aint paid for nothin’ on this place, and Ah’m gointer stay right heah till Ah’m toted out foot foremost.”
“Well, you better quit gittin’ me riled up, else they’ll be totin’ you out sooner than you expect. Ah’m so tired of you Ah don’t know whut to do. Gawd! how Ah hates skinny wimmen!”
A little awed by this new Delia, he sidled out of the door and slammed the back gate after him. He did not say where he had gone, but she knew too well. She knew very well that he would not return until nearly daybreak also. Her work over, she went on to bed but not to sleep at once. Things had come to a pretty pass!
She lay awake, gazing upon the debris that cluttered their matrimonial trail. Not an image left standing along the way. Anything like flowers had long ago been drowned in the salty stream that had been pressed from her heart. Her tears, her sweat, her blood. She had brought love to the union and he had brought a longing after the flesh. Two months after the wedding, he had given her the first brutal beating. She had the memory of his numerous trips to Orlando with all of his wages when he had returned to her penniless, even before the first year had passed. She was young and soft then, but now she thought of her knotty, muscled limbs, her harsh knuckly hands, and drew herself up into an unhappy little ball in the middle of the big feather bed. Too late now to hope for love, even if it were not Bertha it would be someone else. This case differed from the others only in that she was bolder than the others. Too late for everything except her little home. She had built it for her old days, and planted one by one the trees and flowers there. It was lovely to her, lovely.
Somehow, before sleep came, she found herself saying aloud: “Oh well, whatever goes over the Devil’s back, is got to come under his belly. Sometime or ruther, Sykes, like everybody else, is gointer reap his sowing.” After that she was able to build a spiritual earthworks against her husband. His shells could no longer reach her. Amen. She went to sleep and slept until he announced his presence in bed by kicking her feet and rudely snatching the covers away.
“Gimme some kivah heah, an’ git yo’ damn foots over on yo’ own side! Ah oughter mash you in yo’ mouf fuh drawing dat skillet on me.”
Delia went clear to the rail without answering him. A triumphant indifference to all that he was or did.
*****
The week was as full of work for Delia as all other weeks, and Saturday found her behind her little pony, collecting and delivering clothes.
It was a hot, hot day near the end of July. The village men on Joe Clarke’s porch even chewed cane listlessly. They did not hurl the cane-knots as usual. They let them dribble over the edge of the porch. Even conversation had collapsed under the heat.
“Heah come Delia Jones,” Jim Merchant said, as the shaggy pony came ’round the bend of the road toward them. The rusty buckboard was heaped with baskets of crisp, clean laundry.
“Yep,” Joe Lindsay agreed. “Hot or col’, rain or shine, jes ez reg’lar ez de weeks roll roun’ Delia carries ’em an’ fetches ’em on Sat’day.”
“She better if she wanter eat,” said Moss. “Syke Jones aint wuth de shot an’ powder hit would tek tuh kill ’em. Not to huh he aint. ”
“He sho’ aint,” Walter Thomas chimed in. “It’s too bad, too, cause she wuz a right pritty lil trick when he got huh. Ah’d uh mah’ied huh mahseff if he hadnter beat me to it.”
Delia nodded briefly at the men as she drove past.
“Too much knockin’ will ruin any ‘oman. He done beat huh ‘nough tuh kill three women, let ‘lone change they looks,” said Elijah Moseley. “How Syke kin stommuck dat big black greasy Mogul he’s layin’ roun wid, gits me. Ah swear dat eight-rock couldn’t kiss a sardine can Ah done throwed out de back do’ ‘way las’ yeah.”
“Aw, she’s fat, thass how come. He’s allus been crazy ’bout fat women,” put in Merchant. “He’d a’ been tied up wid one long time ago if he could a’ found one tuh have him. Did Ah tell yuh ’bout him come sidlin’ roun’ mah wife–bringin’ her a basket uh pecans outa his yard fuh a present? Yessir, mah wife! She tol’ him tuh take ’em right straight back home, cause Delia works so hard ovah dat washtub she reckon everything on de place taste lak sweat an’ soapsuds. Ah jus’ wisht Ah’d a’ caught ‘im ‘dere! Ah’d a’ made his hips ketch on fiah down dat shell road.”
“Ah know he done it, too. Ah sees ‘im grinnin’ at every ‘oman dat passes,” Walter Thomas said. “But even so, he useter eat some mighty big hunks uh humble pie tuh git dat lil ‘oman he got. She wuz ez pritty ez a speckled pup! Dat wuz fifteen yeahs ago. He useter be so skeered uh losin’ huh, she could make him do some parts of a husband’s duty. Dey never wuz de same in de mind.”
“There oughter be a law about him,” said Lindsay. “He aint fit tuh carry guts tuh a bear.”
Clarke spoke for the first time. “Taint no law on earth dat kin make a man be decent if it aint in ‘im. There’s plenty men dat takes a wife lak dey do a joint uh sugar-cane. It’s round, juicy an’ sweet when dey gits it. But dey squeeze an’ grind, squeeze an’ grind an’ wring tell dey wring every drop uh pleasure dat’s in ’em out. When dey’s satisfied dat dey is wrung dry, dey treats ’em jes lak dey do a cane-chew. Dey throws em away. Dey knows whut dey is doin’ while dey is at it, an’ hates theirselves fuh it but they keeps on hangin’ after huh tell she’s empty. Den dey hates huh fuh bein’ a cane-chew an’ in de way.”
“We oughter take Syke an’ dat stray ‘oman uh his’n down in Lake Howell swamp an’ lay on de rawhide till they cain’t say Lawd a’ mussy.’ He allus wuz uh ovahbearin’ niggah, but since dat white ‘oman from up north done teached ‘im how to run a automobile, he done got too biggety to live–an’ we oughter kill ‘im,” Old Man Anderson advised.
A grunt of approval went around the porch. But the heat was melting their civic virtue, and Elijah Moseley began to bait Joe Clarke.
“Come on, Joe, git a melon outa dere an’ slice it up for yo’ customers. We’se all sufferin’ wid de heat. De bear’s done got me!”
“Thass right, Joe, a watermelon is jes’ whut Ah needs tuh cure de eppizudicks,” Walter Thomas joined forces with Moseley. “Come on dere, Joe. We all is steady customers an’ you aint set us up in a long time. Ah chooses dat long, bowlegged Floridy favorite.”
“A god, an’ be dough. You all gimme twenty cents and slice way,” Clarke retorted. “Ah needs a col’ slice m’self. Heah, everybody chip in. Ah’ll lend y’ll mah meat knife.”
The money was quickly subscribed and the huge melon brought forth. At that moment, Sykes and Bertha arrived. A determined silence fell on the porch and the melon was put away again.
Merchant snapped down the blade of his jackknife and moved toward the store door.
“Come on in, Joe, an’ gimme a slab uh sow belly an’ uh pound uh coffee–almost fuhgot ’twas Sat’day. Got to git on home.” Most of the men left also.
Just then Delia drove past on her way home, as Sykes was ordering magnificently for Bertha. It pleased him for Delia to see.
“Git whutsoever yo’ heart desires, Honey. Wait a minute, Joe. Give huh two bottles uh strawberry soda-water, uh quart uh parched ground-peas, an’ a block uh chewin’ gum.”
With all this they left the store, with Sykes reminding Bertha that this was his town and she could have it if she wanted it.
The men returned soon after they left, and held their watermelon feast.
“Where did Syke Jones git da ‘oman from nohow?” Lindsay asked.
“Ovah Apopka. Guess dey musta been cleanin’ out de town when she lef’. She don’t look lak a thing but a hunk uh liver wid hair on it.”
“Well, she sho’ kin squall,” Dave Carter contributed. “When she gits ready tuh laff, she jes’ opens huh mouf an’ latches it back tuh de las’ notch. No ole grandpa alligator down in Lake Bell ain’t got nothin’ on huh.”
*****
Bertha had been in town three months now. Sykes was still paying her room rent at Della Lewis’–the only house in town that would have taken her in. Sykes took her frequently to Winter Park to “stomps.” He still assured her that he was the swellest man in the state.
“Sho’ you kin have dat lil’ ole house soon’s Ah kin git dat ‘oman outa dere. Everything b’longs tuh me an’ you sho’ kin have it. Ah sho’ ‘bominates uh skinny ‘oman. Lawdy, you sho’ is got one portly shape on you! You kin git anything you wants. Dis is mah town an’ you sho’ kin have it.”
Delia’s work-worn knees crawled over the earth in Gethsemane and up the rocks of Calvary many, many times during these months. She avoided the villagers and meeting places in her efforts to be blind and deaf. But Bertha nullified this to a degree, by coming to Delia’s house to call Sykes out to her at the gate.
Delia and Sykes fought all the time now with no peaceful interludes. They slept and ate in silence. Two or three times Delia had attempted a timid friendliness, but she was repulsed each time. It was plain that the breaches must remain agape.
The sun had burned July to August. The heat streamed down like a million hot arrows, smiting all things living upon the earth. Grass withered, leaves browned, snakes went blind in shedding and men and dogs went mad. Dog days!
Delia came home one day and found Sykes there before her. She wondered, but started to go on into the house without speaking, even though he was standing in the kitchen door and she must either stoop under his arm or ask him to move. He made no room for her. She noticed a soap box beside the steps, but paid no particular attention to it, knowing that he must have brought it there. As she was stooping to pass under his outstretched arm, he suddenly pushed her backward, laughingly.
“Look in de box dere Delia, Ah done brung yuh somethin’!”
She nearly fell upon the box in her stumbling, and when she saw what it held, she all but fainted outright.
“Syke! Syke, mah Gawd! You take dat rattlesnake ‘way from heah! You gottuh. Oh, Jesus, have mussy!”
“Ah aint gut tuh do nuthin’ uh de kin’–fact is Ah aint got tuh do nothin’ but die. Taint no use uh you puttin’ on airs makin’ out lak you skeered uh dat snake–he’s gointer stay right heah tell he die. He wouldn’t bite me cause Ah knows how tuh handle ‘im. Nohow he wouldn’t risk breakin’ out his fangs ‘gin yo’ skinny laigs.”
“Naw, now Syke, don’t keep dat thing ‘roun’ heah tuh skeer me tuh death. You knows Ah’m even feared uh earth worms. Thass de biggest snake Ah evah did see. Kill ‘im Syke, please.”
“Doan ast me tuh do nothin’ fuh yuh. Goin’ roun’ trying’ tuh be so damn asterperious. Naw, Ah aint gonna kill it. Ah think uh damn sight mo’ uh him dan you! Dat’s a nice snake an’ anybody doan lak ‘im kin jes’ hit de grit.”
The village soon heard that Sykes had the snake, and came to see and ask questions.
“How de hen-fire did you ketch dat six-foot rattler, Syke?” Thomas asked.
“He’s full uh frogs so he caint hardly move, thass how. Ah eased up on ‘m. But Ah’m a snake charmer an’ knows how tuh handle ’em. Shux, dat aint nothin’. Ah could ketch one eve’y day if Ah so wanted tuh.”
“Whut he needs is a heavy hick’ry club leaned real heavy on his head. Dat’s de bes ‘way tuh charm a rattlesnake.”
“Naw, Walt, y’ll jes’ don’t understand dese diamon’ backs lak Ah do,” said Sykes in a superior tone of voice.
The village agreed with Walter, but the snake stayed on. His box remained by the kitchen door with its screen wire covering. Two or three days later it had digested its meal of frogs and literally came to life. It rattled at every movement in the kitchen or the yard. One day as Delia came down the kitchen steps she saw his chalky-white fangs curved like scimitars hung in the wire meshes. This time she did not run away with averted eyes as usual. She stood for a long time in the doorway in a red fury that grew bloodier for every second that she regarded the creature that was her torment.
That night she broached the subject as soon as Sykes sat down to the table.
“Syke, Ah wants you tuh take dat snake ‘way fum heah. You done starved me an’ Ah put up widcher, you done beat me an Ah took dat, but you done kilt all mah insides bringin’ dat varmint heah.”
Sykes poured out a saucer full of coffee and drank it deliberately before he answered her.
“A whole lot Ah keer ’bout how you feels inside uh out. Dat snake aint goin’ no damn wheah till Ah gits ready fuh ‘im tuh go. So fur as beatin’ is concerned, yuh aint took near all dat you gointer take ef yuh stay ‘roun’ me.”
Delia pushed back her plate and got up from the table. “Ah hates you, Sykes,” she said calmly. “Ah hates you tuh de same degree dat Ah useter love yuh. Ah done took an’ took till mah belly is full up tuh mah neck. Dat’s de reason Ah got mah letter fum de church an’ moved mah membership tuh Woodbridge–so Ah don’t haf tuh take no sacrament wid yuh. Ah don’t wantuh see yuh ‘roun’ me atall. Lay ‘roun’ wid dat ‘oman all yuh wants tuh, but gwan ‘way fum me an’ mah house. Ah hates yuh lak uh suck-egg dog.”
Sykes almost let the huge wad of corn bread and collard greens he was chewing fall out of his mouth in amazement. He had a hard time whipping himself up to the proper fury to try to answer Delia.
“Well, Ah’m glad you does hate me. Ah’m sho’ tiahed uh you hangin’ ontuh me. Ah don’t want yuh. Look at yuh stringey ole neck! Yo’ rawbony laigs an’ arms is enough tuh cut uh man tuh death. You looks jes’ lak de devvul’s doll-baby tuh me. You cain’t hate me no worse dan Ah hates you. Ah been hatin’ you fuh years.”
“Yo’ ole black hide don’t look lak nothin’ tuh me, but uh passle uh wrinkled up rubber, wid yo’ big ole yeahs flappin’ on each side lak uh paih uh buzzard wings. Don’t think Ah’m gointuh be run ‘way fum mah house neither. Ah’m goin’ tuh de white folks bout you, mah young man, de very nex’ time you lay yo’ han’s on me. Mah cup is done run ovah.” Delia said this with no signs of fear and Sykes departed from the house, threatening her, but made not the slightest move to carry out any of them.
That night he did not return at all, and the next day being Sunday, Delia was glad she did not have to quarrel before she hitched up her pony and drove the four miles to Woodbridge.
She stayed to the night service–“love feast”–which was very warm and full of spirit. In the emotional winds her domestic trials were borne far and wide so that she sang as she drove homeward.
“Jurden water, black an’ col’
Chills de body, not de soul
An’ Ah wantah cross Jurden in uh calm time.”
She came from the barn to the kitchen door and stopped.
“Whut’s de mattah, ol’ satan, you aint kickin’ up yo’ racket?” She addressed the snake’s box. Complete silence. She went on into the house with a new hope in its birth struggles. Perhaps her threat to go to the white folks had frightened Sykes! Perhaps he was sorry! Fifteen years of misery and suppression had brought Delia to the place where she would hope anything that looked towards a way over or through her wall of inhibitions.
She felt in the match safe behind the stove at once for a match. There was only one there.
“Dat niggah wouldn’t fetch nothin’ heah tuh save his rotten neck, but he kin run thew whut Ah brings quick enough. Now he done toted off nigh on tuh haff uh box uh matches. He done had dat ‘oman heah in mah house, too.”
Nobody but a woman could tell how she knew this even before she struck the match. But she did and it put her into a new fury.
Presently she brought in the tubs to put the white things to soak. This time she decided she need not bring the hamper out of the bedroom; she would go in there and do the sorting. She picked up the pot-bellied lamp and went in. The room was small and the hamper stood hard by the foot of the white iron bed. She could sit and reach through the bedposts–resting as she worked.
“Ah wantah cross Jurden in uh calm time,” she was singing again. The mood of the “love feast” had returned. She threw back the lid of the basket almost gaily. Then, moved by both horror and terror, she sprang back toward the door. There lay the snake in the basket! He moved sluggishly at first, but even as she turned round and round, jumped up and down in an insanity of fear, he began to stir vigorously. She saw him pouring his awful beauty from the basket upon the bed, then she seized the lamp and ran as fast as she could to the kitchen. The wind from the open door blew out the light and the darkness added to her terror. She sped to the darkness of the yard, slamming the door after her before she thought to set down the lamp. She did not feel safe even on the ground, so she climbed up in the hay barn.
There for an hour or more she lay sprawled upon the hay a gibbering wreck.
Finally, she grew quiet, and after that, coherent thought. With this, stalked through her a cold, bloody rage. Hours of this. A period of introspection, a space of retrospection, then a mixture of both. Out of this an awful calm.
“Well, Ah done de bes’ Ah could. If things aint right, Gawd knows taint mah fault.”
She went to sleep–a twitch sleep–and woke up to a faint gray sky. There was a loud hollow sound below. She peered out. Sykes was at the wood-pile, demolishing a wire-covered box.
He hurried to the kitchen door, but hung outside there some minutes before he entered, and stood some minutes more inside before he closed it after him.
The gray in the sky was spreading. Delia descended without fear now, and crouched beneath the low bedroom window. The drawn shade shut out the dawn, shut in the night. But the thin walls held back no sound.
“Dat ol’ scratch is woke up now!” She mused at the tremendous whirr inside, which every woodsman knows, is one of the sound illusions. The rattler is a ventriloquist. His whirr sounds to the right, to the left, straight ahead, behind, close under foot–everywhere but where it is. Woe to him who guesses wrong unless he is prepared to hold up his end of the argument! Sometimes he strikes without rattling at all.
Inside, Sykes heard nothing until he knocked a pot lid off the stove while trying to reach the match safe in the dark. He had emptied his pockets at Bertha’s.
The snake seemed to wake up under the stove and Sykes made a quick leap into the bedroom. In spite of the gin he had had, his head was clearing now.
“‘Mah Gawd!” he chattered, “ef Ah could on’y strack uh light!”
The rattling ceased for a moment as he stood paralyzed. He waited. It seemed that the snake waited also.
“Oh, fuh de light! Ah thought he’d be too sick”–Sykes was muttering to himself when the whirr began again, closer, right underfoot this time. Long before this, Sykes’ ability to think had been flattened down to primitive instinct and he leaped–onto the bed.
Outside Delia heard a cry that might have come from a maddened chimpanzee, a stricken gorilla. All the terror, all the horror, all the rage that man possibly could express, without a recognizable human sound.
A tremendous stir inside there, another series of animal screams, the intermittent whirr of the reptile. The shade torn violently down from the window, letting in the red dawn, a huge brown hand seizing the window stick, great dull blows upon the wooden floor punctuating the gibberish of sound long after the rattle of the snake had abruptly subsided. All this Delia could see and hear from her place beneath the window, and it made her ill. She crept over to the four-o’clocks and stretched herself on the cool earth to recover.
She lay there. “Delia. Delia!” She could hear Sykes calling in a most despairing tone as one who expected no answer. The sun crept on up, and he called. Delia could not move–her legs were gone flabby. She never moved, he called, and the sun kept rising.
“Mah Gawd!” She heard him moan, “Mah Gawd fum Heben!” She heard him stumbling about and got up from her flower-bed. The sun was growing warm. As she approached the door she heard him call out hopefully, “Delia, is dat you Ah heah?”
She saw him on his hands and knees as soon as she reached the door. He crept an inch or two toward her–all that he was able, and she saw his horribly swollen neck and his one open eye shining with hope. A surge of pity too strong to support bore her away from that eye that must, could not, fail to see the tubs. He would see the lamp. Orlando with its doctors was too far. She could scarcely reach the Chinaberry tree, where she waited in the growing heat while inside she knew the cold river was creeping up and up to extinguish that eye which must know by now that she knew.

FOREWORD:
 "If every life has pages vacant still whereon a man may write the thing he will ," it is also true that in many little-considered lives there are pages whereon matter of great interest has already been written, if the appraising eye can only reach it.
So with the recently developed discoveries of the wealth of material for artistic and intellectual development in the life, manners, and customs of the Negro and his unique and all-too-frequently unappreciated and unasked contribution to our American self- consciousness
 This challenging collection focuses, as it were , the appraising eyes of white folks on the Negro's life and of Negroes on their own life and development in what seems to me a new and stimulating way.
Great emotional waves may not be stirred by taking cognizance of the performances of Negroes in art and literature, but faithfulness to an ideal of proportion or fair play makes us uneasy lest through ignorance we miss something by straying into the tangles of prejudice.
Most of us claim to recognize Miss Millay's thought that
"He whose soul is flat, the sky
Will fall in on him by and by.”
and will follow with zest the explorations of appraising eyes which have been made available to us in attractive form on these pages .

 INTRODUCTION
 It is only fair to rid this volume, at the beginning, of  some of the usual pretensions, which have the effect of distorting normal values, most often with results as unfortunate as they are unfair. This volume, strangely enough, does not set forth to prove a thesis, nor to plead a cause, nor, stranger still, to offer a progress report on the state of Negro letters. It is a venture in expression, shared, with the slightest editorial suggestion, by a number of persons who are here much less interested in their audience than in what they are trying to say, and the life they are trying to portray. ‘This measurable freedom from the usual burden of proof has been an aid to spontaneity, and to this quality the collection makes its most serious claim.
 It is not improbable that some of our white readers will arch their brows or perhaps knit them soberly at some point before the end. But this is a response not infrequently met with outside the pages of books. There is always an escape of a sort, however, in ignoring that which contradicts one’s sense, even though it were the better wisdom to give heed.
 Some of our Negro readers will doubtless quarrel with certain of the Negro characters who move in these pages. But it is also true that in life some Negroes are distasteful to other Negroes. Following the familiar patterns, we are accustomed to think of Negroes as one ethnic unit, and of whites as many,—the N ordics, Mediterraneans; or Germans, Irish, Swedes; or brachycephalics and dolichocephalics, depending upon our school of politics or anthropology. The significance of the difference is not so much that Negroes in America actually represent different races among themselves, as that there is the same ground, in dissimilar customs and culture patterns, which are the really valid distinctions between races, for viewing Negroes differently among themselves. The point, if it were important enough, could be proved about as satisfactorily as proofs in this field go, and with the same type of data. Beneath the difference, however, as must be evident, is the cultural factor which distinguishes one group of Negroes from another: the small, articulate group from the more numerous, and, one might even add, more interesting folk group; the unconscious Negro folk contributions to music, folk lore, and the dance, from the conscious contributions of Negroes to art and letters.
 The sociological confusion here has brought about endless literary debates.
 Accepting the materials of Negro life for their own worth, it is impossible to escape certain implications: It is significant that white and Negro writers and artists are finding together the highest expression of their art in this corner of life. And, as Mr, Albert Jay Nock reminds us, an interesting person in literature is just what he is in life. It is evident in many quarters that Negroes are being discovered as “fellow mortals,” with complexes of their own to be analyzed. With Julia Peterkin, Paul Green, Dubose Heyward, Guy Johnson, there has been ushered in a  refreshing new picture of Negro life in the south. Swinging free from the old and exhausted stereotypes and reading from life, they have created human characters who are capable of living by their own charm and power. There is something here infinitely more real and honest in the at-
 mosphere thus created, than in the stagnant sentimental aura which has hung about their heads for so many years.
 The Negro writers, removed by two generations from slavery, are now much less self-conscious, less interested in proving that they are just like white people, and, in their excursions into the fields of letters and art, seem to care less about what white people think, or are likely to think about the race. Relief from the stifling consciousness of being a problem has brought a certain superiority to it. There is more candor, even in discussions of themselves, about weaknesses, and on the very sound reasoning that unless they are truthful about their faults, they will not be believed when they chose to speak about their virtues. A sense of humor is present.” The taboos and racial ritual are less strict; there is more overt self-criticism, less of bitterness and appeals to sympathy. The sensitiveness, which a brief decade ago, denied the existence of any but educated Negroes, bitterly opposing Negro dialect, and folk songs, and anything that revived the memory of slavery, is shading off into a sensitiveness to the hidden beauties of this life and a frank joy and pride in it. The return of the Negro writers to folk materials has proved a new emancipation.
 It might not seem to go too far afield to refer to the statements offered not infrequently in criticism, that the cultured Negroes are not romanticized in fiction as generously as the folk types. This has a distinctly sociological implication back of which is the feeling that a
 loftier opinion of all Negroes would follow an emphasis in fiction upon more educated individuals. The attitude is not uncommon in the history of other races and classes. For many years, Americans were affected by the same sensitiveness in relation to Europe, and even in the Southern United States, until very recently, the literature has been defensive and for the most part ineffectual. Aside from the greater color and force of life in those human strata which seem to have struck lightning to the imaginations of our present writers, it might be suggested that the educated Negroes, even if they are not yet being romanticized in fiction, are finding a most effective representation through their own comment upon the extraordinarily interesting patterns of Negro folk life to which they have intimate access. Or, perhaps, they have succeeded only too well in becoming like other people whom writers generally are finding it difficult enough to make interesting.
 The most that will be claimed for this collection is that it is a fairly faithful reflection of current interests and observations in Negro life. The arrangement of the materials of this volume follows roughly the implications of significance in the new interests mentioned. The first part is concerned with Negro folk life itself. The vast resources of this field for American literature cannot be escaped even though they are no more than hinted at in this volume. There is here a life full of strong colors, of passions, deep and fierce, of struggle, disillusion—the whole gamut of life free from the wrappings of intricate sophistication.
 The second part sweeps in from a wider radius of time and space some of the rare and curiously interesting fragments of careers and art which constitute that absorbing field of the past now being re vealed through the zeal and industry of Negro scholars. The garnering of these long lone figures who flashed like bright comets across a black sky is an amenity which has found root quietly and naturally in Negro life.
 A third division is concerned with racial problems and attitudes, and these are rather coldly in the hands of students. In these, there is the implication of a vast drama which the stories and the poetry merely illuminate.
 The fourth section might well be set down as the most significant of current tendencies—the direction of Negro attention inward in frank self-appraisal and criticism. The essays touch boldly and with a striking candor some of the ancient racial foibles. At frequent points they violate the orthodoxy, but in a spirit which is neither bitterly hopeless nor resentful. This is perhaps one of the most hopeful signs of life and the will to live. And finally, there is a division which gives a brief glimpse into the intimate self-feeling of articulate Negroes. ‘These lack conspicuously the familiar tears of self-pity and apology.
 The classification is not a strict one, but it has a possible usefulness as a guide through the varieties of expression to be found herein.  There will be in one an abandonment to the fascination of a new life, in another a critical self searching, in one humor for its own sake, in another humor with a thrust; there will be stoical rebellion, self reliance, beauty. Those seeking set patterns of Negro literature will in all likelihood be disappointed for there is no set pattern of Negro life. If there is anything implicit in the attitude toward life revealing itself, it is acceptance of the fact of race and difference on the same casual gesture that denies that the difference means anything.
 This is probably enough about the contributions to this collection to let them take their own course. From the list of contributors are absent many names with as great reason for inclusion as any present.  There were, however, physical limits to such a volume, with all that this implies, and, if there is, for those who must pass judgment, less merit in what appears than should be, some measure of this deficiency may be laid to the omissions.
 A spirit has been quietly manifest of late which it would be a gentle treason to ignore. Its expression has been a disposition on the part of established writers, scholars, artists and other interested individuals, to offer to Negro writers the practical encouragement of those facilities which they command. ‘To this may be accredited among other things a share in the making of that mood of receptivity among the general public for the literature of Negro life.

       <collex:text>SYBIL WARNS HER SISTER
It is dangerous for a woman to defy the gods;
To taunt them with the tongue's thin tip,
Or strut in the weakness of mere humanity,
Or draw a line daring them to cross;
The gods who own the searing lightning,
The drowning waters, the tormenting fears,
The anger of red sins...
Oh, but worse still if you mince along timidly-
Dodge this way or that, or kneel, or pray,
Or be kind, or sweat agony drops,
Or lay your quick body over your feeble young,
If you have beauty or plainness, if celibate,
Or vowed-the gods are Juggernaut,
Passing over each of us....
Or this you may do:
Lock your heart, then, quietly,
And, lest they peer within,
Light no lamp when dark comes down
Raise no shade for sun,
Breathless must your breath come thru,
If you'd die and dare deny
The gods their god-like fun!

       <collex:text>You have been good to me, I give you this:
 The arms of lovers empty as our own,
 Marble lips sustaining one long kiss
 And the hard sound of hammers breaking stone.
 For I will build a chapel in the place
 Where our love died and I will journey there
 To make a sign and kneel before your face
 And set an old bell tolling on the air.

       <collex:text>A little while spring will claim its own,
 In all the land around for mile on mile
 Tender grass will hide the rugged stone.
 My still heart will sing a little while.
 And men will never think this wilderness
 Was barren once when grass is over all,
 Hearing laughter they may never guess
 My heart has known its winter and carried gall.

       <collex:text>I
Once more, listening to the wind and rain,
Once more, you and I, and above the hurting sound
Of these comes back the throbbing of remembered rain,
Treasured rain falling on dark ground.
Once more, huddling birds upon the leaves
And summer trembling on a withered vine.
And once more, returning out of pain,
The friendly ghost that was your love and mine.
II
Darkness brings the jungle to our room:
The throb of rain is the throb of muffled drums.
Darkness hangs our room with pendulums
Of vine and in the gathering gloom
Our walls recede into a denseness of
Surrounding trees. This is a night of love
Retained from those lost nights our fathers slept
In huts; this is a night that must not die.
Let us keep the dance of rain our fathers kept
And tread our dreams beneath the jungle sky.
III
And now the downpour ceases.
Let us go back once more upon the glimmering leaves
And as the throbbing of the drums increases
Shake the grass and dripping boughs of trees.
A dry wind stirs the palm; the old tree grieves.
Time has charged the years: the old days have returned.
Let us dance by metal waters burned
With gold of moon, let us dance
With naked feet beneath the young spice trees.
What was that light, that radiance
On your face? — something I saw when first
You passed beneath the jungle tapestries?
A moment we pause to quench our thirst
Kneeling at the water's edge, the gleam
Upon your face is plain: you have wanted this.
Let us go back and search the tangled dream
And as the muffled drum-beats throb and miss
Remember again how early darkness comes
To dreams and silence to the drums.
IV
Let us go back into the dusk again,
Slow and sad-like following the track
Of blowing leaves and cool white rain
Into the old gray dream, let us go back.
Our walls close about us we lie and listen
To the noise of the street, the storm and the driven birds.
A question shapes your lips, your eyes glisten
Retaining tears, but there are no more words.

       <collex:text>My branch of thoughts is frail tonight
 As one lone wind-whipped weed.
 Little I care if a rain drop laughs
 Or cries; I cannot heed
 Such trifles now as a twinkling star,
 Or catch a night-bird’s tune.
 My whole life ts you, to-night,
 And you, a cool distant moon.
 With a few soft words to nurture my heart
 And brighter beams following love’s cool shower
 Who knows but this frail wind-whipped weed
 Might bear you a gorgeous flower!

       <collex:text>There are some things I might not know
 Had you not pedagogued me so;
 And these I thank you for,
 Now never shall a piquant face
 Cause my tutored heart a trace
 Of anguish any more.
 Before your pleasure made me wise,
 A simulacrum of disguise
 Masked the serpent and the dove;
 That I discern now hiss from coo,
 My heart's full gratitude to you,
 Lady I had learned to love.
 Before I knew love well I sang
 Many a polished pain and pang,
 With proper bardic zeal;
 But now I know hearts do not break
 So easily, and though a snake
 Has made them wounds may heal.

       <collex:text>Down in Georgia
 a danglin’ n*****
hangin’ in a tree
 ....kicks holes in the laughing sunlight—
 A little red haired
 Irish girl . . . grey eyes
 and a blue dress—
 A little black babe
 in a lacy white cap...
 The soft red lips
 of the little red head
 kiss
 so tenderly
 the little black head—
 grey eyes smile
 into black eyes
 and the gay sunlight
 laughs joyously
 in a burst of gold...
 Down in Georgia
 a danglin’ n*****
hangin’ in a tree
 ...kicks holes in the laughing sunlight—

       <collex:text>I am a knotted nebula—
 awhirling flame
 Shrieking aftire the endless darkness...
 I am the eternal center of gravity
 and about me swing the crazy moons—
 I am the thunder of rising suns,
 the blaze of the zenith—
 ... the tremble of women’s bodies
 in the arms of lovers...
 I sit on top of the Pole
 Drunk with starry splendor
 Shouting hozzanas at the Pleiades
 ... booting footballs at the moon—
 I shall outlast the sun
 and the moon
 and the stars.

       <collex:text>SONNET TO A NEGRO IN HARLEM
You are disdainful and magnificent-
Your perfect body and your pompous gait,
Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate,
Small wonder that you are incompetent
To imitate those whom you so despise
Your shoulders towering high above the throng,
Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song,
Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.
Let others toil and sweat for labor's sake
And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.
Why urge ahead your supercilious feet?
Scorn will efface each footprint that you make.
I love your laughter arrogant and bold.
You are too splendid for this city street!

       <collex:text>DIVINE AFFLATUS
Tell me, swart children of the Southland
Chopping at cotton In the sandy soil,
What do ye dream?
What deeds, what words of heroes
Leaven and lighten up
Your toil?
Know ye of L'Ouverture who freed a nation?
Heard ye of Crispus Attucks,
Or of Young?
Does fiery Vesey
Stir the spark within ye,
Or Douglass
Of the rare and matchless tongue?
That Washington
Who moulded a Tuskegee--
Does he inspire ye?
Does brave Moton thrill?
Mark ye Du Bois
That proud, unyielding eagle,
Beckoning ye higher than the highest hill?
But the swart children
Of the Southland
Stopping to dash the sweatbeads
From dull brows,
Answer: "These names Mean nothing to us,
They, nor the unheard causes they espouse.
Only we know meek Jesus,
Thorn - encircled,
Broken and bleeding
In his Passion's toils;
And Lazarus
Sharing crumbs with dogs;
And Job,
Potsherd in hand, a - scraping at his boils!"

 And make of them a bronze vase,
 And awide round fountain
 With a beautiful statue in its center,
 And a song with a broken heart,
 And I ask you:
 Do you understand my dreams?
 Sometimes you say you do —
 And sometimes you say you don't.
 Either way
 It doesn’t matter.
 I continue to dream.

 You stood in the yard
 Like a lilac bush
 With your head tossed high
 As if to push
 Your hair in a blossom
 About your head
 You wore the grace
 Of a fragile reed.
 FASHION
Your gown crackled loud
 Like the swish of leaves
 Being flitted about
 By a lyric breeze
 Your step was like a dainty fawn
 Breathing the nectared air at dawn,
 Oft have I seen the rose in you
 But it never bloomed such a brilliant hue.

       <collex:text> Father Missouri takes his own.
 These are the fields he loaned them,
 Out of hearts’ fullness; gratuitously ,
 Here are the banks he built up for his children—
 Here are the fields; rich, fertile silt.
 Father Missourt, in his dotage
 Whimsical and drunkenly turbulent,
 Guts away the banks; steals away the loam;
 Washes the ground from under wire fences,
 Leaves fenceposts grotesquely dangling in the air;
 And with doddering steps approaches the shanties.
 Father Missouri; far too old to be so evil.
 Uncle Dan, seeing his garden lopped away,
 Seeing his manured earth topple slowly in the stream,
 Seeing his cows knee-deep in yellow water,
 His pig-sties flooded, his flower beds drowned,
 Seeing his white leghorns swept down the stream—
 Curses Father Missouri, impotently shakes
 His fist at the forecloser, the treacherous skinflint,
 Who takes what was loaned so very long ago,
 And leaves puddles in his parlor, and useless lakes
 In his fine pasture land.
 Sees years of work turned to nothing—
 Curses, and shouts in his hoarse old voice,
 “Aint got no right to act dat way at all”
 And the old river rolls on, slowly to the gulf.

       <collex:text>April is on the way!
 I saw the scarlet flash of a blackbird’s wing
 As he sang in the cold, brown February trees;
 And children said that they caught a glimpse of the sky on a bird’s wing from the far South.
 (Dear God, was that a stark figure outstretched in the bare branches 
 Etched brown against the amethyst sky?)
 April is on the way!
 The ice crashed in the brown mud-pool under my tread,
 The warning earth clutched my hluody feet with great fecund fingers.
 I saw a boy rolling a hoop up the road,
 His little bare hands were red with cold,
 But his brown hair blew backward in the southwest wind.
 (Dear God! He screamed when he saw my awful woe-spent eyes.)
 April is on the way!
 I met a woman in the lane;
 Her burden was heavy as it is always, but today her step was light,
 And a smile drenched the tired look away from her eyes.
 (Dear God, she had dreams of vengeance for her slain mate,
 Perhaps the west wind has blown the mist of hate from her heart,
 The dead man was cruel to her, you know that, God.)
 April is on the way!
 My feet spurn the ground now, instead of dragging on the bitter road.
 I laugh in my throat as I see the grass greening beside the patches of snow
 (Dear God, those were wild fears. Can there be hate when the southwest wind is blowing?)
 April is on the way!
 The crisp brown hedges stir with the bustle of bird wings.
 There is business of building, and songs from brown thrush throats
 As the bird-carpenters make homes against Valentine Day.
 (Dear God, could they build me a shelter in the hedge from the icy winds that will come with the dark?)
 April is on the way!
 I sped through the town this morning. The florist shops have put yellow flowers in the windows,
 Daffodils and tulips and primroses, pale yellow flowers
 Like the tips of her fingers when she waved me that frightened farewell.
 And the women in the market have stuck pussy willows in long necked bottles on their stands.
 (Willow trees are kind, Dear God. They will not bear a body on their limbs.)
 April is on the way!
 The soul within me cried that all the husk of indifference to sorrow was but the crust of ice with which winter disguises life;
 It will melt, and reality will burgeon forth like the crocuses in the glen.
 (Dear God! Those thoughts were from long ago. When we read poetry after the day’s toil. and got religion together at the revival meeting.)
 April is on the way!
 The infinite miracle of unfolding life in the brown February fields.
 (Dear God, the hounds are baying!)
 Murder and wasted love, lust and weariness, deceit and vainglory—what are they but the spent breath of the runner?
 (God, you know he laid hairy red hands on the golden loveliness of her little daffodil body)
 Hate may destroy me, but from my brown limbs will bloom the golden buds with which we once spelled love.
 (Dear God! How their light eyes glow into black pin points of hate!)
 April is on the way!
 Wars are made in April, and they sing at Easter time of the Resurrection.
 Therefore I laugh in their faces.
 (Dear God, give her strength to join me before her golden petals are fouled in the slime!)
 April is on the way!

My proud, White flesh a Black girl’s pangs to ease,
My muscles wrenched a Red-skin’s wrongs to crush,
My entire body diced to clean the slate,
Sheer mock-heroics? They'll have love of me:
The long-enduring, mystical Chinese,
The colored girls whose goodness makes me blush,
The kind-faced squaws who peddle basketry.
They'll have it. Great God, surely it is right?
He taught it . . . Thy son pleasing in Thy sight—
No dawdling, half-way measures satisfy—
I must earn sure approval in Thine eye.
Failing, I plunge (may nothing me exempt)
In cauldron—seething, scalding self-contempt.

       <collex:text>He mocks the God invisible
To whom his mother prays;
“What stands on faith for proof is built
On shifting sands,” he says.
To him life ts a heartless game:
“I grapple, fight, defy,”
He says: “the world is his who wins;
The losers, let them dte.”
Ah, greenhorn-pilgrim, duped by thieves
And left to writhe in dirt
Beside the way to Jericho—
Wounded, robbed—and hurt!

 CONTENTS
INTRODUCTION
In putting ideas and feelings into poetry, I have tried in each case to use the medium most adaptable to the specific purpose. I own allegiance to no master. I have never found it possible to accept in entirety any one poet. But I have loved and joyed in what I consider the finest in the poets of all ages.
The speech of my childhood and early youth was the Jamaica Negro dialect, the native variant of English, which still preserves a few words of African origin, and which is more difficult of understanding than the American Negro dialect. But the language we wrote and read in school was England’s English. Our text books then, before the advent of the American and Jamaican readers and our teachers, too, were all English-made. The native teachers of the elementary schools were tutored by men and women of British import. I quite remember making up verses in the dialect and in English for our moonlight ring dances and for our school parties. Of our purely native song the jammas (field and road), shay-shays (yard and booth), wakes (post-mortem), Anancy tales (transplanted African folk lore), and revivals (religious) are all singularly punctuated by meter and rhyme. And nearly all my own poetic thought has always run naturally into these regular forms.
Consequently, although very conscious of the new criticisms and trends in poetry, to which I am keenly responsive and receptive, I have adhered to such of the older traditions as I find adequate for my most lawless and revolutionary passions and moods. I have not used patterns, images and words that would stamp me a classicist nor a modernist. My intellect is not scientific enough to range me on the side of either; nor is my knowledge wide enough for me to specialize in any school.
I have never studied poetics; but the forms I have used I am convinced are the ones I can work in with the highest degree of spontaneity and freedom.
I have chosen my melodies and rhythms by instinct, and I have favored words and figures which flow smoothly and harmoniously into my compositions. And in all my moods I have striven to achieve directness, truthfulness and naturalness of expression instead of an enameled originality. I have not hesitated to use words which are old, and in some circles considered poetically overworked and dead, when I thought I could make them glow alive by new manipulation. Nor have I stinted my senses of the pleasure of using the decorative metaphor where it is more truly and vividly beautiful than the exact phrase. But for me there is more quiet delight in “The golden moon of heaven” than in “The terra-cotta disc of cloud-land.”
Finally, while I have welcomed criticism, friendly and unfriendly, and listened with willing attention to many varying opinions concerning other poems and my own, I have always, in the summing up, fallen back on my own ear and taste as the arbiter.
Claude McKay.

       <collex:text>Max Eastman, Foreword to Claude McKay's Harlem Shadows
These poems have a special interest for all the races of man because they are sung by a pure blooded Negro. They are the first significant expression of that race in poetry. We tried faithfully to give a position in our literature to Paul Laurence Dunbar. We have excessively welcomed other black poets of minor talent, seeking in their music some distinctive quality other than the fact that they wrote it. But here for the first time we find our literature vividly enriched by a voice from this most alien race among us. And it should be illuminating to observe that while these poems are characteristic of that race as we most admire it - they are gentle-simple, candid, brave and friendly, quick of laughter and of tears - yet they are still more characteristic of what is deep and universal in mankind. There is no special or exotic kind of merit in them, no quality that demands a transmutation of our own natures to perceive. Just as the sculptures and wood and ivory carvings of the vast forgotten African Empires of Ifé and Benin, although so wistful in their tranquillity, are tranquil in the possession of the qualities of all classic and great art, so these poems, the purest of them, move with a sovereignty that is never new to the lovers of the high music of human utterance.
It is the peculiarity of his experience, rather than of his nature, that makes this poet's race a fact to be remembered in the enjoyment of his songs. The subject of all poetry is the experience of the poet, and no man of any other race in the world can touch or imagine the experience of the children of African slaves in America.
Claude McKay was born in 1890 in a little thatched house of two rooms in a beautiful valley of the hilly middle-country of Jamaica. He was born to the genial, warm, patient, neighborly farmer's life of that island. It was a life rich in sun and sound and color and emotion, as we can see in his poems which are forever homeward yearning - in the midst of their present passion and strong will into the future, forever vividly remembering. Like a blue-bird's note in a March wind, those sudden clear thoughts of the warm South ring out in the midst of his northern songs. They carry a thrill into the depth of our hearts. Perhaps in some sense they are thoughts of a mother. At least it seems inevitable that we should find among them those two sacred sonnets of a child's bereavement. It seems inevitable that a wonderful poet should have had a wise and beautiful mother.
We can only distantly imagine how the happy tropic life of play and affection, became shadowed and somber for this sensitive boy as he grew, by a sense of the subjection of his people, and the memory of their bondage to an alien race. Indeed the memory of Claude McKay's family goes back on his mother's side beyond the days of bondage, to a time in Madagascar when they were still free, and by the grace of God still "savage." He learned in early childhood the story of their violent abduction, and how they were freighted over the seas in ships, and sold at public auction in Jamaica. He learned another story, too, which must have kindled a fire that slept in his blood - a story of the rebellion of the members of his own family at the auction-block. A death-strike, we should call it now - for they agreed that if they were divided and sold away into different parts of the country they would all kill themselves. And this fact solemnly announced in the market by the oldest white-haired Negro among them, had such an effect upon prospective buyers that it was impossible to sell them as individuals, and so they were all taken away together to those hills at Clarendon which their descendants still cultivate. With the blood of these rebels in his veins, and their memory to stir it, we cannot wonder that Claude McKay's earliest boyish songs in the Jamaica dialect were full of heresy and the militant love of freedom, and that his first poem of political significance should have been a rally-call to the street-car men on strike in Kingston. He found himself by an instinctive gravitation singing in the forefront of the battle for human liberty. A wider experience and a man's comprehension of the science of history has only strengthened his voice and his resolution.
Those early songs and the music he composed for them, were very popular in Jamaica. Claude McKay was quite the literary prince of the island for a time - a kind of Robert Burns among his own people, as we can imagine, with his physical beauty, his quick sympathy, and the magnetic wayward humor of his ways. He received in 1912 the medal of the Institute of Arts and Sciences in recognition of his preëminence. He was the first Negro to receive this medal, and he was the first poet who ever made songs in the quaint haunting dialect of the island. But nevertheless it was not until he came to the United States that Claude McKay began to confront the deepest feelings in his heart, and realize that a delicate syllabic music could not alone express them. Here his imagination awoke, and the colored imagery that is the language of all deep passion began to appear in his poetry. Here too he conceived and felt the history and position of his people with mature poetic force. He knew that his voice belonged not only to his own moods and the general experience of humanity, but to the hopes and sorrows of his race.
A great many foolish things are said even by wise people upon the subject of racial inferiority. They seem to think that if science could establish a certain difference of average ability as between the whites and blacks, that would justify them in placing the whole of one of these races in a position of inferior esteem. The same fallacy is committed in the discussions of sex-inferiority, and it is worth while to make clear the perfect folly of it. If any defined quantitative difference is ever established between the average abilities of such groups, it will be a relatively slight one. The difficulty of establishing it, is a proof of that. And a slight difference in the general average would have no application whatever as between any two individuals, or any minor groups of individuals. The enormous majority of both races, as of both sexes, would show the same degree of ability. And so great is the factor of individual variation that we could not even be sure an example of the highest ability might not arise in the group whose average was "inferior." This simple consideration of fact and good logic should suffice to silence those who think they can ever appeal to science in support of a general race or sex prejudice.
But in so far as the problem arises between a dominant and a subjected race, it is impossible for science to say anything even as to averages. For a fair general test is impossible. The children of the subjected race never have a chance. To be deprived at the very dawn of selfhood of a sense of possible superiority, is to be undernourished at the point of chief educative importance. And to be assailed in early childhood with a pervading intimation of inferiority is poison in the very centers of growth. Except for people of the highest force of character, therefore, to be born into a subjected race is to grow up inferior, not only to the other race, but to one's own potential self. We see an example of this kind of growth in the bombastic locutions of the traditional "darkie" who has acquired a little culture. Those great big words and long sentences are the result of a feeling of inferiority. They are a pathetic over-correction of the very quality of simple-heartedness which is carried so high in these poems of Claude McKay. It is carried so high, and made so boldly beautiful, that we can not withhold a tribute to his will, as well as to his music and imagination. The naked force of character that we feel in those two recent sonnets, "Baptism" and "The White City," is no mere verbal semblance. Its reality is certified by the very achievement of such commanding art in the face of a contemptuous or condescending civilization.
Claude McKay came to the United States in 1912, having been offered an education here by a friend in Jamaica who believed in his abilities. His intention was to learn scientific farming, and return to the island to offer practical wisdom as well as music to his people. He went at first to
one of our established philanthropic institutions for the training of colored people. He stayed there a few months - long enough to weary of the almost military system of discipline. And then he went to the Agricultural College of Kansas, where he had learned that a free life and a more elective system of education prevailed. He studied for two years there, thinking continually less about farming and more about literature, and gradually losing away altogether the idea of returning to live in Jamaica. He left the college in 1914, knowing that he was a poet - and imagining, I think, that he was a rather irresponsible and wayward character - to cast in his lot with the working-class Negroes of the north. Since then he has earned his living in every one of the ways that the northern Negroes do, from "pot-wrestling" in a boarding-house kitchen to dining car service on the New York and Philadelphia Express. But like all true poets, he failed to take the duty of "earning a living" very seriously. It was a matter of collecting enough money from each new job to quit for a while and live. And with each period of living a new and a more sure and beautiful song would come out of him.
The growth of beauty and sureness in these songs would be apparent if they were arranged in the order of their creation. As it is, the reader will observe occasional lapses of quality. One or two of the rhythms I confess I am not able to apprehend at all. Perhaps they will be picked up by receivers who are attuned to a different wave-length. But the quality is here in them all - the pure, clear arrow-like transference of his emotion into our breast, without any but the inevitable words - the quality that reminds us of Burns and Villon and Catullus, and all the poets that we call lyric because we love them so much. It is the quality that Keats sought to cherish when he said that "Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into the soul, and does not startle or amaze with itself but with its subject." Poetry with this quality is not for those whose interest is mainly in the manufacture of poems. It will come rather to those whose interest is in the life of things. It is the poetry of life, and not of the poet's chamber. It is the poetry that looks upon a thing, and sings. It is possessed by a feeling and sings. May it find its way a little quietly and softly, in this age of roar and advertising, to the hearts that love a true and unaffected song.

       <collex:text>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!
Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,
Giving me strength erect against her hate.
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state,
I stand within her walls with not a shred
Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,
And see her might and granite wonders there,
Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.

       <collex:text>Oh something just now must be happening there!
That suddenly and quiveringly here,
Amid the city’s noises, I must think
Of mangoes leaning o’er the river’s brink,
And dexterous Davie climbing high above,
The gold fruits ebon-speckled to remove,
And toss them quickly in the tangled mass
Of wis-wis twisted round the guinea grass;
And Cyril coming through the bramble-track
A prize bunch of bananas on his back;
And Georgie─none could ever dive like him─
Throwing his scanty clothes off for a swim;
And schoolboys, from Bridge-tunnel going home,
Watching the waters downward dash and foam.
This is no daytime dream, there’s something in it,
Oh something’s happening there this very minute!

       <collex:text>There was a time when in late afternoon
The four-o’clocks would fold up at day’s close
Pink-white in prayer, and ‘neath the floating moon
I lay with them in calm and sweet repose.
And in the open spaces I could sleep,
Half-naked to the shining worlds above;
Peace came with sleep and sleep was long and deep,
Gained without effort, sweet like early love.
But now no balm— nor drug nor weed nor wine—
Can bring true rest to cool my body’s fever,
Nor sweeten in my mouth the acid brine,
That salts my choicest drink and will forever.

O rain-birds racing merrily away
From hill-tops parched with heat and sultry plain
Of wilting plants and fainting flowers, say—
When at the noon-hour from the chapel school
The children dash and scamper down the dale,
Scornful of teacher’s rod and binding rule
Forever broken and without avail,
Do they still stop beneath the giant tree
To gather locusts in their childish greed,
And chuckle when they break the pods to see
The golden powder clustered round the seed?

Wet with the soft rain-kisses of the night,
In which the brown bee buries deep its head,
When still the dawn’s a silver sea of light.
Your lips betray the secret of your soul,
The dark delicious essence that is you,
A mystery of life, the flaming goal
I seek through mazy pathways strange and new.
Your lips are the red symbol of a dream.
What visions of warm lilies they impart,
That line the green bank of a fair blue stream,
With butterflies and bees close to each heart!
Brown bees that murmur sounds of music rare,
That softly fall upon the languorous breeze,
Wafting them gently on the quiet air
Among untended avenues of trees.
O were I hovering, a bee, to probe
Deep down within your scented heart, fair flower,
Enfolded by your soft vermillion robe,
Amorous of sweets, for but one perfect hour!

       <collex:text>Your words dropped into my heart like pebbles into a pool,
Rippling around my breast and leaving it melting cool.
Your kisses fell sharp on my flesh like dawn-dews from the limb,
Of a fruit-filled lemon tree when the day is young and dim.
Like soft rain-christened sunshine, as fragile as rare gold lace,
Your breath, sweet-scented and warm, has kindled my tranquil face.
But a silence vasty-deep, oh deeper than all these ties
Now, through the menacing miles, brooding between us lies.
And more than the songs I sing, I await your written word,
To stir my fluent blood as never your presence stirred.

       <collex:text>For one brief golden moment rare like wine,
The gracious city swept across the line;
Oblivious of the color of my skin,
Forgetting that I was an alien guest,
She bent to me, my hostile heart to win,
Caught me in passion to her pillowy breast;
The great, proud city, seized with a strange love,
Bowed down for one flame hour my pride to prove.

       <collex:text>Altea mentions in her tender letters,
Among a chain of quaint and touching things,
That you are feeble, weighted down with fetters,
And given to strange deeds and mutterings.
No longer without trace or thought of fear,
Do you leap to and ride the rebel roan;
But have become the victim of grim care,
With three brown beauties to support alone.
But none the less will you be in my mind,
Wild May that cantered by the risky ways,
With showy head-cloth flirting in the wind,
From market in the glad December days;
Wild May of whom even other girls could rave
Before sex tamed your spirit, made you slave.

       <collex:text>It was the silver, heart-enveloping view
Of the mysterious sea-line far away,
Seen only on a gleaming gold-white day,
That made it dear and beautiful to you.
And Laura loved it for the little hill,
Where the quartz sparkled fire, barren and dun,
Whence in the shadow of the dying sun,
She contemplated Hallow’s wooden mill.
While Danny liked the sheltering high grass,
In which he lay upon a clear dry night,
To hear and see, screened skilfully from sight,
The happy lovers of the valley pass.
But oh!  I loved it for the big round moon
That swung out of the clouds and swooned aloft,
Burning with passion, gloriously soft,
Lighting the purple flowers of fragrant June.

       <collex:text>I will not toy with it nor bend an inch.
Deep in the secret chambers of my heart
I muse my life-long hate, and without flinch
I bear it nobly as I live my part.
My being would be a skeleton, a shell,
If this dark Passion that fills my every mood,
And makes my heaven in the white world’s hell,
Did not forever feed me vital blood.
I see the mighty city through a mist‐--
The strident trains that speed the goaded mass,
The poles and spires and towers vapor-kissed,
The fortressed port through which the great ships pass,
The tides, the wharves, the dens I contemplate,
Are sweet like wanton loves because I hate.

Reg wished me to go with him to the field,
I paused because I did not want to go;
But in her quiet way she made me yield
Reluctantly, for she was breathing low.
Her hand she slowly lifted from her lap
And, smiling sadly in the old sweet way,
She pointed to the nail where hung my cap.
Her eyes said: I shall last another day.
But scarcely had we reached the distant play,
When o’er the hills we heard a faint bell ringing;
A boy came running up with frightened face;
We knew the fatal news that he was bringing.
I heard him listlessly, without a moan,
Although the only one I loved was gone.
II
The dawn departs, the morning is begun,
The trades come whispering from off the seas,
The fields of corn are golden in the sun,
The dark-brown tassels fluttering in the breeze;
The bell is sounding and the children pass,
Frog-leaping, skipping, shouting, laughing shrill,
Down the red road, over the pasture-grass,
Up to the school-house crumbling on the hill.
The older folk are at their peaceful toil,
Some pulling up the weeds, some plucking corn,
And others breaking up the sun-baked soil.
Float, faintly-scented breeze, at early morn
Over the earth where mortals sow and reap─
Beneath its breast my mother lies asleep.

       <collex:text>Now the dead past seems vividly alive,
And in this shining moment I can trace,
Down through the vista of the vanished years,
Your faun-like form, your fond elusive face.
And suddenly some secret spring’s released,
And unawares a riddle is revealed,
And I can read like large, black-lettered print,
What seemed before a thing forever sealed.
I know the magic word, the graceful thought,
The song that fills me in my lucid hours,
The spirit’s wine that thrills my body through,
And makes me music-drunk, are yours, all
yours.
I cannot praise, for you have passed from praise,
I have no tinted thoughts to paint you true;
But I can feel and I can write the word;
The best of me is but the least of you.

       <collex:text>Oh when I think of my long-suffering race,
For weary centuries despised, oppressed,
Enslaved and lynched, denied a human place
In the great life line of the Christian West;
And in the Black Land disinherited,
Robbed in the ancient country of its birth,
My heart grows sick with hate, becomes as lead,
For this my race that has no home on earth.
Then from the dark depths of my soul I cry
To the avenging angel to consume
The white man’s world of wonders utterly:
Let it be swallowed up in earth’s vast womb,
Or upward roll as sacrificial smoke
To liberate my people from its yoke!

And no one living can recall my face,
When under alien sod my bones lie rotten
With not a tree or stone to mark the place;
Perchance a pensive youth, with passion burning,
For olden verse that smacks of love and wine,
The musty pages of old volumes turning,
May light upon a little song of mine,
And he may softly hum the tune and wonder
Who wrote the verses in the long ago;
Or he may sit him down awhile to ponder
Upon the sample words that touch him so.

Thy slaves toiled at thy monumental best.
Thou ancient treasure-land, thou modern prize,
New peoples marvel at thy pyramids!
The years roll on, thy sphinx of riddle eyes
Watches the mad world with immobile lids.
The Hebrews humbled them at Pharaoh’s name.
Cradle of Power! Yet all things were in vain!
Honor and Glory, Arrogance and Fame!
They went. The darkness swallowed thee again.

       <collex:text>Here, passing lonely down this quiet lane,
Before a mud-splashed window long I pause
To gaze and gaze, while through my active brain
Still thoughts are stirred to wakefulness; because
Long, long ago in a dim unknown land,
A massive forest-tree, ax-felled, adze-hewn,
Was deftly done by cunning mortal hand
Into a symbol of the tender moon.
Why does it thrill more than the handsome boat
That bore me o’er the wild Atlantic ways,
And fill me with rare sense of things remote
From this harsh life of fretful nights and days?
I cannot answer but, whate’er it be,
An old wine has intoxicated me.

       <collex:text>Roar of the rushing train fearfully rocking,
Impatient people jammed in line for food,
The rasping noise of cars together knocking,
And worried waiters, some in ugly mood,
Crowding into the choking pantry hole
To call out dishes for each angry glutton
Exasperated grown beyond control,
From waiting for his soup or fish or mutton.
At last the station’s reached, the engine stops;
For bags and wraps the red-caps circle round;
From off the step the passenger lightly hops,
And seeks his cab or tram-car homeward bound;
The waiters pass out weary, listless, glum,
To spend their tips on harlots, cards and rum.

       <collex:text>For the dim regions whence my fathers came
My spirit, bondaged by the body, longs.
Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame;
My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs.
I would go back to darkness and to peace,
But the great western world holds me in fee,
And I may never hope for full release
While to its alien gods I bend my knee.
Something in me is lost, forever lost,
Some vital thing has gone out of my heart,
And I must walk the way of life a ghost
Among the sons of earth, a thing apart;
For I was born, far from my native clime,
Under the white man’s menace, out of time.

       <collex:text>O whisper, O my soul! The afternoon
Is waning into evening, whisper soft!
Peace, O my rebel heart! for soon the moon
From out its misty veil will swing aloft!
Be patient, weary body, soon the night
Will wrap thee gently in her sable sheet,
And with a leaden sigh thou wilt invite
To rest thy tired hands and aching feet.
The wretched day was theirs, the night is mine;
Come tender sleep, and fold me to thy breast.
But what steals out the gray clouds red like wine?
O dawn! O dreaded dawn! O let me rest
Weary my veins, my brain, my life! Have pity!
No! Once again the harsh, the ugly city.

       <collex:text>I plucked my soul out of its secret place,
And held it to the mirror of my eye,
To see it like a star against the sky,
A twitching body quivering in space,
A spark of passion shining on my face.
And I explored it to determine why
This awful key to my infinity
Conspires to rob me of sweet joy and grace.
And if the sign may not be fully read,
If I can comprehend but not control,
I need not gloom my days with futile dread,
Because I see a part and not the whole.
Contemplating the strange, I’m comforted
By this narcotic thought: I know my soul.

       <collex:text>Their shadow dims the sunshine of our day,
As they go lumbering across the sky,
Squawking in joy of feeling safe on high,
Beating their heavy wings of owlish gray.
They scare the singing birds of earth away
As, greed-impelled, they circle threateningly,
Watching the toilers with malignant eye,
From their exclusive haven—birds of prey.
They swoop down for the spoil in certain might,
And fasten in our bleeding flesh their claws.
They beat us to surrender weak with fright,
And tugging and tearing without let or pause,
They flap their hideous wings in grim delight,
And stuff our gory hearts into their maws.

Stay you without in terror of the heat.
I will go naked in–for thus ’tis sweet—
Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.
I will not quiver in the frailest bone,
You will not note a flicker of defeat;
My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,
My mouth give utterance to any moan.
The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;
Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.
Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,
Transforming me into a shape of flame.
I will come out, back to your world of tears,
A stronger soul within a finer frame.

       <collex:text>Far from this foreign Easter damp and chilly
My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground,
Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily
Soft-scented in the air for yards around;
Alone, without a hint of guardian leaf!
Just like a fragile bell of silver rime,
It burst the tomb for freedom sweet and brief
In the young pregnant year at Eastertime;
And many thought it was a sacred sign,
And some called it the resurrection flower;
And I, a pagan, worshiped at its shrine,
Yielding my heart unto its perfumed power.

       <collex:text>At first you’ll joy to see the playful snow,
Like white moths trembling on the tropic air,
Or waters of the hills that softly flow
Gracefully falling down a shining stair.
And when the fields and streets are covered white
And the wind-worried void is chilly, raw,
Or underneath a spell of heat and light
The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,
Like me you’ll long for home, where birds’ glad song
Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry,
And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong,
Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.
But oh! more than the changeless southern isles,
When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm,
You’ll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles
By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm.

       <collex:text>Your body was a sacred cell always,
A jewel that grew dull in garish light,
An opal which beneath my wondering gaze
Gleamed rarely, softly throbbing in the night.
I touched your flesh with reverential hands,
you were sweet and timid like a flower
That blossoms out of barren tropic sands,
Shedding its perfume in one golden hour.
You yielded to my touch with gentle grace,
And though my passion was a mighty wave
That buried you beneath its strong embrace,
You were yet happy in the moment’s grave.
Still more than passion consummate to me,
More than the nuptials immemorial sung,
Was the warm thrill that melted me to see
Your clean brown body, beautiful and young;
The joy in your maturity at length,
The peace that filled my soul like cooling wine,
When you responded to my tender strength,
And pressed your heart exulting into mine.
How shall I with such memories of you
In coarser forms of love fruition find?
No, I would rather like a ghost pursue
The fairy phantoms of my lonely mind.

My tongue is aching dry, my throat is hot
For water, fresh rain shaken from a bough,
Or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot.
My hungry body’s burning for a swim
In sunlit water where the air is cool,
As in Trout Valley where upon a limb
The golden finch sings sweetly to the pool.
Oh water, water, when the night is done,
When day steals gray-white through the window-pane,
Clear silver water when I wake, alone,
All impotent of parts, of fevered brain;
Pure water from a forest fountain first,
To wash me, cleanse me, and to quench my thirst!

       <collex:text>I
All night, through the eternity of night,
Pain was my portion though I could not feel.
Deep in my humbled heart you ground your heel,
Till I was reft of even my inner light,
Till reason from my mind had taken flight,
And all my world went whirling in a reel.
And all my swarthy strength turned cold like steel,
A passive mass beneath your puny might.
Last night I gave you triumph over me,
So I should be myself as once before,
I marveled at your shallow mystery,
And haunted hungrily your temple door.
I gave you sum and substance to be free,
Oh, you shall never triumph any more!
II
I do not fear to face the fact and say,
How darkly-dull my living hours have grown,
My wounded heart sinks heavier than stone,
Because I loved you longer than a day!
I do not shame to turn myself away
From beckoning flowers beautifully blown,
To mourn your vivid memory alone
In mountain fastnesses austerely gray.
The mists will shroud me on the utter height,
The salty, brimming waters of my breast
Will mingle with the fresh dews of the night
To bathe my spirit hankering to rest.
But after sleep I’ll wake with greater might,
Once more to venture on the eternal quest.

My body kindled to a mighty flame,
And burnt you yielding in my hot embrace
Until you swooned to love, breathing my name. 
And wonder came and filled our night of sleep,
Like a new comet crimsoning the sky;
And stillness like the stillness of the deep
Suspended lay as an unuttered sigh.
I never again shall feel your warm hearth flushed,
Panting with passion, naked unto mine,
Until the throbbing world around is hushed
To quiet worship at our scented shrine. 
Nor will your glory seek my swarthy face,
To kindle and to change my jaded frame
Into a miracle of godlike grace,
Transfigured, bathed in your immortal flame.

Let new flames brush my love-springs like a feather.
But the old fever seizes me to-day,
As sickness grips a soul in wretched weather.
I have given up myself to every urge,
With not a care of precious powers spent,
Have bared my body to the strangest scourge,
To soothe and deaden my heart’s unhealing rent.
But you have torn a nerve out of my frame,
A gut that no physician can replace,
And reft my life of happiness and aim.
Oh what new purpose shall I now embrace?
What substance hold, what lovely form pursue,
When my thought burns through everything to you?

Swiftly it overwhelms and conquers me!
Jasmines, night jasmines, perfect of perfume,
Heavy with dew before the dawn of day!
Your face was in the mirror. I could see
You smile and vanish suddenly away,
Leaving behind the vestige of a tear.
Sad suffering face, from parting grown so dear!
Night jasmines cannot bloom in this cold place;
Without the street is wet and weird with snow;
The cold nude trees are tossing to and fro;
Too stormy is the night for your fond face,
For your low voice too loud the wind's mad roar.
But Oh, your scent --- jasmines, jasmines. that grow
Luxuriant, clustered round your cottage door!

       <collex:text>No servile little fear shall daunt my will
This morning. I have courage steeled to say
I will be lazy, conqueringly still,
I will not lose the hours in toil this day.
The roaring world without, careless of souls,
Shall leave me to my placid dream of rest,
My four walls shield me from its shouting ghouls,
And all its hates have fled my quiet breast.
And I will loll here resting, wide awake,
Dead to the world of work, the world of love,
I laze contented just for dreaming’s sake
With not the slightest urge to think or move.
How tired unto death, how tired I was!
Now for a day I put my burdens by,
And like a child amidst the meadow grass
Under the southern sun, I languid lie
And feel the bed about me kindly deep,
My strength ooze gently from my hollow bones,
My worried brain drift aimlessly to sleep,
Like softening to a song of tuneful tones.

       <collex:text>I.
Not once in all our days of poignant love,
Did I a single instant give to thee
My undivided being wholly free.
Not all thy potent passion could remove
The barrier that loomed between to prove
The full supreme surrendering of me.
Oh, I was beaten, helpless utterly
Against the shadow-fact with which I strove.
For when a cruel power forced me to face
The truth which poisoned our illicit wine,
That even I was faithless to my race
Bleeding beneath the iron hand of thine,
Our union seemed a monstrous thing and base!
I was an outcast from thy world and mine.
II
Adventure-seasoned and storm-buffeted,
I shun all signs of anchorage, because
The zest of life exceeds the bound of laws.
New gales of tropic fury round my head
Break lashing me through hours of soulful dread;
But when the terror thins and, spent, withdraws,
Leaving me wondering awhile, I pause—
But soon again the risky ways I tread!
No rigid road for me, no peace, no rest,
While molten elements run through my blood;
And beauty-burning bodies manifest
Their warm, heart-melting motions to be wooed;
And passion boldly rising in my breast,
Like rivers of the Spring, lets loose its flood.

       <collex:text>Nay, why reproach each other, be unkind,
For there’s no plane on which we two may meet?
Let’s both forgive, forget, for both were blind,
And life is of a day, and time is fleet.
And I am fire, swift to flame and burn,
Melting with elements high overhead,
While you are water in an earthly urn,
All pure, but heavy, and of hue like lead.

Though you pursue and worry me about;
As well put forth my swarthy arm to stop
The wild wind howling, darkly mad without.
The night is yours for revels; day will light.
I will not fight you, bold and tigerish,
For I am weak, while you are gaining strength;
Peace! cease tormenting me to have your wish.
But when you’re filled and sated with the flesh,
I shall go swiftly to the silver stream,
To cleanse my body for the spirit’s sake,
And sun my limbs, and close my eyes to dream.

Toying and turning slowly in her lair.
Oh, I would never ask for more of thee;
Thou art so clean in passion and so fair.
Enough! if thou wilt ask no more of mel

       <collex:text>I
Throughout the afternoon I watched them there,
Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky,
Whirling fantastic in the misty air,
Contending fierce for space supremacy.
And they flew down a mightier force at night,
As though in heaven there was revolt and riot,
And they, frail things had taken panic flight
Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet.
I went to bed and rose at early dawn
To see them huddled together in a heap,
Each merged into the other upon the lawn,
Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep.
The sun shone brightly on them half the day,
By night they stealthily had stol’n away.
II
And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you
Who came to me upon a winter’s night,
When snow-sprites round my attic window flew,
Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light.
My heart was like the weather when you came,
The wanton winds were blowing loud and long;
But you, with joy and passion all aflame,
You danced and sang a lilting summer song.
I made room for you in my little bed,
Took covers from the closet fresh and warm,
A downful pillow for your scented head,
And lay down with you resting in my arm.
You went with Dawn. You left me ere the day,
The lonely actor of a dreamy play.

       <collex:text>About Soho we went before the light;
We went, unresting six, craving new fun,
New scenes, new raptures for the fevered night
Of rollicking laughter, drink and song, was done.
The vault was void, but for the dawn’s great star
That shed upon our path its silver flame,
When La Paloma on a low guitar
Abruptly from a darkened casement came—
Harlem! All else shut out, I saw the hall,
And you in your red shoulder sash come dancing
With Val against me languid by the wall,
Your burning coffee-colored eyes keen glancing
Aslant at mine, proud in your golden glory!
I loved you, Cuban girl, fond sweet Diory.

Scented and warm against my beating breast;
To whisper soft and quivering your name,
And drink the passion burning in your frame;
To lie at full length, taut, with cheek to cheek,
And tease your mouth with kisses till you speak
Love words, mad words, dream words, sweet senseless words,
Melodious like notes of mating birds;
To hear you ask if I shall love always,
And myself answer: Till the end of days;
To feel your easeful sigh of happiness
When on your trembling lips I murmur: Yes;
It is so sweet. We know it is not true.
What matters it? The night must shed her dew.
We know it is not true, but it is sweet—
The poem with this music is complete.

I want nor wine nor weed; your breath alone
Suffices. In this moment rare and tense
I worship at your breast. The flower is blown,
The saffron petals tempt my amorous mouth,
The yellow heart is radiant now with dew
Soft-scented, redolent of my loved South;
O flower of love! I give myself to you.
Uncovered on your couch of figured green,
Here let us linger indivisible.
The portals of your sanctuary unseen
Receive my offering, yielding unto me.
Oh, with our love the night is warm and deep!
The air is sweet, my flower, and sweet the flute
Whose music lulls our burning brain to sleep,
While we lie loving, passionate and mute.

       <collex:text>O lonely heart so timid of approach,
the shy tropic flower that shuts its lips
To the faint touch of tender finger tips:
What is your word? What question would you broach?
Your lustrous-warm eyes are too sadly kind
To mask the meaning of your dreamy tale,
Your guarded life too exquisitely frail
Against the daggers of my warring mind.
There is no part of the unyielding earth,
Even bare rocks where the eagles build their nest,
Will give us undisturbed and friendly rest.
No dewfall softens this vast belt of dearth.
But in the socket-chiseled teeth of strife,
That gleam in serried files in all the lands,
We may join hungry, understanding hands,
And drink our share of ardent love and life.

       <collex:text>All yesterday it poured, and all night long
I could not sleep; the rain unceasing beat
Upon the shingled roof like a weird song,
Upon the grass like running children’s feet.
And down the mountains by the dark cloud kissed,
Like a strange shape in filmy veiling dressed,
Slid slowly, silently, the wraith-like mist,
And nestled soft against the earth’s wet breast.
But lo, there was a miracle at dawn!
The still air stirred at touch of the faint breeze,
The sun a sheet of gold bequeathed the lawn,
The songsters twittered in the rustling trees.
And all things were transfigured in the day,
But me whom radiant beauty could not move;
For you, more wonderful, were far away,
And I was blind with hunger for your love.

For all the passions agitating me;
For all my bitterness thou art too tender,
I cannot pour my red soul into thee.
O haunting melody! thou art too slender,
Too fragile like a globe of crystal glass;
For all my stormy thoughts thou art too slender,
The burden from my bosom will not pass.
O tender word! O melody so slender!
O tears of passion saturate with brine,
O words, unwilling words, ye can not render
My hatred for the foe of me and mine.

       <collex:text>There is a lovely noise about your name,
Above the shoutings of the city clear,
More than a moment’s merriment, whose claim
Will greater grow with every mellowed year.
The people will not bear you down the street,
Dancing to the strong rhythm of your words,
The modern kings will throttle you to greet
The piping voice of artificial birds.
But rare lonely spirits, even mine,
Who love the immortal music of all days,
Will see the glory of your trailing line,
The bedded beauty of your haunting lays.

       <collex:text>Far down, down through the city’s great, gaunt gut
The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;
In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut,
Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.
And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door
To give their summer jackets to the breeze;
Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar
Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas;
Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift
Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,
Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift
Lightly among the islands of the deep;
Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white
That lend their perfume to the tropic sea,
Where fields lie idle in the dew drenched night,
And the Trades float above them fresh and free.

       <collex:text>No engines shrieking rescue storm the night,
And hose and hydrant cannot here avail;
The flames laugh high and fling their challenging light,
And clouds turn gray and black from silver-pale.
The fire leaps out and licks the ancient walls,
And the big building bends and twists and groans.
A bar drops from its place; a rafter falls
Burning the flowers. The wind in frenzy moans.
The watchers gaze, held wondering by the fire,
The dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd,
The flames beyond themselves rise higher, higher,
To lose their glory in the frowning cloud,
Yielding at length the last reluctant breath.
And where life lay asleep broods darkly death.

       <collex:text>This volume aims to document the New Negro culturally and socially,—to register the transformations of the inner and outer life of the Negro in America that have so significantly taken place in the last few years. There is ample evidence of a New Negro in the latest phases of social change and progress, but still more in the internal world of the Negro mind and spirit. Here in the very heart of the folk-spirit are the essential forces, and folk interpretation is truly vital and representative only in terms of these. Of all the voluminous literature on the Negro, so much is mere external view and commentary that we may warrantably say that nine-tenths of it is about the Negro rather than of him, so that it is the Negro problem rather than the Negro that is known and mooted in the general mind. We turn therefore in the other direction to the elements of truest social portraiture, and discover in the artistic self-expression of the Negro to-day a new figure on the national canvas and a new force in the foreground of affairs. Whoever wishes to see the Negro in his essential traits, in the full perspective of his achievement and possibilities, must seek the enlightenment of that self-portraiture which the present developments of Negro culture are offering. In these pages, without ignoring either the fact that there are important interactions between the national and the race life, or that the attitude of America toward the Negro is as important a factor as the attitude of the Negro toward America, we have nevertheless concentrated upon self-expression and the forces and motives of self-determination. So far as he is culturally articulate, we shall let the Negro speak for himself.
Yet the New Negro must be seen in the perspective of a New World, and especially of a New America. Europe seething in a dozen centers with emergent nationalities, Palestine full of a renascent Judaism—these are no more alive with the progressive forces of our era than the quickened centers of the lives of black folk. America seeking a new spiritual expansion and artistic maturity, trying to found an American literature, a national art, and national music implies a Negro-American culture seeking the same satisfactions and objectives. Separate as it may be in color and substance, the culture of the Negro is of a pattern integral with the times and with its cultural setting. The achievements of the present generation have eventually made this apparent. Liberal minds to-day cannot be asked to peer with sympathetic curiosity into the darkened Ghetto of a segregated race life. That was yesterday. Nor must they expect to find a mind and soul bizarre and alien as the mind of a savage, or even as naive and refreshing as the mind of the peasant or the child. That too was yesterday, and the day before. Now that there is cultural adolescence and the approach to maturity,—there has come a development that makes these phases of Negro life only an interesting and significant segment of the general American scene.
Until recently, except for occasional discoveries of isolated talent here and there, the main stream of this development has run in the special channels of “race literature” and “race journalism.” Particularly as a literary movement, it has gradually gathered momentum in the effort and output of such progressive race periodicals as The Crisis under the editorship of Dr. Du Bois and more lately, through the quickening encouragement of Charles Johnson, in the brilliant pages of Opportunity, a Journal of Negro Life. But more and more the creative talents of the race have been taken up into the general journalistic, literary and artistic agencies, as the wide range of the acknowledgments of the material here collected will in itself be sufficient to demonstrate. Recently in a project of The Survey Graphic, whose Harlem Number of March, 1925, has been taken by kind permission as the nucleus of this book, the whole movement was presented as it is epitomized in the progressive Negro community of the American metropolis. Enlarging this stage we are now presenting The New Negro in a national and even international scope. Although there are few centers that can be pointed out approximating Harlem’s significance, the full significance of that even is a racial awakening on a national and perhaps even a world scale.
That is why our comparison is taken with those nascent movements of folk-expression and self-determination which are playing a creative part in the world to-day. The galvanizing shocks and reactions of the last few years are making by subtle processes of internal reorganization a race out of its own disunited and apathetic elements. A race experience penetrated in this way invariably flowers. As in India, in China, in Egypt, Ireland, Russia, Bohemia, Palestine and Mexico, we are witnessing the resurgence of a people: it has aptly been said,—“For all who read the signs aright, such a dramatic flowering of a new race-spirit is taking place close at home—among American Negroes.”
Negro life is not only establishing new contacts and founding new centers, it is finding a new soul. There is a fresh spiritual and cultural focusing. We have, as the heralding sign, an unusual outburst of creative expression. There is a renewed race-spirit that consciously and proudly sets itself apart. Justifiably then, we speak of the offerings of this book embodying these ripening forces as culled from the first fruits of the Negro Renaissance.

       <collex:text>THE NEW NEGRO
ALAIN LOCKE
In the last decade something beyond the watch and guard of statistics has happened in the life of the American Negro and the three norns who have traditionally presided over the Negro problem have a changeling in their laps. The Sociologist, the Philanthropist, the Race-leader are not unaware of the New Negro, but they are at a loss to account for him. He simply cannot be swathed in their formulæ. For the younger generation is vibrant with a new psychology; the new spirit is awake in the masses, and under the very eyes of the professional observers is transforming what has been a perennial problem into the progressive phases of contemporary Negro life.
Could such a metamorphosis have taken place as suddenly as it has appeared to? The answer is no; not because the New Negro is not here, but because the Old Negro had long become more of a myth than a man. The Old Negro, we must remember, was a creature of moral debate and historical controversy. His has been a stock figure perpetuated as an historical fiction partly in innocent sentimentalism, partly in deliberate reactionism. The Negro himself has contributed his share to this through a sort of protective social mimicry forced upon him by the adverse circumstances of dependence. So for generations in the mind of America, the Negro has been more of a formula than a human being—a something to be argued about, condemned or defended, to be “kept down,” or “in his place,” or “helped up,” to be worried with or worried over, harassed or patronized, a social bogey or a social burden. The thinking Negro even has been induced to share this same general attitude, to focus his attention on controversial issues, to see himself in the distorted perspective of a social problem. His shadow, so to speak, has been more real to him than his personality. Through having had to appeal from the unjust stereotypes of his oppressors and traducers to those of his liberators, friends and benefactors he has had to subscribe to the traditional positions from which his case has been viewed. Little true social or self-understanding has or could come from such a situation.
But while the minds of most of us, black and white, have thus burrowed in the trenches of the Civil War and Reconstruction, the actual march of development has simply flanked these positions, necessitating a sudden reorientation of view. We have not been watching in the right direction; set North and South on a sectional axis, we have not noticed the East till the sun has us blinking.
Recall how suddenly the Negro spirituals revealed themselves; suppressed for generations under the stereotypes of Wesleyan hymn harmony, secretive, half-ashamed, until the courage of being natural brought them out—and behold, there was folk-music. Similarly the mind of the Negro seems suddenly to have slipped from under the tyranny of social intimidation and to be shaking off the psychology of imitation and implied inferiority. By shedding the old chrysalis of the Negro problem we are achieving something like a spiritual emancipation. Until recently, lacking self-understanding, we have been almost as much of a problem to ourselves as we still are to others. But the decade that found us with a problem has left us with only a task. The multitude perhaps feels as yet only a strange relief and a new vague urge, but the thinking few know that in the reaction the vital inner grip of prejudice has been broken.
With this renewed self-respect and self-dependence, the life of the Negro community is bound to enter a new dynamic phase, the buoyancy from within compensating for whatever pressure there may be of conditions from without. The migrant masses, shifting from countryside to city, hurdle several generations of experience at a leap, but more important, the same thing happens spiritually in the life-attitudes and self-expression of the Young Negro, in his poetry, his art, his education and his new outlook, with the additional advantage, of course, of the poise and greater certainty of knowing what it is all about. From this comes the promise and warrant of a new leadership. As one of them has discerningly put it:
We have tomorrow
Bright before us
Like a flame.
Yesterday, a night-gone thing
A sun-down name.
And dawn today
Broad arch above the road we came.
We march!
(Langston Hughes, "Youth" [1924]) 
This is what, even more than any “most creditable record of fifty years of freedom,” requires that the Negro of to-day be seen through other than the dusty spectacles of past controversy. The day of “aunties,” “uncles” and “mammies” is equally gone. Uncle Tom and Sambo have passed on, and even the “Colonel” and “George” play barnstorm rôles from which they escape with relief when the public spotlight is off. The popular melodrama has about played itself out, and it is time to scrap the fictions, garret the bogeys and settle down to a realistic facing of facts.
First we must observe some of the changes which since the traditional lines of opinion were drawn have rendered these quite obsolete. A main change has been, of course, that shifting of the Negro population which has made the Negro problem no longer exclusively or even predominantly Southern. Why should our minds remain sectionalized, when the problem itself no longer is? Then the trend of migration has not only been toward the North and the Central Midwest, but city-ward and to the great centers of industry—the problems of adjustment are new, practical, local and not peculiarly racial. Rather they are an integral part of the large industrial and social problems of our present-day democracy. And finally, with the Negro rapidly in process of class differentiation, if it ever was warrantable to regard and treat the Negro en masse it is becoming with every day less possible, more unjust and more ridiculous.
In the very process of being transplanted, the Negro is becoming transformed.
The tide of Negro migration, northward and city-ward, is not to be fully explained as a blind flood started by the demands of war industry coupled with the shutting off of foreign migration, or by the pressure of poor crops coupled with increased social terrorism in certain sections of the South and Southwest. Neither labor demand, the boll-weevil nor the Ku Klux Klan is a basic factor, however contributory any or all of them may have been. The wash and rush of this human tide on the beach line of the northern city centers is to be explained primarily in terms of a new vision of opportunity, of social and economic freedom, of a spirit to seize, even in the face of an extortionate and heavy toll, a chance for the improvement of conditions. With each successive wave of it, the movement of the Negro becomes more and more a mass movement toward the larger and the more democratic chance—in the Negro’s case a deliberate flight not only from countryside to city, but from medieval America to modern.
Take Harlem as an instance of this. Here in Manhattan is not merely the largest Negro community in the world, but the first concentration in history of so many diverse elements of Negro life. It has attracted the African, the West Indian, the Negro American; has brought together the Negro of the North and the Negro of the South; the man from the city and the man from the town and village; the peasant, the student, the business man, the professional man, artist, poet, musician, adventurer and worker, preacher and criminal, exploiter and social outcast. Each group has come with its own separate motives and for its own special ends, but their greatest experience has been the finding of one another. Proscription and prejudice have thrown these dissimilar elements into a common area of contact and interaction. Within this area, race sympathy and unity have determined a further fusing of sentiment and experience. So what began in terms of segregation becomes more and more, as its elements mix and react, the laboratory of a great race-welding. Hitherto, it must be admitted that American Negroes have been a race more in name than in fact, or to be exact, more in sentiment than in experience. The chief bond between them has been that of a common condition rather than a common consciousness; a problem in common rather than a life in common. In Harlem, Negro life is seizing upon its first chances for group expression and self-determination. It is—or promises at least to be—a race capital. That is why our comparison is taken with those nascent centers of folk-expression and self-determination which are playing a creative part in the world to-day. Without pretense to their political significance, Harlem has the same rôle to play for the New Negro as Dublin has had for the New Ireland or Prague for the New Czechoslovakia.
Harlem, I grant you, isn’t typical—but it is significant, it is prophetic. No sane observer, however sympathetic to the new trend, would contend that the great masses are articulate as yet, but they stir, they move, they are more than physically restless. The challenge of the new intellectuals among them is clear enough—the “race radicals” and realists who have broken with the old epoch of philanthropic guidance, sentimental appeal and protest. But are we after all only reading into the stirrings of a sleeping giant the dreams of an agitator? The answer is in the migrating peasant. It is the “man farthest down” who is most active in getting up. One of the most characteristic symptoms of this is the professional man, himself migrating to recapture his constituency after a vain effort to maintain in some Southern corner what for years back seemed an established living and clientele. The clergyman following his errant flock, the physician or lawyer trailing his clients, supply the true clues. In a real sense it is the rank and file who are leading, and the leaders who are following. A transformed and transforming psychology permeates the masses.
When the racial leaders of twenty years ago spoke of developing race-pride and stimulating race-consciousness, and of the desirability of race solidarity, they could not in any accurate degree have anticipated the abrupt feeling that has surged up and now pervades the awakened centers. Some of the recognized Negro leaders and a powerful section of white opinion identified with “race work” of the older order have indeed attempted to discount this feeling as a “passing phase,” an attack of “race nerves” so to speak, an “aftermath of the war,” and the like. It has not abated, however, if we are to gauge by the present tone and temper of the Negro press, or by the shift in popular support from the officially recognized and orthodox spokesmen to those of the independent, popular, and often radical type who are unmistakable symptoms of a new order. It is a social disservice to blunt the fact that the Negro of the Northern centers has reached a stage where tutelage, even of the most interested and well-intentioned sort, must give place to new relationships, where positive self-direction must be reckoned with in ever increasing measure. The American mind must reckon with a fundamentally changed Negro.
The Negro too, for his part, has idols of the tribe to smash. If on the one hand the white man has erred in making the Negro appear to be that which would excuse or extenuate his treatment of him, the Negro, in turn, has too often unnecessarily excused himself because of the way he has been treated. The intelligent Negro of to-day is resolved not to make discrimination an extenuation for his shortcomings in performance, individual or collective; he is trying to hold himself at par, neither inflated by sentimental allowances nor depreciated by current social discounts. For this he must know himself and be known for precisely what he is, and for that reason he welcomes the new scientific rather than the old sentimental interest. Sentimental interest in the Negro has ebbed. We used to lament this as the falling off of our friends; now we rejoice and pray to be delivered both from self-pity and condescension. The mind of each racial group has had a bitter weaning, apathy or hatred on one side matching disillusionment or resentment on the other; but they face each other to-day with the possibility at least of entirely new mutual attitudes.
It does not follow that if the Negro were better known, he would be better liked or better treated. But mutual understanding is basic for any subsequent cooperation and adjustment. The effort toward this will at least have the effect of remedying in large part what has been the most unsatisfactory feature of our present stage of race relationships in America, namely the fact that the more intelligent and representative elements of the two race groups have at so many points got quite out of vital touch with one another.
The fiction is that the life of the races is separate, and increasingly so. The fact is that they have touched too closely at the unfavorable and too lightly at the favorable levels.
While inter-racial councils have sprung up in the South, drawing on forward elements of both races, in the Northern cities manual laborers may brush elbows in their everyday work, but the community and business leaders have experienced no such interplay or far too little of it. These segments must achieve contact or the race situation in America becomes desperate. Fortunately this is happening. There is a growing realization that in social effort the co-operative basis must supplant long-distance philanthropy, and that the only safeguard for mass relations in the future must be provided in the carefully maintained contacts of the enlightened minorities of both race groups. In the intellectual realm a renewed and keen curiosity is replacing the recent apathy; the Negro is being carefully studied, not just talked about and discussed. In art and letters, instead of being wholly caricatured, he is being seriously portrayed and painted.
To all of this the New Negro is keenly responsive as an augury of a new democracy in American culture. He is contributing his share to the new social understanding. But the desire to be understood would never in itself have been sufficient to have opened so completely the protectively closed portals of the thinking Negro’s mind. There is still too much possibility of being snubbed or patronized for that. It was rather the necessity for fuller, truer self-expression, the realization of the unwisdom of allowing social discrimination to segregate him mentally, and a counter-attitude to cramp and fetter his own living—and so the “spite-wall” that the intellectuals built over the “color-line” has happily been taken down. Much of this reopening of intellectual contacts has centered in New York and has been richly fruitful not merely in the enlarging of personal experience, but in the definite enrichment of American art and letters and in the clarifying of our common vision of the social tasks ahead.
The particular significance in the re-establishment of contact between the more advanced and representative classes is that it promises to offset some of the unfavorable reactions of the past, or at least to re-surface race contacts somewhat for the future. Subtly the conditions that are molding a New Negro are molding a new American attitude.
However, this new phase of things is delicate; it will call for less charity but more justice; less help, but infinitely closer understanding. This is indeed a critical stage of race relationships because of the likelihood, if the new temper is not understood, of engendering sharp group antagonism and a second crop of more calculated prejudice. In some quarters, it has already done so. Having weaned the Negro, public opinion cannot continue to paternalize. The Negro to-day is inevitably moving forward under the control largely of his own objectives. What are these objectives? Those of his outer life are happily already well and finally formulated, for they are none other than the ideals of American institutions and democracy. Those of his inner life are yet in process of formation, for the new psychology at present is more of a consensus of feeling than of opinion, of attitude rather than of program. Still some points seem to have crystallized.
Up to the present one may adequately describe the Negro’s “inner objectives” as an attempt to repair a damaged group psychology and reshape a warped social perspective. Their realization has required a new mentality for the American Negro. And as it matures we begin to see its effects; at first, negative, iconoclastic, and then positive and constructive. In this new group psychology we note the lapse of sentimental appeal, then the development of a more positive self-respect and self-reliance; the repudiation of social dependence, and then the gradual recovery from hyper-sensitiveness and “touchy” nerves, the repudiation of the double standard of judgment with its special philanthropic allowances and then the sturdier desire for objective and scientific appraisal; and finally the rise from social disillusionment to race pride, from the sense of social debt to the responsibilities of social contribution, and offsetting the necessary working and commonsense acceptance of restricted conditions, the belief in ultimate esteem and recognition. Therefore the Negro to-day wishes to be known for what he is, even in his faults and shortcomings, and scorns a craven and precarious survival at the price of seeming to be what he is not. He resents being spoken of as a social ward or minor, even by his own, and to being regarded a chronic patient for the sociological clinic, the sick man of American Democracy. For the same reasons, he himself is through with those social nostrums and panaceas, the so-called “solutions” of his “problem,” with which he and the country have been so liberally dosed in the past. Religion, freedom, education, money—in turn, he has ardently hoped for and peculiarly trusted these things; he still believes in them, but not in blind trust that they alone will solve his life-problem.
Each generation, however, will have its creed, and that of the present is the belief in the efficacy of collective effort, in race co-operation. This deep feeling of race is at present the mainspring of Negro life. It seems to be the outcome of the reaction to proscription and prejudice; an attempt, fairly successful on the whole, to convert a defensive into an offensive position, a handicap into an incentive. It is radical in tone, but not in purpose and only the most stupid forms of opposition, misunderstanding or persecution could make it otherwise. Of course, the thinking Negro has shifted a little toward the left with the world-trend, and there is an increasing group who affiliate with radical and liberal movements. But fundamentally for the present the Negro is radical on race matters, conservative on others, in other words, a “forced radical,” a social protestant rather than a genuine radical. Yet under further pressure and injustice iconoclastic thought and motives will inevitably increase. Harlem’s quixotic radicalisms call for their ounce of democracy to-day lest to-morrow they be beyond cure.
The Negro mind reaches out as yet to nothing but American wants, American ideas. But this forced attempt to build his Americanism on race values is a unique social experiment, and its ultimate success is impossible except through the fullest sharing of American culture and institutions. There should be no delusion about this. American nerves in sections unstrung with race hysteria are often fed the opiate that the trend of Negro advance is wholly separatist, and that the effect of its operation will be to encyst the Negro as a benign foreign body in the body politic. This cannot be—even if it were desirable. The racialism of the Negro is no limitation or reservation with respect to American life; it is only a constructive effort to build the obstructions in the stream of his progress into an efficient dam of social energy and power. Democracy itself is obstructed and stagnated to the extent that any of its channels are closed. Indeed they cannot be selectively closed. So the choice is not between one way for the Negro and another way for the rest, but between American institutions frustrated on the one hand and American ideals progressively fulfilled and realized on the other.
There is, of course, a warrantably comfortable feeling in being on the right side of the country’s professed ideals. We realize that we cannot be undone without America’s undoing. It is within the gamut of this attitude that the thinking Negro faces America, but with variations of mood that are if anything more significant than the attitude itself. Sometimes we have it taken with the defiant ironic challenge of McKay:
Mine is the future grinding down to-day
Like a great landslip moving to the sea,
Bearing its freight of débris far away
Where the green hungry waters restlessly
Heave mammoth pyramids, and break and roar
Their eerie challenge to the crumbling shore.
(Claude McKay, "To the Intrenched Classes" [1922])
Sometimes, perhaps more frequently as yet, it is taken in the fervent and almost filial appeal and counsel of Weldon Johnson’s:
O Southland, dear Southland!
Then why do you still cling
To an idle age and a musty page,
To a dead and useless thing?
(James Weldon Johnson, "O Southland" [1917])
But between defiance and appeal, midway almost between cynicism and hope, the prevailing mind stands in the mood of the same author’s To America, an attitude of sober query and stoical challenge:
How would you have us, as we are?
Or sinking ’neath the load we bear,
Our eyes fixed forward on a star,
Or gazing empty at despair?
Rising or falling? Men or things?
With dragging pace or footsteps fleet?
Strong, willing sinews in your wings,
Or tightening chains about your feet?
(James Weldon Johnson, "To America") 
More and more, however, an intelligent realization of the great discrepancy between the American social creed and the American social practice forces upon the Negro the taking of the moral advantage that is his. Only the steadying and sobering effect of a truly characteristic gentleness of spirit prevents the rapid rise of a definite cynicism and counter-hate and a defiant superiority feeling. Human as this reaction would be, the majority still deprecate its advent, and would gladly see it forestalled by the speedy amelioration of its causes. We wish our race pride to be a healthier, more positive achievement than a feeling based upon a realization of the shortcomings of others. But all paths toward the attainment of a sound social attitude have been difficult; only a relatively few enlightened minds have been able as the phrase puts it “to rise above” prejudice. The ordinary man has had until recently only a hard choice between the alternatives of supine and humiliating submission and stimulating but hurtful counter-prejudice. Fortunately from some inner, desperate resourcefulness has recently sprung up the simple expedient of fighting prejudice by mental passive resistance, in other words by trying to ignore it. For the few, this manna may perhaps be effective, but the masses cannot thrive upon it.
Fortunately there are constructive channels opening out into which the balked social feelings of the American Negro can flow freely.
Without them there would be much more pressure and danger than there is. These compensating interests are racial but in a new and enlarged way. One is the consciousness of acting as the advance-guard of the African peoples in their contact with Twentieth Century civilization; the other, the sense of a mission of rehabilitating the race in world esteem from that loss of prestige for which the fate and conditions of slavery have so largely been responsible. Harlem, as we shall see, is the center of both these movements; she is the home of the Negro’s “Zionism.” The pulse of the Negro world has begun to beat in Harlem. A Negro newspaper carrying news material in English, French and Spanish, gathered from all quarters of America, the West Indies and Africa has maintained itself in Harlem for over five years. Two important magazines, both edited from New York, maintain their news and circulation consistently on a cosmopolitan scale. Under American auspices and backing, three pan-African congresses have been held abroad for the discussion of common interests, colonial questions and the future co-operative development of Africa. In terms of the race question as a world problem, the Negro mind has leapt, so to speak, upon the parapets of prejudice and extended its cramped horizons. In so doing it has linked up with the growing group consciousness of the dark-peoples and is gradually learning their common interests. As one of our writers has recently put it: “It is imperative that we understand the white world in its relations to the non-white world.” As with the Jew, persecution is making the Negro international.
As a world phenomenon this wider race consciousness is a different thing from the much asserted rising tide of color. Its inevitable causes are not of our making. The consequences are not necessarily damaging to the best interests of civilization. Whether it actually brings into being new Armadas of conflict or argosies of cultural exchange and enlightenment can only be decided by the attitude of the dominant races in an era of critical change. With the American Negro, his new internationalism is primarily an effort to recapture contact with the scattered peoples of African derivation. Garveyism may be a transient, if spectacular, phenomenon, but the possible rôle of the American Negro in the future development of Africa is one of the most constructive and universally helpful missions that any modern people can lay claim to.
Constructive participation in such causes cannot help giving the Negro valuable group incentives, as well as increased prestigé at home and abroad. Our greatest rehabilitation may possibly come through such channels, but for the present, more immediate hope rests in the revaluation by white and black alike of the Negro in terms of his artistic endowments and cultural contributions, past and prospective. It must be increasingly recognized that the Negro has already made very substantial contributions, not only in his folk-art, music especially, which has always found appreciation, but in larger, though humbler and less acknowledged ways. For generations the Negro has been the peasant matrix of that section of America which has most undervalued him, and here he has contributed not only materially in labor and in social patience, but spiritually as well. The South has unconsciously absorbed the gift of his folk-temperament. In less than half a generation it will be easier to recognize this, but the fact remains that a leaven of humor, sentiment, imagination and tropic nonchalance has gone into the making of the South from a humble, unacknowledged source. A second crop of the Negro’s gifts promises still more largely. He now becomes a conscious contributor and lays aside the status of a beneficiary and ward for that of a collaborator and participant in American civilization. The great social gain in this is the releasing of our talented group from the arid fields of controversy and debate to the productive fields of creative expression. The especially cultural recognition they win should in turn prove the key to that revaluation of the Negro which must precede or accompany any considerable further betterment of race relationships. But whatever the general effect, the present generation will have added the motives of self-expression and spiritual development to the old and still unfinished task of making material headway and progress. No one who understandingly faces the situation with its substantial accomplishment or views the new scene with its still more abundant promise can be entirely without hope. And certainly, if in our lifetime the Negro should not be able to celebrate his full initiation into American democracy, he can at least, on the warrant of these things, celebrate the attainment of a significant and satisfying new phase of group development, and with it a spiritual Coming of Age.

       <collex:text>THE NEGRO IN AMERICAN LITERATURE
True to his origin on this continent, the Negro was projected into literature by an over-mastering and exploiting hand. In the generations that he has been so voluminously written and talked about he has been accorded as little artistic justice as social justice. Ante-bellum literature imposed the distortions of moralistic controversy and made the Negro a wax-figure of the market place: post-bellum literature retaliated with the condescending reactions of sentiment and caricature, and made the Negro a genre stereotype. Sustained, serious or deep study of Negro life and character has thus been entirely below the horizons of our national art. Only gradually through the dull purgatory of the Age of Discussion, has Negro life eventually issued forth to an Age of Expression.
Perhaps I ought to qualify this last statement that the Negro was in American literature generations before he was part of it as a creator. From his very beginning in this country the Negro has been, without the formal recognition of literature and art, creative. During more than two centuries of an enslaved peasantry, the race has been giving evidence, in song and story lore, of an artistic temperament and psychology precious for itself as well as for its potential use and promise in the sophisticated forms of cultural expression. Expressing itself with poignancy and a symbolic imagery unsurpassed, indeed, often unmatched, by any folk-group, the race in servitude was at the same time the finest national expression of emotion and imagination and the most precious mass of raw material for literature America was producing. Quoting these stanzas of James Weldon Johnson’s "O Black and Unknown Bards," I want you to catch the real point of its assertion of the Negro’s way into domain of art:
O black and unknown bards of long ago,
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel’s lyre?
Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
That from degraded rest and servile toil
The fiery spirit of the seer should call
These simple children of the sun and soil.
O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
You—you, alone, of all the long, long line
Of those who’ve sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.
How misdirected was the American imagination, how blinded by the dust of controversy and the pall of social hatred and oppression, not to have found it irresistibly urgent to make literary use of the imagination and emotion it possessed in such abundance.
• • • • •
Controversy and moral appeal gave us Uncle Tom’s Cabin,—the first conspicuous example of the Negro as a subject for literary treatment. Published in 1852, it dominated in mood and attitude the American literature of a whole generation; until the body of Reconstruction literature with its quite different attitude came into vogue. Here was sentimentalized sympathy for a down-trodden race, but one in which was projected a character, in Uncle Tom himself, which has been unequalled in its hold upon the popular imagination to this day. But the moral gain and historical effect of Uncle Tom have been an artistic loss and setback. The treatment of Negro life and character, overlaid with these forceful stereotypes, could not develop into artistically satisfactory portraiture.
Just as in the anti-slavery period, it had been impaled upon the dilemmas of controversy, Negro life with the Reconstruction, became involved in the paradoxes of social prejudice. Between the Civil War and the end of the century the subject of the Negro in literature is one that will some day inspire the literary historian with a magnificent theme. It will be magnificent not because there is any sharp emergence of character or incidents, but because of the immense paradox of racial life which came up thunderingly against the principles and doctrines of democracy, and put them to the severest test that they had known. But in literature, it was a period when Negro life was a shuttlecock between the two extremes of humor and pathos. The Negro was free, and was not free. The writers who dealt with him for the most part refused to see more than skin-deep,—the grin, the grimaces and the picturesque externalities. Occasionally there was some penetration into the heart and flesh of Negro characters, but to see more than the humble happy peasant would have been to flout the fixed ideas and conventions of an entire generation. For more than artistic reasons, indeed against them, these writers refused to see the tragedy of the Negro and capitalized his comedy. The social conscience had as much need for this comic mask as the Negro. However, if any of the writers of the period had possessed gifts of genius of the first caliber, they would have penetrated this deceptive exterior of Negro life, sounded the depths of tragedy in it, and produced a masterpiece.
American literature still feels the hold of this tradition and its indulgent sentimentalities. Irwin Russell was the first to discover the happy, care-free, humorous Negro. He became a fad. It must be sharply called to attention that the tradition of the ante-bellum Negro is a post-bellum product, stranger in truth than in fiction. Contemporary realism in American fiction has not only recorded his passing, but has thrown serious doubts upon his ever having been a very genuine and representative view of Negro life and character. At best this school of Reconstruction fiction represents the romanticized high-lights of a régime that as a whole was a dark, tragic canvas. At most, it presents a Negro true to type for less than two generations. Thomas Nelson Page, kindly perhaps, but with a distant view and a purely local imagination did little more than paint the conditions and attitudes of the period contemporary with his own manhood, the restitution of the over-lordship of the defeated slave owners in the Eighties. George W. Cable did little more than idealize the aristocratic tradition of the Old South with the Negro as a literary foil. The effects, though not the motives of their work, have been sinister. The “Uncle” and the “Mammy” traditions, unobjectionable as they are in the setting of their day and generation, and in the atmosphere of sentimental humor, can never stand as the great fiction of their theme and subject: the great period novel of the South has yet to be written. Moreover, these type pictures have degenerated into reactionary social fetishes, and from that descended into libelous artistic caricature of the Negro; which has hampered art quite as much as it has embarrassed the Negro.
Of all of the American writers of this period, Joel Chandler Harris has made the most permanent contribution in dealing with the Negro. There is in his work both a deepening of interest and technique. Here at least we have something approaching true portraiture. But much as we admire this lovable personality, we are forced to say that in the Uncle Remus stories the race was its own artist, lacking only in its illiteracy the power to record its speech. In the perspective of time and fair judgment the credit will be divided, and Joel Chandler Harris regarded as a sort of providentially provided amanuensis for preserving the folk tales and legends of a race. The three writers I have mentioned do not by any means exhaust the list of writers who put the Negro into literature during the last half of the nineteenth century. Mr. Howells added a shadowy note to his social record of American life with An Imperative Duty and prophesied the Fiction of the Color Line. But his moral scruples—the persistent artistic vice in all his novels—prevented him from consummating a just union between his heroine with a touch of Negro blood and his hero. It is useless to consider any others, because there were none who succeeded in creating either a great story or a great character out of Negro life. Two writers of importance I am reserving for discussion in the group of Negro writers I shall consider presently. One ought perhaps to say in justice to the writers I have mentioned that their nonsuccess was more largely due to the limitations of their social view than of their technical resources. As white Americans of their day, it was incompatible with their conception of the inequalities between the races to glorify the Negro into the serious and leading position of hero or heroine in fiction. Only one man that I recall, had the moral and artistic courage to do this, and he was Stephen Crane in a short story called The Monster. But Stephen Crane was a genius, and therefore could not besmirch the integrity of an artist.
With Thomas Dixon, of The Leopard’s Spots, we reach a distinct stage in the treatment of the Negro in fiction. The portraiture here descends from caricature to libel. A little later with the vogue of the “darkey-story,” and its devotees from Kemble and McAllister to Octavus Roy Cohen, sentimental comedy in the portrayal of the Negro similarly degenerated to blatant but diverting farce. Before the rise of a new attitude, these represented the bottom reaction, both in artistic and social attitude. Reconstruction fiction was passing out in a flood of propagandist melodrama and ridicule. One hesitates to lift this material up to the plane of literature even for the purposes of comparison. But the gradual climb of the new literature of the Negro must be traced and measured from these two nadir points. Following The Leopard’s Spots, it was only occasionally during the next twenty years that the Negro was sincerely treated in fiction by white authors. There were two or three tentative efforts to dramatize him. Sheldon’s The N-----, was the one notable early effort. And in fiction Paul Kester’s His Own Country is, from a purely literary point of view, its outstanding performance. This type of novel failed, however, to awaken any general interest. This failure was due to the illogical treatment of the human situations presented. However indifferent and negative it may seem, there is the latent desire in most readers to have honesty of purpose and a full vision in the artist: and especially in fiction, a situation handled with gloves can never be effectively handled.
The first hint that the American artist was looking at this subject with full vision was in Torrence’s Granny Maumee. It was drama, conceived and executed for performance on the stage, and therefore had a restricted appeal. But even here the artist was concerned with the primitive instincts of the Race, and, though faithful and honest in his portrayal, the note was still low in the scale of racial life. It was only a short time, however, before a distinctly new development took place in the treatment of Negro life by white authors. This new class of work honestly strove to endow the Negro life with purely æsthetic vision and values, but with one or two exceptions, still stuck to the peasant level of race experience, and gave, unwittingly, greater currency to the popular notion of the Negro as an inferior, superstitious, half-ignorant and servile class of folk. Where they did in a few isolated instances recognize an ambitious impulse, it was generally defeated in the course of the story.
Perhaps this is inevitable with an alien approach, however well-intentioned. The folk lore attitude discovers only the lowly and the naïve: the sociological attitude finds the problem first and the human beings after, if at all. But American art in a reawakened seriousness, and using the technique of the new realism, is gradually penetrating Negro life to the core. George Madden Martin, with her pretentious foreword to a group of short stories, The Children in the Mist,—and this is an extraordinary volume in many ways—quite seriously tried, as a Southern woman, to elevate the Negro to a higher plane of fictional treatment and interest. In succession, followed Mary White Ovington’s The Shadow, in which Miss Ovington daringly created the kinship of brother and sister between a black boy and white girl, had it brought to disaster by prejudice, out of which the white girl rose to a sacrifice no white girl in a novel had hitherto accepted and endured; then Shands’ White and Black, as honest a piece of fiction with the Negro as a subject as was ever produced by a Southern pen—and in this story, also, the hero, Robinson, making an equally glorious sacrifice for truth and justice as Miss Ovington’s heroine; Clement Wood’s N-----, with defects of treatment, but admirable in purpose, wasted though, I think, in the effort to prove its thesis on wholly illogical material; and lastly, T. S. Stribling’s Birthright, more significant than any of these other books, in fact, the most significant novel on the Negro written by a white American, and this in spite of its totally false conception of the character of Peter Siner.
Mr. Stribling’s book broke ground for a white author in giving us a Negro hero and heroine. There is an obvious attempt to see objectively. But the formula of the Nineties,—atavistic race-heredity, still survives and protrudes through the flesh and blood of the characters. Using Peter as a symbol of the man tragically linked by blood to one world and by training and thought to another, Stribling portrays a tragic struggle against the pull of lowly origins and sordid environment. We do not deny this element of tragedy in Negro life,—and Mr. Stribling, it must also be remembered, presents, too, a severe indictment in his painting of the Southern conditions which brought about the disintegration of his hero’s dreams and ideals. But the preoccupation, almost obsession of otherwise strong and artistic work like O’Neill’s Emperor Jones, All God’s Chillun Got Wings, and Culbertson’s Goat Alley with this same theme and doubtful formula of hereditary cultural reversion suggests that, in spite of all good intentions, the true presental of the real tragedy of Negro life is a task still left for Negro writers to perform. This is especially true for those phases of culturally representative race life that as yet have scarcely at all found treatment by white American authors. In corroborating this, let me quote a passage from a recent number of the Independent, on the Negro novelist which reads:
“During the past few years stories about Negroes have been extremely popular. A magazine without a Negro story is hardly living up to its opportunities. But almost every one of these stories is written in a tone of condescension. The artists have caught the contagion from the writers, and the illustrations are ninety-nine times out of a hundred purely slapstick stuff. Stories and pictures make a Roman holiday for the millions who are convinced that the most important fact about the Negro is that his skin is black. Many of these writers live in the South or are from the South. Presumably they are well acquainted with the Negro, but it is a remarkable fact that they almost never tell us anything vital about him, about the real human being in the black man’s skin. Their most frequent method is to laugh at the colored man and woman, to catalogue their idiosyncrasies, their departure from the norm, that is, from the ways of the whites. There seems to be no suspicion in the minds of the writers that there may be a fascinating thought life in the minds of the Negroes, whether of the cultivated or of the most ignorant type. Always the Negro is interpreted in the terms of the white man. White-man psychology is applied and it is no wonder that the result often shows the Negro in a ludicrous light.”

I shall have to run back over the years to where I began to survey the achievement of Negro authorship. The Negro as a creator in American literature is of comparatively recent importance. All that was accomplished between Phyllis Wheatley [sic] and Paul Laurence Dunbar, considered by critical standards, is negligible, and of historical interest only. Historically it is a great tribute to the race to have produced in Phyllis Wheatley not only the slave poetess in eighteenth century Colonial America, but to know she was as good, if not a better, poetess than Ann Bradstreet whom literary historians give the honor of being the first person of her sex to win fame as a poet in America.
Negro authorship may, for clearer statement, be classified into three main activities: Poetry, Fiction, and the Essay, with an occasional excursion into other branches. In the drama, until very recently, practically nothing worth while has been achieved, with the exception of Angelina Grimke’s Rachel, notable for its sombre craftsmanship. Biography has given us a notable life story, told by himself, of Booker T. Washington. Frederick Douglass’s story of his life is eloquent as a human document, but not in the graces of narration and psychologic portraiture, which has definitely put this form of literature in the domain of the fine arts. Indeed, we may well believe that the efforts of controversy, of the huge amount of discursive and polemical articles dealing chiefly with the race problem, that have been necessary in breaking and clearing the impeded pathway of racial progress, have absorbed and in a way dissipated the literary energy of many able Negro writers.
Let us survey briefly the advance of the Negro in poetry. Behind Dunbar, there is nothing that can stand the critical test. We shall always have a sentimental and historical interest in those forlorn and pathetic figures who cried in the wilderness of their ignorance and oppression. With Dunbar we have our first authentic lyric utterance, an utterance more authentic, I should say, for its faithful rendition of Negro life and character than for any rare or subtle artistry of expression. When Mr. Howells, in his famous introduction to the Lyrics of Lowly Life, remarked that Dunbar was the first black man to express the life of his people lyrically, he summed up Dunbar’s achievement and transported him to a place beside the peasant poet of Scotland, not for his art, but precisely because he made a people articulate in verse.
The two chief qualities in Dunbar’s work are, however, pathos and humor, and in these he expresses that dilemma of soul that characterized the race between the Civil War and the end of the nineteenth century. The poetry of Dunbar is true to the life of the Negro and expresses characteristically what he felt and knew to be the temper and condition of his people. But its moods reflect chiefly those of the era of Reconstruction and just a little beyond,—the limited experience of a transitional period, the rather helpless and subservient era of testing freedom and reaching out through the difficulties of life to the emotional compensations of laughter and tears. It is the poetry of the happy peasant and the plaintive minstrel. Occasionally, as in the sonnet to Robert Gould Shaw and the "Ode to Ethiopia" there broke through Dunbar, as through the crevices of his spirit, a burning and brooding aspiration, an awakening and virile consciousness of race. But for the most part, his dreams were anchored to the minor whimsies; his deepest poetic inspiration was sentiment. He expressed a folk temperament, but not a race soul. Dunbar was the end of a régime, and not the beginning of a tradition, as so many careless critics, both white and colored, seem to think.
After Dunbar many versifiers appeared,—all largely dominated by his successful dialect work. I cannot parade them here for tag or comment, except to say that few have equalled Dunbar in this vein of expression, and none have deepened it as an expression of Negro life. Dunbar himself had clear notions of its limitations;—to a friend in a letter from London, March 15, 1897, he says: “I see now very clearly that Mr. Howells has done me irrevocable harm in the dictum he laid down regarding my dialect verse.” Not until James W. Johnson published his Fiftieth Anniversary Ode on the emancipation in 1913, did a poet of the race disengage himself from the background of mediocrity into which the imitation of Dunbar snared Negro poetry. Mr. Johnson’s work is based upon a broader contemplation of life, life that is not wholly confined within any racial experience, but through the racial he made articulate that universality of the emotions felt by all mankind. His verse possesses a vigor which definitely breaks away from the brooding minor undercurrents of feeling which have previously characterized the verse of Negro poets. Mr. Johnson brought, indeed, the first intellectual substance to the content of our poetry, and a craftsmanship which, less spontaneous than that of Dunbar’s, was more balanced and precise.
Here a new literary generation begins; poetry that is racial in substance, but with the universal note, with the conscious background of the full heritage of English poetry. With each new figure somehow the gamut broadens and the technical control improves. The brilliant succession and maturing powers of Fenton Johnson, Leslie Pinckney Hill, Everett Hawkins, Lucien Watkins, Charles Bertram Johnson, Joseph Cotter, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Roscoe Jameson and Anne Spencer bring us at last to Claude McKay and the poets of the younger generation and a poetry of the masterful accent and high distinction. Too significantly for mere coincidence, it was the stirring year of 1917 that heard the first real masterful accent in Negro poetry. In the September Crisis of that year, Roscoe Jameson’s "Negro Soldiers" appeared:
These truly are the Brave,
These men who cast aside
Old memories to walk the blood-stained pave
Of Sacrifice, joining the solemn tide
That moves away, to suffer and to die
For Freedom—when their own is yet denied!
O Pride! A Prejudice! When they pass by
Hail them, the Brave, for you now crucified.
The very next month, under the pen name of Eli Edwards, Claude McKay printed in The Seven Arts,
THE HARLEM DANCER
Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;
Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
Blown by black players upon a picnic day.
She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,
The light gauze hanging loose about her form;
To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm
Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.
Upon her swarthy neck black, shiny curls
Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise
The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls
Devoured her with their eager, passionate gaze;
But, looking at her falsely-smiling face
I knew her self was not in that strange place.
With Georgia Johnson, Anne Spencer and Angelina Grimke, the Negro woman poet significantly appears. Mrs. Johnson especially has voiced in true poetic spirit the lyric cry of Negro womanhood. In spite of lapses into the sentimental and the platitudinous, she has an authentic gift. Anne Spencer, more sophisticated, more cryptic but also more universal, reveals quite another aspect of poetic genius. Indeed, it is interesting to notice how to-day Negro poets waver between the racial and the universal notes.
Claude McKay, the poet who leads his generation, is a genius meshed in this dilemma. His work is caught between the currents of the poetry of protest and the poetry of expression; he is in turn the violent and strident propagandist, using his poetic gifts to clothe arrogant and defiant thoughts, and then the pure lyric dreamer, contemplating life and nature with a wistful sympathetic passion. When the mood of "Spring in New Hampshire" or the sonnet "The Harlem Dancer" possesses him, he is full of that spirit and power of beauty that flowers above any and all men’s harming. How different in spite of the admirable spirit of courage and defiance, are his poems of which the sonnet "If We Must Die" is a typical example. Negro poetic expression hovers for the moment, pardonably perhaps, over the race problem, but its highest allegiance is to Poetry—it must soar.
• • • • •
Let me refer briefly to a type of literature in which there have been many pens, but a single mind. Dr. Du Bois is the most variously gifted writer which the race has produced. Poet, novelist, sociologist, historian and essayist, he has produced books in all these fields with the exception, I believe, of a formal book of poems, and has given to each the distinction of his clear and exact thinking, and of his sensitive imagination and passionate vision. The Souls of Black Folk was the book of an era; it was a painful book, a book of tortured dreams woven into the fabric of the sociologist’s document. This book has more profoundly influenced the spiritual temper of the race than any other written in its generation. It is only through the intense, passionate idealism of such substance as makes The Souls of Black Folk such a quivering rhapsody of wrongs endured and hopes to be fulfilled that the poets of the race with compelling artistry can lift the Negro into the only full and complete nationalism he knows—that of the American democracy. No other book has more clearly revealed to the nation at large the true idealism and high aspiration of the American Negro.
In this book, as well as in many of Dr. Du Bois’s essays, it is often my personal feeling that I am witnessing the birth of a poet, phoenix-like, out of a scholar. Between The Souls of Black Folk and Darkwater, published four years ago, Dr. Du Bois has written a number of books, none more notable, in my opinion, than his novel The Quest of the Silver Fleece, in which he made Cotton the great protagonist of fate in the lives of the Southern people, both white and black. I only know of one other such attempt and accomplishment in American fiction—that of Frank Norris—and I am somehow of the opinion that when the great epic novel of the South is written this book will prove to have been its forerunner. Indeed, the Negro novel is one of the great potentialities of American literature. Must it be written by a Negro? To recur to the article from which I have already quoted:
“The white writer seems to stand baffled before the enigma and so he expends all his energies on dialect and in general on the Negro’s minstrel characteristics. . . . We shall have to look to the Negro himself to go all the way. It is quite likely that no white man can do it. It is reasonable to suppose that his white psychology will always be in his way. I am not thinking at all about a Negro novelist who shall arouse the world to the horror of the deliberate killings by white mobs, to the wrongs that condemn a free people to political serfdom. I am not thinking at all of the propaganda novel, although there is enough horror and enough drama in the bald statistics of each one of the annual Moton letters to keep the whole army of writers busy. But the Negro novelist, if he ever comes, must reveal to us much more than what a Negro thinks about when he is being tied to a stake and the torch is being applied to his living flesh; much more than what he feels when he is being crowded off the sidewalk by a drunken rowdy who may be his intellectual inferior by a thousand leagues. Such a writer, to succeed in a big sense, would have to forget that there are white readers; he would have to lose self-consciousness and forget that his work would be placed before a white jury. He would have to be careless as to what the white critic might think of it; he would need the self-assurance to be his own critic. He would have to forget for the time being, at least, that any white man ever attempted to dissect the soul of a Negro.”
What I here quote is both an inquiry and a challenge! Well informed as the writer is, he does not seem to detect the forces which are surely gathering to produce what he longs for.
The development of fiction among Negro authors has been, I might almost say, one of the repressed activities of our literary life. A fair start was made the last decade of the nineteenth century when Chestnutt and Dunbar were turning out both short stories and novels. In Dunbar’s case, had he lived, I think his literary growth would have been in the evolution of the Race novel as indicated in The Uncalled and the Sport of the Gods. The former was, I think, the most ambitious literary effort of Dunbar; the latter was his most significant; significant because, thrown against the background of New York City, it displayed the life of the race as a unit, swayed by currents of existence, of which it was and was not a part. The story was touched with that shadow of destiny which gave to it a purpose more important than the mere racial machinery of its plot. But Dunbar in his fiction dealt only successfully with the same world that gave him the inspiration for his dialect poems; though his ambition was to “write a novel that will deal with the educated class of my own people.” Later he writes of The Fanatics: “You do not know how my hopes were planted in that book, but it has utterly disappointed me.” His contemporary, Charles W. Chestnutt, was concerned more primarily with the fiction of the Color Line and the contacts and conflicts of its two worlds. He was in a way more successful. In the five volumes to his credit, he has revealed himself as a fiction writer of a very high order. But after all Mr. Chestnutt is a story-teller of genius transformed by racial earnestness into the novelist of talent. His natural gift would have found freer vent in a flow of short stories like Bret Harte’s, to judge from the facility and power of his two volumes of short stories, The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories and The Conjure Woman. But Mr. Chestnutt’s serious effort was in the field of the novel, where he made a brave and partially successful effort to correct the distortions of Reconstruction fiction and offset the school of Page and Cable. Two of these novels, The Marrow of Tradition and The House Behind the Cedars, must be reckoned among the representative period novels of their time. But the situation was not ripe for the great Negro novelist. The American public preferred spurious values to the genuine; the coinage of the Confederacy was at literary par. Where Dunbar, the sentimentalist, was welcome, Chestnutt, the realist, was barred. In 1905 Mr. Chestnutt wrote The Colonel’s Dream, and thereafter silence fell upon him.
From this date until the past year, with the exception of The Quest of the Silver Fleece, which was published in 1911, there has been no fiction of importance by Negro authors. But then suddenly there comes a series of books, which seems to promise at least a new phase of race fiction, and possibly the era of the major novelists. Mr. Walter White’s novel The Fire in the Flint is a swift moving straightforward story of the contemporary conflicts of black manhood in the South. Coming from the experienced observation of the author, himself an investigator of many lynchings and riots, it is a social document story of first-hand significance and importance; too vital to be labelled and dismissed as propaganda, yet for the same reason too unvarnished and realistic a story to be great art. Nearer to the requirements of art comes Miss Jessie Fauset’s novel There is Confusion. Its distinction is to have created an entirely new milieu in the treatment of the race in fiction. She has taken a class within the race of established social standing, tradition and culture, and given in the rather complex family story of The Marshalls a social document of unique and refreshing value. In such a story, race fiction, detaching itself from the limitations of propaganda on the one hand and genre fiction on the other, emerges from the color line and is incorporated into the body of general and universal art.
Finally in Jean Toomer, the author of Cane, we come upon the very first artist of the race, who with all an artist’s passion and sympathy for life, its hurts, its sympathies, its desires, its joys, its defeats and strange yearnings, can write about the Negro without the surrender or compromise of the artist’s vision. So objective is it, that we feel that it is a mere accident that birth or association has thrown him into contact with the life he has written about. He would write just as well, just as poignantly, just as transmutingly, about the peasants of Russia, or the peasants of Ireland, had experience brought him in touch with their existence. Cane is a book of gold and bronze, of dusk and flame, of ecstasy and pain, and Jean Toomer is a bright morning star of a new day of the race in literature.

       <collex:text>TO A BROWN GIRL
What if his glance is bold and free,
His mouth the lash of whips?
So should the eyes of lovers be,
And so a lover’s lips.
What if no puritanic strain
Confines him to the nice?
He will not pass this way again
Nor hunger for you twice.
Since in the end consort together
Magdalen and Mary,
Youth is the time for careless weather;
Later, lass, be wary.
—Countée Cullen.
TO A BROWN BOY
That brown girl’s swagger gives a twitch
To beauty like a queen;
Lad, never dam your body’s itch
When loveliness is seen.
For there is ample room for bliss
In pride in clean, brown limbs,
And lips know better how to kiss
Than how to raise white hymns.
And when your body’s death gives birth
To soil for spring to crown,
Men will not ask if that rare earth
Was white flesh once, or brown.
—Countée Cullen.
TABLEAU
Locked arm in arm they cross the way,
The black boy and the white,
The golden splendor of the day
The sable pride of night.
From lowered blinds the dark folk stare
And here the fair folk talk,
Indignant that these two should dare
In unison to walk.
Oblivious to look and word
They pass, and see no wonder
That lightning brilliant as a sword
Should blaze the path of thunder.
—Countée Cullen.
HARLEM WINE
This is not water running here,
These thick rebellious streams
That hurtle flesh and bone past fear
Down alleyways of dreams.
This is a wine that must flow on
Not caring how or where,
So it has ways to flow upon
Where song is in the air.
So it can woo an artful flute
With loose, elastic lips,
Its measurement of joy compute
With blithe, ecstatic hips.
—Countée Cullen.
SHE OF THE DANCING FEET SINGS
And what would I do in heaven, pray,
Me with my dancing feet,
And limbs like apple boughs that sway
When the gusty rain winds beat?
And how would I thrive in a perfect place
Where dancing would be sin,
With not a man to love my face,
Nor an arm to hold me in?
The seraphs and the cherubim
Would be too proud to bend
To sing the faery tunes that brim
My heart from end to end.
The wistful angels down in hell
Will smile to see my face,
And understand, because they fell
From that all-perfect place.
—Countée Cullen.
A BROWN GIRL DEAD
With two white roses on her breasts,
White candles at head and feet,
Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;
Lord Death has found her sweet.
Her mother pawned her wedding ring
To lay her out in white;
She’d be so proud she’d dance and sing
To see herself to-night.
—Countée Cullen.
FRUIT OF THE FLOWER
My father is a quiet man
With sober, steady ways;
For simile, a folded fan;
His nights are like his days.
My mother’s life is puritan,
No hint of cavalier,
A pool so calm you’re sure it can
Have little depth to fear.
And yet my father’s eyes can boast
How full his life has been;
There haunts them yet the languid ghost
Of some still sacred sin.
And though my mother chants of God,
And of the mystic river,
I’ve seen a bit of checkered sod
Set all her flesh aquiver.
Why should he deem it pure mischance
A son of his is fain
To do a naked tribal dance
Each time he hears the rain?
Why should she think it devil’s art
That all my songs should be
Of love and lovers, broken heart,
And wild sweet agony?
Who plants a seed begets a bud,
Extract of that same root;
Why marvel at the hectic blood
That flushes this wild fruit?
—Countée Cullen.
IN MEMORY OF COLONEL CHARLES YOUNG
Along the shore the tall, thin grass
That fringes that dark river,
While sinuously soft feet pass,
Begins to bleed and quiver.
The great dark voice breaks with a sob
Across the womb of night;
Above your grave the tom-toms throb,
And the hills are weird with light.
The great dark heart is like a well
Drained bitter by the sky,
And all the honeyed lies they tell
Come there to thirst and die.
No lie is strong enough to kill
The roots that work below;
From your rich dust and slaughtered will
A tree with tongues will grow.
—Countée Cullen.

       <collex:text>THE NEGRO SPEAKS OF RIVERS
I’ve known rivers . . .
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young,
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep,
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when
Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans,
And I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.
I’ve known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers,
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
—Langston Hughes.
AN EARTH SONG
It’s an earth song,—
And I’ve been waiting long for an earth song.
It’s a spring song,—
And I’ve been waiting long for a spring song.
Strong as the shoots of a new plant
Strong as the bursting of new buds
Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother’s womb.
It’s an earth song,
A body-song,
A spring song,—
I have been waiting long for this spring song.
—Langston Hughes.
POEM
Being walkers with the dawn and morning
Walkers with the sun and morning,
We are not afraid of night,
Nor days of gloom,
Nor darkness,
Being walkers with the sun and morning.
—Langston Hughes.
YOUTH
We have to-morrow
Bright before us
Like a flame
Yesterday, a night-gone thing
A sun-down name
And dawn to-day
Broad arch above the road we came,
We march!
—Langston Hughes.
SONG
Lovely, dark, and lonely one,
Bare your bosom to the sun,
Do not be afraid of light
You who are a child of night.
Open wide your arms to life,
Whirl in the wind of pain and strife,
Face the wall with the dark closed gate,
Beat with bare, brown fists
And wait.
—Langston Hughes.
DREAM VARIATION
To fling my arms wide 
In some place of the sun,
To whirl and to dance
Till the bright day is done.
Then rest at cool evening
Beneath a tall tree
While night comes gently
Dark like me.
That is my dream.
To fling my arms wide
In the face of the sun.
Dance! Whirl! Whirl!
Till the quick day is done.
Rest at pale evening,
A tall, slim tree,
Night coming tenderly
Black like me.
—Langston Hughes.
MINSTREL MAN
Because my mouth
Is wide with laughter
And my throat
Is deep with song,
You do not think
I suffer after
I have held my pain
So long.
Because my mouth
Is wide with laughter,
You do not hear
My inner cry,
Because my feet
Are gay with dancing,
You do not know
I die.
—Langston Hughes.
OUR LAND
We should have a land of sun,
Of gorgeous sun,
And a land of fragrant water
Where the twilight is a soft bandanna handkerchief
Of rose and gold,
And not this land
Where life is cold.
We should have a land of trees,
Of tall thick trees,
Bowed down with chattering parrots
Brilliant as the day,
And not this land where birds are gray.
Ah, we should have a land of joy,
Of love and joy and wine and song,
And not this land where joy is wrong.
—Langston Hughes.
I TOO
I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes.
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
To-morrow
I’ll sit at the table
When company comes
Nobody ’11 dare
Say to me,
“Eat in the kitchen”
Then.
Besides, they’ll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed,—
I, too, am America.
—Langston Hughes.

       <collex:text>BAPTISM
Into the furnace let me go alone;
Stay you without in terror of the heat.
I will go naked in—for thus ’tis sweet—
Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.
I will not quiver in the frailest bone,
You will not note a flicker of defeat;
My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,
Nor mouth give utterance to any moan.
The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;
Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.
Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,
Transforming me into a shape of flame.
I will come out, back to your world of tears,
A stronger soul within a finer frame.
—Claude McKay.
WHITE HOUSES
Your door is shut against my tightened face,
And I am sharp as steel with discontent;
But I possess the courage and the grace
To bear my anger proudly and unbent.
The pavement slabs burn loose beneath my feet,
A chafing savage, down the decent street,
And passion rends my vitals as I pass,
Where boldly shines your shuttered door of glass.
Oh I must search for wisdom every hour,
Deep in my wrathful bosom sore and raw,
And find in it the superhuman power
To hold me to the letter of your law!
Oh I must keep my heart inviolate
Against the potent poison of your hate.
—Claude McKay.
LIKE A STRONG TREE
Like a strong tree that in the virgin earth
Sends far its roots through rock and loam and clay,
And proudly thrives in rain or time of dearth,
When the dry waves scare rainy sprites away;
Like a strong tree that reaches down, deep, deep,
For sunken water, fluid underground,
Where the great-ringed unsightly blind worms creep,
And queer things of the nether world abound:
So would I live in rich imperial growth,
Touching the surface and the depth of things,
Instinctively responsive unto both,
Tasting the sweets of being and the stings,
Sensing the subtle spell of changing forms,
Like a strong tree against a thousand storms.
—Claude McKay.
RUSSIAN CATHEDRAL
Bow down my soul in worship very low
And in the holy silences be lost.
Bow down before the marble man of woe,
Bow down before the singing angel host.
What jewelled glory fills my spirit’s eye!
What golden grandeur moves the depths of me!
The soaring arches lift me up on high
Taking my breath with their rare symmetry.
Bow down my soul and let the wondrous light
Of Beauty bathe thee from her lofty throne
Bow down before the wonder of man’s might.
Bow down in worship, humble and alone;
Bow lowly down before the sacred sight
Of man’s divinity alive in stone.
—Claude McKay.
THE TROPICS IN NEW YORK
Bananas ripe and green, and ginger root,
Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,
And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit,
Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs.
Set in the window, bringing memories
Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,
And dewy dawns, and mystical blue skies
In benediction over nun-like hills.
My eyes grew dim, and I could no more gaze;
A wave of longing through my body swept,
And, hungry for the old familiar ways,
I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.
—Claude McKay.

       <collex:text>GEORGIA DUSK
The sky, lazily disdaining to pursue
The setting sun, too indolent to hold
A lengthened tournament for flashing gold,
Passively darkens for night’s barbecue,
A feast of moon and men and barking hounds,
An orgy for some genius of the South
With blood-hot eyes and cane-lipped scented mouth,
Surprised in making folk-songs from soul sounds.
The sawmill blows its whistle, buzz-saws stop,
And silence breaks the bud of knoll and hill,
Soft settling pollen where ploughed lands fulfill
Their early promise of a bumper crop.
Smoke from the pyramidal sawdust pile
Curls up, blue ghosts of trees, tarrying low
Where only chips and stumps are left to show
The solid proof of former domicile.
Meanwhile, the men, with vestiges of pomp,
Race memories of king and caravan,
High-priests, an ostrich, and a juju-man,
Go singing through the footpaths of the swamp.
Their voices rise . . . the pine trees are guitars,
Strumming, pine-needles fall like sheets of rain . . .
Their voices rise . . . the chorus of the cane
Is carolling a vesper to the stars.
O singers, resinous and soft your songs
Above the sacred whisper of the pines,
Give virgin lips to cornfield concubines,
Bring dreams of Christ to dusky cane-lipped throngs.
—Jean Toomer.
SONG OF THE SON
Pour, O pour that parting soul in song,
O pour it in the saw-dust glow of night,
Into the velvet pine-smoke air to-night,
And let the valley carry it along,
And let the valley carry it along.
O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree,
So scant of grass, so profligate of pines,
Now just before an epoch’s sun declines
Thy son, in time, I have returned to thee,
Thy son, I have in time returned to thee.
In time, although the sun is setting on
A song-lit race of slaves, it has not set;
Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet
To catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone,
Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone.
O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums,
Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air,
Passing, before they strip the old tree bare
One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes
An everlasting song, a singing tree,
Caroling softly souls of slavery,
What they were, and what they are to me,

       <collex:text>TO SAMUEL COLERIDGE TAYLOR, UPON HEARING HIS
Strange to a sensing motherhood,
Loved as a toy—not understood,
Child of a dusky father, bold;
Frail little captive, exiled, cold.
Oft when the brooding planets sleep,
You through their drowsy empires creep,
Flinging your arms through their empty space,
Seeking the breast of an unknown face.
—Georgia Douglas Johnson.
THE ORDEAL
Ho! my brother,
Pass me not by so scornfully
I’m doing this living of being black,
Perhaps I bear your own life-pack,
And heavy, heavy is the load
That bends my body to the road.
But I have kept a smile for fate,
I neither cry, nor cringe, nor hate,
Intrepidly, I strive to bear
This handicap. The planets wear
The Maker’s imprint, _and with mine
I swing into their rhythmic line;
I ask—only for destiny,
Mine, not thine.
—Georgia Douglas Johnson.
ESCAPE
Shadows, shadows,
Hug me round
So that I shall not be found
By sorrow:
She pursues me
Everywhere,
I can’t lose her
Anywhere.
Fold me in your black
Abyss,
She will never look
In this,—
Shadows, shadows,
Hug me round
In your solitude
Profound.
—Georgia Douglas Johnson.
THE RIDDLE
White men’s children spread over the earth—
A rainbow suspending the drawn swords of birth,
Uniting and blending the races in one
The world man—cosmopolite—everyman’s son!
He channels the stream of the red blood and blue,
Behold him! A Triton—the peer of the two;
Unriddle this riddle of “outside in”
White men’s children in black men’s skin.
—Georgia Douglas Johnson.

The chisel fell, or it might have been
You had borne so long the yoke of men.
Lady, Lady, I saw your hands,
Twisted, awry, like crumpled roots,
Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub,
Wrinkled and drawn from your rub-a-dub.
Lady, Lady, I saw your heart,
And altared there in its darksome place
Were the tongues of flame the ancients knew,
Where the good God sits to spangle through.

The moonlight:
Juice flowing from an over-ripe pomegranate

The cossack-crested palm trees:
motionless
The leopard spotted shade:
inciting fear
silence seeds sown . . .
PART II
Medicine Dance
A body smiling with black beauty Leaping into the air
Around a grotesque hyena-faced monster: The Sorcerer—
A black body—dancing with beauty
Clothed in African moonlight,
Smiling more beauty into its body.
The hyena-faced monster yelps!
Echo!
Silence—
The dance
Leaps—
Twirls—
The twirling body comes to a fall
At the feet of the monster.
Yelps—
Wild—
Terror-filled—
Echo—
The hyena-faced monster jumps
starts,

chases his own yelps back to the wilderness.
The black body clothed in moonlight
Raises up its head,
Holding a face dancing with delight.
Terror reigns like a new crowned king.

       <collex:text>THE TASK OF NEGRO WOMANHOOD 
Elise Johnson McDougald 
Throughout the years of history, woman has been the weather-vane, the indicator, showing in which direction the wind of destiny blows. Her status and development have augured now calm and stability, now swift currents of progress. What then is to be said of the Negro woman of today, whose problems are of such import to her race? 
A study of her contributions to any one community, throughout America, would illuminate the pathway being trod by her people. There is, however, an advantage in focusing upon the women of Harlem — modern city in the world’s metropolis. Here, more than anywhere else, the Negro woman is free from the cruder handicaps of primitive household hardships and the grosser forms of sex and race subjugation. Here, she has considerable opportunity to measure her powers in the intellectual and industrial fields of the great city. The questions naturally arise: “What are her difficulties?” and, “How is she solving them?” 
To answer these questions, one must have in mind not any one Negro woman, but rather a colorful pageant of individuals, each differently endowed. Like the red and yellow of the tiger-lily, the skin of one is brilliant against the star-lit darkness of a racial sister. From grace to strength, they vary in infinite degree, with traces of the race’s history left in physical and mental outline on each. With a discerning mind, one catches the multiform charm, beauty and character of Negro women, and grasps the fact that their problems cannot be thought of in mass. 
Because only a few have caught this vision, even in New York, the general attitude of mind causes the Negro woman serious difficulty. She is conscious that what is left of chivalry is not directed toward her. She realizes that the ideals of beauty, built up in the fine arts, have excluded her almost entirely. Instead, the grotesque Aunt Jemimas of the street-car advertisements, proclaim only an ability to serve, without grace of loveliness. Nor does the drama catch her finest spirit. She is most often used to provoke the mirthless laugh of ridicule; or to portray feminine viciousness or vulgarity not peculiar to Negroes. This is the shadow over her. To a race naturally sunny comes the twilight of self-doubt and a sense of personal inferiority. It cannot be denied that these are potent and detrimental influences, though not generally recognized because they are in the realm of the mental and spiritual. More apparent are the economic handicaps which follow her recent entrance into industry. It is conceded that she has special difficulties because of the poor working conditions and low wages of her men. It is not surprising that only the most determined women forge ahead to results other than mere survival. To the gifted, the zest of meeting a challenge is a compensating factor which often brings success. The few who do prove their mettle, stimulate one to a closer study of how this achievement is won under contemporary conditions. 
Better to visualize the Negro woman at her job, our vision of a host of individuals must once more resolve itself into groups on the basis of activity. First, comes a very small leisure group — the wives and daughters of men who are in business, in the professions and a few well-paid personal service occupations. Second, a most active and progressive group, the women in business and the professions. Third, the many women in the trades and industry. Fourth, a group weighty in numbers struggling on in domestic service, with an even less fortunate fringe of casual workers, fluctuating with the economic temper of the times. 
The first is a pleasing group to see. It is picked for outward beauty by Negro men with much the same feeling as other Americans of the same economic class. Keeping their women free to preside over the family, these women are affected by the problems of every wife and mother, but touched only faintly by their race’s hardships. They do share acutely in the prevailing difficulty of finding competent household help. 
Negro wives find Negro maids unwilling generally to work in their own neighborhoods, for various reasons. They do not wish to work where there is a possibility of acquaintances coming into contact with them while they serve and they still harbor the misconception that Negroes of any station are unable to pay as much as persons of the other race. It is in these homes of comparative ease that we find the polite activities of social exclusiveness. The luxuries of well-appointed homes, modest motors, tennis, golf and country clubs, trips to Europe and California, make for social standing. The problem confronting the refined Negro family is to know others of the same achievement. The search for kindred spirits gradually grows less difficult; in the past it led to the custom of visiting all the large cities in order to know similar groups of cultured Negro people. In recent years, the more serious minded Negro woman’s visit to Europe has been extended from months to years for the purpose of study and travel. The European success which meets this type of ambition is instanced in the conferring of the doctorate in philosophy upon a Negro woman, Dr. Anna J. Cooper, at the last commencement of the Sorbonne, Paris. Similarly, a score of Negro women are sojourning abroad in various countries for the spiritual relief and cultural stimulation afforded there. 
A spirit of stress and struggles characterizes the second two groups. These women of business, profession and trade are the hub of the wheel of progress. Their burden is twofold. Many are wives and mothers whose husbands are insufficiently paid, or who have succumbed to social maladjustment and have abandoned their families. An appalling number are widows. They face the great problem of leaving home each day and at the same time trying to rear children in their spare time — this, too, in neighborhoods where rents are large, standards of dress and recreation high and costly, and social danger on the increase. One cannot resist the temptation to pause for a moment and pay tribute to these Negro mothers. And to call attention to the service she is rendering to the nation, in her struggle against great odds to educate and care for one group of the country’s children. If the mothers of the race should ever be honored by state or federal legislation, the artist’s imagination will find a more inspiring subject in the modern Negro mother — self-directed but as loyal and tender as the much extolled, yet pitiable black mammy of slavery days. 
The great commercial life of New York City is only slightly touched by the Negro woman, of our second group. Negro business men offer her most of their work, but their number is limited. Outside of this field in Negro offices, custom is once more against her, and competition is keen for all. However, Negro girls are training and some are holding exceptional jobs. One of the professors in a New York college has had a young colored woman as secretary for the past three or four years. Another holds the head clerical position in an organization where reliable handling of detail and a sense of business ethics are essential. Quietly these women prove their worth, so that when a vacancy exists and there is a call, it is difficult to find even one competent colored secretary who is not employed. As a result of the opportunity in clerical work in the educational system of New York City, a number have qualified for such positions, one having been recently appointed to the office of a high school. In other departments, the civil service in New York City is no longer free from discrimination. The casual personal interview, that tenacious and retrogressive practice introduced into the federal administration during the World War, has spread and often nullifies the Negro woman’s success in written tests. The successful young woman cited above was three times “turned down” as undesirable on the basis of the personal interview. In the great mercantile houses, the many young Negro girls who might be well suited to sales positions are barred from all but menial positions. Even so, one Negro woman, beginning as a uniformed maid in the shoe department of one of the largest stores, has pulled herself up to the position of ahead of stock.” One of the most prosperous monthly magazines of national circulation has for the head of its news service a Negro woman who rose from the position of stenographer. Her duties involve attendance upon staff conferences, executive supervision of her staff of white office workers, broadcasting and journalism of the highest order. 
Yet in spite of the claims of justice and proved efficiency, telephone and insurance companies and other corporations which receive considerable patronage from Negroes deny them proportionate employment. Fortunately this is an era of changing customs. There is hope that a less selfish racial attitude will prevail. It is a heartening fact that there is an increasing number of Americans who will lend a hand in the game fight of the worthy. 
Throughout the South, where businesses for Negro patronage are under the control of Negroes to a large extent, there are already many opportunities for Negro women. But, because of the nerve strain and spiritual drain of hostile social conditions in that section, Negro women are turning away from opportunities there to find a freer and fuller life in the North. 
In the less crowded professional vocations, the outlook is more cheerful. In these fields, the Negro woman is dependent largely upon herself and her own race for work. In the legal, dental and medical professions, successful women practitioners have usually worked their way through college and are “managing” on the small fees that can be received from an under-paid public. 
Social conditions in America are hardest upon the Negro because he is lowest in the economic scale. The tendency to force the Negro downward, gives rise to serious social problems and to a consequent demand for trained college women in the profession of social wcrk. The need has been met with a response from young college women, anxious to devote their education and lives toward helping the submerged classes. Much of the social work has been pioneer in nature; the pay has been small, with little possibility of advancement. For, even in work among Negroes, the better paying positions are reserved for whites. The Negro college woman is doing her bit at a sacrifice, along such lines as these: as probation officers, investigators and police women in the correctional departments of the city; as Big Sisters attached to the Children’s Court; as field workers and visitors for relief organizations, missions and churches; as secretaries for traveller’s aid societies; in the many organizations devoted to preventative and educational medicine ; in clinics and hospitals and as boys’ and girls’ welfare workers in recreation and industry. 
In the profession of nursing, there are over three hundred in New York City. In the dark blue linen uniform of Henry Street Visiting Nurse Service, the Negro woman can be seen hurrying earnestly from house to house on her round of free relief to the needy. Again, she is in many other branches of public health nursing, in the public schools, milk stations and diet kitchens. The Negro woman is in the wards of two of the large city hospitals and clinics. After a score of years of service in one such institution, a Negro woman became superintendent of nurses in the war emergency. Deposed after the armistice, though eminently satisfactory, she retained connection with the training school as lecturer, for the inspiration she could be to “her girls.” The growing need for the executive nurse is being successfully met as instanced by the supervisors in day nurseries and private sanitariums, financed and operated in Harlem entirely by Negroes. Throughout the South there is a clear and anxious call to nurses to carry the gospel of hygiene to the rural sections and to minister to the suffering not reached by organizations already in the communities. One social worker, in New York City, though a teacher by profession, is head of an organization whose program is to raise money for the payment of nurses to do the work described above. In other centers, West and South, the professional Negro nurse is supplanting the untrained woman attendant of former years. 
In New York City, nearly three hundred women share in the good conditions obtaining there in the teaching profession. They measure up to the high pedagogical requirements of the city and state law, and are increasingly leaders in the community. In a city where the schools are not segregated, she is meeting with success among white as well as colored children in positions ranging from clerk in the elementary school on up through the graded ranks of teachers in the lower grades, of special subjects in the higher grades, in the junior high schools and in the senior high schools. One Negro woman is assistant principal in an elementary school where the other assistant and the principal are white men and the majority of the teachers white. Another Negro woman serves in the capacity of visiting teacher to several schools, calling upon both white and colored families and experiencing no difficulty in making social adjustments. Still another Negro woman is a vocational counsellor under the Board of Education, in a junior high school. She is advising children of both races as to future courses of study to pursue and as to the vocations in which tests prove them to be apt. This position, the result of pioneer work by another Negro woman, is unique in the school system of New York. 
In the teaching profession, too, the Negro woman finds evidence of the white worker’s fear of competition. The need for teachers is still so great that little friction exists. When it does seem imminent, it is smoothed away, as it recently was at a meeting of school principals. From the floor a discussion began with: “What are we going to do about this problem of the increasing number of Negro teachers coming into our schools?” It ended promptly through the suggestion of another principal: “Send all you get and don’t want over to my school. I have two now and I’ll match their work with any two of the best you name.” Outside of New York City, the Negro woman teacher faces problems almost as difficult as those besetting the pioneers in the field. Night riders are terrorizing the leading educators of the South, with the same tactics used years ago in the burning of buildings and in the threatening of personal injury. Negro teachers in some sections show heroism matching that of such women as Maria Becroft, Mary Wormely, Margaret Thompson, Fannie Hampton, Myrtilla Miner and others who in the early ’8o’s faced riot and violence which closed colored schools and made educational work a hazardous vocation. Throughout the North and South, urban and rural teachers form an earnest and forward-looking group of women. They are endeavoring to hold for the future the progress that has been made in the past. The Negro woman teacher finds that, figuratively speaking, she must stand on her tip toes to do it, for educational standards are no longer what they were. Surrounded by forces which persistently work to establish the myth of his inferiority, the Negro youth must be encouraged to think vigorously and to maintain a critical attitude toward what he is taught. The Negro teacher is bending herself to the task of imparting this power to hold the spiritual and mental balance under hostile conditions. Though her salary in most places lags behind the service she is rendering (exceptions being noted where the Jeannes-Slater and Rosenwald Funds bring relief), her inspiration is the belief that the hope of the race is in the New Negro student. Of more vital import than what he is compelled to be to-day, is what he is determined to make of himself tomorrow. And, the Negro woman teacher, bringing to the class room sympathy and judgment, is a mighty force in this battle. 
Comparatively new are opportunities in the field of trained library work for the Negro woman. In New Y ork City, the Public Library system has opened its service to the employment of colored women of college grade. The vision of those in charge of their training is illuminated by fires that have somewhat of a missionary glow. There is an ever-present hope that, once trained, the Negro woman librarian will, scatter such opportunities across the country, establishing branches wherever none exist. Into such an emergency, the successful Negro woman head of the library of the Veterans5 Hospital at Tuske- gee, stepped from the New York Library on One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street. Recently at this same Harlem Branch Library a Negro woman has been placed in charge of the large, permanent collection of books by or about Negroes and examples of Negro art. Another is acting head of the children’s department, and several others have been assigned to branches throughout the city where there is little or no Negro patronage. They are thus rendering exceptional service, and additionally creating an impetus for the enlargement of this field for Negro women. 
One might go on to such interesting and more unusual professions as bacteriology, chemistry and pharmacy, etc., and find that though the number in any one may be small, the Negro woman is creditably represented in practically every one, and according to ability, she is meeting with success. In the fields of literature and art, the Negro woman’s culture has once more begun to flower. After the long quiescent period, following the harvest from the pen of Phyllis Wheatley, Negro women dramatists, poets and novelists are enjoying a vogue in print. There is every prospect that the Negro woman will enrich American literature and art with stylistic portrayal of her experience and her problems. 
Closing the door on the home anxieties, the women engaged in trades and in industry faces serious difficulty in competition in the open working field. Custom is against the Negro woman in all but a few trade and industrial occupations. She has, however, been established long in the dressmaking trade as helpers and finishers, and more recently as drapers and fitters in some of the best establishments. Several Negro women are themselves proprietors of shops in the country’s great fashion district. In millinery, power-sewing machine operating on cloth, straw and leather, there are few Negro women. The laissez- faire attitude of practically all trade unions has, in the past, made of the Negro woman an unwilling menace to the cause of labor. When one reviews the demands now being made by white women workers, for labor colleges, for political recognition, and for representation at world conferences, one cannot help but feel how far back on the road of labor progress is the struggling group of Negro workers. Yet, they are gradually becoming more alive to the issues involved. One Negro woman has held office and been most active in the flower and feather workers’ union. Another has been a paid organizer in the garment industry for several years. Still another has co-operated as an unpaid worker, in endeavoring to prevent Negro women from breaking union strikes. Pacing with pickets, or explaining at meetings the wisdom underlying union principles, she became convinced that the problem lay as much in the short-sighted, “wait-until-a-strike-comes” policy of the labor unions themselves, as in the alienated or unintelligent attitude of the Negro worker. More sincerity and understanding was greatly needed. Within the past year, she has worked with two Negro men, a white woman and two white men, all union members, and with this committee of six has brought about a conference of accredited delegates from thirty-three unions in New York City. This is the first all-union conference held on adjusting the Negro workers’ problem. As a result, a permanent organization has been formed called the Trade Union Committee for Organizing Negro Workers. Headquarters have been established and a program is well under way which includes: — organizing special industries, manned largely by Negro men and women ; working to bring about changes in the constitutions of trade unions which make it impossible or difficult for Negroes to join; educating both black and white workers in union principles through conferences and speeches; making necessary adjustments among union members of the two races and taking part in righting any grievances of Negro union members. 
In trade cookery, the Negro woman’s talent and past experience is recognized. Her problem here is to find employers who will let her work her way to managerial positions, in tearooms, candy shops and institutions. One such employer be¬ came convinced that the managing cook, a young colored graduate of Pratt Institute, could build up a business that had been failing. Pie offered her a partnership. As in the cases of a number of such women, her barrier was lack of capital. No matter how highly trained, nor how much speed and business acumen has been acquired, the Negro’s credit is held in doubt. An exception in this matter of capital will serve to. prove the rule. Thirty years ago, a young Negro girl began learning all branches of the fur trade. She is now in business for herself, employing three women of her race and one Jewish man. She has made fur experts of still another half-dozen colored girls. Such instances as these justify the prediction that the foothold which is being gained in the trade world will, year by year, become more secure. 
Because of the limited fields for this group, many of the unsuccessful drift into the fourth social grade — the domestic and casual workers. These drifters increase the difficulties of the Negro women suited to housework. New standards of household management are forming and the problem of the Negro woman is to meet these new businesslike ideals. The constant influx of workers unfamiliar with household conditions in New York keeps the situation one of turmoil. The Negro woman, moreover, is revolting against residential domestic service. It is a last stand in her fight to maintain a semblance of family life. For this reason, principally, the number of day or casual workers is on the increase. Happiness is almost impossible under the strain of these conditions. Health and morale suffer, but how else can her children, loose all afternoon, be gathered together at nightfall? Through it all she manages to give satisfactory service and the Negro woman is sought after for this unpopular work, largely because her honesty, loyalty .and cleanliness have stood the test of time. Through her drudgery, the women of other groups find leisure time for progress. This is one of her contributions to America. 
It is apparent from what has been said that even in New York City, Negro women are of a race which is free neither economically, socially nor spiritually. Like women in general, but more particularly like those of other oppressed minorities, the Negro woman has been forced to submit to overpowering conditions. Pressure has been exerted upon her, both from without and within her group. Her emotional and sex life is a reflex of her economic station. The women of the working class will react, emotionally and sexually, similarly to the working-class woman of other races. The Negro woman does not maintain any moral standard which may be assigned chiefly to qualities of race, any more than a white woman does. Yet she has been singled out and advertised as having lower sex standards. Superficial critics who have had contact only with the lower grades of Negro women, claim that they are more immoral than other groups of women. This I deny. This is the sort of criticism which predicates of one race, to its detriment, that which is common to all races. Sex irregularities are not a matter of race, but of socio-economic conditions. Research shows that most of the African tribes from which the Negro sprang have strict codes for sex relations. There is no proof of inherent weakness in the ethnic group. 
Gradually overcoming the habitual limits imposed upon her by slave masters, she increasingly seeks legal sanction for the consummation and dissolution of sex contracts. Contrary to popular belief, illegitimacy among Negroes is cause for shame and grief. When economic, social and biological forces combined bring about unwed motherhood, the reaction is much the same as in families in other racial groups. Secrecy is maintained if possible. Generally the married aunt or even the girl’s mother claims the illegitimate child as her own. The foundling asylum is seldom sought. Schooled in this kind of suffering in the days of slavery, the Negro woman often tempers scorn with sympathy for weakness. Stigma does fall upon the unmarried mother, but perhaps in this matter the Negro s attitude is nearer the modern enlightened ideal for the social treatment of the unfortunate. May not this, too, be considered another contribution to America? 
With all these forces at work, true sex equality has not been approximated. The ratio of opportunity in the sex, social, economic and political spheres is about that which exists between white men and women. In the large, I would say that the Negro woman is the cultural equal of her man because she is generally kept in school longer. Negro boys, like white boys, are usually put to work to subsidize the family income. The growing economic independence of Negro working women is causing her to rebel against the domineering family attitude of the cruder working-class husband. The masses of Negro men are engaged in menial occupations throughout the working day. Their baffled and suppressed desires to determine their economic life are manifested in overbearing domination at home. Working mothers are unable to instill different ideals in the sons. Conditions change slowly. Nevertheless, education and opportunity are modifying the spirit of the younger Negro men. Trained in modern schools of thought, they begin to show a wholesome attitude of fellowship and freedom for their women. The challenge to young Negro womanhood is to see clearly this trend and grasp the proffered comradeship with sincerity. In this matter of sex equality, Negro women have contributed few outstanding militants, a notable instance being the historic Sojourner Truth. On the whole the Negro woman’s feminist efforts are directed chiefly toward the realization of the equality of the races, the sex struggle assuming the subordinate place. 
Obsessed with difficulties which might well compel individualism, the Negro woman has engaged in a considerable amount of organized action to meet group needs. She has evolved a federation of her clubs, embracing between eight and ten thousand women in New York state alone. The state federation is a part of the National Association of Colored Women, which, calling together the women from all parts of the country, engages itself in enterprises of general race interest. The national organization of colored women is now firmly established, and under the presidency of Mrs. Bethune is about to strive for conspicuous goals. 
In New York City, many associations exist for social betterment, financed and operated by Negro women. One makes child welfare its name and special concern. Others, like the Utility Club, Utopia Neighborhood, Debutantes’ League, Sempre Fidelius, etc., raise funds for old folks’ homes, a shelter for delinquent girls and fresh-air camps for children. The Colored Women’s Branch of the Y. W. C. A. and the women’s organizations in the many churches as well as the beneficial lodges and associations, care for the needs of their members. 
On the other hand, the educational welfare of the coming generation has become the chief concern of the national sororities of Negro college women. The first to be organized in the country, the Alpha Kappa Alpha , has a systematized, a continuous program of educational and vocational guidance for students of the high schools and colleges. The work of Lambda Chapter, which covers New York City and its suburbs, has been most effective in carrying out the national program. Each year, it gathers together between one and two hundred such students and gives the girls a chance to hear the life stories of Negro women, successful in various fields of endeavor. Recently a trained nurse told how, starting in the same schools as they, she had risen to the executive position in the Harlem Health Information Bureau. A commercial artist showed how real talent had overcome the color line. The graduate physician was a living example of the modern opportunities in the newer fields of medicine open to women. The vocations, as outlets for the creative instinct, became attractive under the persuasion of the musician, the dressmaker and the decorator. A recent graduate outlined her plans for meeting the many difficulties encountered in establishing a dental office and in building up a practice. A journalist spun the fascinating tale of her years of experience. The Delta Sigma Theta Sorority (national in scope) works along similar lines. Alpha Beta Chapter of New York City, during the current year, presented a young art student with a scholarship of $1,000 for study abroad. In such ways as these are the progressive and privileged groups of Negro women expressing their community and race consciousness. 
We find the Negro woman, figuratively struck in the face daily by contempt from the world about her. Within her soul, she knows little of peace and happiness. But through it all, she is courageously standing erect, developing within herself the moral strength to rise above and conquer false attitudes. She is maintaining her natural beauty and charm and improving her mind and opportunity. She is measuring up to the needs of her family, community and race, and radiating a hope throughout the land. 
The wind of the race’s destiny stirs more briskly because of her striving.

       <collex:text>PREFACE
There is, perhaps, a better excuse for giving an Anthology of American Negro Poetry to the public than can be offered for many of the anthologies that have recently been issued. The public, generally speaking, does not know that there are American Negro poets--to supply this lack of information is, alone, a work worthy of somebody's effort.
Moreover, the matter of Negro poets and the production of literature by the colored people in this country involves more than supplying information that is lacking. It is a matter which has a direct bearing on the most vital of American problems.
A people may become great through many means, but there is only one measure by which its greatness is recognized and acknowledged. The final measure of the greatness of all peoples is the amount and standard of the literature and art they have produced. The world does not know that a people is great until that people produces great literature and art. No people that has produced great literature and art has ever been looked upon by the world as distinctly inferior.
The status of the Negro in the United States' is more a question of national mental attitude toward the race than of actual conditions. And nothing will do more to change that mental attitude and raise his status than a demonstration of intellectual parity by the Negro through the production of literature and art.
Is there likelihood that the American Negro will be able to do this? There is, for the good reason that he possesses the innate powers. He has the emotional endowment, the originality and artistic conception, and, what is more important, the power of creating that which has universal appeal and influence.
I make here what may appear to be a more startling statement by saying that the Negro has already proved the possession of these powers by being the creator of the only things artistic that have yet sprung from American soil and been universally acknowledged as distinctive American products.
These creations by the American Negro may be summed up under four heads. The first two are the Uncle Remus stories, which were collected by Joel Chandler Harris, and the "spirituals" or slave songs, to which the Fisk Jubilee Singers made the public and the musicians of both the United States and Europe listen. The Uncle Remus stories constitute the greatest body of folklore that America has produced, and the "spirituals" the greatest body of folk-song. I shall speak of the "spirituals" later because they are more than folk-songs, for in them the Negro sounded the depths, if he did not scale the heights, of music.
The other two creations are the Cakewalk and ragtime. We do not need to go very far back to remember when cakewalking was the rage in the United States, Europe and South America. Society in this country and royalty abroad spent time in practicing the intricate steps. Paris pronounced it the "poetry of motion." The popularity of the cakewalk passed away but its influence remained. The influence can be seen to-day on any American stage where there is dancing.
The influence which the Negro has exercised on the art of dancing in this country has been almost absolute. For generations the "buck and wing" and the "stop-time" dances, which are strictly Negro, have been familiar to American theatre audiences. A few years ago the public discovered the "turkey trot," the "eagle rock," "ballin' the jack," and several other varieties that started the modern dance craze. These dances were quickly followed by the "tango," a dance originated by the Negroes of Cuba and later transplanted to South America. (This fact is attested by no less authority than Vincente Blasco Ibañez in his "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.") Half the floor space in the country was then turned over to dancing, and highly paid exponents sprang up everywhere. The most noted, Mr. Vernon Castle, and, by the way, an Englishman, never danced except to the music of a colored band, and he never failed to state to his audiences that most of his dances had long been done by "your colored people," as he put it.
Any one who witnesses a musical production in which there is dancing cannot fail to notice the Negro stamp on all the movements; a stamp which even the great vogue of Russian dances that swept the country about the time of the popular dance craze could not affect. That peculiar swaying of the shoulders which you see done everywhere by the blond girls of the chorus is nothing more than a movement from the Negro dance referred to above, the "eagle rock." Occasionally the movement takes on a suggestion of the, now outlawed, "shimmy."
As for Ragtime, I go straight to the statement that it is the one artistic production by which America is known the world over. It has been all-conquering. Everywhere it is hailed as "American music."
For a dozen years or so there has been a steady tendency to divorce Ragtime from the Negro; in fact, to take from him the credit of having
originated it. Probably the younger people of the present generation do not know that Ragtime is of Negro origin. The change wrought in Ragtime and the way in which it is accepted by the country have been brought about chiefly through the change which has gradually been made in the words and stories accompanying the music. Once the text of all Ragtime songs was written in Negro dialect, and was about Negroes in the cabin or in the cotton field or on the levee or at a jubilee or on Sixth Avenue or at a ball, and about their love affairs. To-day, only a small proportion of Ragtime songs relate at all to the Negro. The truth is, Ragtime is now national rather than racial. But that does not abolish in any way the claim of the American Negro as its originator.
Ragtime music was originated by colored piano players in the questionable resorts of St. Louis, Memphis, and other Mississippi River towns. These men did not know any more about the theory of music than they did about the theory of the universe. They were guided by their natural musical instinct and talent, but above all by the Negro's extraordinary sense of rhythm. Any one who is familiar with Ragtime may note that its chief charm is not in melody, but in rhythms. These players often improvised crude and, at times, vulgar words to fit the music. This was the beginning of the Ragtime song.
Ragtime music got its first popular hearing at Chicago during the world's fair in that city. From Chicago it made its way to New York, and then started on its universal triumph.
The earliest Ragtime songs, like Topsy, "jes' grew." Some of these earliest songs were taken down by white men, the words slightly altered or changed, and published under the names of the arrangers. They sprang into immediate popularity and earned small fortunes. The first to become widely known was "The Bully," a levee song which had been long used by roustabouts along the Mississippi. It was introduced in New York by Miss May Irwin, and gained instant popularity. Another one of these "jes' grew" songs was one which for a while disputed for place with Yankee Doodle; perhaps, disputes it even to-day. That song was "A Hot Time in the Old Town To-night"; introduced and made popular by the colored regimental bands during the Spanish-American War.
Later there came along a number of colored men who were able to transcribe the old songs and write original ones. I was, about that time, writing words to music for the music show stage in New York. I was collaborating with my brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and the late Bob Cole. I remember that we appropriated about the last one of the old "jes' grew" songs. It was a song which had been sung for years all through the South. The words were unprintable, but the tune was irresistible, and belonged to nobody. We took it, re-wrote the verses, telling an entirely different story from the original, left the chorus as it was, and published the song, at first under the name of "Will Handy." It became very popular with college boys, especially at football games, and perhaps still is. The song was, "Oh, Didn't He Ramble!"
In the beginning, and for quite a while, almost all of the Ragtime songs that were deliberately composed were the work of colored writers. Now, the colored composers, even in this particular field, are greatly outnumbered by the white.
The reader might be curious to know if the "jes' grew" songs have ceased to grow. No, they have not; they are growing all the time. The country has lately been flooded with several varieties of "The Blues." These "Blues," too, had their origin in Memphis, and the towns along the Mississippi. They are a sort of lament of a lover who is feeling "blue" over the loss of his sweetheart. The "Blues" of Memphis have been adulterated so much on Broadway that they have lost their pristine hue. But whenever you hear a piece of music which has a strain like this in it:

you will know you are listening to something which belonged originally to Beale Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee. The original "Memphis Blues," so far as it can be credited to a composer, must be credited to Mr. W. C. Handy, a colored musician of Memphis.
As illustrations of the genuine Ragtime song in the making, I quote the words of two that were popular with the Southern colored soldiers in
France. Here is the first:
   "Mah mammy's lyin' in her grave,
      Mah daddy done run away,
    Mah sister's married a gamblin' man,
      An' I've done gone astray.
    Yes, I've done gone astray, po' boy,
      An' I've done gone astray,
    Mah sister's married a gamblin' man,
      An' I've done gone astray, po' boy."
These lines are crude, but they contain something of real poetry, of that elusive thing which nobody can define and that you can only tell that it
is there when you feel it. You cannot read these lines without becoming reflective and feeling sorry for "Po' Boy."
Now, take in this word picture of utter dejection:
   "I'm jes' as misabul as I can be,
    I'm unhappy even if I am free,
    I'm feelin' down, I'm feelin' blue;
    I wander 'round, don't know what to do.
    I'm go'n lay mah haid on de railroad line,
    Let de B. &amp;O. come and pacify mah min'."
These lines are, no doubt, one of the many versions of the famous "Blues." They are also crude, but they go straight to the mark. The last two lines move with the swiftness of all great tragedy.
In spite of the bans which musicians and music teachers have placed on it, the people still demand and enjoy Ragtime. In fact, there is not a corner of the civilized world in which it is not known and liked. And this proves its originality, for if it were an imitation, the people of Europe, at least, would not have found it a novelty. And it is proof of a more important thing, it is proof that Ragtime possesses the vital spark, the power to appeal universally, without which any artistic production, no matter how approved its form may be, is dead.
Of course, there are those who will deny that Ragtime is an artistic production. American musicians, especially, instead of investigating Ragtime, dismiss it with a contemptuous word. But this has been the course of scholasticism in every branch of art. Whatever new thing the people like is pooh-poohed; whatever is popular is regarded as not worth while. The fact is, nothing great or enduring in music has ever sprung full-fledged from the brain of any master; the best he gives the world he gathers from the hearts of the people, and runs it through the alembic of his genius.
Ragtime deserves serious attention. There is a lot of colorless and vicious imitation, but there is enough that is genuine. In one composition
alone, "The Memphis Blues," the musician will find not only great melodic beauty, but a polyphonic structure that is amazing.
It is obvious that Ragtime has influenced, and in a large measure, become our popular music; but not many would know that it has influenced
even our religious music. Those who are familiar with gospel hymns can at once see this influence if they will compare the songs of thirty years
ago, such as "In the Sweet Bye and Bye," "The Ninety and Nine," etc., with the up-to-date, syncopated tunes that are sung in Sunday Schools,
Christian Endeavor Societies, Y.M.C.A.'s and like gatherings to-day.
Ragtime has not only influenced American music, it has influenced American life; indeed, it has saturated American life. It has become the popular medium for our national expression musically. And who can say that it does not express the blare and jangle and the surge, too, of our national spirit?
Any one who doubts that there is a peculiar heel-tickling, smile-provoking, joy-awakening, response-compelling charm in Ragtime needs only to hear a skilful performer play the genuine article, needs only to listen to its bizarre harmonies, its audacious resolutions often consisting of an abrupt jump from one key to another, its intricate rhythms in which the accents fall in the most unexpected places but in which the fundamental beat is never lost in order to be convinced. I believe it has its place as well as the music which draws from us sighs and tears.
Now, these dances which I have referred to and Ragtime music may be lower forms of art, but they are evidence of a power that will some day be applied to the higher forms. And even now we need not stop at the Negro's accomplishment through these lower forms. In the "spirituals," or slave songs, the Negro has given America not only its only folksongs, but a mass of noble music. I never think of this music but that I am struck by the wonder, the miracle of its production. How did the men who originated these songs manage to do it? The sentiments are easily accounted for; they are, for the most part, taken from the Bible. But the melodies, where did they come from? Some of them so weirdly sweet, and others so wonderfully strong. Take, for instance, "Go Down, Moses"; I doubt that there is a stronger theme in the whole musical literature of the world.

It is to be noted that whereas the chief characteristic of Ragtime is rhythm, the chief characteristic of the "spirituals" is melody. The melodies of "Steal Away to Jesus," "Swing Low Sweet Chariot," "Nobody Knows de Trouble I See," "I Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray," "Deep River," "O, Freedom Over Me," and many others of these songs possess a beauty that is--what shall I say? poignant. In the riotous rhythms of Ragtime the Negro expressed his irrepressible buoyancy, his keen response to the sheer joy of living; in the "spirituals" he voiced his sense of beauty and his deep religious feeling.
Naturally, not as much can be said for the words of these songs as for the music. Most of the songs are religious. Some of them are songs expressing faith and endurance and a longing for freedom. In the religious songs, the sentiments and often the entire lines are taken bodily from the Bible. However, there is no doubt that some of these religious songs have a meaning apart from the Biblical text. It is evident that the opening lines of "Go Down, Moses,"
   "Go down, Moses,
      'Way down in Egypt land;
    Tell old Pharoah,
      Let my people go."
have a significance beyond the bondage of Israel in Egypt.
The bulk of the lines to these songs, as is the case in all communal music, is made up of choral iteration and incremental repetition of the leader's lines. If the words are read, this constant iteration and repetition are found to be tiresome; and it must be admitted that the lines themselves are often very trite. And, yet, there is frequently revealed a flash of real, primitive poetry. I give the following examples:
   "Sometimes I feel like an eagle in de air."
   "You may bury me in de East,
    You may bury me in de West,
    But I'll hear de trumpet sound
    In-a dat mornin'."
   "I know de moonlight, I know de starlight;
      I lay dis body down.
    I walk in de moonlight, I walk in de starlight;
      I lay dis body down.
    I know de graveyard, I know de graveyard,
      When I lay dis body down.
    I walk in de graveyard, I walk troo de graveyard
      To lay dis body down.
    I lay in de grave an' stretch out my arms;
      I lay dis body down.
    I go to de judgment in de evenin' of de day
      When I lay dis body down.
    An' my soul an' yo' soul will meet in de day
      When I lay dis body down."
Regarding the line, "I lay in de grave an' stretch out my arms," Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson of Boston, one of the first to give these slave
songs serious study, said: "Never it seems to me, since man first lived and suffered, was his infinite longing for peace uttered more plaintively
than in that line."
These Negro folksongs constitute a vast mine of material that has been neglected almost absolutely. The only white writers who have in recent
years given adequate attention and study to this music, that I know of, are Mr. H.E. Krehbiel and Mrs. Natalie Curtis Burlin. We have our native
composers denying the worth and importance of this music, and trying to manufacture grand opera out of so-called Indian themes.
But there is a great hope for the development of this music, and that hope is the Negro himself. A worthy beginning has already been made by
Burleigh, Cook, Johnson, and Dett. And there will yet come great Negro composers who will take this music and voice through it not only the soul of their race, but the soul of America.
And does it not seem odd that this greatest gift of the Negro has been the most neglected of all he possesses? Money and effort have been expended upon his development in every direction except this. This gift has been regarded as a kind of side show, something for occasional exhibition; wherein it is the touchstone, it is the magic thing, it is that by which the Negro can bridge all chasms. No persons, however hostile, can listen to Negroes singing this wonderful music without having their hostility melted down.
This power of the Negro to suck up the national spirit from the soil and create something artistic and original, which, at the same time, possesses the note of universal appeal, is due to a remarkable racial gift of adaptability; it is more than adaptability, it is a transfusive quality.
And the Negro has exercised this transfusive quality not only here in America, where the race lives in large numbers, but in European countries,
where the number has been almost infinitesimal.
Is it not curious to know that the greatest poet of Russia is Alexander Pushkin, a man of African descent; that the greatest romancer of France
is Alexander Dumas, a man of African descent; and that one of the greatest musicians of England is Coleridge-Taylor, a man of African descent?
The fact is fairly well known that the father of Dumas was a Negro of the French West Indies, and that the father of Coleridge-Taylor was a
native-born African; but the facts concerning Pushkin's African ancestry are not so familiar.
When Peter the Great was Czar of Russia, some potentate presented him with a full-blooded Negro of gigantic size. Peter, the most eccentric ruler of modern times, dressed this Negro up in soldier clothes, christened him Hannibal, and made him a special body-guard.
But Hannibal had more than size, he had brain and ability. He not only looked picturesque and imposing in soldier clothes, he showed that he had in him the making of a real soldier. Peter recognized this, and eventually made him a general. He afterwards ennobled him, and Hannibal, later, married one of the ladies of the Russian court. This same Hannibal was great-grandfather of Pushkin, the national poet of Russia, the man who bears the same relation to Russian literature that Shakespeare bears to English literature.
I know the question naturally arises: If out of the few Negroes who have lived in France there came a Dumas; and out of the few Negroes who have lived in England there came a Coleridge-Taylor; and if from the man who was at the time, probably, the only Negro in Russia there sprang that country's national poet, why have not the millions of Negroes in the United States with all the emotional and artistic endowment claimed for
them produced a Dumas, or a Coleridge-Taylor, or a Pushkin?
The question seems difficult, but there is an answer. The Negro in the United States is consuming all of his intellectual energy in this
gruelling race-struggle. And the same statement may be made in a general way about the white South. Why does not the white South produce literature and art? The white South, too, is consuming all of its intellectual energy in this lamentable conflict. Nearly all of the mental efforts of the white South run through one narrow channel. The life of every Southern white man and all of his activities are impassably limited by the ever present Negro problem. And that is why, as Mr. H. L. Mencken puts it, in all that vast region, with its thirty or forty million people and its territory as large as a half a dozen Frances or Germanys, there is not a single poet, not a serious historian, not a creditable composer, not a critic good or bad, not a dramatist dead or alive.
But, even so, the American Negro has accomplished something in pure literature. The list of those who have done so would be surprising both by its length and the excellence of the achievements. One of the great books written in this country since the Civil War is the work of a colored man, "The Souls of Black Folk," by W.E.B. Du Bois.
Such a list begins with Phillis Wheatley. In 1761 a slave ship landed a cargo of slaves in Boston. Among them was a little girl seven or eight
years of age. She attracted the attention of John Wheatley, a wealthy gentleman of Boston, who purchased her as a servant for his wife. Mrs.
Wheatley was a benevolent woman. She noticed the girl's quick mind and determined to give her opportunity for its development. Twelve years later Phillis published a volume of poems. The book was brought out in London, where Phillis was for several months an object of great curiosity and attention.
Phillis Wheatley has never been given her rightful place in American literature. By some sort of conspiracy she is kept out of most of the
books, especially the text-books on literature used in the schools. Of course, she is not a _great_ American poet--and in her day there were
no great American poets--but she is an important American poet. Her importance, if for no other reason, rests on the fact that, save one, she
is the first in order of time of all the women poets of America. And she is among the first of all American poets to issue a volume.
It seems strange that the books generally give space to a mention of Urian
Oakes, President of Harvard College, and to quotations from the crude and
lengthy elegy which he published in 1667; and print examples from the
execrable versified version of the Psalms made by the New England divines,
and yet deny a place to Phillis Wheatley.
Here are the opening lines from the elegy by Oakes, which is quoted from
in most of the books on American literature:
   "Reader, I am no poet, but I grieve.
    Behold here what that passion can do,
    That forced a verse without Apollo's leave,
    And whether the learned sisters would or no."
There was no need for Urian to admit what his handiwork declared. But this
from the versified Psalms is still worse, yet it is found in the books:
   "The Lord's song sing can we? being
    in stranger's land, then let
    lose her skill my right hand if I
    Jerusalem forget."
Anne Bradstreet preceded Phillis Wheatley by a little over twenty years.
She published her volume of poems, "The Tenth Muse," in 1750. Let us
strike a comparison between the two. Anne Bradstreet was a wealthy,
cultivated Puritan girl, the daughter of Thomas Dudley, Governor of Bay
Colony. Phillis, as we know, was a Negro slave girl born in Africa. Let us
take them both at their best and in the same vein. The following stanza is
from Anne's poem entitled "Contemplation":
   "While musing thus with contemplation fed,
    And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain,
    The sweet tongued Philomel percht o'er my head,
    And chanted forth a most melodious strain,
    Which rapt me so with wonder and delight,
    I judged my hearing better than my sight,
    And wisht me wings with her awhile to take my flight."
And the following is from Phillis' poem entitled "Imagination":
   "Imagination! who can sing thy force?
    Or who describe the swiftness of thy course?
    Soaring through air to find the bright abode,
    The empyreal palace of the thundering God,
    We on thy pinions can surpass the wind,
    And leave the rolling universe behind,
    From star to star the mental optics rove,
    Measure the skies, and range the realms above,
    There in one view we grasp the mighty whole,
    Or with new worlds amaze the unbounded soul."
We do not think the black woman suffers much by comparison with the white.
Thomas Jefferson said of Phillis: "Religion has produced a Phillis
Wheatley, but it could not produce a poet; her poems are beneath
contempt." It is quite likely that Jefferson's criticism was directed more
against religion than against Phillis' poetry. On the other hand, General
George Washington wrote her with his own hand a letter in which he thanked
her for a poem which she had dedicated to him. He, later, received her
with marked courtesy at his camp at Cambridge.
It appears certain that Phillis was the first person to apply to George
Washington the phrase, "First in peace." The phrase occurs in her poem
addressed to "His Excellency, General George Washington," written in 1775.
The encomium, "First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his
countrymen" was originally used in the resolutions presented to Congress
on the death of Washington, December, 1799.
Phillis Wheatley's poetry is the poetry of the Eighteenth Century. She
wrote when Pope and Gray were supreme; it is easy to see that Pope was her
model. Had she come under the influence of Wordsworth, Byron or Keats or
Shelley, she would have done greater work. As it is, her work must not be
judged by the work and standards of a later day, but by the work and
standards of her own day and her own contemporaries. By this method of
criticism she stands out as one of the important characters in the making
of American literature, without any allowances for her sex or her
antecedents.
According to "A Bibliographical Checklist of American Negro Poetry,"
compiled by Mr. Arthur A. Schomburg, more than one hundred Negroes in the
United States have published volumes of poetry ranging in size from
pamphlets to books of from one hundred to three hundred pages. About
thirty of these writers fill in the gap between Phillis Wheatley and Paul
Laurence Dunbar. Just here it is of interest to note that a Negro wrote
and published a poem before Phillis Wheatley arrived in this country from
Africa. He was Jupiter Hammon, a slave belonging to a Mr. Lloyd of
Queens-Village, Long Island. In 1760 Hammon published a poem, eighty-eight
lines in length, entitled "An Evening Thought, Salvation by Christ, with
Penettential Cries." In 1788 he published "An Address to Miss Phillis
Wheatley, Ethiopian Poetess in Boston, who came from Africa at eight years
of age, and soon became acquainted with the Gospel of Jesus Christ." These
two poems do not include all that Hammon wrote.
The poets between Phillis Wheatley and Dunbar must be considered more in
the light of what they attempted than of what they accomplished. Many of
them showed marked talent, but barely a half dozen of them demonstrated
even mediocre mastery of technique in the use of poetic material and
forms. And yet there are several names that deserve mention. George M.
Horton, Frances E. Harper, James M. Bell and Alberry A. Whitman, all merit
consideration when due allowances are made for their limitations in
education, training and general culture. The limitations of Horton were
greater than those of either of the others; he was born a slave in North
Carolina in 1797, and as a young man began to compose poetry without being
able to write it down. Later he received some instruction from professors
of the University of North Carolina, at which institution he was employed
as a janitor. He published a volume of poems, "The Hope of Liberty," in
1829.
Mrs. Harper, Bell and Whitman would stand out if only for the reason that
each of them attempted sustained work. Mrs. Harper published her first
volume of poems in 1854, but later she published "Moses, a Story of the
Nile," a poem which ran to 52 closely printed pages. Bell in 1864
published a poem of 28 pages in celebration of President Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation. In 1870 he published a poem of 32 pages in
celebration of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the
Constitution. Whitman published his first volume of poems, a book of 253
pages, in 1877; but in 1884 he published "The Rape of Florida," an epic
poem written in four cantos and done in the Spenserian stanza, and which
ran to 97 closely printed pages. The poetry of both Mrs. Harper and of
Whitman had a large degree of popularity; one of Mrs. Harper's books went
through more than twenty editions.
Of these four poets, it is Whitman who reveals not only the greatest
imagination but also the more skilful workmanship. His lyric power at its
best may be judged from the following stanza from the "Rape of Florida":
   "'Come now, my love, the moon is on the lake;
    Upon the waters is my light canoe;
    Come with me, love, and gladsome oars shall make
    A music on the parting wave for you.
    Come o'er the waters deep and dark and blue;
    Come where the lilies in the marge have sprung,
    Come with me, love, for Oh, my love is true!'
    This is the song that on the lake was sung,
    The boatman sang it when his heart was young."
Some idea of Whitman's capacity for dramatic narration may be gained from
the following lines taken from "Not a Man, and Yet a Man," a poem of even
greater length than "The Rape of Florida":
   "A flash of steely lightning from his hand,
    Strikes down the groaning leader of the band;
    Divides his startled comrades, and again
    Descending, leaves fair Dora's captors slain.
    Her, seizing then within a strong embrace,
    Out in the dark he wheels his flying pace;
    He speaks not, but with stalwart tenderness
    Her swelling bosom firm to his doth press;
    Springs like a stag that flees the eager hound,
    And like a whirlwind rustles o'er the ground.
    Her locks swim in dishevelled wildness o'er
    His shoulders, streaming to his waist and more;
    While on and on, strong as a rolling flood,
    His sweeping footsteps part the silent wood."
It is curious and interesting to trace the growth of individuality and
race consciousness in this group of poets. Jupiter Hammon's verses were
almost entirely religious exhortations. Only very seldom does Phillis
Wheatley sound a native note. Four times in single lines she refers to
herself as "Afric's muse." In a poem of admonition addressed to the
students at the "University of Cambridge in New England" she refers to
herself as follows:
   "Ye blooming plants of human race divine,
    An Ethiop tells you 'tis your greatest foe."
But one looks in vain for some outburst or even complaint against the
bondage of her people, for some agonizing cry about her native land. In
two poems she refers definitely to Africa as her home, but in each
instance there seems to be under the sentiment of the lines a feeling of
almost smug contentment at her own escape therefrom. In the poem, "On
Being Brought from Africa to America," she says:
   "'Twas mercy brought me from my pagan land,
    Taught my benighted soul to understand
    That there's a God and there's a Saviour too;
    Once I redemption neither sought or knew.
    Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
    'Their color is a diabolic dye.'
    Remember, Christians, Negroes black as Cain,
    May be refined, and join th' angelic train."
In the poem addressed to the Earl of Dartmouth, she speaks of freedom and
makes a reference to the parents from whom she was taken as a child, a
reference which cannot but strike the reader as rather unimpassioned:
   "Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song,
    Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,
    Whence flow these wishes for the common good,
    By feeling hearts alone best understood;
    I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate
    Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat;
    What pangs excruciating must molest,
    What sorrows labor in my parents' breast?
    Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd
    That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd;
    Such, such my case. And can I then but pray
    Others may never feel tyrannic sway?"
The bulk of Phillis Wheatley's work consists of poems addressed to people
of prominence. Her book was dedicated to the Countess of Huntington, at
whose house she spent the greater part of her time while in England. On
his repeal of the Stamp Act, she wrote a poem to King George III, whom she
saw later; another poem she wrote to the Earl of Dartmouth, whom she knew.
A number of her verses were addressed to other persons of distinction.
Indeed, it is apparent that Phillis was far from being a democrat. She was
far from being a democrat not only in her social ideas but also in her
political ideas; unless a religious meaning is given to the closing lines
of her ode to General Washington, she was a decided royalist:
   "A crown, a mansion, and a throne that shine
    With gold unfading, Washington! be thine."
Nevertheless, she was an ardent patriot. Her ode to General Washington
(1775), her spirited poem, "On Major General Lee" (1776) and her poem,
"Liberty and Peace," written in celebration of the close of the war,
reveal not only strong patriotic feeling but an understanding of the
issues at stake. In her poem, "On Major General Lee," she makes her hero
reply thus to the taunts of the British commander into whose hands he has
been delivered through treachery:
                       "O arrogance of tongue!
    And wild ambition, ever prone to wrong!
    Believ'st thou, chief, that armies such as thine
    Can stretch in dust that heaven-defended line?
    In vain allies may swarm from distant lands,
    And demons aid in formidable bands,
    Great as thou art, thou shun'st the field of fame,
    Disgrace to Britain and the British name!
    When offer'd combat by the noble foe,
    (Foe to misrule) why did the sword forego
    The easy conquest of the rebel-land?
    Perhaps TOO easy for thy martial hand.
    What various causes to the field invite!
    For plunder YOU, and we for freedom fight,
    Her cause divine with generous ardor fires,
    And every bosom glows as she inspires!
    Already thousands of your troops have fled
    To the drear mansions of the silent dead:
    Columbia, too, beholds with streaming eyes
    Her heroes fall--'tis freedom's sacrifice!
    So wills the power who with convulsive storms
    Shakes impious realms, and nature's face deforms;
    Yet those brave troops, innum'rous as the sands,
    One soul inspires, one General Chief commands;
    Find in your train of boasted heroes, one
    To match the praise of Godlike Washington.
    Thrice happy Chief in whom the virtues join,
    And heaven taught prudence speaks the man divine."
What Phillis Wheatley failed to achieve is due in no small degree to her
education and environment. Her mind was steeped in the classics; her
verses are filled with classical and mythological allusions. She knew Ovid
thoroughly and was familiar with other Latin authors. She must have known
Alexander Pope by heart. And, too, she was reared and sheltered in a
wealthy and cultured family,--a wealthy and cultured Boston family; she
never had the opportunity to learn life; she never found out her own true
relation to life and to her surroundings. And it should not be forgotten
that she was only about thirty years old when she died. The impulsion or
the compulsion that might have driven her genius off the worn paths, out
on a journey of exploration, Phillis Wheatley never received. But,
whatever her limitations, she merits more than America has accorded her.
Horton, who was born three years after Phillis Wheatley's death, expressed
in all of his poetry strong complaint at his condition of slavery and a
deep longing for freedom. The following verses are typical of his style
and his ability:
   "Alas! and am I born for this,
      To wear this slavish chain?
    Deprived of all created bliss,
      Through hardship, toil, and pain?
           *       *       *       *       *
    Come, Liberty! thou cheerful sound,
      Roll through my ravished ears;
    Come, let my grief in joys be drowned,
      And drive away my fears."
In Mrs. Harper we find something more than the complaint and the longing
of Horton. We find an expression of a sense of wrong and injustice. The
following stanzas are from a poem addressed to the white women of America:
   "You can sigh o'er the sad-eyed Armenian
      Who weeps in her desolate home.
    You can mourn o'er the exile of Russia
      From kindred and friends doomed to roam.
           *       *       *       *       *
    But hark! from our Southland are floating
      Sobs of anguish, murmurs of pain,
    And women heart-stricken are weeping
      O'er their tortured and slain.
           *       *       *       *       *
    Have ye not, oh, my favored sisters,
      Just a plea, a prayer or a tear
    For mothers who dwell 'neath the shadows
      Of agony, hatred and fear?
           *       *       *       *       *
    Weep not, oh my well sheltered sisters,
      Weep not for the Negro alone,
    But weep for your sons who must gather
      The crops which their fathers have sown."
Whitman, in the midst of "The Rape of Florida," a poem in which he related
the taking of the State of Florida from the Seminoles, stops and discusses
the race question. He discusses it in many other poems; and he discusses
it from many different angles. In Whitman we find not only an expression
of a sense of wrong and injustice, but we hear a note of faith and a note
also of defiance. For example, in the opening to Canto II of "The Rape of
Florida":
   "Greatness by nature cannot be entailed;
    It is an office ending with the man,--
    Sage, hero, Saviour, tho' the Sire be hailed,
    The son may reach obscurity in the van:
    Sublime achievements know no patent plan,
    Man's immortality's a book with seals,
    And none but God shall open--none else can--
    But opened, it the mystery reveals,--
    Manhood's conquest of man to heaven's respect appeals.
   "Is manhood less because man's face is black?
    Let thunders of the loosened seals reply!
    Who shall the rider's restive steed turn back,
    Or who withstand the arrows he lets fly
    Between the mountains of eternity?
    Genius ride forth! Thou gift and torch of heav'n!
    The mastery is kindled in thine eye;
    To conquest ride! thy bow of strength is giv'n--
    The trampled hordes of caste before thee shall be driv'n!
           *       *       *       *       *
   "'Tis hard to judge if hatred of one's race,
    By those who deem themselves superior-born,
    Be worse than that quiescence in disgrace,
    Which only merits--and should only--scorn.
    Oh, let me see the Negro night and morn,
    Pressing and fighting in, for place and power!
    All earth is place--all time th' auspicious hour,
    While heaven leans forth to look, oh, will he quail or cower?
   "Ah! I abhor his protest and complaint!
    His pious looks and patience I despise!
    He can't evade the test, disguised as saint;
    The manly voice of freedom bids him rise,
    And shake himself before Philistine eyes!
    And, like a lion roused, no sooner than
    A foe dare come, play all his energies,
    And court the fray with fury if he can;
    For hell itself respects a fearless, manly man."
It may be said that none of these poets strike a deep native strain or
sound a distinctively original note, either in matter or form. That is
true; but the same thing may be said of all the American poets down to the
writers of the present generation, with the exception of Poe and Walt
Whitman. The thing in which these black poets are mostly excelled by their
contemporaries is mere technique.
Paul Laurence Dunbar stands out as the first poet from the Negro race in
the United States to show a combined mastery over poetic material and
poetic technique, to reveal innate literary distinction in what he wrote,
and to maintain a high level of performance. He was the first to rise to a
height from which he could take a perspective view of his own race. He was
the first to see objectively its humor, its superstitions, its
shortcomings; the first to feel sympathetically its heart-wounds, its
yearnings, its aspirations, and to voice them all in a purely literary
form.
Dunbar's fame rests chiefly on his poems in Negro dialect. This appraisal
of him is, no doubt, fair; for in these dialect poems he not only carried
his art to the highest point of perfection, but he made a contribution to
American literature unlike what any one else had made, a contribution
which, perhaps, no one else could have made. Of course, Negro dialect
poetry was written before Dunbar wrote, most of it by white writers; but
the fact stands out that Dunbar was the first to use it as a medium for
the true interpretation of Negro character and psychology. And, yet,
dialect poetry does not constitute the whole or even the bulk of Dunbar's
work. In addition to a large number of poems of a very high order done in
literary English, he was the author of four novels and several volumes of
short stories.
Indeed, Dunbar did not begin his career as a writer of dialect. I may be
pardoned for introducing here a bit of reminiscence. My personal
friendship with Paul Dunbar began before he had achieved recognition, and
continued to be close until his death. When I first met him he had
published a thin volume, "Oak and Ivy," which was being sold chiefly
through his own efforts. "Oak and Ivy" showed no distinctive Negro
influence, but rather the influence of James Whitcomb Riley. At this time
Paul and I were together every day for several months. He talked to me a
great deal about his hopes and ambitions. In these talks he revealed that
he had reached a realization of the possibilities of poetry in the
dialect, together with a recognition of the fact that it offered the
surest way by which he could get a hearing. Often he said to me: "I've
got to write dialect poetry; it's the only way I can get them to listen
to me." I was with Dunbar at the beginning of what proved to be his last
illness. He said to me then: "I have not grown. I am writing the same
things I wrote ten years ago, and am writing them no better." His
self-accusation was not fully true; he had grown, and he had gained a
surer control of his art, but he had not accomplished the greater things
of which he was constantly dreaming; the public had held him to the things
for which it had accorded him recognition. If Dunbar had lived he would
have achieved some of those dreams, but even while he talked so dejectedly
to me he seemed to feel that he was not to live. He died when he was only
thirty-three.
It has a bearing on this entire subject to note that Dunbar was of unmixed
Negro blood; so, as the greatest figure in literature which the colored
race in the United States has produced, he stands as an example at once
refuting and confounding those who wish to believe that whatever
extraordinary ability an Aframerican shows is due to an admixture of white
blood.
As a man, Dunbar was kind and tender. In conversation he was brilliant and
polished. His voice was his chief charm, and was a great element in his
success as a reader of his own works. In his actions he was impulsive as a
child, sometimes even erratic; indeed, his intimate friends almost looked
upon him as a spoiled boy. He was always delicate in health.
Temperamentally, he belonged to that class of poets who Taine says are
vessels too weak to contain the spirit of poetry, the poets whom poetry
kills, the Byrons, the Burns's, the De Mussets, the Poes.
To whom may he be compared, this boy who scribbled his early verses while
he ran an elevator, whose youth was a battle against poverty, and who, in
spite of almost insurmountable obstacles, rose to success? A comparison
between him and Burns is not unfitting. The similarity between many phases
of their lives is remarkable, and their works are not incommensurable.
Burns took the strong dialect of his people and made it classic; Dunbar
took the humble speech of his people and in it wrought music.
Mention of Dunbar brings up for consideration the fact that, although he
is the most outstanding figure in literature among the Aframericans of the
United States, he does not stand alone among the Aframericans of the whole
Western world. There are Plácido and Manzano in Cuba; Vieux and Durand in
Haiti, Machado de Assis in Brazil; Leon Laviaux in Martinique, and others
still that might be mentioned, who stand on a plane with or even above
Dunbar. Plácido and Machado de Assis rank as great in the literatures of
their respective countries without any qualifications whatever. They are
world figures in the literature of the Latin languages. Machado de Assis
is somewhat handicapped in this respect by having as his tongue and medium
the lesser known Portuguese, but Plácido, writing in the language of
Spain, Mexico, Cuba and of almost the whole of South America, is
universally known. His works have been republished in the original in
Spain, Mexico and in most of the Latin-American countries; several
editions have been published in the United States; translations of his
works have been made into French and German.
Plácido is in some respects the greatest of all the Cuban poets. In sheer
genius and the fire of inspiration he surpasses even the more finished
Heredia. Then, too, his birth, his life and his death ideally contained
the tragic elements that go into the making of a halo about a poet's head.
Plácido was born in Habana in 1809. The first months of his life were
passed in a foundling asylum; indeed, his real name, Gabriel de la
Concepcion Valdés, was in honor of its founder. His father took him out of
the asylum, but shortly afterwards went to Mexico and died there. His
early life was a struggle against poverty; his youth and manhood was a
struggle for Cuban independence. His death placed him in the list of Cuban
martyrs. On the 27th of June, 1844, he was lined up against a wall with
ten others and shot by order of the Spanish authorities on a charge of
conspiracy. In his short but eventful life he turned out work which bulks
more than six hundred pages. During the few hours preceding his execution
he wrote three of his best known poems, among them his famous sonnet,
"Mother, Farewell!"
Plácido's sonnet to his mother has been translated into every important
language; William Cullen Bryant did it in English; but in spite of its
wide popularity, it is, perhaps, outside of Cuba the least understood of
all Plácido's poems. It is curious to note how Bryant's translation
totally misses the intimate sense of the delicate subtility of the poem.
The American poet makes it a tender and loving farewell of a son who is
about to die to a heart-broken mother; but that is not the kind of a
farewell that Plácido intended to write or did write.
The key to the poem is in the first word, and the first word is the
Spanish conjunction _Si_ (if). The central idea, then, of the sonnet
is, "If the sad fate which now overwhelms me should bring a pang to your
heart, do not weep, for I die a glorious death and sound the last note of
my lyre to you." Bryant either failed to understand or ignored the opening
word, "If," because he was not familiar with the poet's history.
While Plácido's father was a Negro, his mother was a Spanish white woman,
a dancer in one of the Habana theatres. At his birth she abandoned him to
a foundling asylum, and perhaps never saw him again, although it is known
that she outlived her son. When the poet came down to his last hours he
remembered that somewhere there lived a woman who was his mother; that
although she had heartlessly abandoned him; that although he owed her no
filial duty, still she might, perhaps, on hearing of his sad end feel some
pang of grief or sadness; so he tells her in his last words that he dies
happy and bids her not to weep. This he does with nobility and dignity,
but absolutely without affection. Taking into account these facts, and
especially their humiliating and embittering effect upon a soul so
sensitive as Plácido's, this sonnet, in spite of the obvious weakness of
the sestet as compared with the octave, is a remarkable piece of work.[1]
[Footnote 1: Plácido's sonnet and two English versions will be found in
the Appendix.]
In considering the Aframerican poets of the Latin languages I am impelled
to think that, as up to this time the colored poets of greater
universality have come out of the Latin-American countries rather than out
of the United States, they will continue to do so for a good many years.
The reason for this I hinted at in the first part of this preface. The
colored poet in the United States labors within limitations which he
cannot easily pass over. He is always on the defensive or the offensive.
The pressure upon him to be propagandic is well nigh irresistible. These
conditions are suffocating to breadth and to real art in poetry. In
addition he labors under the handicap of finding culture not entirely
colorless in the United States. On the other hand, the colored poet of
Latin-America can voice the national spirit without any reservations. And
he will be rewarded without any reservations, whether it be to place him
among the great or declare him the greatest.
So I think it probable that the first world-acknowledged Aframerican poet
will come out of Latin-America. Over against this probability, of course,
is the great advantage possessed by the colored poet in the United States
of writing in the world-conquering English language.
This preface has gone far beyond what I had in mind when I started. It was
my intention to gather together the best verses I could find by Negro
poets and present them with a bare word of introduction. It was not my
plan to make this collection inclusive nor to make the book in any sense a
book of criticism. I planned to present only verses by contemporary
writers; but, perhaps, because this is the first collection of its kind, I
realized the absence of a starting-point and was led to provide one and to
fill in with historical data what I felt to be a gap.
It may be surprising to many to see how little of the poetry being written
by Negro poets to-day is being written in Negro dialect. The newer Negro
poets show a tendency to discard dialect; much of the subject-matter which
went into the making of traditional dialect poetry, 'possums, watermelons,
etc., they have discarded altogether, at least, as poetic material. This
tendency will, no doubt, be regretted by the majority of white readers;
and, indeed, it would be a distinct loss if the American Negro poets threw
away this quaint and musical folk-speech as a medium of expression. And
yet, after all, these poets are working through a problem not realized by
the reader, and, perhaps, by many of these poets themselves not realized
consciously. They are trying to break away from, not Negro dialect itself,
but the limitations on Negro dialect imposed by the fixing effects of long
convention.
The Negro in the United States has achieved or been placed in a certain
artistic niche. When he is thought of artistically, it is as a
happy-go-lucky, singing, shuffling, banjo-picking being or as a more or
less pathetic figure. The picture of him is in a log cabin amid fields of
cotton or along the levees. Negro dialect is naturally and by long
association the exact instrument for voicing this phase of Negro life; and
by that very exactness it is an instrument with but two full stops, humor
and pathos. So even when he confines himself to purely racial themes, the
Aframerican poet realizes that there are phases of Negro life in the
United States which cannot be treated in the dialect either adequately or
artistically. Take, for example, the phases rising out of life in Harlem,
that most wonderful Negro city in the world. I do not deny that a Negro in
a log cabin is more picturesque than a Negro in a Harlem flat, but the
Negro in the Harlem flat is here, and he is but part of a group growing
everywhere in the country, a group whose ideals are becoming increasingly
more vital than those of the traditionally artistic group, even if its
members are less picturesque.
What the colored poet in the United States needs to do is something like
what Synge did for the Irish; he needs to find a form that will express
the racial spirit by symbols from within rather than by symbols from
without, such as the mere mutilation of English spelling and
pronunciation. He needs a form that is freer and larger than dialect, but
which will still hold the racial flavor; a form expressing the imagery,
the idioms, the peculiar turns of thought, and the distinctive humor and
pathos, too, of the Negro, but which will also be capable of voicing the
deepest and highest emotions and aspirations, and allow of the widest
range of subjects and the widest scope of treatment.
Negro dialect is at present a medium that is not capable of giving
expression to the varied conditions of Negro life in America, and much
less is it capable of giving the fullest interpretation of Negro character
and psychology. This is no indictment against the dialect as dialect, but
against the mould of convention in which Negro dialect in the United
States has been set. In time these conventions may become lost, and the
colored poet in the United States may sit down to write in dialect without
feeling that his first line will put the general reader in a frame of mind
which demands that the poem be humorous or pathetic. In the meantime,
there is no reason why these poets should not continue to do the beautiful
things that can be done, and done best, in the dialect.
In stating the need for Aframerican poets in the United States to work out
a new and distinctive form of expression I do not wish to be understood to
hold any theory that they should limit themselves to Negro poetry, to
racial themes; the sooner they are able to write _American_ poetry
spontaneously, the better. Nevertheless, I believe that the richest
contribution the Negro poet can make to the American literature of the
future will be the fusion into it of his own individual artistic gifts.
Not many of the writers here included, except Dunbar, are known at all to
the general reading public; and there is only one of these who has a
widely recognized position in the American literary world, he is William
Stanley Braithwaite. Mr. Braithwaite is not only unique in this respect,
but he stands unique among all the Aframerican writers the United States
has yet produced. He has gained his place, taking as the standard and
measure for his work the identical standard and measure applied to
American writers and American literature. He has asked for no allowances
or rewards, either directly or indirectly, on account of his race.
Mr. Braithwaite is the author of two volumes of verses, lyrics of delicate
and tenuous beauty. In his more recent and uncollected poems he shows
himself more and more decidedly the mystic. But his place in American
literature is due more to his work as a critic and anthologist than to his
work as a poet. There is still another role he has played, that of friend
of poetry and poets. It is a recognized fact that in the work which
preceded the present revival of poetry in the United States, no one
rendered more unremitting and valuable service than Mr. Braithwaite. And
it can be said that no future study of American poetry of this age can be
made without reference to Braithwaite.
Two authors included in the book are better known for their work in prose
than in poetry: W.E.B. Du Bois whose well-known prose at its best is,
however, impassioned and rhythmical; and Benjamin Brawley who is the
author, among other works, of one of the best handbooks on the English
drama that has yet appeared in America.
But the group of the new Negro poets, whose work makes up the bulk of this
anthology, contains names destined to be known. Claude McKay, although
still quite a young man, has already demonstrated his power, breadth and
skill as a poet. Mr. McKay's breadth is as essential a part of his
equipment as his power and skill. He demonstrates mastery of the three
when as a Negro poet he pours out the bitterness and rebellion in his
heart in those two sonnet-tragedies, "If We Must Die" and "To the White
Fiends," in a manner that strikes terror; and when as a cosmic poet he
creates the atmosphere and mood of poetic beauty in the absolute, as he
does in "Spring in New Hampshire" and "The Harlem Dancer." Mr. McKay gives
evidence that he has passed beyond the danger which threatens many of the
new Negro poets--the danger of allowing the purely polemical phases of the
race problem to choke their sense of artistry.
Mr. McKay's earliest work is unknown in this country. It consists of poems
written and published in his native Jamaica. I was fortunate enough to run
across this first volume, and I could not refrain from reproducing here
one of the poems written in the West Indian Negro dialect. I have done
this not only to illustrate the widest range of the poet's talent and to
offer a comparison between the American and the West Indian dialects, but
on account of the intrinsic worth of the poem itself. I was much tempted
to introduce several more, in spite of the fact that they might require a
glossary, because however greater work Mr. McKay may do he can never do
anything more touching and charming than these poems in the Jamaica
dialect.
Fenton Johnson is a young poet of the ultra-modern school who gives
promise of greater work than he has yet done. Jessie Fauset shows that she
possesses the lyric gift, and she works with care and finish. Miss Fauset
is especially adept in her translations from the French. Georgia Douglas
Johnson is a poet neither afraid nor ashamed of her emotions. She limits
herself to the purely conventional forms, rhythms and rhymes, but through
them she achieves striking effects. The principal theme of Mrs. Johnson's
poems is the secret dread down in every woman's heart, the dread of the
passing of youth and beauty, and with them love. An old theme, one which
poets themselves have often wearied of, but which, like death, remains one
of the imperishable themes on which is made the poetry that has moved
men's hearts through all ages. In her ingenuously wrought verses, through
sheer simplicity and spontaneousness, Mrs. Johnson often sounds a note of
pathos or passion that will not fail to waken a response, except in those
too sophisticated or cynical to respond to natural impulses. Of the half
dozen or so of colored women writing creditable verse, Anne Spencer is the
most modern and least obvious in her methods. Her lines are at times
involved and turgid and almost cryptic, but she shows an originality which
does not depend upon eccentricities. In her "Before the Feast of Shushan"
she displays an opulence, the love of which has long been charged against
the Negro as one of his naïve and childish traits, but which in art may
infuse a much needed color, warmth and spirit of abandon into American
poetry.
John W. Holloway, more than any Negro poet writing in the dialect to-day,
summons to his work the lilt, the spontaneity and charm of which Dunbar
was the supreme master whenever he employed that medium. It is well to say
a word here about the dialect poems of James Edwin Campbell. In dialect,
Campbell was a precursor of Dunbar. A comparison of his idioms and
phonetics with those of Dunbar reveals great differences. Dunbar is a
shade or two more sophisticated and his phonetics approach nearer to a
mean standard of the dialects spoken in the different sections. Campbell
is more primitive and his phonetics are those of the dialect as spoken by
the Negroes of the sea islands off the coasts of South Carolina and
Georgia, which to this day remains comparatively close to its African
roots, and is strikingly similar to the speech of the uneducated Negroes
of the West Indies. An error that confuses many persons in reading or
understanding Negro dialect is the idea that it is uniform. An ignorant
Negro of the uplands of Georgia would have almost as much difficulty in
understanding an ignorant sea island Negro as an Englishman would have.
Not even in the dialect of any particular section is a given word always
pronounced in precisely the same way. Its pronunciation depends upon the
preceding and following sounds. Sometimes the combination permits of a
liaison so close that to the uninitiated the sound of the word is almost
completely lost.
The constant effort in Negro dialect is to elide all troublesome
consonants and sounds. This negative effort may be after all only positive
laziness of the vocal organs, but the result is a softening and smoothing
which makes Negro dialect so delightfully easy for singers.
Daniel Webster Davis wrote dialect poetry at the time when Dunbar was
writing. He gained great popularity, but it did not spread beyond his own
race. Davis had unctuous humor, but he was crude. For illustration, note
the vast stretch between his "Hog Meat" and Dunbar's "When de Co'n Pone's
Hot," both of them poems on the traditional ecstasy of the Negro in
contemplation of "good things" to eat.
It is regrettable that two of the most gifted writers included were cut
off so early in life. R. C. Jamison and Joseph S. Cotter, Jr., died
several years ago, both of them in their youth. Jamison was barely thirty
at the time of his death, but among his poems there is one, at least,
which stamps him as a poet of superior talent and lofty inspiration. "The
Negro Soldiers" is a poem with the race problem as its theme, yet it
transcends the limits of race and rises to a spiritual height that makes
it one of the noblest poems of the Great War. Cotter died a mere boy of
twenty, and the latter part of that brief period he passed in an invalid
state. Some months before his death he published a thin volume of verses
which were for the most part written on a sick bed. In this little volume
Cotter showed fine poetic sense and a free and bold mastery over his
material. A reading of Cotter's poems is certain to induce that mood in
which one will regretfully speculate on what the young poet might have
accomplished had he not been cut off so soon.
As intimated above, my original idea for this book underwent a change in
the writing of the introduction. I first planned to select twenty-five to
thirty poems which I judged to be up to a certain standard, and offer them
with a few words of introduction and without comment. In the collection,
as it grew to be, that "certain standard" has been broadened if not
lowered; but I believe that this is offset by the advantage of the wider
range given the reader and the student of the subject.
I offer this collection without making apology or asking allowance. I feel
confident that the reader will find not only an earnest for the future,
but actual achievement. The reader cannot but be impressed by the distance
already covered. It is a long way from the plaints of George Horton to the
invectives of Claude McKay, from the obviousness of Frances Harper to the
complexness of Anne Spencer. Much ground has been covered, but more will
yet be covered. It is this side of prophecy to declare that the undeniable
creative genius of the Negro is destined to make a distinctive and
valuable contribution to American poetry.
I wish to extend my thanks to Mr. Arthur A. Schomburg, who placed his
valuable collection of books by Negro authors at my disposal. I wish also
to acknowledge with thanks the kindness of Dodd, Mead &amp;Co. for permitting

Company for permission to reprint poems of Georgia Douglas Johnson, Joseph
S. Cotter, Jr., Bertram Johnson and Waverley Carmichael; and of Neale &amp;
Co. for permission to reprint poems of John W. Holloway. I wish to thank
Mr. Braithwaite for permission to use the included poems from his
forthcoming volume, "Sandy Star and Willie Gee." And to acknowledge the
courtesy of the following magazines: _The Crisis, The Century Magazine,
The Liberator, The Freeman, The Independent, Others_, and _Poetry: A

            SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT
            Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;
            I look far out into the pregnant night,
            Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
            And catch the gleaming of a random light,
            That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.
            My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
            For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
            I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
            My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
            And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.
            O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
            O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
            Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
            That I may sight and check that speeding bark
            Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?

            THE DEBT
            This is the debt I pay
            Just for one riotous day,
            Years of regret and grief.
            Sorrow without relief.
            Pay it I will to the end--
            Until the grave, my friend,
            Gives me a true release--
            Gives me the clasp of peace.
            Slight was the thing I bought,
            Small was the debt I thought,
            Poor was the loan at best--
            God! but the interest!
            THE HAUNTED OAK
            Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
            Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
            And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
            Runs a shudder over me?
            My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
            And sap ran free in my veins,
            But I saw in the moonlight dim and weird
            A guiltless victim's pains.
            I bent me down to hear his sigh;
            I shook with his gurgling moan,
            And I trembled sore when they rode away,
            And left him here alone.
            They'd charged him with the old, old crime,
            And set him fast in jail:
            Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
            And why does the night wind wail?
            He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
            And he raised his hand to the sky;
            But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
            And the steady tread drew nigh.
            Who is it rides by night, by night,
            Over the moonlit road?
            And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
            What is the galling goad?
            And now they beat at the prison door,
            "Ho, keeper, do not stay!
            We are friends of him whom you hold within,
            And we fain would take him away
            From those who ride fast on our heels
            With mind to do him wrong;
            They have no care for his innocence,
            And the rope they bear is long."
            They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
            They have fooled the man with lies;
            The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
            And the great door open flies.
            Now they have taken him from the jail,
            And hard and fast they ride,
            And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
            As they halt my trunk beside.
            Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
            And the doctor one of white,
            And the minister, with his oldest son,
            Was curiously bedight.
            Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
            'Tis but a little space,
            And the time will come when these shall dread
            The mem'ry of your face.
            I feel the rope against my bark,
            And the weight of him in my grain,
            I feel in the throe of his final woe
            The touch of my own last pain.
            And never more shall leaves come forth
            On a bough that bears the ban;
            I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
            From the curse of a guiltless man.
            And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
            And goes to hunt the deer,
            And ever another rides his soul
            In the guise of a mortal fear.
            And ever the man he rides me hard,
            And never a night stays he;
            For I feel his curse as a haunted bough
            On the trunk of a haunted tree.
            WHEN DE CO'N PONE'S HOT
            Dey is times in life when Nature
            Seems to slip a cog an' go,
            Jes' a-rattlin' down creation,
            Lak an ocean's overflow;
            When de worl' jes' stahts a-spinnin'
            Lak a picaninny's top,
            An' yo' cup o' joy is brimmin'
            'Twell it seems about to slop,
            An' you feel jes' lak a racah,
            Dat is trainin' fu' to trot--
            When yo' mammy says de blessin'
            An' de co'n pone's hot.
            When you set down at de table,
            Kin' o' weary lak an' sad,
            An' you'se jes' a little tiahed
            An' purhaps a little mad;
            How yo' gloom tu'ns into gladness,
            How yo' joy drives out de doubt
            When de oven do' is opened,
            An' de smell comes po'in' out;
            Why, de 'lectric light o' Heaven
            Seems to settle on de spot,
            When yo' mammy says de blessin'
            An' de co'n pone's hot.
            When de cabbage pot is steamin'
            An' de bacon good an' fat,
            When de chittlins is a-sputter'n'
            So's to show you whah dey's at;
            Tek away yo' sody biscuit,
            Tek away yo' cake an' pie,
            Fu' de glory time is comin',
            An' it's 'proachin' mighty nigh,
            An' you want to jump an' hollah,
            Dough you know you'd bettah not,
            When yo' mammy says de blessin'
            An' de co'n pone's hot.
            I have hyeahd o' lots o' sermons,
            An' I've hyeahd o' lots o' prayers,
            An' I've listened to some singin'
            Dat has tuck me up de stairs
            Of de Glory-Lan' an' set me
            Jes' below de Mastah's th'one,
            An' have lef my hea't a-singin'
            In a happy aftah tone;
            But dem wu'ds so sweetly murmured
            Seem to tech de softes' spot,
            When my mammy says de blessin',
            An' de co'n pone's hot.
            A DEATH SONG
            Lay me down beneaf de willers in de grass,
            Whah de branch'll go a-singin' as it pass
            An' w'en I's a-layin' low,
            I kin hyeah it as it go
            Singin', "Sleep, my honey, tek yo' res' at las'."
            Lay me nigh to whah hit meks a little pool,
            An' de watah stan's so quiet lak an' cool,
            Whah de little birds in spring,
            Ust to come an' drink an' sing,
            An' de chillen waded on dey way to school.
            Let me settle w'en my shouldahs draps dey load
            Nigh enough to hyeah de noises in de road;
            Fu' I t'ink de las' long res'
            Gwine to soothe my sperrit bes'
            If I's layin' 'mong de t'ings I's allus knowed.

            COMPENSATION
            O, rich young lord, thou ridest by
            With looks of high disdain;
            It chafes me not thy title high,
            Thy blood of oldest strain.
            The lady riding at thy side
            Is but in name thy promised bride,
            Ride on, young lord, ride on!
            Her father wills and she obeys,
            The custom of her class;
            'Tis Land not Love the trothing sways--
            For Land he sells his lass.
            Her fair white hand, young lord, is thine,
            Her _soul_, proud fool, her _soul_ is mine,
            Ride on, young lord, ride on!
            No title high my father bore;
            The tenant of thy farm,
            He left me what I value more:
            Clean heart, clear brain, strong arm
            And love for bird and beast and bee
            And song of lark and hymn of sea,
            Ride on, young lord, ride on!
            The boundless sky to me belongs,
            The paltry acres thine;
            The painted beauty sings thy songs,
            The lavrock lilts me mine;
            The hot-housed orchid blooms for thee,
            The gorse and heather bloom for me,
            Ride on, young lord, ride on!

       <collex:text>AT THE CLOSED GATE OF JUSTICE
            To be a Negro in a day like this
            Demands forgiveness. Bruised with blow on blow,
            Betrayed, like him whose woe dimmed eyes gave bliss
            Still must one succor those who brought one low,
            To be a Negro in a day like this.
            To be a Negro in a day like this
            Demands rare patience--patience that can wait
            In utter darkness. 'Tis the path to miss,
            And knock, unheeded, at an iron gate,
            To be a Negro in a day like this.
            To be a Negro in a day like this
            Demands strange loyalty. We serve a flag
            Which is to us white freedom's emphasis.
            Ah! one must love when Truth and Justice lag,
            To be a Negro in a day like this.
            To be a Negro in a day like this--
            Alas! Lord God, what evil have we done?
            Still shines the gate, all gold and amethyst,
            But I pass by, the glorious goal unwon,
            "Merely a Negro"--in a day like this!
            PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR
            He came, a youth, singing in the dawn
            Of a new freedom, glowing o'er his lyre,
            Refining, as with great Apollo's fire,
            His people's gift of song. And thereupon,
            This Negro singer, come to Helicon
            Constrained the masters, listening to admire,
            And roused a race to wonder and aspire,
            Gazing which way their honest voice was gone,
            With ebon face uplit of glory's crest.
            Men marveled at the singer, strong and sweet,
            Who brought the cabin's mirth, the tuneful night,
            But faced the morning, beautiful with light,
            To die while shadows yet fell toward the west,
            And leave his laurels at his people's feet.
            Dunbar, no poet wears your laurels now;
            None rises, singing, from your race like you.
            Dark melodist, immortal, though the dew
            Fell early on the bays upon your brow,
            And tinged with pathos every halcyon vow
            And brave endeavor. Silence o'er you threw
            Flowerets of love. Or, if an envious few
            Of your own people brought no garlands, how
            Could Malice smite him whom the gods had crowned?
            If, like the meadow-lark, your flight was low
            Your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned;
            A wide world heard you, and it loved you so
            It stilled its heart to list the strains you sang,
            And o'er your happy songs its plaudits rang.
            THE NEGRO SINGER
            O'er all my song the image of a face
            Lieth, like shadow on the wild sweet flowers.
            The dream, the ecstasy that prompts my powers;
            The golden lyre's delights bring little grace
            To bless the singer of a lowly race.
            Long hath this mocked me: aye in marvelous hours,
            When Hera's gardens gleamed, or Cynthia's bowers,
            Or Hope's red pylons, in their far, hushed place!
            But I shall dig me deeper to the gold;
            Fetch water, dripping, over desert miles,
            From clear Nyanzas and mysterious Niles
            Of love; and sing, nor one kind act withhold.
            So shall men know me, and remember long,
            Nor my dark face dishonor any song.
            THE ROAD TO THE BOW
            Ever and ever anon,
            After the black storm, the eternal, beauteous bow!
            Brother, to rosy-painted mists that arch beyond,
            Blithely I go.
            My brows men laureled and my lyre
            Twined with immortal ivy for one little rippling song;
            My "House of Golden Leaves" they praised and "passionate fire"--
            But, Friend, the way is long!
            Onward and onward, up! away!
            Though Fear flaunt all his banners in my face,
            And my feet stumble, lo! the Orphean Day!
            Forward by God's grace!
            These signs are still before me: "Fear,"
            "Danger," "Unprecedented," and I hear black "No"
            Still thundering, and "Churl." Good Friend, I rest me here--
            Then to the glittering bow!
            Loometh and cometh Hate in wrath,
            Mailed Wrong, swart Servitude and Shame with bitter rue,
            Nathless a Negro poet's feet must tread the path
            The winged god knew.
            Thus, my true Brother, dream-led, I
            Forefend the anathema, following the span.
            I hold my head as proudly high
            As any man.
            IN THE MATTER OF TWO MEN
            One does such work as one will not,
            And well each knows the right;
            Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,
            The black must serve the white.
            And it's, oh, for the white man's softening flesh,
            While the black man's muscles grow!
            Well I know which grows the mightier,
            _I_ know; full well I know.
            The white man seeks the soft, fat place,
            And he moves and he works by rule.
            Ingenious grows the humbler race
            In Oppression's prodding school.
            And it's, oh, for a white man gone to seed,
            While the Negro struggles so!
            And I know which race develops most,
            I know; yes, well I know.
            The white man rides in a palace car,
            And the Negro rides "Jim Crow."
            To damn the other with bolt and bar,
            One creepeth so low; so low!
            And it's, oh, for a master's nose in the mire,
            While the humbled hearts o'erflow!
            Well I know whose soul grows big at this,
            And whose grows small; _I know_!
            The white man leases out his land,
            And the Negro tills the same.
            One works; one loafs and takes command;
            But I know who wins the game!
            And it's, oh, for the white man's shrinking soil,
            As the black's rich acres grow!
            Well I know how the signs point out at last,
            I know; ah, well I know!
            The white man votes for his color's sake,
            While the black, for his is barred;
            (Though "ignorance" is the charge they make),
            But the black man studies hard.
            And it's, oh, for the white man's sad neglect,
            For the power of his light let go!
            So, I know which man must win at last,
            I know! Ah, Friend, I know!
            AN INDIGNATION DINNER
            Dey was hard times jes fo' Christmas round our neighborhood one year;
            So we held a secret meetin', whah de white folks couldn't hear,
            To 'scuss de situation, an' to see what could be done
            Towa'd a fust-class Christmas dinneh an' a little Christmas fun.
            Rufus Green, who called de meetin', ris an' said: "In dis here town,
            An' throughout de land, de white folks is a-tryin' to keep us down."
            S' 'e: "Dey's bought us, sold us, beat us; now dey 'buse us 'ca'se we's free;
            But when dey tetch my stomach, dey's done gone too fur foh me!
            "Is I right?" "You sho is, Rufus!" roared a dozen hungry throats.
            "Ef you'd keep a mule a-wo'kin', don't you tamper wid his oats.
            Dat's sense," continued Rufus. "But dese white folks nowadays
            Has done got so close and stingy you can't live on what dey pays.
            "Here 'tis Christmas-time, an', folkses, I's indignant 'nough to choke.
            Whah's our Christmas dinneh comin' when we's 'mos' completely broke?
            I can't hahdly 'fo'd a toothpick an' a glass o' water. Mad?
            Say, I'm desp'ret! Dey jes better treat me nice, dese white folks had!"
            Well, dey 'bused de white folks scan'lous, till old Pappy Simmons ris,
            Leanin' on his cane to s'pote him, on account his rheumatis',
            An' s' 'e: "Chilun, whut's dat wintry wind a-sighin' th'ough de street
            'Bout yo' wasted summeh wages? But, no matter, we mus' eat.
            "Now, I seed a beau'ful tuhkey on a certain gemmun's fahm.
            He's a-growin' fat an' sassy, an' a-struttin' to a chahm.
            Chickens, sheeps, hogs, sweet pertaters--all de craps is fine dis year;
            All we needs is a committee foh to tote de goodies here."
            Well, we lit right in an' voted dat it was a gran idee,
            An' de dinneh we had Christmas was worth trabblin' miles to see;
            An' we eat a full an' plenty, big an' little, great an' small,
            Not beca'se we was dishonest, but indignant, sah. Dat's all.
            DREAM AND THE SONG
            So oft our hearts, belovèd lute,
            In blossomy haunts of song are mute;
            So long we pore, 'mid murmurings dull,
            O'er loveliness unutterable.
            So vain is all our passion strong!
            The dream is lovelier than the song.
            The rose thought, touched by words, doth turn
            Wan ashes. Still, from memory's urn,
            The lingering blossoms tenderly
            Refute our wilding minstrelsy.
            Alas! we work but beauty's wrong!
            The dream is lovelier than the song.
            Yearned Shelley o'er the golden flame?
            Left Keats for beauty's lure, a name
            But "writ in water"? Woe is me!
            To grieve o'er flowerful faëry.
            My Phasian doves are flown so long--
            The dream is lovelier than the song!
            Ah, though we build a bower of dawn,
            The golden-wingèd bird is gone,
            And morn may gild, through shimmering leaves,
            Only the swallow-twittering eaves.
            What art may house or gold prolong
            A dream far lovelier than a song?
            The lilting witchery, the unrest
            Of wingèd dreams, is in our breast;
            But ever dear Fulfilment's eyes
            Gaze otherward. The long-sought prize,
            My lute, must to the gods belong.
            The dream is lovelier than the song.

       <collex:text>SONNET
            I had no thought of violets of late,
            The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet
            In wistful April days, when lovers mate
            And wander through the fields in raptures sweet.
            The thought of violets meant florists' shops,
            And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine;
            And garish lights, and mincing little fops
            And cabarets and songs, and deadening wine.
            So far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed,
            I had forgot wide fields, and clear brown streams;
            The perfect loveliness that God has made,--
            Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams.
            And now--unwittingly, you've made me dream
            Of violets, and my soul's forgotten gleam.

       <collex:text>BEFORE THE FEAST OF SHUSHAN
            Garden of Shushan!
            After Eden, all terrace, pool, and flower recollect thee:
            Ye weavers in saffron and haze and Tyrian purple,
            Tell yet what range in color wakes the eye;
            Sorcerer, release the dreams born here when
            Drowsy, shifting palm-shade enspells the brain;
            And sound! ye with harp and flute ne'er essay
            Before these star-noted birds escaped from paradise awhile to
            Stir all dark, and dear, and passionate desire, till mine
            Arms go out to be mocked by the softly kissing body of the wind--
            Slave, send Vashti to her King!
            The fiery wattles of the sun startle into flame
            The marbled towers of Shushan:
            So at each day's wane, two peers--the one in
            Heaven, the other on earth--welcome with their
            Splendor the peerless beauty of the Queen.
            Cushioned at the Queen's feet and upon her knee
            Finding glory for mine head,--still, nearly shamed
            Am I, the King, to bend and kiss with sharp
            Breath the olive-pink of sandaled toes between;
            Or lift me high to the magnet of a gaze, dusky,
            Like the pool when but the moon-ray strikes to its depth;
            Or closer press to crush a grape 'gainst lips redder
            Than the grape, a rose in the night of her hair;
            Then--Sharon's Rose in my arms.
            And I am hard to force the petals wide;
            And you are fast to suffer and be sad.
            Is any prophet come to teach a new thing
            Now in a more apt time?
            Have him 'maze how you say love is sacrament;
            How says Vashti, love is both bread and wine;
            How to the altar may not come to break and drink,
            Hulky flesh nor fleshly spirit!
            I, thy lord, like not manna for meat as a Judahn;
            I, thy master, drink, and red wine, plenty, and when
            I thirst. Eat meat, and full, when I hunger.
            I, thy King, teach you and leave you, when I list.
            No woman in all Persia sets out strange action
            To confuse Persia's lord--
            Love is but desire and thy purpose fulfillment;
            I, thy King, so say!
            AT THE CARNIVAL
            Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank,
            I desire a name for you,
            Nice, as a right glove fits;
            For you--who amid the malodorous
            Mechanics of this unlovely thing,
            Are darling of spirit and form.
            I know you--a glance, and what you are
            Sits-by-the-fire in my heart.
            My Limousine-Lady knows you, or
            Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark
            Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile?
            Guilt pins a fig-leaf; Innocence is its own adorning.
            The bull-necked man knows you--this first time
            His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health
            And thinks not of his avocation.
            I came incuriously--
            Set on no diversion save that my mind
            Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds
            In the presence of a blind crowd.
            The color of life was gray.
            Everywhere the setting seemed right
            For my mood.
            Here the sausage and garlic booth
            Sent unholy incense skyward;
            There a quivering female-thing
            Gestured assignations, and lied
            To call it dancing;
            There, too, were games of chance
            With chances for none;
            But oh! Girl-of-the-Tank, at last!
            Gleaming Girl, how intimately pure and free
            The gaze you send the crowd,
            As though you know the dearth of beauty
            In its sordid life.
            We need you--my Limousine-Lady,
            The bull-necked man and I.
            Seeing you here brave and water-clean,
            Leaven for the heavy ones of earth,
            I am swift to feel that what makes
            The plodder glad is good; and
            Whatever is good is God.
            The wonder is that you are here;
            I have seen the queer in queer places,
            But never before a heaven-fed
            Naiad of the Carnival-Tank!
            Little Diver, Destiny for you,
            Like as for me, is shod in silence;
            Years may seep into your soul
            The bacilli of the usual and the expedient;
            I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day!
            THE WIFE-WOMAN
            Maker-of-Sevens in the scheme of things
            From earth to star;
            Thy cycle holds whatever is fate, and
            Over the border the bar.
            Though rank and fierce the mariner
            Sailing the seven seas,
            He prays, as he holds his glass to his eyes,
            Coaxing the Pleiades.
            I cannot love them; and I feel your glad
            Chiding from the grave,
            That my all was only worth at all, what
            Joy to you it gave.
            These seven links the _Law_ compelled
            For the human chain--
            I cannot love _them_; and _you_, oh,
            Seven-fold months in Flanders slain!
            A jungle there, a cave here, bred six
            And a million years,
            Sure and strong, mate for mate, such
            Love as culture fears;
            I gave you clear the oil and wine;
            You saved me your hob and hearth--
            See how _even_ life may be ere the
            Sickle comes and leaves a swath.
            But I can wait the seven of moons,
            Or years I spare,
            Hoarding the heart's plenty, nor spend
            A drop, nor share--
            So long but outlives a smile and
            A silken gown;
            Then gaily I reach up from my shroud,
            And you, glory-clad, reach down.
            TRANSLATION
            We trekked into a far country,
            My friend and I.
            Our deeper content was never spoken,
            But each knew all the other said.
            He told me how calm his soul was laid
            By the lack of anvil and strife.
            "The wooing kestrel," I said, "mutes his mating-note
            To please the harmony of this sweet silence."
            And when at the day's end
            We laid tired bodies 'gainst
            The loose warm sands,
            And the air fleeced its particles for a coverlet;
            When star after star came out
            To guard their lovers in oblivion--
            My soul so leapt that my evening prayer
            Stole my morning song!
            DUNBAR
            Ah, how poets sing and die!
            Make one song and Heaven takes it;
            Have one heart and Beauty breaks it;
            Chatterton, Shelley, Keats and I--
            Ah, how poets sing and die!

            LA VIE C'EST LA VIE
            On summer afternoons I sit
            Quiescent by you in the park,
            And idly watch the sunbeams gild
            And tint the ash-trees' bark.
            Or else I watch the squirrels frisk
            And chaffer in the grassy lane;
            And all the while I mark your voice
            Breaking with love and pain.
            I know a woman who would give
            Her chance of heaven to take my place;
            To see the love-light in your eyes,
            The love-glow on your face!
            And there's a man whose lightest word
            Can set my chilly blood afire;
            Fulfilment of his least behest
            Defines my life's desire.
            But he will none of me, Nor I
            Of you. Nor you of her. 'Tis said
            The world is full of jests like these.--
            I wish that I were dead.
            CHRISTMAS EVE IN FRANCE
            Oh little Christ, why do you sigh
            As you look down to-night
            On breathless France, on bleeding France,
            And all her dreadful plight?
            What bows your childish head so low?
            What turns your cheek so white?
            Oh little Christ, why do you moan,
            What is it that you see
            In mourning France, in martyred France,
            And her great agony?
            Does she recall your own dark day,
            Your own Gethsemane?
            Oh little Christ, why do you weep,
            Why flow your tears so sore
            For pleading France, for praying France,
            A suppliant at God's door?
            "God sweetened not my cup," you say,
            "Shall He for France do more?"
            Oh little Christ, what can this mean,
            Why must this horror be
            For fainting France, for faithful France,
            And her sweet chivalry?
            "I bled to free all men," you say
            "France bleeds to keep men free."
            Oh little, lovely Christ--you smile!
            What guerdon is in store
            For gallant France, for glorious France,
            And all her valiant corps?
            "Behold I live, and France, like me,
            Shall live for evermore."
            DEAD FIRES
            If this is peace, this dead and leaden thing,
            Then better far the hateful fret, the sting.
            Better the wound forever seeking balm
            Than this gray calm!
            Is this pain's surcease? Better far the ache,
            The long-drawn dreary day, the night's white wake,
            Better the choking sigh, the sobbing breath
            Than passion's death!
            ORIFLAMME
            "I can remember when I was a little, young girl, how my old mammy would
            sit out of doors in the evenings and look up at the stars and groan, and I
            would say, 'Mammy, what makes you groan so?' And she would say, 'I am
            groaning to think of my poor children; they do not know where I be and I
            don't know where they be. I look up at the stars and they look up at the
            stars!'"--_Sojourner Truth_.
            I think I see her sitting bowed and black,
            Stricken and seared with slavery's mortal scars,
            Reft of her children, lonely, anguished, yet
            Still looking at the stars.
            Symbolic mother, we thy myriad sons,
            Pounding our stubborn hearts on Freedom's bars,
            Clutching our birthright, fight with faces set,
            Still visioning the stars!
            OBLIVION
            _From the French of Massillon Coicou (Haiti)_
            I hope when I am dead that I shall lie
            In some deserted grave--I cannot tell you why,
            But I should like to sleep in some neglected spot
            Unknown to every one, by every one forgot.
            There lying I should taste with my dead breath
            The utter lack of life, the fullest sense of death;
            And I should never hear the note of jealousy or hate,
            The tribute paid by passersby to tombs of state.
            To me would never penetrate the prayers and tears
            That futilely bring torture to dead and dying ears;
            There I should lie annihilate and my dead heart would bless
            Oblivion--the shroud and envelope of happiness.

            A PRAYER
            As I lie in bed,
            Flat on my back;
            There passes across my ceiling
            An endless panorama of things--
            Quick steps of gay-voiced children,
            Adolescence in its wondering silences,
            Maid and man on moonlit summer's eve,
            Women in the holy glow of Motherhood,
            Old men gazing silently thru the twilight
            Into the beyond.
            O God, give me words to make my dream-children live.
            AND WHAT SHALL YOU SAY?
            Brother, come!
            And let us go unto our God.
            And when we stand before Him
            I shall say--
            "Lord, I do not hate,
            I am hated.
            I scourge no one,
            I am scourged.
            I covet no lands,
            My lands are coveted.
            I mock no peoples,
            My people are mocked."
            And, brother, what shall you say?
            IS IT BECAUSE I AM BLACK?
            Why do men smile when I speak,
            And call my speech
            The whimperings of a babe
            That cries but knows not what it wants?
            Is it because I am black?
            Why do men sneer when I arise
            And stand in their councils,
            And look them eye to eye,
            And speak their tongue?
            Is it because I am black?
            THE BAND OF GIDEON
            The band of Gideon roam the sky,
            The howling wind is their war-cry,
            The thunder's roll is their trump's peal,
            And the lightning's flash their vengeful steel.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            And men below rear temples high
            And mock their God with reasons why,
            And live in arrogance, sin and shame,
            And rape their souls for the world's good name.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            The band of Gideon roam the sky
            And view the earth with baleful eye;
            In holy wrath they scourge the land
            With earth-quake, storm and burning brand.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            The lightnings flash and the thunders roll,
            And "Lord have mercy on my soul,"
            Cry men as they fall on the stricken sod,
            In agony searching for their God.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            And men repent and then forget
            That heavenly wrath they ever met,
            The band of Gideon yet will come
            And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            RAIN MUSIC
            On the dusty earth-drum
            Beats the falling rain;
            Now a whispered murmur,
            Now a louder strain.
            Slender, silvery drumsticks,
            On an ancient drum,
            Beat the mellow music
            Bidding life to come.
            Chords of earth awakened,
            Notes of greening spring,
            Rise and fall triumphant
            Over every thing.
            Slender, silvery drumsticks
            Beat the long tattoo--
            God, the Great Musician,
            Calling life anew.
            SUPPLICATION
            I am so tired and weary,
            So tired of the endless fight,
            So weary of waiting the dawn
            And finding endless night.
            That I ask but rest and quiet--
            Rest for days that are gone,
            And quiet for the little space
            That I must journey on.

            CHILDREN OF THE SUN
            We are children of the sun,
            Rising sun!
            Weaving Southern destiny,
            Waiting for the mighty hour
            When our Shiloh shall appear
            With the flaming sword of right,
            With the steel of brotherhood,
            And emboss in crimson die
            Liberty! Fraternity!
            We are the star-dust folk,
            Striving folk!
            Sorrow songs have lulled to rest;
            Seething passions wrought through wrongs,
            Led us where the moon rays dip
            In the night of dull despair,
            Showed us where the star gleams shine,
            And the mystic symbols glow--
            Liberty! Fraternity!
            We have come through cloud and mist,
            Mighty men!
            Dusk has kissed our sleep-born eyes,
            Reared for us a mystic throne
            In the splendor of the skies,
            That shall always be for us,
            Children of the Nazarene,
            Children who shall ever sing
            Liberty! Fraternity!
            THE NEW DAY
            From a vision red with war I awoke and saw the Prince
            of Peace hovering over No Man's Land.
            Loud the whistles blew and the thunder of cannon was
            drowned by the happy shouting of the people.
            From the Sinai that faces Armageddon I heard this chant
            from the throats of white-robed angels:
            Blow your trumpets, little children!
            From the East and from the West,
            From the cities in the valley,
            From God's dwelling on the mountain,
            Blow your blast that Peace might know
            She is Queen of God's great army.
            With the crying blood of millions
            We have written deep her name
            In the Book of all the Ages;
            With the lilies in the valley,
            With the roses by the Mersey,
            With the golden flower of Jersey
            We have crowned her smooth young temples.
            Where her footsteps cease to falter
            Golden grain will greet the morning,
            Where her chariot descends
            Shall be broken down the altars
            Of the gods of dark disturbance.
            Nevermore shall men know suffering,
            Nevermore shall women wailing
            Shake to grief the God of Heaven.
            From the East and from the West,
            From the cities in the valley,
            From God's dwelling on the mountain,
            Little children, blow your trumpets!
            From Ethiopia, groaning 'neath her heavy burdens, I
            heard the music of the old slave songs.
            I heard the wail of warriors, dusk brown, who grimly
            fought the fight of others in the trenches of Mars.
            I heard the plea of blood-stained men of dusk and the
            crimson in my veins leapt furiously.
            Forget not, O my brothers, how we fought
            In No Man's Land that peace might come again!
            Forget not, O my brothers, how we gave
            Red blood to save the freedom of the world!
            We were not free, our tawny hands were tied;
            But Belgium's plight and Serbia's woes we shared
            Each rise of sun or setting of the moon.
            So when the bugle blast had called us forth
            We went not like the surly brute of yore
            But, as the Spartan, proud to give the world
            The freedom that we never knew nor shared.
            These chains, O brothers mine, have weighed us down
            As Samson in the temple of the gods;
            Unloosen them and let us breathe the air
            That makes the goldenrod the flower of Christ.
            For we have been with thee in No Man's Land,
            Through lake of fire and down to Hell itself;
            And now we ask of thee our liberty,
            Our freedom in the land of Stars and Stripes.
            I am glad that the Prince of Peace is hovering over No Man's Land.
            TIRED
            I am tired of work; I am tired of building up somebody else's civilization.
            Let us take a rest, M'Lissy Jane.
            I will go down to the Last Chance Saloon, drink a gallon or two of gin,
            shoot a game or two of dice and sleep the rest of the night on one of
            Mike's barrels.
            You will let the old shanty go to rot, the white people's clothes turn to
            dust, and the Calvary Baptist Church sink to the bottomless pit.
            You will spend your days forgetting you married me and your nights hunting
            the warm gin Mike serves the ladies in the rear of the Last Chance Saloon.
            Throw the children into the river; civilization has given us too many. It
            is better to die than it is to grow up and find out that you are colored.
            Pluck the stars out of the heavens. The stars mark our destiny. The stars
            marked my destiny.
            I am tired of civilization.
            THE BANJO PLAYER
            There is music in me, the music of a peasant people.
            I wander through the levee, picking my banjo and singing
            my songs of the cabin and the field. At the
            Last Chance Saloon I am as welcome as the violets
            in March; there is always food and drink for me
            there, and the dimes of those who love honest music.
            Behind the railroad tracks the little children clap
            their hands and love me as they love Kris Kringle.
            But I fear that I am a failure. Last night a woman
            called me a troubadour. What is a troubadour?
            THE SCARLET WOMAN
            Once I was good like the Virgin Mary and the Minister's wife.
            My father worked for Mr. Pullman and white people's tips; but he died two
            days after his insurance expired.
            I had nothing, so I had to go to work.
            All the stock I had was a white girl's education and a face that enchanted
            the men of both races.
            Starvation danced with me.
            So when Big Lizzie, who kept a house for white men, came to me with tales
            of fortune that I could reap from the sale of my virtue I bowed my head to Vice.
            Now I can drink more gin than any man for miles around.
            Gin is better than all the water in Lethe.

       <collex:text>THE LYNCHING
His spirit in smoke ascended to high heaven.
His father, by the crudest way of pain,
Had bidden him to his bosom once again;
The awful sin remained still unforgiven.
All night a bright and solitary star
(Perchance the one that ever guided him,
Yet gave him up at last to Fate's wild whim)
Hung pitifully o'er the swinging char.
Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view
The ghastly body swaying in the sun:
The women thronged to look, but never a one
Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue;
And little lads, lynchers that were to be,
Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.
IF WE MUST DIE
If we must die--let it not be like hogs
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
Making their mock at our accursed lot.
If we must die--oh, let us nobly die,
So that our precious blood may not be shed
In vain; then even the monsters we defy
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!
Oh, Kinsmen! We must meet the common foe;
Though far outnumbered, let us still be brave,
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!
What though before us lies the open grave?
Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall, dying, but--fighting back!
TO THE WHITE FIENDS
Think you I am not fiend and savage too?
Think you I could not arm me with a gun
And shoot down ten of you for every one
Of my black brothers murdered, burnt by you?
Be not deceived, for every deed you do
I could match--out-match: am I not Africa's son,
Black of that black land where black deeds are done?
But the Almighty from the darkness drew
My soul and said: Even thou shalt be a light
Awhile to burn on the benighted earth,
Thy dusky face I set among the white
For thee to prove thyself of highest worth;
Before the world is swallowed up in night,
To show thy little lamp: go forth, go forth!
THE HARLEM DANCER
Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;
Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
Blown by black players upon a picnic day.
She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,
The light gauze hanging loose about her form;
To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm
Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.
Upon her swarthy neck black, shiny curls
Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise,
The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,
Devoured her with their eager, passionate gaze;
But, looking at her falsely-smiling face
I knew her self was not in that strange place.
HARLEM SHADOWS
I hear the halting footsteps of a lass
  In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall
Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass
  Eager to heed desire's insistent call:
Ah, little dark girls, who in slippered feet
  Go prowling through the night from street to street.
Through the long night until the silver break
  Of day the little gray feet know no rest,
Through the lone night until the last snow-flake
  Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast,
The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet
  Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.
Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way
  Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,
Has pushed the timid little feet of clay.
  The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!
Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet
  In Harlem wandering from street to street.
AFTER THE WINTER
Some day, when trees have shed their leaves,
  And against the morning's white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
  Have sheltered for the night,
We'll turn our faces southward, love,
  Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
  And wide-mouthed orchids smile.
And we will seek the quiet hill
  Where towers the cotton tree,
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
  And works the droning bee.
And we will build a lonely nest
  Beside an open glade,
And there forever will we rest,
  O love--O nut-brown maid!
SPRING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
Too green the springing April grass,
Too blue the silver speckled sky,
For me to linger here, alas,
While happy winds go laughing by,
Wasting the golden hours indoors,
Washing windows and scrubbing floors.
Too wonderful the April night,
Too faintly sweet the first May flowers,
The stars too gloriously bright,
For me to spend the evening hours,
When fields are fresh and streams are leaping,
Wearied, exhausted, dully sleeping.
THE TIRED WORKER
O whisper, O my soul!--the afternoon
Is waning into evening--whisper soft!
Peace, O my rebel heart! for soon the moon
From out its misty veil will swing aloft!
Be patient, weary body, soon the night
Will wrap thee gently in her sable sheet,
And with a leaden sigh thou wilt invite
To rest thy tired hands and aching feet.
The wretched day was theirs, the night is mine;
Come, tender sleep, and fold me to thy breast.
But what steals out the gray clouds red like wine?
O dawn! O dreaded dawn! O let me rest!
Weary my veins, my brain, my life,--have pity!
No! Once again the hard, the ugly city.
THE BARRIER
I must not gaze at them although
  Your eyes are dawning day;
I must not watch you as you go
  Your sun-illumined way;
I hear but I must never heed
  The fascinating note,
Which, fluting like a river-reed,
  Comes from your trembling throat;
I must not see upon your face
  Love's softly glowing spark;
For there's the barrier of race,
  You're fair and I am dark.
TO O. E. A.
Your voice is the color of a robin's breast,
  And there's a sweet sob in it like rain--still rain in the night.
Among the leaves of the trumpet-tree, close to his nest,
  The pea-dove sings, and each note thrills me with strange delight
Like the words, wet with music, that well from your trembling throat.
    I'm afraid of your eyes, they're so bold,
    Searching me through, reading my thoughts, shining like gold.
But sometimes they are gentle and soft like the dew on the lips of the
eucharis
Before the sun comes warm with his lover's kiss,
  You are sea-foam, pure with the star's loveliness,
Not mortal, a flower, a fairy, too fair for the beauty-shorn earth,
All wonderful things, all beautiful things, gave of their wealth to your
birth:
  O I love you so much, not recking of passion, that I feel it is wrong,
    But men will love you, flower, fairy, non-mortal spirit burdened with
flesh,
Forever, life-long.
FLAME-HEART
So much have I forgotten in ten years,
  So much in ten brief years; I have forgot
What time the purple apples come to juice
  And what month brings the shy forget-me-not;
Forgotten is the special, startling season
  Of some beloved tree's flowering and fruiting,
What time of year the ground doves brown the fields
  And fill the noonday with their curious fluting:
I have forgotten much, but still remember
The poinsettia's red, blood-red in warm December.
I still recall the honey-fever grass,
  But I cannot bring back to mind just when
We rooted them out of the ping-wing path
  To stop the mad bees in the rabbit pen.
I often try to think in what sweet month
  The languid painted ladies used to dapple
The yellow bye road mazing from the main,
  Sweet with the golden threads of the rose-apple:
I have forgotten, strange, but quite remember
The poinsettia's red, blood-red in warm December.
What weeks, what months, what time o' the mild year
  We cheated school to have our fling at tops?
What days our wine-thrilled bodies pulsed with joy
  Feasting upon blackberries in the copse?
Oh, some I know! I have embalmed the days,
  Even the sacred moments, when we played,
All innocent of passion uncorrupt,
  At noon and evening in the flame-heart's shade:
We were so happy, happy,--I remember
Beneath the poinsettia's red in warm December.
TWO-AN'-SIX
Merry voices chatterin',
Nimble feet dem patterin',
Big an' little, faces gay,
Happy day dis market day.
Sateday, de marnin' break,
Soon, soon market-people wake;
An' de light shine from de moon
While dem boy, wid pantaloon
Roll up ober dem knee-pan,
'Tep across de buccra lan'
To de pastur whe' de harse
Feed along wid de jackass,
An' de mule cant' in de track
Wid him tail up in him back,
All de ketchin' to defy,
No ca' how dem boy might try.
In de early marnin'-tide,
When de cocks crow on de hill
An' de stars are shinin' still,
Mirrie by de fireside
Hots de coffee for de lads
Comin' ridin' on de pads
T'rown across dem animul--
Donkey, harse too, an' de mule,
Which at last had come do'n cool.
On de bit dem hol' dem full:
Racin' ober pastur' lan',
See dem comin' ebery man,
Comin' fe de steamin' tea
Ober hilly track an' lea.
Hard-wuk'd donkey on de road
Trottin' wid him ushal load,
Hamper pack' wi' yam an' grain,
Sour-sop, and Gub'nor cane.
Cous' Sun sits in hired dray,
Drivin' 'long de market way;
Whole week grindin' sugar cane
T'rough de boilin' sun an' rain,
Now, a'ter de toilin' hard,
He goes seekin' his reward,
While he's thinkin' in him min'
Of de dear ones lef behin',
Of de loved though ailin' wife,
Darlin' treasure of his life,
An' de picknies, six in all,
Whose 'nuff burdens 'pon him fall:
Seben lovin' ones in need,
Seben hungry mouths fe feed;
On deir wants he thinks alone,
Neber dreamin' of his own,
But gwin' on wid joyful face
Till him re'ch de market-place.
Sugar bears no price to-day,
Though it is de mont' o' May,
When de time is hellish hot,
An' de water cocoanut
An' de cane bebridge is nice,
Mix' up wid a lilly ice.
Big an' little, great an' small,
Afou yam is all de call;
Sugar tup an' gill a quart,
Yet de people hab de heart
Wantin' brater top o' i',
Want de sweatin' higgler fe
Ram de pan an' pile i' up,
Yet sell i' fe so-so tup.
Cousin Sun is lookin' sad,
As de market is so bad;
'Pon him han' him res' him chin,
Quietly sit do'n thinkin'
Of de loved wife sick in bed,
An' de children to be fed--
What de laborers would say
When dem know him couldn' pay;
Also what about de mill
Whe' him hire from ole Bill;
So him think, an' think on so,
Till him t'oughts no more could go.
Then he got up an' began
Pickin' up him sugar-pan:
In his ears rang t'rough de din
"Only two-an'-six a tin'."
What a tale he'd got to tell,
How bad, bad de sugar sell!
Tekin' out de lee amount,
Him set do'n an' begin count
All de time him min' deh doubt
How expenses would pay out;
Ah, it gnawed him like de ticks,
Sugar sell fe two-an'-six!
So he journeys on de way,
Feelinl sad dis market day;
No e'en buy a little cake
To gi'e baby when she wake,--
Passin' 'long de candy-shop
'Douten eben mek a stop
To buy drops fe las'y son,
For de lilly cash nea' done.
So him re'ch him own a groun',
An' de children scamper roun',
Each one stretchin' out him han',
Lookin' to de poor sad man.
Oh, how much he felt de blow,
As he watched dem face fall low,
When dem wait an' nuttin' came
An' drew back deir han's wid shame!
But de sick wife kissed his brow:
"Sun, don't get down-hearted now;
Ef we only pay expense
We mus' wuk we common-sense,
Cut an' carve, an' carve an' cut,
Mek gill sarbe fe quattiewut;
We mus' try mek two ends meet
Neber mind how hard be it.
We won't mind de haul an' pull,
While dem pickny belly full."
An' de shadow lef' him face,
An' him felt an inward peace,
As he blessed his better part
For her sweet an' gentle heart:
"Dear one o' my heart, my breat',
Won't I lub you to de deat'?
When my heart is weak an' sad,
Who but you can mek it glad?"
So dey kissed an' kissed again,
An' deir t'oughts were not on pain,
But was 'way down in de sout'
Where dey'd wedded in deir yout',
In de marnin' of deir life
Free from all de grief an' strife,
Happy in de marnin' light,
Never thinkin' of de night.
So dey k'lated eberyt'ing;
An' de profit it could bring,
A'ter all de business fix',
Was a princely two-an'-six.

            THE RUBINSTEIN STACCATO ETUDE
            Staccato! Staccato!
            Leggier agitato!
            In and out does the melody twist--
            Unique proposition
            Is this composition.
            (Alas! for the player who hasn't the wrist!)
            Now in the dominant
            Theme ringing prominent,
            Bass still repeating its one monotone,
            Double notes crying,
            Up keyboard go flying,
            The change to the minor comes in like a groan.
            Without a cessation
            A chaste modulation
            Hastens adown to subdominant key,
            Where melody mellow-like
            Singing so 'cello-like
            Rises and falls in a wild ecstasy.
            Scarce is this finished
            When chords all diminished
            Break loose in a patter that comes down like rain,
            A pedal-point wonder
            Rivaling thunder.
            Now all is mad agitation again.
            Like laughter jolly
            Begins the finale;
            Again does the 'cello its tones seem to lend
            Diminuendo ad molto crescendo.
            Ah! Rubinstein only could make such an end!

            TIME TO DIE
            Black brother, think you life so sweet
            That you would live at any price?
            Does mere existence balance with
            The weight of your great sacrifice?
            Or can it be you fear the grave
            Enough to live and die a slave?
            O Brother! be it better said,
            When you are gone and tears are shed,
            That your death was the stepping stone
            Your children's children cross'd upon.
            Men have died that men might live:
            Look every foeman in the eye!
            If necessary, your life give
            For something, ere in vain you die.
            'ITTLE TOUZLE HEAD
            (_To R. V.P._)

            ZALKA PEETRUZA
            (_Who Was Christened Lucy Jane_)
            She danced, near nude, to tom-tom beat,
            With swaying arms and flying feet,
            'Mid swirling spangles, gauze and lace,
            Her all was dancing--save her face.
            A conscience, dumb to brooding fears,
            Companioned hearing deaf to cheers;
            A body, marshalled by the will,
            Kept dancing while a heart stood still:
            And eyes obsessed with vacant stare,
            Looked over heads to empty air,
            As though they sought to find therein
            Redemption for a maiden sin.
            'Twas thus, amid force driven grace,
            We found the lost look on her face;
            And then, to us, did it occur
            That, though we saw--we saw not her.
            SPRIN' FEVAH
            Dar's a lazy, sortah hazy
            Feelin' grips me, thoo an' thoo;
            An' I feels lak doin' less dan enythin';
            Dough de saw is sharp an' greasy,
            Dough de task et han' is easy,
            An' de day am fair an' breezy,
            Dar's a thief dat steals embition in de win'.
            Kaint defy it, kaint deny it,
            Kaze it jes won't be denied;
            Its a mos' pursistin' stubbern sortah thin';
            Anti Tox' doan neutrolize it;
            Doctahs fail to analyze it;
            So I yiel's (dough I despise it)
            To dat res'less, wretchit fevah evah Sprin'.
            DE DRUM MAJAH
            He's struttin' sho ernuff,
            Wearin' a lady's muff
            En' ways erpon his head,
            Red coat ob reddest red,
            Purtty white satin ves',

            Goo'ness! he cuts a stunt,
            Prancin' out dar in frunt,

            Each man behine him knows

            You bet! he dues it, too.
            W'en dat brass stick he twirls,

            But take erway de head,

            A SONG OF THANKS
            For the sun that shone at the dawn of spring,
            For the flowers which bloom and the birds that sing,
            For the verdant robe of the gray old earth,
            For her coffers filled with their countless worth,
            For the flocks which feed on a thousand hills,
            For the rippling streams which turn the mills,
            For the lowing herds in the lovely vale,
            For the songs of gladness on the gale,--
            From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks,--
            Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
            For the farmer reaping his whitened fields,
            For the bounty which the rich soil yields,
            For the cooling dews and refreshing rains,
            For the sun which ripens the golden grains,
            For the bearded wheat and the fattened swine,
            For the stallèd ox and the fruitful vine,
            For the tubers large and cotton white,
            For the kid and the lambkin frisk and blithe,
            For the swan which floats near the river-banks,--
            Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
            For the pumpkin sweet and the yellow yam,
            For the corn and beans and the sugared ham,
            For the plum and the peach and the apple red,
            For the dear old press where the wine is tread,
            For the cock which crows at the breaking dawn,
            And the proud old "turk" of the farmer's barn,
            For the fish which swim in the babbling brooks,
            For the game which hide in the shady nooks,--
            From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks--
            Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
            For the sturdy oaks and the stately pines,
            For the lead and the coal from the deep, dark mines,
            For the silver ores of a thousand fold,
            For the diamond bright and the yellow gold,
            For the river boat and the flying train,
            For the fleecy sail of the rolling main,
            For the velvet sponge and the glossy pearl,
            For the flag of peace which we now unfurl,--
            From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks,--
            Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
            For the lowly cot and the mansion fair,
            For the peace and plenty together share,
            For the Hand which guides us from above,
            For Thy tender mercies, abiding love,
            For the blessed home with its children gay,
            For returnings of Thanksgiving Day,
            For the bearing toils and the sharing cares,
            We lift up our hearts in our songs and our prayers,--
            From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans' banks,--
            Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!

            TUSKEGEE
            Wherefore this busy labor without rest?
            Is it an idle dream to which we cling,
            Here where a thousand dusky toilers sing
            Unto the world their hope? "Build we our best.
            By hand and thought," they cry, "although unblessed."
            So the great engines throb, and anvils ring,
            And so the thought is wedded to the thing;
            But what shall be the end, and what the test?
            Dear God, we dare not answer, we can see
            Not many steps ahead, but this we know--
            If all our toilsome building is in vain,
            Availing not to set our manhood free,
            If envious hate roots out the seed we sow,
            The South will wear eternally a stain.
            CHRISTMAS AT MELROSE
            Come home with me a little space
            And browse about our ancient place,
            Lay by your wonted troubles here
            And have a turn of Christmas cheer.
            These sober walls of weathered stone
            Can tell a romance of their own,
            And these wide rooms of devious line
            Are kindly meant in their design.
            Sometimes the north wind searches through,
            But he shall not be rude to you.
            We'll light a log of generous girth
            For winter comfort, and the mirth
            Of healthy children you shall see
            About a sparkling Christmas tree.
            Eleanor, leader of the fold,
            Hermione with heart of gold,
            Elaine with comprehending eyes,
            And two more yet of coddling size,
            Natalie pondering all that's said,
            And Mary with the cherub head--
            All these shall give you sweet content
            And care-destroying merriment,
            While one with true madonna grace
            Moves round the glowing fire-place
            Where father loves to muse aside
            And grandma sits in silent pride.
            And you may chafe the wasting oak,
            Or freely pass the kindly joke
            To mix with nuts and home-made cake
            And apples set on coals to bake.
            Or some fine carol we will sing
            In honor of the Manger-King,
            Or hear great Milton's organ verse
            Or Plato's dialogue rehearse
            What Socrates with his last breath
            Sublimely said of life and death.
            These dear delights we fain would share
            With friend and kinsman everywhere,
            And from our door see them depart
            Each with a little lighter heart.
            SUMMER MAGIC
            So many cares to vex the day,
            So many fears to haunt the night,
            My heart was all but weaned away
            From every lure of old delight.
            Then summer came, announced by June,
            With beauty, miracle and mirth.
            She hung aloft the rounding moon,
            She poured her sunshine on the earth,
            She drove the sap and broke the bud,
            She set the crimson rose afire.
            She stirred again my sullen blood,
            And waked in me a new desire.
            Before my cottage door she spread
            The softest carpet nature weaves,
            And deftly arched above my head
            A canopy of shady leaves.
            Her nights were dreams of jeweled skies,
            Her days were bowers rife with song,
            And many a scheme did she devise
            To heal the hurt and soothe the wrong.
            For on the hill or in the dell,
            Or where the brook went leaping by
            Or where the fields would surge and swell
            With golden wheat or bearded rye,
            I felt her heart against my own,
            I breathed the sweetness of her breath,
            Till all the cark of time had flown,
            And I was lord of life and death.
            THE TEACHER
            Lord, who am I to teach the way
            To little children day by day,
            So prone myself to go astray?
            I teach them KNOWLEDGE, but I know
            How faint they flicker and how low
            The candles of my knowledge glow.
            I teach them POWER to will and do,
            But only now to learn anew
            My own great weakness through and through.
            I teach them LOVE for all mankind
            And all God's creatures, but I find
            My love comes lagging far behind.
            Lord, if their guide I still must be,
            Oh let the little children see
            The teacher leaning hard on Thee.

       <collex:text>O BLACK AND UNKNOWN BARDS
O black and unknown bards of long ago,
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?
Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
Heart of what slave poured out such melody
As "Steal away to Jesus"? On its strains
His spirit must have nightly floated free,
Though still about his hands he felt his chains.
Who heard great "Jordan roll"? Whose starward eye
Saw chariot "swing low"? And who was he
That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,
"Nobody knows de trouble I see"?
What merely living clod, what captive thing,
Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,
And find within its deadened heart to sing
These songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?
How did it catch that subtle undertone,
That note in music heard not with the ears?
How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,
Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.
Not that great German master in his dream
Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars
At the creation, ever heard a theme
Nobler than "Go down, Moses." Mark its bars
How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir
The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung
Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were
That helped make history when Time was young.
There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
That from degraded rest and servile toil
The fiery spirit of the seer should call
These simple children of the sun and soil.
O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
You--you alone, of all the long, long line
Of those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.
You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;
No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean
Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings
You touched in chord with music empyrean.
You sang far better than you knew; the songs
That for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed
Still live,--but more than this to you belongs:
You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.
SENCE YOU WENT AWAY
Seems lak to me de stars don't shine so bright,
Seems lak to me de sun done loss his light,
Seems lak to me der's nothin' goin' right,
  Sence you went away.
Seems lak to me de sky ain't half so blue,
Seems lak to me dat ev'ything wants you,
Seems lak to me I don't know what to do,
  Sence you went away.
Seems lak to me dat ev'ything is wrong,
Seems lak to me de day's jes twice es long,
Seems lak to me de bird's forgot his song,
  Sence you went away.
Seems lak to me I jes can't he'p but sigh,
Seems lak to me ma th'oat keeps gittin' dry,
Seems lak to me a tear stays in ma eye,
  Sence you went away.
THE CREATION
(_A Negro Sermon_)
And God stepped out on space,
And He looked around and said,
_"I'm lonely--
I'll make me a world."_
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said, _"That's good!"_
Then God reached out and took the light in His hands,
And God rolled the light around in His hands
Until He made the sun;
And He set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said, _"That's good!"_
Then God himself stepped down--
And the sun was on His right hand,
And the moon was on His left;
The stars were clustered about His head,
And the earth was under His feet.
And God walked, and where He trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then He stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And He spat out the seven seas;
He batted His eyes, and the lightnings flashed;
He clapped His hands, and the thunders rolled;
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around His shoulder.
Then God raised His arm and He waved His hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And He said, _"Bring forth! Bring forth!"_
And quicker than God could drop His hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said, _"That's good!"_
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that He had made.
He looked at His sun,
And He looked at His moon,
'And He looked at His little stars;
He looked on His world
With all its living things,
And God said, _"I'm lonely still."_
Then God sat down
On the side of a hill where He could think;
By a deep, wide river He sat down;
With His head in His hands,
God thought and thought,
Till He thought, _"I'll make me a man!"_
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled Him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of His hand;
This Great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till He shaped it in His own image;
Then into it He blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen.  Amen.
THE WHITE WITCH
O brothers mine, take care! Take care!
The great white witch rides out to-night.
Trust not your prowess nor your strength,
Your only safety lies in flight;
For in her glance there is a snare,
And in her smile there is a blight.
The great white witch you have not seen?
Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,
Like nursery children you have looked
For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;
But no, not so; the witch appears
In all the glowing charms of youth.
Her lips are like carnations, red,
Her face like new-born lilies, fair,
Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,
She moves with subtle grace and air,
And all about her head there floats
The golden glory of her hair.
But though she always thus appears
In form of youth and mood of mirth,
Unnumbered centuries are hers,
The infant planets saw her birth;
The child of throbbing Life is she,
Twin sister to the greedy earth.
And back behind those smiling lips,
And down within those laughing eyes,
And underneath the soft caress
Of hand and voice and purring sighs,
The shadow of the panther lurks,
The spirit of the vampire lies.
For I have seen the great white witch,
And she has led me to her lair,
And I have kissed her red, red lips
And cruel face so white and fair;
Around me she has twined her arms,
And bound me with her yellow hair.
I felt those red lips burn and sear
My body like a living coal;
Obeyed the power of those eyes
As the needle trembles to the pole;
And did not care although I felt
The strength go ebbing from my soul.
Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,
And heard your laughter loud and gay,
And in your voices she has caught
The echo of a far-off day,
When man was closer to the earth;
And she has marked you for her prey.
She feels the old Antaean strength
In you, the great dynamic beat
Of primal passions, and she sees
In you the last besieged retreat
Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,
Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.
O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!
The great white witch rides out to-night.
O, younger brothers mine, beware!
Look not upon her beauty bright;
For in her glance there is a snare,
And in her smile there is a blight.
MOTHER NIGHT
Eternities before the first-born day,
  Or ere the first sun fledged his wings of flame,
  Calm Night, the everlasting and the same,
  A brooding mother over chaos lay.
And whirling suns shall blaze and then decay,
  Shall run their fiery courses and then claim
  The haven of the darkness whence they came;
  Back to Nirvanic peace shall grope their way.
So when my feeble sun of life burns out,
  And sounded is the hour for my long sleep,
  I shall, full weary of the feverish light,
Welcome the darkness without fear or doubt,
  And heavy-lidded, I shall softly creep
  Into the quiet bosom of the Night.
O SOUTHLAND!
O Southland! O Southland!
  Have you not heard the call,
The trumpet blown, the word made known
  To the nations, one and all?
The watchword, the hope-word,
  Salvation's present plan?
A gospel new, for all--for you:
  Man shall be saved by man.
O Southland! O Southland!
  Do you not hear to-day
The mighty beat of onward feet,
  And know you not their way?
'Tis forward, 'tis upward,
  On to the fair white arch
Of Freedom's dome, and there is room
  For each man who would march.
O Southland, fair Southland!
  Then why do you still cling
To an idle age and a musty page,
  To a dead and useless thing?
'Tis springtime! 'Tis work-time!
  The world is young again!
And God's above, and God is love,
  And men are only men.
O Southland! my Southland!
  O birthland! do not shirk
The toilsome task, nor respite ask,
  But gird you for the work.
Remember, remember
  That weakness stalks in pride;
That he is strong who helps along
  The faint one at his side.
BROTHERS
See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!
No light is there; none, save the glint that shines
In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
Of some wild animal caught in the hunter's trap.
  How came this beast in human shape and form?
Speak, man!--We call you man because you wear
His shape--How are you thus? Are you not from
That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race
Which we have known three centuries? Not from
That more than faithful race which through three wars
Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes
Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!
  I am, and am not.
      Then who, why are you?
  I am a thing not new, I am as old
As human nature. I am that which lurks,
Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;
The ancient trait which fights incessantly
Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;
The weight forever seeking to obey
The law of downward pull;--and I am more:
The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;
The resultant, the inevitable end
Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
  Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,
The memories of cruel sights and deeds,
The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate
Filtered through fifteen generations have
Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.
In me the muttered curse of dying men,
On me the stain of conquered women, and
Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,
Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers
Of wretches now long dead,--their dire bequests,--
In me the echo of the stifled cry
Of children for their bartered mothers' breasts.
  I claim no race, no race claims me; I am
No more than human dregs; degenerate;
The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;
I am--just what I am. . . . The race that fed
Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same
To-day, but I--
               Enough, the brute must die!
Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist
The fire much longer than this slender pine.
Now bring the fuel! Pile it'round him! Wait!
Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose
The agony and terror in his face.
And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames
Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!
And there's another! Wilder than the first.
Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!
Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,
Searching around in vain appeal for help!
Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh
Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
Down through the coils of chain that hold erect
The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.
  Stop! to each man no more than one man's share.
You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain--
Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,
In fair division, to the leader comes.
  And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;
Let us back to our wives and children.--Say,
What did he mean by those last muttered words,
_"Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we"?_
FIFTY YEARS
(1863-1913)
_On the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Emancipation
Proclamation._
O brothers mine, to-day we stand
  Where half a century sweeps our ken,
Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,
  Struck off our bonds and made us men.
Just fifty years--a winter's day--
  As runs the history of a race;
Yet, as we look back o'er the way,
  How distant seems our starting place!
Look farther back! Three centuries!
  To where a naked, shivering score,
Snatched from their haunts across the seas,
  Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.
This land is ours by right of birth,
  This land is ours by right of toil;
We helped to turn its virgin earth,
  Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.
Where once the tangled forest stood,--
  Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,--
Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,
  The cotton white, the yellow corn.
To gain these fruits that have been earned,
  To hold these fields that have been won,
Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,
  Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.
That Banner which is now the type
  Of victory on field and flood--
Remember, its first crimson stripe
  Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.
And never yet has come the cry--
  When that fair flag has been assailed--
For men to do, for men to die,
  That we have faltered or have failed.
We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,
  Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze
Held in our hands, it has been borne
  And planted far across the seas.
And never yet,--O haughty Land,
  Let us, at least, for this be praised--
Has one black, treason-guided hand
  Ever against that flag been raised.
Then should we speak but servile words,
  Or shall we hang our heads in shame?
Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,
  And fear our heritage to claim?
No! stand erect and without fear,
  And for our foes let this suffice--
We've bought a rightful sonship here,
  And we have more than paid the price.
And yet, my brothers, well I know
  The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,
The spirit bowed beneath the blow,
  The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;
The staggering force of brutish might,
  That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;
The long, vain waiting through the night
  To hear some voice for justice raised.
Full well I know the hour when hope
  Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere
Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope
  With hands uplifted in despair.
Courage! Look out, beyond, and see
  The far horizon's beckoning span!
Faith in your God-known destiny!
  We are a part of some great plan.
Because the tongues of Garrison
  And Phillips now are cold in death,
Think you their work can be undone?
  Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?
Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?
  That Lovejoy was but idly slain?
Or do you think those precious drops
  From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?
That for which millions prayed and sighed,
  That for which tens of thousands fought,
For which so many freely died,
  God cannot let it come to naught.

       <collex:text>STANZAS FROM THE FLEDGLING BARD AND THE POETRY SOCIETY
            _Part I_
            I'm out to find the new, the modern school,
            Where Science trains the fledgling bard to fly,
            Where critics teach the ignorant, the fool,
            To write the stuff the editors would buy;
            It matters not e'en tho it be a lie,--
            Just so it aims to smash tradition's crown
            And build up one instead decked with a new renown.
            A thought is haunting me by night and day,
            And in some safe archive I seek to lay it;
            I have some startling thing I wish to say,
            And they can put me wise just how to say it.
            Without their aid, I, like the ass, must bray it,
            Without due knowledge of its mood and tense,
            And so 'tis sure to fail the bard to recompense.
            Will some kind one direct me to that college
            Where every budding genius now is headed,
            The only source to gain poetic knowledge,
            Where all the sacred truths lay deep imbedded,
            Where nothing but the genuine goods are shredded,--
            The factory where they shape new feet and meters
            That make poetic symbols sound like carpet beaters.
            *       *       *       *       *
            I hope I'll be an eligible student,
            E'en tho I am no poet in a sense,
            But just a hot-head youth with ways imprudent,--
            A rustic ranting rhymer like by chance
            Who thinks that he can make the muses dance
            By beating on some poet's borrowed lyre,
            To win some fool's applause and please his own desire.
            Perhaps they'll never know or e'en suspect
            That I am not a true, a genuine poet;
            If in the poet's colors I am decked
            They may not ask me e'er to prove or show it.
            I'll play the wise old cock, nor try to crow it,
            But be content to gaze with open mind;
            I'll never show the lead but eye things from behind.
            *       *       *       *       *
            _Part II_
            I have a problem all alone to solve,
            A problem how to find the poetry club,
            It makes my sky piece like a top revolve,
            For fear that they might mark me for a snob.
            They'll call me poetry monger and then dub
            Me rustic rhymer, anything they choose,
            Ay, anything at all, but heaven's immortal muse.
            Great Byron, when he published his Childe book,
            In which he sang of all his lovely dears,
            Called forth hot condemnation and cold look,
            From lesser mortals who were not his peers.
            They chided him for telling his affairs,
            Because they could not tell their own so well,
            They plagued the poet lord and made his life a hell.
            They called him lewd, vile drunkard, vicious wight,
            And all because he dared to tell the truth,
            Because he was no cursed hermaphrodite,--
            A full fledged genius with the fire of youth.
            They hounded him, they hammered him forsooth;
            Because he blended human with divine,
            They branded him "the bard of women and of wine."
            Of course I soak the booze once in a while,
            But I don't wake the town to sing and shout it;
            I love the girls, they win me with a smile,
            But no one knows, for I won't write about it.
            And so the fools may never think to doubt it,
            When I declare I am a moral man,
            As gifted, yet as good as God did ever plan.
            *       *       *       *       *
            Every man has got a hobby,
            Every poet has some fault,
            Every sweet contains its bitter,
            Every fresh thing has its salt.
            Every mountain has a valley,
            Every valley has a hill,
            Every ravine is a river,
            Every river is a rill.
            Every fool has got some wisdom,
            Every wise man is a fool,
            Every scholar is a block-head,
            Every dunce has been to school.
            Every bad man is a good man,
            Every fat man is not stout,
            Every good man is a bad man
            But 'tis hard to find him out.
            Every strong man is a weak man,
            You may doubt it as you please,
            Every well man is a sick man,
            Every doctor has disease.

            Sandy Star and Willie Gee,
            Count 'em two, you make 'em three:
            Pluck the man and boy apart
            And you'll see into my heart.

            _Sculptured Worship_
            The zones of warmth around his heart,
            No alien airs had crossed;
            But he awoke one morn to feel
            The magic numbness of autumnal frost.
            His thoughts were a loose skein of threads,
            And tangled emotions, vague and dim;
            And sacrificing what he loved
            He lost the dearest part of him.
            In sculptured worship now he lives,
            His one desire a prisoned ache;
            If he can never melt again
            His very heart will break.

            _Laughing It Out_
            He had a whim and laughed it out
            Upon the exit of a chance;
            He floundered in a sea of doubt--
            If life was real--or just romance.
            Sometimes upon his brow would come
            A little pucker of defiance;
            He totalled in a word the sum
            Of all man made of facts and science.
            And then a hearty laugh would break,
            A reassuring shrug of shoulder;
            And we would from his fancy take
            A faith in death which made life bolder.
            III
            _Exit_
            No, his exit by the gate
            Will not leave the wind ajar;
            He will go when it is late
            With a misty star.
            One will call, he cannot see;
            One will call, he will not hear;
            He will take no company
            Nor a hope or fear.
            We shall smile who loved him so--
            They who gave him hate will weep;
            But for us the winds will blow
            Pulsing through his sleep.
            IV
            _The Way_
            He could not tell the way he came,
            Because his chart was lost:
            Yet all his way was paved with flame
            From the bourne he crossed.
            He did not know the way to go,
            Because he had no map:
            He followed where the winds blow,--
            And the April sap.
            He never knew upon his brow
            The secret that he bore,--
            And laughs away the mystery now
            The dark's at his door.
            V
            _Onus Probandi_
            No more from out the sunset,
            No more across the foam,
            No more across the windy hills
            Will Sandy Star come home.
            He went away to search it
            With a curse upon his tongue:
            And in his hand the staff of life,
            Made music as it swung.
            I wonder if he found it,
            And knows the mystery now--
            Our Sandy Star who went away,
            With the secret on his brow.
            DEL CASCAR
            Del Cascar, Del Cascar,
            Stood upon a flaming star,
            Stood, and let his feet hang down
            Till in China the toes turned brown.
            And he reached his fingers over
            The rim of the sea, like sails from Dover,
            And caught a Mandarin at prayer,
            And tickled his nose in Orion's hair.
            The sun went down through crimson bars,
            And left his blind face battered with stars--
            But the brown toes in China kept
            Hot the tears Del Cascar wept.
            TURN ME TO MY YELLOW LEAVES
            Turn me to my yellow leaves,
            I am better satisfied;
            There is something in me grieves--
            That was never born, and died.
            Let me be a scarlet flame
            On a windy autumn morn,
            I who never had a name,
            Nor from breathing image born.
            From the margin let me fall
            Where the farthest stars sink down,
            And the void consumes me,--all
            In nothingness to drown.
            Let me dream my dream entire,
            Withered as an autumn leaf--
            Let me have my vain desire,
            Vain--as it is brief.
            IRONIC: LL.D.
            There are no hollows any more
            Between the mountains; the prairie floor
            Is like a curtain with the drape
            Of the winds' invisible shape;
            And nowhere seen and nowhere heard
            The sea's quiet as a sleeping bird.
            Now we're traveling, what holds back
            Arrival, in the very track
            Where the urge put forth; so we stay
            And move a thousand miles a day.
            Time's a Fancy ringing bells
            Whose meaning, charlatan history, tells!
            SCINTILLA
            I kissed a kiss in youth
            Upon a dead man's brow;
            And that was long ago,--
            And I'm a grown man now.
            It's lain there in the dust,
            Thirty years and more;--
            My lips that set a light
            At a dead man's door.
            SIC VITA
            Heart free, hand free,
            Blue above, brown under,
            All the world to me
            Is a place of wonder.
            Sun shine, moon shine,
            Stars, and winds a-blowing,
            All into this heart of mine
            Flowing, flowing, flowing!
            Mind free, step free,
            Days to follow after,
            Joys of life sold to me
            For the price of laughter.
            Girl's love, man's love,
            Love of work and duty,
            Just a will of God's to prove
            Beauty, beauty, beauty!
            RHAPSODY
            I am glad daylong for the gift of song,
            For time and change and sorrow;
            For the sunset wings and the world-end things
            Which hang on the edge of to-morrow.
            I am glad for my heart whose gates apart
            Are the entrance-place of wonders,
            Where dreams come in from the rush and din
            Like sheep from the rains and thunders.

       <collex:text>DOGWOOD BLOSSOMS
            To dreamy languors and the violet mist
            Of early Spring, the deep sequestered vale
            Gives first her paling-blue Miamimist,
            Where blithely pours the cuckoo's annual tale
            Of Summer promises and tender green,
            Of a new life and beauty yet unseen.
            The forest trees have yet a sighing mouth,
            Where dying winds of March their branches swing,
            While upward from the dreamy, sunny South,
            A hand invisible leads on the Spring.
            His rounds from bloom to bloom the bee begins
            With flying song, and cowslip wine he sups,
            Where to the warm and passing southern winds,
            Azaleas gently swing their yellow cups.
            Soon everywhere, with glory through and through,
            The fields will spread with every brilliant hue.
            But high o'er all the early floral train,
            Where softness all the arching sky resumes,
            The dogwood dancing to the winds' refrain,
            In stainless glory spreads its snowy blooms.
            A BUTTERFLY IN CHURCH
            What dost thou here, thou shining, sinless thing,
            With many colored hues and shapely wing?
            Why quit the open field and summer air
            To flutter here? Thou hast no need of prayer.
            'Tis meet that we, who this great structure built,
            Should come to be redeemed and washed from guilt,
            For we this gilded edifice within
            Are come, with erring hearts and stains of sin.
            But thou art free from guilt as God on high;
            Go, seek the blooming waste and open sky,
            And leave us here our secret woes to bear,
            Confessionals and agonies of prayer.
            THE HILLS OF SEWANEE
            Sewanee Hills of dear delight,
            Prompting my dreams that used to be,
            I know you are waiting me still to-night
            By the Unika Range of Tennessee.
            The blinking stars in endless space,
            The broad moonlight and silvery gleams,
            To-night caress your wind-swept face,
            And fold you in a thousand dreams.
            Your far outlines, less seen than felt,
            Which wind with hill propensities,
            In moonlight dreams I see you melt
            Away in vague immensities.
            And, far away, I still can feel
            Your mystery that ever speaks
            Of vanished things, as shadows steal
            Across your breast and rugged peaks.
            O, dear blue hills, that lie apart,
            And wait so patiently down there,
            Your peace takes hold upon my heart
            And makes its burden less to bear.
            THE FEET OF JUDAS
            Christ washed the feet of Judas!
            The dark and evil passions of his soul,
            His secret plot, and sordidness complete,
            His hate, his purposing, Christ knew the whole,
            And still in love he stooped and washed his feet.
            Christ washed the feet of Judas!
            Yet all his lurking sin was bare to him,
            His bargain with the priest, and more than this,
            In Olivet, beneath the moonlight dim,
            Aforehand knew and felt his treacherous kiss.
            Christ washed the feet of Judas!
            And so ineffable his love 'twas meet,
            That pity fill his great forgiving heart,
            And tenderly to wash the traitor's feet,
            Who in his Lord had basely sold his part.
            Christ washed the feet of Judas!
            And thus a girded servant, self-abased,
            Taught that no wrong this side the gate of heaven
            Was ever too great to wholly be effaced,
            And though unasked, in spirit be forgiven.
            And so if we have ever felt the wrong
            Of Trampled rights, of caste, it matters not,
            What e'er the soul has felt or suffered long,
            Oh, heart! this one thing should not be forgot:
            Christ washed the feet of Judas.

       <collex:text>A LITANY OF ATLANTA
            Done at Atlanta, in the Day of Death, 1906
            O Silent God, Thou whose voice afar in mist and mystery hath left our ears
            an-hungered in these fearful days--
            Hear us, good Lord!
            Listen to us, Thy children: our faces dark with doubt are made a mockery
            in Thy sanctuary. With uplifted hands we front Thy heaven, O God, crying:
            We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!
            We are not better than our fellows, Lord, we are but weak and human men.
            When our devils do deviltry, curse Thou the doer and the deed: curse them
            as we curse them, do to them all and more than ever they have done to
            innocence and weakness, to womanhood and home.
            Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners!
            And yet whose is the deeper guilt? Who made these devils? Who nursed them
            in crime and fed them on injustice? Who ravished and debauched their
            mothers and their grandmothers? Who bought and sold their crime, and waxed
            fat and rich on public iniquity?
            Thou knowest, good God!
            Is this Thy justice, O Father, that guile be easier than innocence, and
            the innocent crucified for the guilt of the untouched guilty?
            Justice, O judge of men!
            Wherefore do we pray? Is not the God of the fathers dead? Have not seers
            seen in Heaven's halls Thine hearsed and lifeless form stark amidst the
            black and rolling smoke of sin, where all along bow bitter forms of
            endless dead?
            Awake, Thou that sleepest!
            Thou art not dead, but flown afar, up hills of endless light, thru blazing
            corridors of suns, where worlds do swing of good and gentle men, of women
            strong and free--far from the cozenage, black hypocrisy and chaste
            prostitution of this shameful speck of dust!
            Turn again, O Lord, leave us not to perish in our sin!
            From lust of body and lust of blood
            Great God, deliver us!
            From lust of power and lust of gold,
            Great God, deliver us!
            From the leagued lying of despot and of brute,
            Great God, deliver us!
            A city lay in travail, God our Lord, and from her loins sprang twin Murder
            and Black Hate. Red was the midnight; clang, crack and cry of death and
            fury filled the air and trembled underneath the stars when church spires
            pointed silently to Thee. And all this was to sate the greed of greedy men
            who hide behind the veil of vengeance!
            Bend us Thine ear, O Lord!
            In the pale, still morning we looked upon the deed. We stopped our ears
            and held our leaping hands, but they--did they not wag their heads and
            leer and cry with bloody jaws: Cease from Crime! The word was
            mockery, for thus they train a hundred crimes while we do cure one.
            Turn again our captivity, O Lord!
            Behold this maimed and broken thing; dear God, it was an humble black man
            who toiled and sweat to save a bit from the pittance paid him. They told
            him: Work and Rise. He worked. Did this man sin? Nay, but some one
            told how some one said another did--one whom he had never seen nor known.
            Yet for that man's crime this man lieth maimed and murdered, his wife
            naked to shame, his children, to poverty and evil.
            Hear us, O Heavenly Father!
            Doth not this justice of hell stink in Thy nostrils, O God? How long shall
            the mounting flood of innocent blood roar in Thine ears and pound in our
            hearts for vengeance? Pile the pale frenzy of blood-crazed brutes who do
            such deeds high on Thine altar, Jehovah Jireh, and burn it in hell forever
            and forever!
            Forgive us, good Lord; we know not what we say!
            Bewildered we are, and passion-tost, mad with the madness of a mobbed and
            mocked and murdered people; straining at the armposts of Thy Throne, we
            raise our shackled hands and charge Thee, God, by the bones of our stolen
            fathers, by the tears of our dead mothers, by the very blood of Thy
            crucified Christ: What meaneth this? Tell us the Plan; give us the
            Sign!
            Keep not thou silence, O God!
            Sit no longer blind, Lord God, deaf to our prayer and dumb to our dumb
            suffering. Surely Thou too art not white, O Lord, a pale, bloodless,
            heartless thing?
            Ah! Christ of all the Pities!
            Forgive the thought! Forgive these wild, blasphemous words. Thou art still
            the God of our black fathers, and in Thy soul's soul sit some soft
            darkenings of the evening, some shadowings of the velvet night.
            But whisper--speak--call, great God, for Thy silence is white terror to
            our hearts! The way, O God, show us the way and point us the path.
            Whither? North is greed and South is blood; within, the coward, and
            without, the liar. Whither? To death?
            Amen! Welcome dark sleep!
            Whither? To life? But not this life, dear God, not this. Let the cup pass
            from us, tempt us not beyond our strength, for there is that clamoring and
            clawing within, to whose voice we would not listen, yet shudder lest we
            must, and it is red, Ah! God! It is a red and awful shape.
            Selah!
            In yonder East trembles a star.
            Vengeance is mine; I mill repay, saith the Lord!
            Thy will, O Lord, be done!
            Kyrie Eleison!
            Lord, we have done these pleading, wavering words.
            We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!
            We bow our heads and hearken soft to the sobbing of women and little
            children.
            We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!
            Our voices sink in silence and in night.
            Hear us, good Lord!
            In night, O God of a godless land!
            Amen!
            In silence, O Silent God.
            _Selah!_

       <collex:text>DUSK SONG
            The garden is very quiet to-night,
            The dusk has gone with the Evening Star,
            And out on the bay a lone ship light
            Makes a silver pathway over the bar
            Where the sea sings low.
            I follow the light with an earnest eye,
            Creeping along to the thick far-away,
            Until it fell in the depths of the deep, dark sky
            With the haunting dream of the dusk of day
            And its lovely glow.
            Long nights, long nights and the whisperings of new ones,
            Flame the line of the pathway down to the sea
            With the halo of new dreams and the hallow of old ones,
            And they bring magic light to my love reverie
            And a lover's regret.
            Tender sorrow for loss of a soft murmured word,
            Tender measure of doubt in a faint, aching heart,
            Tender listening for wind-songs in the tree heights heard
            When you and I were of the dusks a part,
            Are with me yet.
            I pray for faith to the noble spirit of Space,
            I sound the cosmic depths for the measure of glory
            Which will bring to this earth the imperishable race
            Of whom Beauty dreamed in the soul-toned story
            The Prophets told.
            Silence and love and deep wonder of stars
            Dust-silver the heavens from west to east,
            From south to north, and in a maze of bars
            Invisible I wander far from the feast
            As night grows old.
            Half blind is my vision I know to the truth,
            My ears are half deaf to the voice of the tear
            That touches the silences as Autumn's ruth
            Steals thru the dusks of each returning year
            A goodly friend.
            The Autumn, then Winter and wintertime's grief!
            But the weight of the snow is the glistening gift
            Which loving brings to the rose and its leaf,
            For the days of the roses glow in the drift
            And never end.
            *       *       *       *       *
            The moon has come. Wan and pallid is she.
            The spell of half memories, the touch of half tears,
            And the wounds of worn passions she brings to me
            With all the tremor of the far-off years
            And their mad wrong.
            Yet the garden is very quiet to-night,
            The dusk has long gone with the Evening Star,
            And out on the bay the moon's wan light
            Lays a silver pathway beyond the bar,
            Dear heart, pale and long.
            IT WAS NOT FATE
            It was not fate which overtook me,
            Rather a wayward, wilful wind
            That blew hot for awhile
            And then, as the even shadows came, blew cold.
            What pity it is that a man grown old in life's dreaming
            Should stop, e'en for a moment, to look into a woman's eyes.
            And I forgot!
            Forgot that one's heart must be steeled against the east wind.
            Life and death alike come out of the East:
            Life as tender as young grass,
            Death as dreadful as the sight of clotted blood.
            I shall go back into the darkness,
            Not to dream but to seek the light again.
            I shall go by paths, mayhap,
            On roads that wind around the foothills
            Where the plains are bare and wild
            And the passers-by come few and far between.
            I want the night to be long, the moon blind,
            The hills thick with moving memories,
            And my heart beating a breathless requiem
            For all the dead days I have lived.
            When the Dawn comes--Dawn, deathless, dreaming--
            I shall will that my soul must be cleansed of hate,
            I shall pray for strength to hold children close to my heart,
            I shall desire to build houses where the poor will know shelter, comfort,
            beauty.
            And then may I look into a woman's eyes
            And find holiness, love and the peace which passeth understanding.

            SOME weep to find the Golden Pear
            Feeds maggots at the core,
            And some grow cold as ice, and bear
            Them prouder than before.
            But you go singing like the sea
            Whose lover turns to land;
            You make your grief a melody
            And take it by the hand.
            Such songs the mellow-bosomed maids
            Of Africa intone
            For lovers dead in hidden glades,
            Slow rotting flesh and bone.
            Such keenings tremble from the kraal,
            Where sullen-browed abides
            The second wife whose dark tears fail
            To draw him to her sides.
            Somewhere Jeritza breaks her heart
            On symbols Verdi wrote;
            You tear the strings of your soul apart,
            Blood dripping note by note.

            SHE went to buy a brand new hat,
            And she was ugly, black, and fat:
            “This red becomes you well,” they said,
            And perched it high upon her head.
            And then they laughed behind her back
            To see it glow against the black.
            She paid for it with regal mien,
            And walked out proud as any queen.

            The play is done, the crowds depart; and see
            That twisted tortured thing hung from a tree,
            Swart victim of a newer Calvary.

            Yea, he who helped Christ up Golgotha's track,
            That Simon who did not deny, was black.
            (The Unknown Color)
            I’ve often heard my mother say,
            When great winds blew across the day,
            And, cuddled close and out of sight,
            The young pigs squealed with sudden fright
            Like something speared or javelined,
            “Poor little pigs, they see the wind.”

            (To Fiona)
            PITY the deep in love;⁠
            They move as men asleep,
            Traveling a narrow way
            Precipitous and steep.
            Tremulous is the lover’s breath
            With little moans and sighs;
            Heavy are the brimming lids
            Upon a lover’s eyes.

       <collex:text>Timid Lover
            IWHO employ a poet’s tongue,
            Would tell you how
            You are a golden damson hung
            Upon a silver bough.
            I who adore exotic things
            Would shape a sound
            To be your name, a word that sings
            Until the head goes round.
            I who am proud with other folk
            Would grow complete
            In pride on bitter words you spoke,
            And kiss your petalled feet.
            But never past the frail intent
            My will may flow,
            Though gentle looks of yours are bent
            Upon me where I go.
            So must I, starved for love’s delight,
            Affect the mute,
            When love’s divinest acolyte
            Extends me holy fruit.

       <collex:text>Nocturne
            TELL me all things false are true,⁠
            Bitter sweet, that fools are wise;
            I will not doubt nor question you;
            I am in a mood for lies.
            Tell me all things ill turn good;
            Thew and sinew will be stronger
            Thriving on the deadly food
            Life proffers for their hunger.
            Paint love lovely, if you will;
            Be crafty, sly, deceptive;
            Here is fertile land to till,
            Sun-seeking, rain-receptive.
            Hold my hand and lie to me;
            I will not ask you How nor Why;
            I see death drawing nigh to me
            Out of the corner of my eye.

            WHAT if you come
            Again and swell
            The throat of some
            Mute bird;
            How shall I tell?
            How shall I know
            That it is so,
            Having heard?
            Love, let no trick
            Of what’s to come
            Deceive; the quick
            So soon grow dumb;
            With wine and bread
            Our feast is spread;
            Let’s leave no crumb.

            IF I was born a liar, lass,
            And you were born a jade,
            It’s just the way things come to pass,
            And men and mice are made.
            I tell you love is like the dew
            That trembles on the grass;
            You’d not believe me, speaking true,
            That love is wormwood, lass.
            You swear no other lips but mine
            Have clung like this to yours,
            But lass, I know how such strong wine
            Draws bees and flies by scores.
            I now voluptuously bask
            Where Jack tomorrow will,
            And while we kiss, I long to ask,
            “What girl goes up that hill?”
            You love me for the liar I am;
            I love the minx you are;
            ’Tis heaven we must bless or damn
            That shaped us on a par.

       <collex:text>Variations on a Theme
            (The Loss of Love)
            1
            THIS house where Love a little while abode,
            Impoverished completely of him now,
            Of every vestige bare, drained like a bough
            Wherefrom the all-sustaining sap has flowed
            Away, yet bears upon its front bestowed
            A cabalistic legend telling how
            Love for a meagre space deigned to allow
            It summer scent before the winter snowed.
            Here rots to ruin a splendor proudly calm,
            A skeleton whereof the clean bones wear
            Their indigence relieved of any qualm
            For purple robes that once were folded there.
            The mouldy Coliseum draws upon
            Our wonder yet . . . no less Love’s Parthenon.
            2
            All through an empty place I go,
            And find her not in any room;
            The candles and the lamps I light
            Go down before a wind of gloom.
            Thick-spraddled lies the dust about,
            A fit, sad place to write her name
            Or draw her face the way she looked
            That legendary night she came.
            The old house crumbles bit by bit;
            Each day I hear the ominous thud
            That says another rent is there
            For winds to pierce and storms to flood.
            My orchards groan and sag with fruit;
            Where, Indian-wise, the bees go round;
            I let it rot upon the bough;
            I eat what falls upon the ground.
            The heavy cows go laboring
            In agony with clotted teats;
            My hands are slack; my blood is cold;
            I marvel that my heart still beats.
            I have no will to weep or sing,
            No least desire to pray or curse;
            The loss of love is a terrible thing;
            They lie who say that death is worse.

       <collex:text>A Song of Sour Grapes
            I WISH your body were in the grave,
            Deep down as a grave may be,
            Or rotting under the deepest wave
            That ever ploughed the sea.
            I wish I never had seen your face,
            Or the sinuous curve of your mouth,
            Dear as a straw to a man who drowns
            Or rain to a land in drouth.
            I would that your mother had never borne,
            Your father’s seed to fruit,
            That meadow rats had gnawed his corn
            Before it gathered root.

            YOU were the path I had to take
            To find that all
            That lay behind its loops and bends
            Was a bare blank wall.
            You were the way my curious hands
            Were doomed to learn
            That fire, lovely to the sight,
            To the touch will burn.
            That yours was no slight rôle, my dear,
            Be well content;
            Not everyone is blessed to be
            Wisdom’s instrument.

            THE lily, being white not red,
            Contemns the vivid flower,
            And men alive believe the dead
            Have lost their vital power.
            Yet some prefer the brilliant shade,
            And pass the livid by;
            And no man knows if dead men fade
            Or bloom, save those that die.

       <collex:text>To Endymion
            ENDYMION, your star is steadfast now,⁠
            Beyond aspersion’s power to glitter down;
            There is no redder blossom on the bough
            Of song, no richer jewel in her crown;
            Long shall she stammer forth a broken note,
            (Striving with how improvident a tongue)
            Before the ardor of another throat
            Transcends the jubilate you have sung.
            High as the star of that last poignant cry
            Death could not stifle in the wasted frame,
            You know at length the bright immortal lie
            Time gives to those detractors of your name,
            And see, from where you and Diana ride,
            Your humble epitaph—how misapplied!
            Rome, August 1926, after a visit to the grave of Keats.

            OF ALL the grandeur that was Solomon’s
            High testament of Israel’s far pride,
            Shedding its lustre like a sun of suns,
            This feeble flicker only has not died.
            This wall alone reminds a vanquished race,
            This brief remembrance still retained in stone,
            That sure foundations guard their given place
            To rehabilitate the overthrown.
            So in the battered temple of the heart,
            That grief is harder on than time on stone,
            Though three sides crumble, one will stand apart,
            Where thought may mourn its past, remembrance groan,
            And hands now bare that once were rich with rings
            Rebuild upon the ancient site of things.

       <collex:text>Millennial
            (To John Haynes Holmes)
            ONCE in a thousand years a call may ring
            Divested so of every cumbering lie,
            A man espousing it may fight and sing,
            And count it but a little thing to die;
            Once in a thousand years a star may come,
            Six-pointed, tipped with such an astral flow,
            Its singing sisters must bow hushed in dumb,
            Half-mutinous, yet half-adoring show.
            Once in as many years a man may rise
            So cosmopolitan of thought and speech,
            Humanity reflected in his eyes,
            His heart a haven every race can reach,
            That doubters shall receive a mortal thrust,
            And own, “This man proves flesh exalts its dust.”

       <collex:text>On the Mediterranean Sea
            THAT weaver of words, the poet who
            First named this sullen sea the blue,
            And left off painting there, he knew
            How rash a man would be to try
            Precise defining of such a dye
            As lurks within this colored spume.
            And for retelling little room
            He willed to singers then unborn
            But destined later years, at morn,
            High noon, twilight, or night to view
            This Protean sheet, and anguish through
            The mind to paint its wayward hue.
            Not Helen’s eyes, no vaunted stains
            That shone in Cressid’s lacy veins,
            Not those proud fans the peacocks spread,
            No sky that ever arched its head
            Above a wonder-stricken two
            Aghast at love, wore such a hue.
            Only the Hand that never erred
            Bent on beauty, creation-spurred,
            Could mix and mingle such a dye,
            Nor leave its like in earth or sky.
            That sire of singers, the poet who
            First named this sullen sea the blue
            And left off painting there, he knew!

            A CITY builded on a hill may flaunt
            Its glory in the sunken valley’s face,
            And ways the Nazarene has trod may vaunt
            A credible inheritance of grace.
            Your very stones, Jerusalem, can sing:
            “He would have taken us beneath His wing.”

            I HOLD not with the fatalist creed
            Of what must be must be;
            There is enough to meet my need
            In this most meagre me.
            These two slim arms were made to rein
            My steed, to ward and fend;
            There is more gold in this small brain
            Than I can ever spend.
            The seed I plant is chosen well;
            Ambushed by no sly sweven,
            I plant it if it droops to hell,
            Or if it blooms to heaven.

       <collex:text>Advice to a Beauty
            (To Sydonia)
            OF ALL things, lady, be not proud;
            Inter not beauty in that shroud
            Wherein the living waste, the dead,
            Unwept and unrememberéd,
            Decay. Beauty beats so frail a wing;
            Suffer men to gaze, poets to sing
            How radiant you are, compare
            And favor you to that most rare
            Bird of delight: a lovely face
            Matched with an equal inner grace.
            Sweet bird, beware the Fowler, Pride;
            His knots once neatly crossed and tied,
            The prey is caged and walled about
            With no way in and no way out.

            AND when I think how that dark throat of thine,
            Irreconcilably stilled, lies mute,
            A golden honey-hive robbed of its fruit,
            A wassail cup in which there is no wine;
            Thy sweet, high treble hushed that never mine
            Auricular delight again shall suit
            To wild bird warblings, or liken to a flute
            That with wild tremors agitates the spine;
            Then though the legion-throated spring cry out,
            Though raucously the summer whirl about
            Me all her scent and color in one shout
            Of pride, though autumn clamor at my ear,
            Or winter crackle round me, crystal-clear,
            While memory persists, I do not hear.

       <collex:text>More Than a Fool’s Song
            (To Edward Perry)
            GO LOOK for beauty where you least
            Expect to hear her hive;
            Regale your belly with a feast
            Of hunger till you thrive.
            For honest treatment seek the thief;
            For truth consult the liar;
            Court pleasure in the halls of grief;
            Find smoothness on a briar.
            The worth impearled in chastity
            Is known best of the harlot,
            And courage throws her panoply
            On many a native varlet.
            In Christian practice those who move
            To symbols strange to us
            May reckon clearer of His love
            Than we who own His cross.
            The world’s a curious riddle thrown
            Water-wise from heaven’s cup;
            The souls we think are hurtling down
            Perhaps are climbing up.

       <collex:text>The Poet
            LEST any forward thought intrude
            Of death and desolation,
            Upon a mind shaped but to brood
            On wonder and creation,
            He keeps an unremittent feud
            Against such usurpation.
            His ears are tuned to all sharp cries
            Of travail and complaining,
            His vision stalks a new moon’s rise
            In every old moon’s waning,
            And in his heart pride’s red flag flies
            Too high for sorrow’s gaining.
            Thus militant, with sword in hand,
            His battle shout renewing,
            He feels all faith affords is planned,
            As seeds, for rich accruing;
            Death ties no knot too gordianed
            For his deft hands’ undoing.

            (To Melanie)
            YOU too listless to examine
            If in pestilence or famine
            Death lurk least, a hungry gamin
            Gnawing on you like a beaver
            On a root, while you trifle
            Time away nodding in the sun,
            Careless how the shadows crawl
            Surely up your crumbling wall,
            Heedless of the Thief’s footfall,
            Death’s whose nimble fingers rifle
            Your heartbeats one by weary one,—
            Here’s the difference in our dying:
            You go dawdling, we go flying.
            Here’s a thought flung out to plague you:
            Ours the pleasure if we’d liever
            Burn completely with the fever
            Than go ambling with the ague.

       <collex:text>Hunger
            (To Emerson Withorne)
            BREAK me no bread however white it be;
            It cannot fill the emptiness I know;
            No wine can cool this desert thirst in me
            Though it had lain a thousand years in snow;
            No swooning lotus flower’s languid juice
            Drips anodyne unto my restlessness,
            And impotent to win me to a truce
            Is every artifice of loveliness.
            Inevitable is the way I go,
            False-faced amid a pageant permeate
            With bliss, yet visioning a higher wave
            Than this weak ripple washing to and fro;
            The fool still keeps his dreams inviolate
            Till their virginity espouse the grave.

            SINCE men grow diffident at last,
            And care no whit at all,
            If spring be come, or the fall be past,
            Or how the cool rains fall,
            I come to no flower but I pluck,
            I raise no cup but I sip,
            For a mouth is the best of sweets to suck;
            The oldest wine’s on the lip.
            If I grow old in a year or two,
            And come to the querulous song
            Of “Alack and aday” and “This was true,
            And that, when I was young,”
            I must have sweets to remember by,
            Some blossom saved from the mire,
            Some death-rebellious ember I
            Can fan into a fire.

       <collex:text>Scandal and Gossip
            SCANDAL is a stately lady,
            Whispers when she talks;
            Waves of innuendo
            Ripple where she walks.
            Speaking with a lifted shoulder,
            Flicker of a lash,
            Scorning words as dangerous,
            She is never rash.
            Gossip is a giddy girl
            Running here and there,
            Showing all the neighborhood
            What she has to wear.
            Gossip babbles like a brook,
            Rages like a flood,
            Chews her placid hearsays
            As a cow her cud.
            Scandal hobnobs with the rich
            Over purple wine;
            Gossip has the vagabonds
            In to chat and dine.
            Scandal never visits us;
            We are far too poor;
            Gossip never missed a day
            Knocking at our door.

       <collex:text>An Epitaph
            (For Amy Lowell)
            SHE leans across a golden table,
            Confronts God with an eye
            Still puzzled by the standard label
            All flesh bears: Made to die —
            And questions Him if He is able
            To reassure her why.

            (To John Trounstine)
            I LONG not now, a little while at least,
            For that serene interminable hour
            When I shall leave this Barmecidal feast
            With poppy for my everlasting flower;
            I long not now for that dim cubicle
            Of earth to which my lease will not expire,
            Where he who comes a tenant there may dwell
            Without a thought of famine, flood, or fire.
            Surely that house has quiet to bestow—
            Still tongue, spent pulse, heart pumped of its last throb,
            The fingers tense and tranquil in a row,
            The throat unwelled with any sigh or sob—
            But time to live, to love, bear pain and smile,
            Oh, we are given such a little while!

       <collex:text>Lines to My Father
            THE many sow, but only the chosen reap;
            Happy the wretched host if Day be brief,
            That with the cool oblivion of sleep
            A dawnless Night may soothe the smart of grief.
            If from the soil our sweat enriches sprout
            One meagre blossom for our hands to cull,
            Accustomed indigence provokes a shout
            Of praise that life becomes so bountiful.
            Now ushered regally into your own,
            Look where you will, as far as eye can see,
            Your little seeds are to a fullness grown,
            And golden fruit is ripe on every tree.
            Yours is no fairy gift, no heritage
            Without travail, to which weak wills aspire;
            This is a merited and grief-earned wage
            From One Who holds His servants worth their hire.
            So has the shyest of your dreams come true,
            Built not of sand, but of the solid rock,
            Impregnable to all that may accrue
            Of elemental rage: storm, stress, and shock.

       <collex:text>Cor Cordium[1]
            COR cordium is written there,⁠
            But the heart of hearts is away;
            They could not fashion any bier
            To hold that burning clay.
            Imprisoned in the flesh, he wrought
            Till Death as Prospero,
            Pitied the spark that life had caught,
            Loosed him, and let him go.
            Look, a light like a sun-girt flask;
            Listen, and hear it sing.
            Light and song are what, you ask?
            Ariel off on the wing!
            Written at the Shelly Memorial in Rome, August 1926.

       <collex:text>In Spite of Death
            ALL things confirm me in the thought that dust,
            Once raised to monumental pride of breath,
            To no extent affirms the right of death
            To raze such splendor to an ancient crust.
            “Grass withereth, the flower fadeth;” yea,
            But in the violated seed exults,
            The bleakest winter through, a deathless pulse,
            Beating, “Spring wipes this sacrilege away.”
            No less shall I in some new fashion flare
            Again, when death has blown my candles out;
            Although my blood went down in shameful rout
            Tonight, by all this living frame holds fair,
            Though death should closet me tonight, I swear
            Tomorrow’s sun would find his cupboard bare.

       <collex:text>To Lovers of Earth: Fair Warning
            GIVE over to high things the fervent thought⁠
            You waste on Earth; let down the righteous bar
            Against a wayward peace too dearly bought
            Upon this pale and passion-frozen star.
            Sweethearts and friends, are they not loyal? Far
            More fickle, false, perverse, far more unkind
            Is Earth to those who give her heart and mind.
            And you whose lusty youth her snares intrigue,
            Who glory in her seas, swear by her clouds,
            With Age, man’s foe, Earth ever is in league.
            Time resurrects her even while he crowds
            Your bloom to dust, and lengthens out your shrouds
            A day’s length or a year’s; she will be young,
            When your last cracked and quivering note is sung.
            She will remain the Earth, sufficient still,
            Though you are gone and with you that rare loss
            That vanishes with your bewildered will.
            And there shall flame no red, indignant cross
            For you, no quick white scar of wrath emboss
            The sky, no blood drip from a wounded moon,
            And not a single star chime out of tune.

       <collex:text>An Old Story
            “I must be ready when he comes,” she said,
            “Besieger of the heart, the long adored;
            And I shall know him by his regal tread,
            And by the grace peculiar to my lord.
            Upon my mouth his lips shall be a sword;
            Splendid is he by whom this breast shall fall,
            This hive of honey burst, this fruit be cored.”
            So beauty that would be a willing thrall
            Kept vigil, eyes aglow, ear tuned to hear his call.
            Had she not had her dream, she might have seen
            For what he was the stranger at her gate,
            And known his rugged hands, strong mouth, and lean
            Hawk-face spelled out for her a star-spun fate.
            But captive to a dream she let him wait
            In vain for any word she might have said
            Whereat he might declare himself her mate.
            She looked him through as one unknown or dead;
            He passed, an unseen halo blazing round his head.
            The grave will be her only lover now,
            Though still she watches for the shining one,
            Her prince in purple robes, with flaming brow,
            Astride a wild steed lineaged from the sun.
            Season to season shades, the long days run
            To longer years; she still is waiting there,
            Not knowing long ago her siege was done,
            Not dreaming it has been her bitter share
            To entertain her heart’s high guest all unaware.

       <collex:text>Portrait of a Lover
            WEARY, restless, now fever’s minion, furnace-hot,⁠
            Now without reason shivering prey to some great dread;
            Trusting, doubting, prone to reveal, yet wishing not
            To name this malady whereby his wits are led,
            Trapped in this labyrinth without a magic thread,
            He gropes bewildered in a most familiar place;
            It should be spring by all the signs and portents spread,
            But four strong seasons wrangle on this lover’s face.
            Of all men born he deems himself so much accurst,
            His plight so piteous, his proper pain so rare,
            The very bread he eats so dry, so fierce his thirst,
            What shall we liken such a martyr to? Compare
            Him to a man with poison raging in his throat,
            And far away the one mind with an antidote.

       <collex:text>Love’s Way
            LOVE is not love demanding all, itself
            Withholding aught; love’s is the nobler way
            Of courtesy, that will not feast aware
            That the beloved hungers, nor drink unless
            The cup be shared down to the last sweet dregs.
            Renunciatory never was the thorn
            To crown love with, but prodigal and proud!
            Too proud to rest the debtor of the one
            Dear passion most it dotes upon, always
            Love rehabilitates unto the end.
            So let it be with us; the perfect faith
            We each to other swear this moment leaves
            Our scales harmonious, neither wanting found
            Though weighed in such strict balances. So let
            It be with us always. I am too proud
            To owe you one caress; you must not drop
            Beholden to my favor for one least
            Endearing term. Should you reveal some stretch
            Of sky to me, let me revive some note
            Of music lost to you. This is love’s way,
            That where a heart is asked gives back a heart.

       <collex:text>The Poet Puts His Heart to School
            OUR love has dwindled down to this:
            With proper stress and emphasis
            To crown a given exercise;
            Those lips, that bearing, those great eyes
            I once was wont to praise, I trade
            Now for technique and for a grade.
            That sun in which I used to bask
            Now glorifies a schoolboy’s task.
            Priest am I now for wisdom’s pay,
            And half a priest’s task is to slay,
            Nor raise one far-remembering cry
            Though with the slain the slayer die.
            Aloft the sacred knife is curved:
            The gods of knowledge must be served.

       <collex:text>Two Thoughts of Death
            1
            WHEN I am dead, it will not be
            Much matter of concern to me
            Who folds my hands, or combs my hair,
            Or, pitying their sightless stare,
            Draws down the blinds across my eyes.
            I shall not have the least surmise
            Which of the many loves I had
            Weeps most the passing of her lad.
            Not what these give, nor what they keep,
            Shall gladden or disturb my sleep,
            If only one who never guessed
            How every tremor in her breast
            Reverberated in my own.
            In that last hour come and bend down
            To kiss my long-expectant mouth
            Still curved, in death, to meet her mouth.
            2
            I am content to play the martyr,
            To wear the dunce cap here at school;
            For every tear I shed I’ll barter
            To Death; I’ll be no more a fool
            When that pale rider reaches down
            His hand to me. He’ll beat a crown
            From all the aches my shoulders bore,
            And I shall lord one regal hour
            Illumined in all things before
            His sickle spears another flower.
            While still his shears snarl through my thread,
            Dismembering it strand by strand,
            While I hang poised between the dead
            And quick, into omniscience fanned,
            My mind shall glow with one rich spark
            Before it ends in endless dark.
            These straining eyes, clairvoyant then,
            Shall probe beneath the calloused husk
            That hides the better selves of men.
            And as my day throbs into dusk,
            This heart the world has made to bleed,
            While all its red stream deathward flows,
            Shall comprehend just why the seed
            Must agonize to be the rose.

       <collex:text>They in their cruel traps, and we in ours,   
            Survey each other’s rage, and pass the hours   
            Commiserating each the other’s woe,   
            To mitigate his own pain’s fiery glow.   
            Man could but little proffer in exchange   
            Save that his cages have a larger range.   
            That lion with his lordly, untamed heart   
            Has in some man his human counterpart,
            Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped,   
            But in the stifling flesh securely trapped.   
            Gaunt eagle whose raw pinions stain the bars   
            That prison you, so men cry for the stars!
            Some delve down like the mole far underground,   
            (Their nature is to burrow, not to bound),
            Some, like the snake, with changeless slothful eye,   
            Stir not, but sleep and smoulder where they lie.   
            Who is most wretched, these caged ones, or we,   
            Caught in a vastness beyond our sight to see?

       <collex:text>The Wind Bloweth Where It Listeth
            “LIVE like the wind,” he said, “unfettered,
            And love me while you can;
            And when you will, and can be bettered,
            Go to the better man.
            “For you’ll grow weary, maybe, sleeping
            So long a time with me;
            Like this there’ll be no cause for weeping;
            The wind is always free.
            “Go when you please,” he would be saying,
            His mouth hard on her own;
            That’s why she stayed and loved the staying,
            Contented to the bone.
            And now he’s dust, and he but twenty,—
            Frost that was like a flame;
            Her kisses on the head death bent, he
            Gave answer to his name.
            And now he’s dust and with dust lying
            In sullen arrogance;
            Death found it hard, for all his trying,
            To shatter such a lance.
            She laid him out as fine as any
            That had a priest and ring;
            She never spared a silver penny
            For cost of anything.
            Her grief is crowned with his child sucking
            The milk of her distress,
            As if his father’s hands were plucking
            Her buds of bitterness.
            He may grow tall as any other,
            Blest with his father’s face,
            And yield her strength enough to smother
            What some will call disgrace.
            He may be cursed and be concerned
            With thoughts of right and wrong,
            And brand with “Shame” these two that burned
            Without the legal thong.
            Her man would say they were no rabble
            To love like common clay,—
            But Christian tongues are trained to babble
            In such a bitter way.
            Still, she’s this minted gold to pour her,
            This from her man for a mark:
            It was no law that held him for her,
            And moved his feet in the dark.

            COME, let us plant our love as farmers plant
            A seed, and you shall water it with tears,
            And I shall weed it with my hands until
            They bleed. Perchance this buried love of ours
            Will fall on goodly ground and bear a tree
            With fruit and flowers; pale lovers chancing here
            May pluck and eat, and through their veins a sweet
            And languid ardor play, their pulses beat
            An unimagined tune, their shy lips meet
            And part, and bliss repeat again. And men
            Will pilgrimage from far and wide to see
            This tree for which we two were crucified,
            And, happy in themselves, will never know
            ’Twas break of heart that made the Love Tree grow.

       <collex:text>Sonnet to a Scornful Lady
            (To Ruth Marie)
            LIKE some grim gladiator who has fought
            Men loving life as lustily as he,
            And with red wounds and blood has dearly bought
            A forced reprieve from those who came to see
            Him die; a suppliant on gory knees
            Like him, lean with my passion’s hunger, I
            Lay bare the bruises of my heart, with these
            Imploring, “Love me, lady, or I die.”
            But unlike him I hear no populace
            Enamoured of a brave bout, crying, “Grace!”
            Scorn rules your eyes as silence does your mouth;
            No golden sceptre raises me from where
            I kneel unfavored finding you still fair
            Though both your regal thumbs are pointed south.

       <collex:text>Song of the Rejected Lover
            WITH silver bell scarce sounding at the pace,
            Slow riding down from courtly Camelot,
            Roused from the splendor of her escort’s grace,
            Queen Guinevere turns cold to Lancelot.
            For love of me Elaine has kissed Death’s face,
            For love of me is grief in Astolat,
            While for the warm delight of my embrace
            Queen Guinevere turns cold to Lancelot.
            Thou slender cruelty and slim distress,
            Let each to each forgetful and forgot
            Abide; for me, a dream-dark loveliness,
            Queen Guinevere turns cold to Lancelot.

       <collex:text>The Spark
            STAMP hard, be sure
            We leave no spark
            That may allure
            This placid dark.
            At last we learn
            That love is cruel;
            Fire will not burn
            Lacking fuel.
            Here, take your heart,
            The whole of it;
            I want no part,
            No smallest bit.
            And this is mine?
            You took scant care;
            My heart could shine;
            No glaze was there.
            Young lips hold wine
            The fair world over;
            New heads near mine
            Will dent the clover;
            We need not pine
            Now this is over.
            Now love is dead
            We might be friends;
            ’Tis best instead
            To say all ends,
            And when we meet
            Pass quickly by;
            Oh, speed your feet,
            And so will I.
            I know a man
            Thought a spark was dead
            That flamed and ran
            A brighter red,
            And burned the roof
            Above his head.

            If love be staunch, call mountains brittle;
            Love is a thing will live
            So long, my dear,—oh, just the little
            While water stays in a sieve.
            Yea, love is deathless as the day
            Whose death the stars reveal;
            And love is loyal all the way,
            If treachery be leal.
            Beyond the shadow of a doubt,
            No thing is sweet as love,
            But, oh, the bitterness spewed out
            Of the heart at the end thereof!
            Beyond all cavil or complaint,
            Love’s ways are double-dyed;
            Beneath the surplice of a saint
            The cloven hooves are spied.
            Whom yesterday love rhymed his sun
            Today he names a star;
            When the course of another day is run,
            What will he say you are?

            Now let all lovely things embark
            Upon the sea of mist
            With her whose luscious mouth the dark,
            Grim troubadour has kissed.
            The silver clock that ticked away
            Her days, and never knew
            Its beats were sword thrusts to the clay
            That too much beauty slew.
            The pillow favored with her tears
            And hallowed by her head;
            I shall not even keep my fears,
            Now their concern is dead.
            But where shall I bury sun and rain,
            How mortalise the stars,
            How still the half-heard cries of pain
            That seared her soul with scars?
            In what sea depths shall all the seeds
            Of every flower die?
            Where shall I scatter the broken reeds,
            And how erase the sky?
            And where shall I find a hole so deep
            No troubled ghost may rise?
            There will I put my heart to sleep
            Wanting her face and eyes.

       <collex:text>The Litany of the Dark People
            OUR flesh that was a battle-ground
            Shows now the morning-break;
            The ancient deities are downed
            For Thy eternal sake.
            Now that the past is left behind,
            Fling wide Thy garment’s hem
            To keep us one with Thee in mind,
            Thou Christ of Bethlehem.
            The thorny wreath may ridge our brow,
            The spear may mar our side,
            And on white wood from a scented bough
            We may be crucified;
            Yet no assault the old gods make
            Upon our agony
            Shall swerve our footsteps from the wake
            Of Thine toward Calvary.
            And if we hunger now and thirst,
            Grant our withholders may,
            When heaven’s constellations burst
            Upon Thy crowning day,
            Be fed by us, and given to see
            Thy mercy in our eyes,
            When Bethlehem and Calvary
            Are merged in Paradise.

            “Young fool, you’ll soon be ripe!”
            I have a friend who eats his heart
            Away with grief of mine,
            Who drinks my joy as tipplers drain
            Deep goblets filled with wine.
            I wonder why here at his side,
            Face-in-the-grass with him,
            My mind should stray the Grecian urn
            To muse on uncle Jim.

            Think not my wounds are healed;
            Far deeper than the scars you see

            Weep not, you who love her --
            What rebellious flow
            Grief undams shall recover
            Whom the gods bid go?
            Sorrow rising like a wall,
            Bitter, blasphemous --
            What avails it to recall
            Beauty back to us?
            Think not this grave shall keep her,
            This marriage-bed confine;
            Death may dig it deep and deeper --
            She shall climb it like a vine.
            Body that was quick and sentient,
            Dear as thought or speech,
            Death could not, with one trenchant
            Blow, snatch out of reach!
            She is nearer than the word
            Wasted on her now,
            Nearer than the swaying bird
            On its rhythmic bough.
            Only were our faith as much
            As a mustard seed,
            Aching hungry hands might touch
            Her as they touch a reed.
            Life, who was not loth to trade
            Her unto death, has done
            Better than he planned, has made
            Her wise as Solomon.
            Now she knows the Why and Wherefore,
            Troublous Whence and Whither;
            Why men strive and sweat, and care for
            Bays that droop and wither.
            All the stars she knows by name,
            End and origin thereof,
            Knows if love be kin to shame,
            If shame be less than love.
            What was crooked now is straight,
            What was rough is plain;
            Grief and sorrow have no weight
            Now to cause her pain.
            One to her are flame and frost;
            Silence is her singing lark.
            We alone are children -- lost,
            Crying in the dark.
            Varied features now, and form
            Change has bred upon her;
            Crush no bug or nauseous worm
            Lest you tread upon her.
            Pluck no flower lest she scream;
            Bruise no slender reed
            Lest it prove more than it seem,
            Lest she groan and bleed.
            More than ever trust your brother,
            Read him golden, pure --
            It may be she finds no other
            House so safe and sure.
            Set no poet carving
            Rhymes to make her laugh;
            Only live hearts starving
            Need an epitaph.
            Lay upon her no white stone
            From a foreign quarry;
            Earth and sky, be these alone
            Her obituary.
            Swift as a startled fawn or swallow,
            Silence all her sound,
            She has fled; we cannot follow
            Further than this mound.
            We who take the beaten track,
            Trying to appease
            Hearts near breaking with their lack,
            We need elegies.

            To the Black and Unknown Bards who gave to the world the priceless treasure of those “canticles of love and woe,” the camp-meeting
            Spirituals; more particularly, to those untaught singers of the old plantations of the South, whose melodious lullabies to the babes of both
            races entered with genius-quickening power into the souls of Poe and Lanier, Dunbar and Cotter: to them, for whom any monument in stone or bronze were but mockery, I dedicate this monument of verse, budded by the children of their vision.

       <collex:text>PREFACE
            _Ad astra per aspera_--that is the old Roman adage. Magnificent is it, and magnificently is it being in these days exemplified by the American Negroes, particularly by the increasing number of educated and talented American Negroes, and most particularly by those who feel the urge to express in song the emotions and aspirations of their people. A surprisingly large number is this class. Without exhausting the possibilities of selection I have quoted in this anthology of contemporary Negro poetry sixty odd writers of tolerable verse that exhibits, besides form, at least one fundamental quality of poetry, namely, passion.
            The mere number, large as it is, would of course not signify by itself.
            Nor does the phrase “tolerable verse,” cautiously chosen, seem to
            promise much. What this multitude means, and whether the verse be worthy of a more complimentary description, I leave to the reader’s judgment. Quality of expression and character of content are of course the prepotent considerations.
            While, in a preliminary section, I have passed in review the poetry of
            the Negro up to and including Dunbar, not neglecting the old religious songs of the plantation, or “Spirituals,” and the dance, play, and nursery rhymes, or “Seculars,” yet strictly speaking this is a
            representation of new Negro voices, an anthology of present-day Negro verse, with biographical items and critical, or at least appreciative comment.
            I wish most heartily to express my obligations to the publishers and
            authors of the volumes I have drawn upon for selections. They are named in the Index and Biographical and Bibliographical Notes at the end of the text. But for the reader’s convenience I collect their names here:
            Richard E. Badger, publisher of Walter Everette Hawkins’s _Chords and Discords_; A. B. Caldwell, Atlanta, Ga., publisher of Sterling M. Means’ _The Deserted Cabin and Other Poems_; the Cornhill Company, publishers of Waverley Turner Carmichael’s _From the Heart of a Folk_; Joseph S. Cotter’s _The Band of Gideon_; Georgia Douglas Johnson’s _The Heart of a Woman_; Charles Bertram Johnson’s _Songs of My People_; James Weldo Johnson’s _Fifty Years and Other Poems_; Joshua Henry Jones’s _Poems of
            the Four Seas_; Dodd, Mead and Company, publishers of Dunbar’s _Poems_; the Grafton Press, publishers of H. Cordelia Ray’s _Poems_; Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company, publishers of W. E. Burghardt DuBois’s _Darkwater_; Pritchard and Ovington’s _The Upward Path_; the Macmillan Company, publishers of Thomas W. Talley’s _Negro Folk Rhymes_; the Neale Publishing Company, publishers of Kelley Miller’s _Out of the House of Bondage_; J. L. Nichols &amp; Company, Naperville, Ill., publishers of Mrs. Dunbar-Nelson’s _The Dunbar Speaker and Entertainer_, and _The Life and
            Works of Paul Laurence Dunbar_; the Stratford Company, publishers of Joshua Henry Jones’s _The Heart of the World and Other Poems_; and Leslie Pinckney Hill’s _The Wings of Oppression_. It is with their kind permission I am privileged to use selections from the books named. To _The Crisis_, _The Favorite Magazine_, and _The Messenger_, I am indebted for several selections, which I gratefully acknowledge.
            To readers who are disposed to study the poetry of the Negro I would commend Dr. James Weldon Johnson’s _The Book of American Negro Poetry_ (Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.) and Mr. Arthur A. Schomburg’s _A Bibliographical Checklist of American Negro Poetry_ (Charles F. Hartman, New York). I am indebted to both these books and authors. To Mr. Schomburg I am also indebted for the loan of many of the pictures of the earlier poets.

       <collex:text>6. Paul Laurence Dunbar
            He came, a dark youth, singing in the dawn
            Of a new freedom, glowing o’er his lyre,
            Refining, as with great Apollo’s fire,
            His people’s gift of song. And, thereupon,
            This Negro singer, come to Helicon,
            Constrained the masters, listening, to admire,
            And roused a race to wonder and aspire,
            Gazing which way their honest voice was gone,
            With ebon face uplit of glory’s crest.
            Men marveled at the singer, strong and sweet,
            Who brought the cabin’s mirth, the tuneful night,
            But faced the morning, beautiful with light,
            To die while shadows yet fell toward the west,
            And leave his laurels at his people’s feet.
            --_James David Corrothers._
            Less than a generation ago William Dean Howells hailed Paul Laurence Dunbar as “the first instance of an American Negro who had evinced innate distinction in literature,” “the only man of pure African blood and of American civilization to feel Negro life æsthetically and express it lyrically.” It is not my purpose to give Dunbar space and consideration in this book commensurate with his importance. Its scope does not, strictly speaking, include him and his predecessors. They are introduced here, but to provide an historical background. The object of this book is to exhibit the achievement of the Negro in verse since Dunbar. Even though it were true, which I think it is not, that no American Negro previous to Dunbar had evinced innate distinction in literature, this anthology, I believe, will reveal that many American Negroes in this new day are evincing, if not innate distinction, yet cultured talent, in literature.
            The sonnet to Dunbar which stands at the head of this section was
            composed by a Negro who was by three years Dunbar’s senior. His
            opportunities in early life were far inferior to Dunbar’s. At nineteen
            years of age, with almost inconsiderable schooling, he was a boot-black in a Chicago barber shop. I give his sonnet here--other poems of his I give in another chapter--in evidence of that distinction in literature, innate or otherwise, which is rather widespread among American Negroes of the present time. Dunbar himself might have been proud to put his name to this sonnet.
            When this marvel, a Negro poet, so vouched for, appeared in the West, like a new star in the heavens, a few white people, a very few, knew, vaguely, that back in Colonial times there was a slave woman in Boston who had written verses, who was therefore a prodigy. The space between Phillis Wheatley and this new singer was desert. But Nature, as people think, produces freaks, or sports; therefore a Negro poet was not absolutely beyond belief, since poets are rather freakish, abnormal creatures anyway. Incredulity therefore yielded to an attitude scarcely worthier, namely, that dishonoring, irreverent interpretation of a supreme human phenomenon which consists in denominating it a freak of nature. But Dunbar is a fact, as Burns, as Whittier, as Riley, are facts--a fact of great moment to a people and for a people. For one thing, he revealed to the Negro youth of America the latent literary powers and the unexploited literary materials of their race. He was the fecundating genius of their talents. Upon all his people he was a tremendously quickening power, not less so than his great contemporary at Tuskegee. Doubtless it will be recognized, in a broad view, that the
            Negro people of America needed, equally, both men, the counterparts of each other.
            It needs to be remarked for white people, that there were two Dunbars, and that they know but one. There is the Dunbar of “the jingle in a broken tongue,” whom Howells with gracious but imperfect sympathy and understanding brought to the knowledge of the world, and whom the public readers, white and black alike, have found it delightful to present, to the entire eclipse of the other Dunbar. That other Dunbar was the poet of the flaming “Ode to Ethiopia,” the pathetic lyric, “We Wear the Mask,” the apparently offhand jingle but real masterpiece entitled “Life,” the incomparable ode “Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,” and a score of other pieces in which, using their speech, he matches himself with the poets who shine as stars in the firmament of our admiration. This Dunbar Howells failed to appreciate, and ignorance of him has been fostered, as I have intimated, by professional readers and writers. The first Dunbar, the generally accepted one, was, as Howells pointed out, the artistic interpreter of the old-fashioned, vanishing generation of black folk--the generation that was maimed and scarred by slavery, that presented so many ludicrous and pathetic,
            abject and lovable aspects in strange mixture. The second Dunbar was the prophet robed in a mantle of austerity, shod with fire, bowed with sorrow, as every true prophet has been, in whatever time, among whatever people. He was the prophet, I say, of a new generation, a coming generation, as he was the poet of a vanishing generation. The generation of which he was the prophet-herald has arrived. Its most authentic representatives are the poets that I put forward in this volume as worthy of attention.
            Dunbar’s real significance to his race has been admirably expressed not only by Corrothers but in the following lines by his biographer, Lida Keck Wiggins:
            Life’s lowly were laureled with verses
            And sceptered were honor and worth,
            While cabins became, through the poet,
            Fair homes of the lords of the earth.
            So it was. But “honor and worth” yet remain, to be “sceptered.” Such
            poems as these few here given from the choragus of the present
            generation of Negro singers will suggest the kind of honor and the
            degree of worth to which our tribute is due.[2]
            ERE SLEEP COMES DOWN TO SOOTHE THE WEARY EYES
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            Which all the day with ceaseless care have sought
            The magic gold which from the seeker flies;
            Ere dreams put on the gown and cap of thought,
            And make the waking world a world of lies,--
            Of lies most palpable, uncouth, forlorn,
            That say life’s full of aches and tears and sighs,--
            Oh, how with more than dreams the soul is torn,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            How all the griefs and heartaches we have known
            Come up like pois’nous vapors that arise
            From some base witch’s caldron, when the crone,
            To work some potent spell, her magic plies.
            The past which held its share of bitter pain,
            Whose ghost we prayed that Time might exorcise,
            Comes up, is lived and suffered o’er again,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            What phantoms fill the dimly lighted room;
            What ghostly shades in awe-creating guise
            Are bodied forth within the teeming gloom.
            What echoes faint of sad and soul-sick cries,
            And pangs of vague inexplicable pain
            That pay the spirit’s ceaseless enterprise,
            Come thronging through the chambers of the brain,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            Where ranges forth the spirit far and free?
            Through what strange realms and unfamiliar skies
            Tends her far course to lands of mystery?
            To lands unspeakable--beyond surmise,
            Where shapes unknowable to being spring,
            Till, faint of wing, the Fancy fails and dies
            Much wearied with the spirit’s journeying,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            How questioneth the soul that other soul,--
            The inner sense which neither cheats nor lies,
            But self exposes unto self, a scroll
            Full writ with all life’s acts unwise or wise,
            In characters indelible and known;
            So, trembling with the shock of sad surprise,
            The soul doth view its awful self alone,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes,
            The last dear sleep whose soft embrace is balm,
            And whom sad sorrow teaches us to prize
            For kissing all our passions into calm,
            Ah, then, no more we heed the sad world’s cries,
            Or seek to probe th’ eternal mystery,
            Or fret our souls at long-withheld replies,
            At glooms through which our visions cannot see,
            Ere sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes.
            LIFE
            A crust of bread and a corner to sleep in,
            A minute to smile and an hour to weep in,
            A pint of joy to a peck of trouble,
            And never a laugh but the moans come double;
            And that is life!
            A crust and a corner that love makes precious,
            With the smile to warm and the tears to refresh us;
            And joy seems sweeter when cares come after,
            And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter:
            And that is life!
            _ODE TO ETHIOPIA_
            O Mother Race! to thee I bring
            This pledge of faith unwavering,
            This tribute to thy glory.
            I know the pangs which thou didst feel,
            When Slavery crushed thee with its heel,
            With thy dear blood all gory.
            Sad days were those--ah, sad indeed!
            But through the land the fruitful seed
            Of better times was growing.
            The plant of freedom upward sprung,
            And spread its leaves so fresh and young--
            Its blossoms now are blowing.
            On every hand in this fair land,
            Proud Ethiope’s swarthy children stand
            Beside their fairer neighbor;
            The forests flee before their stroke,
            Their hammers ring, their forges smoke,--
            They stir in honest labor.
            They tread the fields where honor calls;
            Their voices sound through senate halls
            In majesty and power.
            To right they cling; the hymns they sing
            Up to the skies in beauty ring,
            And bolder grow each hour.
            Be proud, my Race, in mind and soul
            Thy name is writ on Glory’s scroll
            In characters of fire.
            High ’mid the clouds of Fame’s bright sky
            Thy banner’s blazoned folds now fly,
            And truth shall lift them higher.
            Thou hast the right to noble pride,
            Whose spotless robes were purified
            By blood’s severe baptism,
            Upon thy brow the cross was laid,
            And labor’s painful sweat-beads made
            A consecrating chrism.
            No other race, or white or black,
            When bound as thou wert, to the rack,
            So seldom stooped to grieving;
            No other race, when free again,
            Forgot the past and proved them men
            So noble in forgiving.
            Go on and up! Our souls and eyes
            Shall follow thy continuous rise;
            Our ears shall list thy story
            From bards who from thy root shall spring,
            And proudly tune their lyres to sing
            Of Ethiopia’s glory.
            WITH THE LARK
            Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy,
            Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy;
            Darkness for sighing and daylight for song,--
            Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and strong,
            All the night through, though I moan in the dark,
            I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
            Deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves,
            Softly and sadly the wood-spirit grieves.
            But when the first hue of dawn tints the sky,
            I shall shake out my wings like the birds and be dry;
            And though, like the rain-drops, I grieved through the dark,
            I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
            On the high hills of heaven, some morning to be,
            Where the rain shall not grieve thro’ the leaves of the tree,
            There my heart will be glad for the pain I have known,
            For my hand will be clasped in the hand of mine own;
            And though life has been hard and death’s pathway been dark,
            I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
            WE WEAR THE MASK
            We wear the mask that grins and lies,
            It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--
            This debt we pay to human guile;
            With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,
            And mouth with myriad subtleties.
            Why should the world be over-wise,
            In counting all our tears and sighs?
            Nay, let them only see us, while
            We wear the mask.
            We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
            To thee from tortured souls arise.
            We sing, but oh, the clay is vile
            Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
            But let the world dream otherwise,
            We wear the mask!

       <collex:text>4. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper_
            A female poet of the same period as Horton wrote in the same strain
            about freedom:
            Make me a grave wher’er you will,
            In a lowly plain or a lofty hill;
            Make it among earth’s humblest graves,
            But not in a land where men are slaves.
            Like Horton, she lived to see her prayer for freedom answered. Of the Emancipation Proclamation she burst forth in joy:
            It shall flash through coming ages,
            It shall light the distant years;
            And eyes now dim with sorrow
            Shall be brighter through their tears.
            This slave woman was Frances Ellen Watkins, by marriage Harper. Mrs. Harper attained to a greater popularity than any poet of her race prior to Dunbar. As many as ten thousand copies of some of her poems were in circulation in the middle of the last century. Her success was not unmerited. Many singers of no greater merit have enjoyed greater celebrity. She was thoroughly in the fashion of her times, as Phillis Wheatley was in the yet prevalent fashion of Pope, or, perhaps more accurately, Cowper. The models in the middle of the nineteenth century were Mrs. Hemans, Whittier, and Longfellow. It is in their manner she writes. A serene and beautiful Christian spirit tells a moral tale in fluent ballad stanzas, not without poetic phrasing. In all she beholds, in all she experiences, there is a lesson. There is no grief without its consolation. Serene resignation breathes through all her poems--at least through those written after her freedom was achieved. Illustrations of these traits abound. A few stanzas from _Go Work in My Vineyard_ will suffice. After bitter disappointments in attempting to fulfil the command the “lesson” comes thus sweetly expressed:
            My hands were weak, but I reached them out
            To feebler ones than mine,
            And over the shadows of my life
            Stole the light of a peace divine.
            Oh, then my task was a sacred thing,
            How precious it grew in my eyes!
            ’Twas mine to gather the bruised grain
            For the Lord of Paradise.
            And when the reapers shall lay their grain
            On the floors of golden light,
            I feel that mine with its broken sheaves
            Shall be precious in His sight.
            Though thorns may often pierce my feet,
            And the shadows still abide,
            The mists will vanish before His smile,
            There will be light at eventide.
            How successfully Mrs. Harper could draw a lesson from the common objects or occurrences of the world about us may be illustrated by the following poem:
            TRUTH
            A rock, for ages, stern and high,
            Stood frowning ’gainst the earth and sky,
            And never bowed his haughty crest
            When angry storms around him prest.
            Morn, springing from the arms of night,
            Had often bathed his brow with light,
            And kissed the shadows from his face
            With tender love and gentle grace.
            Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
            Smiled on him from the distant West,
            And from her throne the dark-browed Night
            Threw round his path her softest light.
            And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
            Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
            He bared his brow to every blast
            And scorned the tempest as it passed.
            One day a tiny, humble seed--
            The keenest eye would hardly heed--
            Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,
            And found a lowly hiding-place.
            A ray of light, and drop of dew,
            Came with a message, kind and true;
            They told her of the world so bright,
            Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
            And lured her from her hiding-place,
            To gaze upon earth’s glorious face.
            So, peeping timid from the ground,
            She clasped the ancient rock around,
            And climbing up with childish grace,
            She held him with a close embrace;
            Her clinging was a thing of dread;
            Where’er she touched a fissure spread,
            And he who’d breasted many a storm
            Stood frowning there, a mangled form.
            A Truth, dropped in the silent earth,
            May seem a thing of little worth,
            Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
            It saps its pillars proud and strong,
            And o’er the fallen ruin weaves
            The brightest blooms and fairest leaves.
            The story of Vashti, who dared heroically to disobey her monarch-husband, is as well told in simple ballad measure as one may find it. I give it entire:
            VASHTI
            She leaned her head upon her hand
            And heard the King’s decree--
            “My lords are feasting in my halls;
            Bid Vashti come to me.
            “I’ve shown the treasures of my house,
            My costly jewels rare,
            But with the glory of her eyes
            No rubies can compare.
            “Adorn’d and crown’d I’d have her come,
            With all her queenly grace,
            And, ’mid my lords and mighty men,
            Unveil her lovely face.
            “Each gem that sparkles in my crown,
            Or glitters on my throne,
            Grows poor and pale when she appears,
            My beautiful, my own!”
            All waiting stood the chamberlains
            To hear the Queen’s reply.
            They saw her cheek grow deathly pale,
            But light flash’d to her eye:
            “Go, tell the King,” she proudly said,
            “That I am Persia’s Queen,
            And by his crowds of merry men
            I never will be seen.
            “I’ll take the crown from off my head
            And tread it ’neath my feet,
            Before their rude and careless gaze
            My shrinking eyes shall meet.
            “A queen unveil’d before the crowd!--
            Upon each lip my name!--
            Why, Persia’s women all would blush
            And weep for Vashti’s shame!
            “Go back!” she cried, and waved her hand,
            And grief was in her eye:
            “Go, tell the King,” she sadly said,
            “That I would rather die.”
            They brought her message to the King;
            Dark flash’d his angry eye;
            ’Twas as the lightning ere the storm
            Hath swept in fury by.
            Then bitterly outspoke the King,
            Through purple lips of wrath--
            “What shall be done to her who dares
            To cross your monarch’s path?”
            Then spake his wily counsellors--
            “O King of this fair land!
            From distant Ind to Ethiop,
            All bow to thy command.
            “But if, before thy servants’ eyes,
            This thing they plainly see,
            That Vashti doth not heed thy will
            Nor yield herself to thee,
            “The women, restive ’neath our rule,
            Would learn to scorn our name,
            And from her deed to us would come
            Reproach and burning shame.
            “Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand
            This stern but just decree,
            That Vashti lay aside her crown,
            Thy Queen no more to be.”
            She heard again the King’s command,
            And left her high estate;
            Strong in her earnest womanhood,
            She calmly met her fate,
            And left the palace of the King,
            Proud of her spotless name--
            A woman who could bend to grief
            But would not bow to shame.
            Those last stanzas are quite as noble as any that one may find in the
            poets whom I named as setting the American fashion in the era of Mrs. Harper. The poems of this gentle, sweet-spirited Negro woman deserve a better fate than has overtaken them.

       <collex:text>I. THE COTTERS, FATHER AND SON
_The Father_
[Illustration: JOSEPH S. COTTER, SR.]
On the Kentucky plantation where Stephen Collins Foster one June
morning, when the mocking birds were singing and “the darkies were gay,”
composed and his sister sang, “My Old Kentucky Home,” there was among
those first delighted listeners who paused in their tasks to hear the
immortal song at its birth a slave girl in whose soul were strange
melodies of her own. Born of free people of color, she was bonded to the
owner of this plantation, yet her soul was such as must be free.
Faithful in her work, respectful and obedient, she was yet a dangerous
character among slaves, being too spirited. Hence her master ordered her
to leave, fearing she would demoralize discipline in the quarters. She
demanded to be taken away as she had been brought--in a wagon; and it
was so done. It seems that one-half of her blood was African and the
other half was divided between Indian and English, though it is
impossible to be sure of the exact proportion. An account of her in
those days by one who knew her reveals her as one of nature’s poets--a
Phillis Wheatley of the wash-tubs. “She was very fervent in her
religious devotions”--so runs this account--“and a very hard worker. She
would sometimes wash nearly all night and then have periods of prayer
and exaltation. Then again during the day she would draw from her bosom
a favorite book and pause to read over the wash-tub. She had a strong
dramatic instinct and would frequently make up little plays of her own
and represent each character vividly.” Of such mothers are seers and
poets born. And so in this instance it proved to be.
At the age of twenty, while yet a slave, she was married, under the
common law--though marriage it was not called--to a Scotch-Irishman, a
prominent citizen of Louisville, her employer at the time, who was
distinguished by a notably handsome physique and a great fondness for
books. Of this union was born, at Bardstown, a son, Joseph, so named for
the dreamer of biblical story.
The vision-seeing slave mother, her mind running on the bondage of her
people, named her son Joseph in the hope of his becoming great in the
service of his people, like the Hebrew Joseph. She lived to see her hope
fulfilled. The boy’s earliest education was in song and story invented
and sung or told by his mother. He got a few terms of school, reaching
the third grade. At ten years of age he went to work in a brickyard of
Louisville to help support his mother. Even there the faculty that
afterwards distinguished him appears in action, to his relief in time of
trouble. Bigger boys, white and black, working in the same yard, hazed
and harried him. Fighting to victory was out of the question, against
such odds. Brains won where brawn was wanting. He observed that the men
at their noon rest-hour, the time of his distress, told stories and
laughed. He couldn’t join them, but he tried story-telling in the boy
group. It worked. The men, hearing the laughter, came over and joined
them. The persecuted boy became the entertainer of both groups. He had
won mastery by wit, the proudest mastery in the world.
Then, until he was twenty-two years of age, he was a teamster on the
levee. At this time the desire for an education mastered him and he
entered a night school--the primary grade. Hard toil and the struggle to
get on had not killed his soul but had wiped out his acquisitions of
book-knowledge. In two terms he was qualified to teach. He is now the
principal of the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor High School in Louisville, the
author of several books, a maker of songs and teller of stories, and a
man upright in conduct and wise in counsel.
It was at Bardstown, February 2, 1861, that Joseph Seamon Cotter was
born. Let Bardstown be put on the literary map of America, not because
Stephen Collins Foster wrote “My Old Kentucky Home” there, but because
one was born there the latchet of whose poetic shoes he was not worthy
to unloose. “A poet, a bard, to be born in Bardstown--how odd, and how
appropriate!” one exclaims. And _bard_ seems exactly the right
appellation for this song-maker and story-man. But it is not altogether
so. In character bardlike, but not in appearance. Bards have long,
unkempt, white hair, which mingles with beards that rest on their
bosoms. Cotter’s square-cut chin is clean-shaven, and his large
brain-dome shows like a harvest moon. But he makes poems and invents and
discovers stories, and, bard-like, recites or relates them to whatever
audience may call for them--in schools, in churches, at firesides. Minus
the hairy habiliments he is a bard.
Some of Cotter’s stories come out of Africa and are “different,” as the
word goes. Some are “current among the colored folks of Louisville.”
These, too, are different. Some are tragedies and some are comedies and
some are tragi-comedies of everyday life among the Negroes. I will give
one entire tale here, selecting this particular one because of its
brevity, not its pre-eminence:
THE BOY AND THE IDEAL
Once upon a time a Mule, a Hog, a Snake, and a Boy met. Said the Mule:
“I eat and labor that I may grow strong in the heels. It is fine to have
heels so gifted. My heels make people cultivate distance.”
Said the Hog: “I eat and labor that I may grow strong in the snout. It
is fine to have a fine snout. I keep people watching for my snout.”
“No exchanging heels for snouts,” broke in the Mule.
“No,” answered the Hog; “snouts are naturally above heels.”
Said the Snake: “I eat to live, and live to cultivate my sting. The way
people shun me shows my greatness. Beget stings, comrades, and stings
will beget glory.”
Said the Boy: “There is a star in my life like unto a star in the sky. I
eat and labor that I may think aright and feel aright. These rounds will
conduct me to my star. Oh, inviting star!”
“I am not so certain of that,” said the Mule. “I have noticed your kind
and ever see some of myself in them. Your star is in the distance.”
The Boy answered by smelling a flower and listening to the song of a
bird. The Mule looked at him and said: “He is all tenderness and care.
The true and the beautiful have robbed me of a kinsman. His star is
near.”
Said the Boy: “I approach my star.”
“I am not so certain of that,” interrupted the Hog. “I have noticed your
kind and I ever see some of myself in them. Your star is a delusion.”
The Boy answered by painting the flower and setting the notes of the
bird’s song to music.
The Hog looked at the boy and said: “His soul is attuned by nature. The
meddler in him is slain.”
“I can all but touch my star,” cried the Boy.
“I am not so certain of that,” remarked the Snake. “I have watched your
kind and ever see some of myself in them. Stings are nearer than stars.”
The Boy answered by meditating upon the picture and music. The Snake
departed, saying that stings and stars cannot keep company.
The Boy journeyed on, ever led by the star. Some distance away the Mule
was bemoaning the presence of his heels and trying to rid himself of
them by kicking a tree. The Hog was dividing his time between looking
into a brook and rubbing his snout on a rock to shorten it. The Snake
lay dead of its own bite. The Boy journeyed on, led by an ever inviting
star.
(Negro Tales.--Joseph S. Cotter, The Cosmopolitan Press, New York,
1912.)
     *       *       *       *       *
Yes--Uncle Remus, in reality--and not exactly so. No copy. Not every
like is the same. An Uncle Remus with culture and conscious art, yet
unspoilt, the native qualities strong. And how poetic those qualities
are!
Well might one expect a teacher, if he writes verse, to write didactic
verse. But I think you will pronounce him to be an extraordinary teacher
and verse-writer who writes as Mr. Cotter does, for example, in:
THE THRESHING FLOOR
    Thrice blessed he who wields the flail
      Upon this century’s threshing floor;
    A few slight strokes by him avail
      More than a hundred would of yore.
    Around him lies the ripened grain
      From every land and every age;
    The weakest thresher should attain
      Unto the wisdom of the sage.
    Ambitious youth, this is the wealth
      The ages have bequeathed to thee.
    Thou canst not take thy share by stealth
      Nor by mere ingenuity.
    Thy better self must spur thee on
      To win what time has made thy own;
    No hand but labor’s yet has drawn
      The sweets that labor’s hand has sown.
In verse presuming to be lyrical we hearken for the lyrical cry. That
cry is in his lines, melodiously uttered, and poignant. For example:
    The flowers take the tears
      Of the weeping night
    And give them to the sun
      For the day’s delight.
    My passion takes the joys
      Of the laughing day
    And melts them into tears
      For my heart’s decay.
The sweet sadness of those stanzas lingers with one. A stanza from a
poem entitled “The Nation’s Neglected Child” may help us to their
secret:
    I am not thy pampered steed,
      I am not thy welcome dog;
    I am of a lower breed
      Even than thy Berkshire hog;
    I am thy neglected child--
      Make me grow, but keep me wild.
In many of Cotter’s verses there is a sonorous flow which is evidence of
poetic power made creative by passion. Didacticism and philosophy do not
destroy the lyrical quality. In _The Book’s Creed_ this teacher-poet
makes an appeal to his generation to be as much alive and as creative as
the creed makers of other days were. The slaves of the letter, the
mummers of mere formulas, he thus addresses:
    You are dead to all the Then,
      You are dead to all the Now,
    If you hold that former men
      Wore the garland for your brow.
    Time and tide were theirs to brave,
      Time and tide are yours to stem.
    Bow not o’er their open grave
      Till you drop your diadem.
    Honor all who strove and wrought,
      Even to their tears and groans;
    But slay not your honest thought
      Through your reverence for their bones.
Cotter is a wizard at rhyming. His “Sequel to the Pied Piper of Hamelin”
surpasses the original--Browning’s--in technique--that is, in rushing
rhythms and ingenious rhymes. It is an incredible success, with no hint
of a tour-de-force performance. Its content, too, is worthy of the
metrical achievement. I will lay the proof before the competent reader
in an extract or two from this remarkable accomplishment:
    The last sweet notes the piper blew
      Were heard by the people far and wide;
    And one by one and two by two
      They flocked to the mountain-side.
    Some came, of course, intensely sad,
    And some came looking fiercely mad,
    And some came singing solemn hymns,
    And some came showing shapely limbs,
    And some came bearing the tops of yews,
    And some came wearing wooden shoes,
    And some came saying what they would do,
    And some came praying (and loudly too),
    And all for what? Can you not infer?
    A-searching and lurching for the Pied Piper,
    And the boys and girls he had taken away.
    And all were ready now to pay
    Any amount that he should say.
So begins the _Sequel_. Another passage, near the end, will indicate the
trend of the story:
    The years passed by, as years will do,
      When trouble is the master,
    And always strives to bring to view
      A new and worse disaster;
    And sorrow, like a sorcerer,
      Spread out her melancholy pall,
      So that its folds enveloped all,
    And each became her worshipper.
    And not a single child was born
      Through all the years thereafter;
    If words sprang from the lips of scorn
      None came from those of laughter.
Finally, the inhabitants of Hamelin are passing through death’s portal,
and when all had departed:
   --a message went to Rat-land
         *       *       *       *       *
    And lo! a race of rats was at hand
         *       *       *       *       *
    They swarmed into the highest towers,
    And loitered in the fairest bowers,
    And sat down where the mayor sat,
    And also in his Sunday hat;
    And gnawed revengefully thereat.
    With rats for mayor and rats for people,
    With rats in the cellar and rats in the steeple,
    With rats without and rats within,
    Stood poor, deserted Hamelin.
Like Dunbar, Cotter is a satirist of his people--or certain types of his
people--a gentle, humorous, affectionate satirist. His medium for satire
is dialect, inevitably. Sententious wisdom, irradiated with humor,
appears in these pieces in homely garb. In standard English, without
satire or humor that wisdom thus appears:
    What deeds have sprung from plow and pick!
      What bank-rolls from tomatoes!
    No dainty crop of rhetoric
      Can match one of potatoes.
The gospel of work has been set forth by our poet in a four-act poetic
drama entitled _Caleb, the Degenerate_. All the characters are Negroes.
The form is blank verse--blank verse of a very high order, too. The
language, like Shakespeare’s--though Browning rather than Shakespeare is
suggested--is always that of a poet. The wisdom is that of a man who has
observed closely and pondered deeply. Idealistic, philosophical,
poetical--such it is. It bears witness to no ordinary dramatic ability.
“Best bard, because the wisest,” says our Israfel. Verily. “Sage” you
may call this man as well as “bard.” The proof is in poems and tales,
apologues and apothegms. Joseph Seamon Cotter is now sixty years of age.
Yet the best of him, according to good omens, is yet to be given forth,
in song, story, precept, and drama. His nature is opulent--the
cultivation began late and the harvest grows richer.
The chief event of his life, I doubt not, remains to be mentioned--a
very sad one. This was the untimely death of his poet-son, Joseph S.
Cotter, Jr. Born of this sorrow was the following lyric:
    Oh, my way and thy way,
      And life’s joy and wonder,
    And thy day and my day
      Are cloven asunder.
    Oh, my trust and thy trust,
      And fair April weather,
    And thy dust and my dust
      Shall mingle together.
_The Son_
Dead at the age of twenty-three years, Joseph S. Cotter, Jr., left
behind a thin volume of lyrics, entitled _The Band of Gideon_, and about
twenty sonnets of an unfinished sequence, and a little book of one-act
plays. I will presently place the remarkable title-poem of his book of
lyrics before the reader, but first I will give two minor pieces,
without comment:
[Illustration: JOSEPH S. COTTER, JR.]
RAIN MUSIC
    On the dusty earth-drum
      Beats the falling rain;
    Now a whispered murmur,
      Now a louder strain.
    Slender silvery drumsticks,
      On the ancient drum,
    Beat the mellow music,
      Bidding life to come.
    Chords of earth awakened,
      Notes of greening spring,
    Rise and fall triumphant
      Over everything.
    Slender silvery drumsticks
      Beat the long tattoo--
    God the Great Musician
      Calling life anew.
COMPENSATION
    I plucked a rose from out a bower fair,
      That overhung my garden seat;
    And wondered I if, e’er before, bloomed there
      A rose so sweet.
    Enwrapt in beauty I scarce felt the thorn
      That pricked me as I pulled the bud;
    Till I beheld the rose, that summer morn,
      Stained with my blood.
    I sang a song that thrilled the evening air,
      With beauty somewhat kin to love,
    And all men knew that lyric song so rare
      Came from above.
    And men rejoiced to hear the golden strain;
      But no man knew the price I paid,
    Nor cared that out of my soul’s deathless pain
      The song was made.
The lyrical faculty is evinced by such poems. But other singers of our
day might have produced them--singers of the white race. Not so, I
think, of “The Band of Gideon.” Upon that poem is the stamp, not of
genius only, but of Negro genius. In it is re-incarnated, by a cultured,
creative mind, the very spirit of the old plantation songs and sermons.
The reader who has in his possession that background will respond to the
unique and powerful appeal of this poem.
THE BAND OF GIDEON
    The band of Gideon roam the sky,
    The howling wind is their war-cry,
    The thunder’s roll is their trumpet’s peal
    And the lightning’s flash their vengeful steel.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
    “The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
    And men below rear temples high
    And mock their God with reasons why,
    And live in arrogance, sin, and shame,
    And rape their souls for the world’s good name.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
    “The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
    The band of Gideon roam the sky
    And view the earth with baleful eye;
    In holy wrath they scourge the land
    With earthquake, storm, and burning brand.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
    “The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
    The lightnings flash and the thunders roll,
    And “Lord have mercy on my soul,”
    Cry men as they fall on the stricken sod,
    In agony searching for their God.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
    “The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
    And men repent and then forget
    That heavenly wrath they ever met.
    The band of Gideon yet will come
    And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
    “The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
The reader, I predict, will be drawn again and again to this mysterious
poem. It will continue to haunt his imagination, and tease his thought.
The stamp of the African mind is upon it. Closely allied, on the one
hand by its august refrain to the Spirituals, on the other hand it
touches the most refined and perfected art; such, for example, as
Rossetti’s ballads or Vachel Lindsay’s cantatas. It can scarcely be
wondered at that the people of his race should call this untimely dead
singer their Negro Lycidas.

            THE DREAM AND THE SONG
            So oft our hearts, beloved lute,
            In blossomy haunts of song are mute;
            So long we pore, ’mid murmurings dull,
            O’er loveliness unutterable;
            So vain is all our passion strong!
            The dream is lovelier than the song.
            The rose thought, touched by words, doth turn
            Wan ashes. Still, from memory’s urn,
            The lingering blossoms tenderly
            Refute our wilding minstrelsy.
            Alas! we work but beauty’s wrong!
            The dream is lovelier than the song.
            Yearned Shelley o’er the golden flame?
            Left Keats, for beauty’s lure, a name
            But “writ in water”? Woe is me!
            To grieve o’er floral faëry.
            My Phasian doves are flown so long--
            The dream is lovelier than the song!
            Ah, though we build a bower of dawn,
            The golden-winged bird is gone,
            And morn may gild, through shimmering leaves,
            Only the swallow-twittering eaves.
            What art may house or gold prolong
            A dream far lovelier than a song?
            The lilting witchery, the unrest
            Of wingèd dreams, is in our breast;
            But ever dear Fulfilment’s eyes
            Gaze otherward. The long-sought prize,
            My lute, must to the gods belong.
            The dream is lovelier than the song.
            Cherokee-Indian, Scotch-Irish, French, and African blood in James David
            Corrothers, the author of this poem, makes his complexion, he supposed,
            “about that of the original man.” The reader has already had, at the
            beginning of the discussion of Dunbar, a sonnet from this poet. The
            sonnet, the above poem, and the others given here were published in _The
            Century Magazine_. Not unworthy of _The Century’s_ standards, the reader
            must say.
            [Illustration: J. D. CORROTHERS]
            James David Corrothers was born in Michigan, July 2, 1869. His mother in
            giving him life surrendered her own. His father never cared for him.
            Sheltered for a few years by maternal relatives, he was out on the world
            in early boyhood, dependent on his own resources. Soon, because he was a
            Negro, he was a wanderer for work through several states. Often without
            money, friends, or food, he slept out of doors, sometimes in zero
            weather. At nineteen years of age, as before stated, he was shining
            shoes in a Chicago barber shop. There he was “discovered.”
            Henry D. Lloyd was having his boots shined by young Corrothers when the
            two fell into book talk. The distinguished writer was astonished at the
            knowledge possessed by one engaged in such a menial occupation. Out of
            this circumstance, it seems, the Negro boot-black became a student in
            Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois. By mowing lawns and doing
            whatever odd jobs he could find he worked his way for three years in the
            university. Then, by the kindness of Frances E. Willard, he had a year
            in Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina. Prior to his entrance at
            Northwestern there had been but one brief opportunity in his life for
            attending school. But the wandering youth, battling against the adverse
            fates, or, concretely stated, the disadvantage of being a Negro, had
            managed somehow to make great books his companions. Hence, he had
            entered what Carlyle calls “the true modern university.” Hence, his
            literary conversation with Mr. Lloyd.
            Out of those early struggles, and perhaps also out of later bitter
            experiences, came such poems as the following:
            AT THE CLOSED GATE OF JUSTICE
            To be a Negro in a day like this
            Demands forgiveness. Bruised with blow on blow,
            Betrayed, like him whose woe-dimmed eyes gave bliss,
            Still must one succor those who brought one low,
            To be a Negro in a day like this.
            To be a Negro in a day like this
            Demands rare patience--patience that can wait
            In utter darkness. ’Tis the path to miss,
            And knock, unheeded, at an iron gate,
            To be a Negro in a day like this.
            To be a Negro in a day like this
            Demands strange loyalty. We serve a flag
            Which is to us white freedom’s emphasis.
            Ah! one must love when truth and justice lag,
            To be a Negro in a day like this.
            To be a Negro in a day like this--
            Alas! Lord God, what evil have we done?
            Still shines the gate, all gold and amethyst
            But I pass by, the glorious goal unwon,
            “Merely a Negro”--in a day like _this_!
            Even though his face be “red like Adam’s,” and even though his art be
            noble like that of the masters of song, yet had Mr. Corrothers, even in
            the republic of letters, felt the handicap of his complexion, as this
            sonnet bears witness:
            THE NEGRO SINGER
            O’er all my song the image of a face
            Lieth, like shadow on the wild, sweet flowers.
            The dream, the ecstasy that prompts my powers,
            The golden lyre’s delights, bring little grace
            To bless the singer of a lowly race.
            Long hath this mocked me: aye, in marvelous hours,
            When Hera’s gardens gleamed, or Cynthia’s bowers,
            Or Hope’s red pylons, in their far, hushed place!
            But I shall dig me deeper to the gold;
            Fetch water, dripping, over desert miles
            From clear Nyanzas and mysterious Niles
            Of love; and sing, nor one kind act withhold.
            So shall men know me, and remember long,
            Nor my dark face dishonor any song.
            Death has silenced the muse of this dark singer,
            one of the best hitherto. That his endowment was
            uncommon and that his achievement, as evinced by
            these poems, is one of distinction, to use Mr.
            Howells’s word, every reader equipped to judge
            of poetry must admit.

       <collex:text>III. A GROUP OF SINGING JOHNSONS
In all rosters the name Johnson claims liberal space. Five verse-smiths
with that cognomen will be presented in this book, and there is a sixth.
These many Johnsons are no further related to one another, so far as I
know, than that they are all Adam’s offspring, and poets. Only three of
them will be presented in this chapter: James Weldon Johnson, of
Florida, author of _Fifty Years and Other Poems_ (1917); Charles Bertram
Johnson, of Missouri, author of _Songs of My People_ (1918); Fenton
Johnson, of Chicago, author of _A Little Dreaming_ (1914); _Unions of
the Dusk_ (1915), and _Songs of the Soil_ (1916). The fourth and fifth
are women, and will find a place in another group; the sixth is Adolphus
Johnson, author of _The Silver Chord_, Philadelphia, 1915. The three
mentioned above will be treated in the order in which they have been
named.
_1. James Weldon Johnson_
Now of New York, but born in Florida and reared in the South, James
Weldon Johnson is a man of various abilities, accomplishments, and
activities. He was graduated with the degrees of A. B. and A. M. from
Atlanta University and later studied for three years in Columbia
University. First a school-principal, then a practitioner of the law, he
followed at last the strongest propensity and turned author. His
literary work includes light operas, for which his brother, J. Rosamond
Johnson, composed the music, and a novel entitled _The Autobiography of
an Ex-Colored Man_. Having been United States consul in two
Latin-American countries, he is a master of Spanish and has made
translations of Spanish plays and poems. The English libretto of
_Goyescas_ was made by him for the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1915.
He is also one of the ablest editorial writers in the country. In the
_Public Ledger’s_ contest of 1916 he won the third prize. His editorials
are widely syndicated in the Negro weekly press. Poems of his have
appeared in _The Century_, _The Crisis_, and _The Independent_.
[Illustration: JAMES WELDON JOHNSON]
Professor Brander Matthews in his Introduction to _Fifty Years and Other
Poems_ speaks of “the superb and soaring stanzas” of the title-poem and
describes it as “a poem sonorous in its diction, vigorous in its
workmanship, elevated in its imagination, and sincere in its emotion.”
Doubtless this will seem like the language of exaggeration. The sceptic,
however, must withhold judgment until he has read the poem, too long for
presentation here. Mr. Johnson’s poetical qualities can be represented
in this place only by briefer though inferior productions. A poem of
special significance, and characterized by the qualities noted by
Professor Matthews in “Fifty Years,” is the following:
O SOUTHLAND!
    O Southland! O Southland!
      Have you not heard the call,
    The trumpet blown, the word made known
      To the nations, one and all?
    The watchword, the hope-word,
      Salvation’s present plan?
    A gospel new, for all--for you:
      Man shall be saved by man.
    O Southland! O Southland!
      Do you not hear to-day
    The mighty beat of onward feet,
      And know you not their way?
    ’Tis forward, ’tis upward,
      On to the fair white arch
    Of Freedom’s dome, and there is room
      For each man who would march.
    O Southland, fair Southland!
      Then why do you still cling
    To an idle age and a musty page,
      To a dead and useless thing?
    ’Tis springtime! ’Tis work-time!
      The world is young again!
    And God’s above, and God is love,
      And men are only men.
    O Southland! my Southland!
      O birthland! do not shirk
    The toilsome task, nor respite ask,
      But gird you for the work.
    Remember, remember
      That weakness stalks in pride;
    That he is strong who helps along
      The faint one at his side.
For pure lyric beauty and exquisite pathos, Wordsworthian in both
respects, but no hint of imitation, the following stanzas may be set,
without disadvantage to them, by the side of any in our literature:
    The glory of the day was in her face,
    The beauty of the night was in her eyes,
    And over all her loveliness, the grace
    Of Morning blushing in the early skies.
    And in her voice, the calling of the dove;
    Like music of a sweet, melodious part.
    And in her smile, the breaking light of love;
    And all the gentle virtues in her heart.
    And now the glorious day, the beauteous night,
    The birds that signal to their mates at dawn,
    To my dull ears, to my tear-blinded sight
    Are one with all the dead, since she is gone.
Yet one other poem of this fine singer’s I will give, selecting from not
a few that press for the restricted space. The easy flow of the verse
and the ready rhyme will be remarked--and that supreme quality of good
lyric poetry, austere simplicity.
THE YOUNG WARRIOR
    Mother, shed no mournful tears,
    But gird me on my sword;
    And give no utterance to thy fears,
    But bless me with thy word.
    The lines are drawn! The fight is on!
    A cause is to be won!
    Mother, look not so white and wan;
    Give Godspeed to thy son.
    Now let thine eyes my way pursue
    Where’er my footsteps fare;
    And when they lead beyond thy view,
    Send after me a prayer.
    But pray not to defend from harm,
    Nor danger to dispel;
    Pray, rather, that with steadfast arm
    I fight the battle well.
    Pray, mother of mine, that I always keep
    My heart and purpose strong,
    My sword unsullied and ready to leap
    Unsheathed against the wrong.
Arduous labors in other fields than poetry threaten to silence Mr.
Johnson’s muse, and that is to be regretted.
2. _Charles Bertram Johnson_
School-teacher, preacher, poet--this is Charles Bertram Johnson of
Missouri. And in Missouri there is no voice more tuneful, no artistry in
song any finer, than his. Nor in so bold an assertion am I forgetting
the sweet voice and exquisite artistry of Sarah Teasdale. Mr. Johnson’s
art is not unlike hers in all that makes hers most charming. Only there
is not so much of his that attains to perfection of form. On pages 52
and 63 were given two of his quatrain poems. These were of his people.
But a lyric poet should sing himself. That is of the essence of lyric
poetry. In so singing, however, the poet reveals not only his individual
life, but that of his race to the view of the world. Another quatrain
poem, personal in form, may be accepted as of racial interpretation:
[Illustration: CHARLES BERTRAM JOHNSON]
SOUL AND STAR
    So oft from out the verge afar
      The dear dreams throng and throng,
    Sometimes I think my soul a star,
      And life a pulséd song.
Born at Callao, Missouri, October 5, 1880, of a Kentucky mother and a
Virginia father, Charles Bertram Johnson attended a one-room school
“across the railroad track,” where--who can explain this?--he was
“Introduced to Bacon, Shakespeare, and the art of rhyming.” It reads
like an old story. Some freak of a schoolmaster whose head is filled
with “useless” lore--poetry, tales, and “such stuff”--nurturing a child
of genius into song. But it was Johnson’s mother who was the great
influence in his life. She was an “adept at rhyming” and “she initiated
me into the world of color and melody”--so writes our poet. It is always
the mother. Then, by chance--but how marvelously chance comes to the aid
of the predestined!--by chance, he learns of Dunbar and his poetry. The
ambition to be a poet of his people like Dunbar possesses him. He knows
the path to that goal is education. He therefore makes his way to a
little college at Macon, Missouri, from which, after five years, he is
graduated--without having received any help in the art of poetry,
however. Two terms at a summer school and special instruction by
correspondence seem to have aided him here, or to have induced the
belief that he had been aided. For twenty-odd years he followed the
profession of teaching. For ten years of that period he also preached.
The ministry now claims his entire energies, and the muse knocks less
and less frequently at his door.
Yet he still sings. In a recent number of _The Crisis_ I find a poem of
his that in suggesting a life of toil growing to a peaceful close is
filled with soothing melody:
OLD FRIENDS
    Sit here before my grate,
      Until it’s ashen gray,
    Or till the night grows late,
      And talk the time away.
    I cannot think to sleep,
      And miss your golden speech,
    My bed of dreams will keep--
      You here within my reach.
    I have so much to say,
      The time is short at best,
    A bit of toil and play,
      And after that comes rest.
    But you and I know now
      The wisdom of the soul,
    The years that seamed the brow
      Have made our visions whole.
    Sit here before my grate
      Until the ash is cold;
    The things you say of late
      Are fine as shriven gold.
Even though one be born to sing, if circumstances have made him a
preacher he may be expected to moralize his song. Whether we shall be
reconciled to this will depend on the art with which it is done. If the
moral idea be a sweet human one, and if the verse still be melifluous,
we will submit, and our delight will be twofold--ethical and esthetical.
We will put our preacher-poet of Missouri to the test:
SO MUCH
    So much of love I need,
      And tender passioned care,
    Of human fault and greed
      To make me unaware:
    So much of love I owe,
      That, ere my life be done,
    How shall I keep His will
      To owe not any one?
Truth is, Mr. Johnson is not given to preaching in verse any more than
other poets. His sole aim is beauty. He assures me it is truth. Instead
of admitting disagreement I only assert that, being a poet, he must find
all truth beautiful. It is only for relative thinking we need the three
terms, truth, goodness, and beauty.
I will conclude this presentation of the Missouri singer with a lyrical
sermonette:
A RAIN SONG
    Chill the rain falls, chill!
    Dull gray the world; the vale
    Rain-swept; wind-swept the hill;
    “But gloom and doubt prevail,”
    My heart breaks forth to say.
    Ere thus its sorrow-note,
    “Cheer up! Cheer up, to-day!
    To-morrow is to be!”
    Babbled from a joyous throat,
    A robin’s in a mist-gray tree.
    Then off to keep a tryst--
    He preened his drabbled cloak--
    Doughty little optimist!--
    As if in answer, broke
    The sunlight through that oak.
_3. Fenton Johnson_
Dreams and visions--such are the treasures of suffering loyal hearts:
dreams, visions, and song. Happy even in their sorrows the people to
whom God has given poets to be their spokesmen to the world. Else their
hearts should stifle with woe. As the prophet was of old so in these
times the poet. As a prophet speaks Fenton Johnson, his heart yearning
toward the black folk of our land:
THESE ARE MY PEOPLE
    These are my people, I have built for them
    A castle in the cloister of my heart;
    And I shall fight that they may dwell therein.
    The God that gave Sojourner tongue of fire
    Has made with me a righteous covenant
    That these, my brothers of the dusk, shall rise
    To Sinai and thence in purple walk
    A newer Canaan, vineyards of the West.
    The rods that chasten us shall break as straw
    And fire consume the godless in the South;
    The hand that struck the helpless of my race
    Shall wither as a leaf in drear November,
    And liberty, the nectar God has blest,
    Shall flow as free as wine in Babylon.
    O God of Covenants, forget us not!
Fenton Johnson seems to be more deeply rooted in the song-traditions of
his people than are most of his fellow-poets. To him the classic
Spirituals afford inspiration and pattern. Whoever is familiar with
those “canticles of love and woe” will recognize their influence
throughout Mr. Johnson’s three volumes of song. I shall make no attempt
here to illustrate this truth but shall rather select a piece or two
that will represent the poet’s general qualities. Other poems more
typical of him as a melodist could be found but these have special
traits that commend them for this place.
THE PLAINT OF THE FACTORY CHILD
    Mother, must I work all day?
    All the day? Ay, all the day?
    Must my little hands be torn?
    And my heart bleed, all forlorn?
    I am but a child of five,
    And the street is all alive
    With the tops and balls and toys,--
    Pretty tops and balls and toys.
    Day in, day out, I toil--toil!
    And all that I know is toil;
    Never laugh as others do,
    Never cry as others do,
    Never see the stars at night,
    Nor the golden glow of sunlight,--
    And all for but a silver coin,--
    Just a worthless silver coin.
    Would that death might come to me!
    That blessed death might come to me,
    And lead me to waters cool,
    Lying in a tranquil pool,
    Up there where the angels sing,
    And the ivy tendrils cling
    To the land of play and song,--
    Fairy land of play and song.
THE MULATTO’S SONG
    Die, you vain but sweet desires!
      Die, you living, burning fires!
    I am like a Prince of France,--
      Like a prince whose noble sires
    Have been robbed of heritage;
      I am phantom derelict,
    Drifting on a flaming sea.
    Everywhere I go, I strive,
      Vainly strive for greater things;
    Daisies die, and stars are cold,
      And canary never sings;
    Where I go they mock my name,
      Never grant me liberty,
    Chance to breathe and chance to do.
_The Vision of Lazarus_, contained in _A Little Dreaming_, is a
blank-verse poem of about three-hundred lines, original, well-sustained,
imaginative, and deeply impressive.
In one of the newer methods of verse, and yet with a splendid suggestion
of the old Spirituals, I will take from a recent magazine a poem by Mr.
Johnson that will show how the vision of his people is turned toward the
future, from the welter of struggling forces in the World War:
THE NEW DAY
    From a vision red with war I awoke and saw the Prince
         of Peace hovering over No Man’s Land.
    Loud the whistles blew and thunder of cannon was drowned
         by the happy shouting of the people.
    From the Sinai that faces Armageddon I heard this chant
         from the throats of white-robed angels:
      Blow your trumpets, little children!
      From the East and from the West,
      From the cities in the valley,
      From God’s dwelling on the mountain,
      Blow your blast that Peace might know
      She is Queen of God’s great army.
      With the crying blood of millions
      We have written deep her name
      In the Book of all the Ages;
      With the lilies in the valley,
      With the roses by the Mersey,
      With the golden flower of Jersey,
      We have crowned her smooth young temples.
      Where her footsteps cease to falter
      Golden grain will greet the morning,
      Where her chariot descends
      Shall be broken down the altar
      Of the gods of dark disturbance.
      Nevermore shall men know suffering,
      Nevermore shall women wailing
      Shake to grief the God of Heaven.
      From the East and from the West,
      From the cities in the valley,
      From God’s dwelling on the mountain,
      Little children, blow your trumpets!
    From Ethiopia, groaning ’neath her heavy burdens I
         heard the music of the old slave songs.
    I heard the wail of warriors, dusk brown, who grimly
         fought the fight of others in the trenches of Mars.
    I heard the plea of blood-stained men of dusk and
         the crimson in my veins leapt furiously:
      Forget not, O my brothers, how we fought
      In No Man’s Land that peace might come again!
      Forget not, O my brothers, how we gave
      Red blood to save the freedom of the world!
      We were not free, our tawny hands were tied;
      But Belgium’s plight and Serbia’s woes we shared
      Each rise of sun or setting of the moon.
      So when the bugle blast had called us forth
      We went not like the surly brute of yore,
      But, as the Spartan, proud to give the world
      The freedom that we never knew nor shared.
      These chains, O brothers mine, have weighed us down
      As Samson in the temple of the gods;
      Unloosen them and let us breathe the air
      That makes the goldenrod the flower of Christ;
      For we have been with thee in No Man’s Land,
      Through lake of fire and down to Hell itself;
      And now we ask of thee our liberty,
      Our freedom in the land of Stars and Stripes.
      I am glad that the Prince of Peace is hovering over No Man’s Land.
4. _Adolphus Johnson_
From the _Preface_ of Adolphus Johnson’s _The Silver Chord_ I will take
a paragraph that is more poetic and perfect in expression than any
stanza in his book. Poetry, I think, is in him, but when he wrote these
rhymes he was not yet sufficiently disciplined in expression. But this
is how he can say a thing in prose:
“As the Goddess of Music takes down her lute, touches its silver chords,
and sets the summer melodies of nature to words, so an inspiration
comes to me in my profoundest slumbers and gently awakens my highest
faculties to the finest thought and serenest contemplation herein
expressed. Always remember that a book is your best friend when it
compels you to think, disenthralls your reason, enkindles your hopes,
vivifies your imagination, and makes easier all the burdens of your
daily life.”

       <collex:text>IV. William Stanley Braithwaite_
            The critical and the creative faculties rarely dwell together in
            harmony. One or the other finally predominates. In the case of Mr.
            Braithwaite it seems to be the critical faculty. He has preferred, it
            seems, to be America’s chief anthologist, encouraging others up rugged
            Parnassus, rather than himself to stand on the heights of song. Since
            1913 he has edited a series of annual anthologies of American magazine
            verse, which he has provided with critical reviews of the verse output
            of the respective year. Of several anthologies of English verse also he
            is the editor. Three books of original verse stand to his credit:
            _Lyrics of Life and Love_ (1904), _The House of Falling Leaves_ (1908),
            and _Sandy Star and Willie Gee_ (1922). These dates seem to prove that
            the creative impulse has waned.
            Verse artistry, in simple forms, reaches a degree of excellence in Mr.
            Braithwaite’s lyrics that has rarely been surpassed in our times.
            Graceful and esthetically satisfying expression is given to elusive or
            mystical and rare fancies. I will give one of his brief lyrics as an
            example of the qualities to which I allude:
            SANDY STAR
            No more from out the sunset,
            No more across the foam,
            No more across the windy hills
            Will Sandy Star come home.
            He went away to search it,
            With a curse upon his tongue,
            And in his hands the staff of life
            Made music as it swung.
            I wonder if he found it,
            And knows the mystery now:
            Our Sandy Star who went away
            With the secret on his brow.
            In a number of Mr. Braithwaite’s lyrics, as in this one, there is an
            atmosphere of mystery that, with the charming simplicity of manner,
            strongly suggests Blake. There is a strangeness in all beauty, it has
            been said. There is commonly something of Faëryland in the finest lyric
            poetry. Another lyric illustrating this quality in Mr. Braithwaite is
            the following:
            IT’S A LONG WAY
            It’s a long way the sea-winds blow
            Over the sea-plains blue,--
            But longer far has my heart to go
            Before its dreams come true.
            It’s work we must, and love we must,
            And do the best we may,
            And take the hope of dreams in trust
            To keep us day by day.
            It’s a long way the sea-winds blow--
            But somewhere lies a shore--
            Thus down the tide of Time shall flow
            My dreams forevermore.
            Mr. Braithwaite’s art rises above race. He seems not to be
            race-conscious in his writing, whether prose or verse. Yet no man can
            say but that race has given his poetry the distinctive quality I have
            indicated. In this connection a most interesting poem is his “A New
            England Spinster.” The detachment is perfect, the analysis is done in
            the spirit of absolute art. I will quote but two of its dozen or so
            stanzas:
            She dwells alone, and never heeds
            How strange may sound her own footfall,
            And yet is prompt to others’ needs,
            Or ready at a neighbor’s call.
            But still her world is one apart,
            Serene above desire and change;
            There are no hills beyond her heart,
            Beyond her gate, no winds that range.
            Here is the true artist’s imagination that penetrates to the secrets of
            life. No poet’s lyrics, with their deceptive simplicity, better reward
            study for a full appreciation of their idea. So much of suggestion to
            the reader of the poems which follow:
            FOSCATI
            Blest be Foscati! You’ve heard tell
            How--spirit and flesh of him--blown to flame,
            Leaped the stars for heaven, dropped back to hell,
            And felt no shame.
            I here indite this record of his journey:
            The splendor of his epical will to perform
            Life’s best, with the lance of Truth at Tourney--
            Till caught in the storm.
            Of a woman’s face and hair like scented clover,
            Te Deums, Lauds, and Magnificat, he
            Praised with tongue of saint, heart of lover--
            Missed all, but found Foscati!
            AUTUMN SADNESS
            The warm October rain fell upon his dream,
            When once again the autumn sadness stirred,
            And murmured through his blood, like a hidden stream
            In a forest, unheard.
            The drowsy rain battered against his delight
            Of the half forgotten poignancies,
            That settle in the dusk of an autumn night
            On a world one hears and sees.
            One was, he thought, an echo merely,
            A glow enshadowed of truths untraced;
            But the autumn sadness, brought him yearly,
            Was a joy embraced.
            THANKING GOD
            The way folks had of thanking God
            He found annoying, till he thought
            Of flame and coolness in the sod--
            Of balms and blessings that they wrought.
            And so the habit grew, and then--
            Of when and how he did not care--
            He found his God as other men
            The mystic verb in a grammar of prayer.
            He never knelt, nor uttered words--
            His laughter felt no chastening rod;
            “My being,” he said, “is a choir of birds,
            And all my senses are thanking God.”
            Mr. Braithwaite is thoroughly conversant, as these selections indicate,
            with the subtleties and finest effects of the art poetic, and his
            impulses to write spring from the deepest human speculations, the purest
            motives of art. Hence in his work he takes his place among the few.

       <collex:text>_IX. Claude McKay_
            [Illustration: CLAUDE MCKAY]
            An English subject, being born and growing to manhood in Jamaica, Claude
            McKay, a pure blood Negro, was first discovered as a poet by English
            critics. In Jamaica, as early as 1911, when he was but twenty-two years
            of age, his _Constab Ballads_, in Negro dialect, was published. Even in
            so broken a tongue this book revealed a poet--on the constabulary force
            of Jamaica. In 1920 his first book of poems in literary English, _Spring
            in New Hamp-Shire_, came out in England, with a _Preface_ by Mr. I. A.
            Richards, of Cambridge, England. Meanwhile, shortly after the
            publication of his first book, he had come to the United States.
            Here he has worked at various occupations, has taken courses in
            Agriculture and English in the Kansas State College, and has thus become
            acquainted with life in the States. He is now on the editorial staff of
            the _Liberator_, New York. There has been no poet of his race who has
            more poignantly felt and more artistically expressed the life of the
            American Negro. His poetry is a most noteworthy contribution to
            literature. From _Spring in New Hampshire_ I am privileged to take a
            number of poems which will follow without comment:
            SPRING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
            Too green the springing April grass,
            Too blue the silver-speckled sky,
            For me to linger here, alas,
            While happy winds go laughing by,
            Wasting the golden hours indoors,
            Washing windows and scrubbing floors.
            Too wonderful the April night,
            Too faintly sweet the first May flowers,
            The stars too gloriously bright,
            For me to spend the evening hours,
            When fields are fresh and streams are leaping,
            Wearied, exhausted, dully sleeping.
            THE LYNCHING
            His spirit in smoke ascended to high heaven.
            His Father, by the cruelest way of pain,
            Had bidden him to his bosom once again;
            The awful sin remained still unforgiven:
            All night a bright and solitary star
            (Perchance the one that ever guided him,
            Yet gave him up at last to Fate’s wild whim)
            Hung pitifully o’er the swinging char.
            Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view
            The ghastly body swaying in the sun:
            The women thronged to look, but never a one
            Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue,
            And little lads, lynchers that were to be,
            Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee.
            THE HARLEM DANCER
            Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
            And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;
            Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
            Blown by black players upon a picnic day.
            She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,
            The light gauze hanging loose about her form;
            To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm
            Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.
            Upon her swarthy neck, black, shiny curls
            Profusely fell; and, tossing coins in praise,
            The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,
            Devoured her with eager, passionate gaze:
            But, looking at her falsely-smiling face,
            I knew her self was not in that strange place.
            IN BONDAGE
            I would be wandering in distant fields
            Where man, and bird, and beast live leisurely,
            And the old earth is kind and ever yields
            Her goodly gifts to all her children free;
            Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding,
            And boys and girls have time and space for play
            Before they come to years of understanding,--
            Somewhere I would be singing, far away;
            For life is greater than the thousand wars
            Men wage for it in their insatiate lust,
            And will remain like the eternal stars
            When all that is to-day is ashes and dust:
            But I am bound with you in your mean graves,
            Oh, black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.
            Distinction of idea and phrase inheres in these poems. In them the Negro
            is esthetically conceived, and interpreted with vision. This is art
            working as it should. Mr. McKay has passion and the control of it to the
            ends of art. He has the poet’s insight, the poet’s understanding.
            Perhaps the most arresting poem in this list, and the one most surely
            attesting the genius of the writer, is _The Harlem Dancer_. It is an
            achievement in portrayal sufficient by itself to establish a poetic
            reputation. The divination that penetrates to the secret purity of soul,
            or nobleness of character, through denying appearances--how rare is the
            faculty, and how necessary! Elsewhere I give a poem from a Negro woman
            which evinces the same divine gift in the author, exhibited in a poem
            no less original and no less deeply impressive--Mrs. Spencer’s _At the
            Carnival_. Here I will companion _The Harlem Dancer_ with one from Mr.
            Dandridge, for the comparison will deepen the effect of each:
            ZALKA PEETRUZA
            (_Who Was Christened Lucy Jane_)
            She danced, near nude, to tom-tom beat,
            With swaying arms and flying feet,
            ’Mid swirling spangles, gauze and lace,
            Her all was dancing--save her face.
            A conscience, dumb to brooding fears,
            Companioned hearing deaf to cheers;
            A body, marshalled by the will,
            Kept dancing while a heart stood still:
            And eyes obsessed with vacant stare
            Looked over heads to empty air,
            As though they sought to find therein
            Redemption for a maiden sin.
            ’Twas thus, amid force-driven grace,
            We found the lost look on her face;
            And then, to us, did it occur
            That, though we saw--we saw not her.
            Returning to Mr. McKay, we may assert that his new volume of verse,
            _Harlem Shadows_, confirms and enhances the estimate of him we have
            expressed.

       <collex:text>_X. Leslie Pinckney Hill_
            [Illustration: LESLIE PINCKNEY HILL]
            Bearing the diploma of the Lyric Muse, Mr. Leslie Pinckney Hill,
            schoolmaster of Cheyney, Pennsylvania, and authentic singer, is one of
            the newest arrivals on the slopes of Parnassus. A first glance tells
            that he is an agile climber, sinewy, easy of movement, light of step,
            with both grace and strength. Every indication in form and motion is for
            some point far up toward the summit. Youthful he is, ambitious, plainly,
            and, in spite of a burden, buoyant. “Climber,” I said. I will drop the
            figure. Poets were never pedestrians. Mr. Hill comes not afoot. If not
            on the wings of Pegasus, yet on wings he comes--_the wings of
            oppression_. Sad wings! yet it must be remarked that it is commonly on
            such wings that poets of whatever race and time rise. And Mr. Hill’s
            race knows no other wings. On the wings of oppression the Negro poet and
            the Negro people are rising toward the summits of Parnassus, Pisgah, and
            other peaks. This they know, too, and of it they are justly proud.
            In his _Foreword_ Mr. Hill thus states the case of his people, and, by
            implication, of himself: “Nothing in the life of the nation has seemed
            to me more significant than that dark civilization which the colored man
            has built up in the midst of a white society organized against it. The
            Negro has been driven under all the burdens of oppression, both material
            and spiritual, to the brink of desperation, but he has always been saved
            by his philosophy of life. He has advanced against all opposition by a
            certain elevation of his spirit. He has been made strong in tribulation.
            He has constrained oppression to give him wings.”
            The significant thing about these wings, in a critical view, is that
            they fulfill the proper function of wings--bear aloft and sustain in
            flight through the azure depths. Mr. Hill’s wings do bear aloft and
            sustain: if not always, nor even ever, into the very empyrean of poetry
            yet invariably, seventy times, into the ampler air. Like all his race,
            he has suffered much; and, like all his race still, he has gathered
            wisdom from sorrow. As a true poet should have, he has philosophy, also
            vision and imagination--vision for himself and his people, imagination
            that sees facts in terms of beauty and presents truths with vital
            imagery. Add thereto craftsmanship acquired in the best traditions of
            English poetry and you have Hill the poet.
            The merit of his book cannot be shown by lines and stanzas. As ever with
            true art, the merit lies in the whole effect of complete poems. Still,
            we may here first detach from this and that poem a stanza or two,
            despite the wrong to art. The first and fourth stanzas of the title-poem
            will indicate Mr. Hill’s technique and philosophy:
            I have a song that few will sing
            In honor of all suffering,
            A song to which my heart can bring
            The homage of believing--
            A song the heavy-laden hears
            Above the clamor of his fears,
            While still he walks with blinding tears,
            And drains the cup of grieving.
            *       *       *       *       *
            So long as life is steeped in wrong,
            And nations cry: “How long, how long!”
            I look not to the wise and strong
            For peace and self-possession;
            But right will rise, and mercy shine,
            And justice lift her conquering sign
            Where lowly people starve and pine
            Beneath a world oppression.
            The character and temper of the Negro in those gentler aspects which
            make such an appeal to the heart are revealed in the following sonnet:
            MATER DOLOROSA
            O mother, there are moments when I know
            God’s presence to the full. The city street
            May wrap me in the tumult and the heat
            Of futile striving; bitter winds may blow
            With winter-wilting freeze of hail and snow,
            And all my hopes lie shattered in defeat;
            But in my heart the springtime blossoms sweet,
            And heaven seems very near the way I go.
            These moments are the angels of that prayer
            Which thou hast breathed for many a troubled year
            With bended knee and swarthy-streaming face--
            “Uphold him, Father, with a double care:
            He is but mortal, yet his days must bear
            The world cross, and the burden of his race.”
            If these poems, taken collectively, do not declare “what is on the
            Negro’s mind” they yet truly reveal, to the reflecting person, what has
            sunk deep into his heart. They are therefore a message to America, a
            protest, an appeal, and a warning. They will penetrate, I predict,
            through breast-armor of _aes triplex_ into the hearts of those whom
            sermons and editorials fail to touch in the springs of action. Such is
            the virtue of music wed to persuasive words. In strong lines of soaring
            blank verse, in which Mr. Hill is particularly capable, he makes a
            direct appeal to America in behalf of his people, in a poem entitled
            Armageddon:
            Because ye schooled them in the arts of life,
            And gave to them your God, and poured your blood
            Into their veins to make them what they are,
            They shall not fail you in the hour of need.
            They own in them enough of you to feel
            All that has made you masters in your time--
            Dear art and riches, unremitting toil,
            Proud types of beauty, an unbounded will
            To triumph, wondrous science and old law--
            These have they learned to covet and to share.
            But deeper in them still is something steeled
            To hot abhorrence and unmeasured dread
            Of your undaunted sins against the light--
            Red sins of lust, of envy and of hate,
            Of guilty gain extorted from the weak,
            Of brotherhood traduced, and God denied.
            All this have they beheld without revolt,
            And borne the brunt in agonizing prayer.
            For other strains of blood that flow from times
            Older than Egypt, whence the dark man gave
            The rudiments of learning to all lands,
            Have been a strong constraint. And they have dreamed
            Of a peculiar mission under heaven,
            And felt the force of unexampled gifts
            That make for them a rare inheritance--
            The gift of cheerful confidence in man,
            The gift of calm endurance, solacing
            An infinite capacity for pain,
            The gift of an unfeigned humility,
            Blinding the eyes of strident arrogance
            And bigot pride to that philosophy
            And that far-glancing wisdom which it veils,
            Of joy in beauty, hardihood in toil,
            Of hope in tribulation, and of wide
            Adaptive power without a parallel
            In chronicles of men.
            A sonnet entitled _To a Caged Canary in a Negro Restaurant_ will present
            the poet’s people with the persuasiveness of pathos as the foregoing
            poem with the persuasiveness of reason:
            Thou little golden bird of happy song!
            A cage cannot restrain the rapturous joy
            Which thou dost shed abroad. Thou dost employ
            Thy bondage for high uses. Grievous wrong
            Is thine; yet in thy heart glows full and strong
            The tropic sun, though far beyond thy flight,
            And though thou flutterest there by day and night
            Above the clamor of a dusky throng.
            So let my will, albeit hedged about
            By creed and caste, feed on the light within;
            So let my song sing through the bars of doubt
            With light and healing where despair has been;
            So let my people bide their time and place,
            A hindered but a sunny-hearted race.
            It would be an injustice to this poet did I convey the idea that his
            seventy-odd poems are exclusively occupied with race wrongs and
            oppression. Not a few of them bear no stamp of an oppressed or afflicted
            spirit, though of sorrow they may have been nurtured.
            A lyric of pure loveliness is the following, entitled
            TO A NOBLY-GIFTED SINGER
            All the pleasance of her face
            Telleth of an inward grace;
            In her dark eyes I have seen
            Sorrows of the Nazarene;
            In the proud and perfect mould
            Of her body I behold,
            Rounded in a single view,
            The good, the beautiful, the true;
            And when her spirit goes up-winging
            On sweet airs of artless singing,
            Surely the heavenly spheres rejoice
            In union with a kindred voice.
            Schoolmaster I said Mr. Hill was. To represent his didactic quality, not
            his purer lyrical note, nor yet his narrative beauty, I choose the
            following piece:
            SELF-DETERMINATION
            _The Philosophy of the American Negro_
            Four things we will not do, in spite of all
            That demons plot for our decline and fall;
            We bring four benedictions which the meek
            Unto the proud are privileged to speak,
            Four gifts by which amidst all stern-browed races
            We move with kindly hearts and shining faces.
            _We will not hate._ Law, custom, creed and caste,
            All notwithstanding, here we hold us fast.
            Down through the years the mighty ships of state
            Have all been broken on the rocks of hate.
            _We will not cease to laugh and multiply._
            We slough off trouble, and refuse to die.
            The Indian stood unyielding, stark and grim;
            We saw him perish, and we learned of him
            To mix a grain of philosophic mirth
            With all the crass injustices of earth.
            _We will not use the ancient carnal tools._
            These never won, yet centuries of schools,
            Of priests, and all the work of brush and pen
            Have not availed to win the wisest men
            From futile faith in battleship and shell:
            We see them fall, and mark that folly well.
            _We will not waver in our loyalty._
            No strange voice reaches us across the sea;
            No crime at home shall stir us from this soil.
            Ours is the guerdon, ours the blight of toil,
            But raised above it by a faith sublime
            We choose to suffer _here_ and bide our time.
            And if we hold to this, we dream some day
            Our countrymen will follow in our way.
            But though teacher Leslie Pinckney Hill is singer too. And though he has
            a message for America he also has music. His powers are rich, varied,
            cultured, and developing. His second book will be better than his
            excellent first.

THE HEART OF NEGRO WOMANHOOD
_I. Miss Eva A. Jessye_
[Illustration: MISS EVA A. JESSYE]
From newspapers I have clipt several poems by Miss Jessye that exhibit a
nature touched to the finer things of the world and of life. She has
fancy, and skill in expression. I concluded section I of chapter II with
a poem of hers, and I will here give two more. The first, in a lighter
vein, betrays the human nature of a school-teacher in the midst of her
vexations while she tries to appear above the reach of common desires.
SPRING WITH THE TEACHER
    ’Tis now the time of silver moon,
    Of swelling bud and fancies free
    As western winds, but then, ah me!
    May cannot come too soon;
    The rover calls in every child,
    And sets his pulses running wild!
    “Do stop that noise and take your seat!
    Joe, learn to study quietly!
    Why girl, it surely has me beat
    How you forget geography!
    Brazil’s in Spain? Here, close that book!
    What caused the Civil War, you say?--
    Suzanna says somebody took
    Her beads; return them right away!
    “Now boy, I told you once before
    To put that story book away!
    I’ll call the roll: Beatrice Moore,
    Why were you absent yesterday?
    Why yes, I heard that mocking bird.
    Lee Arthur, straighten up your face!
    Well, surely, class, you never heard
    Of adverbs having tense and case!
    “Now, James, explain the term ‘per cent,’
    My, my, ’tis surely not forgot!
    If it were fun or devilment
    You’d know it all, sir, like as not!
    Who put that bent pin in my chair?
    No one of course--bent pins can walk!
    I’ll tell you though, had I sat there
    I’d make these straps and switches talk.
    “A picnic on for Saturday?
    (I wish that I were going, too!)
    Oh, no! I couldn’t get away,
    I have so many things to do.
    Well, there’s the bell! Goodbye, goodbye,
    And be good children, don’t forget.”--
    Well, thank the Lord they’re gone, but I
    Can hear their joyous laughter yet.
    ’Tis now the time of silver moon,
    Of swelling bud and fancies free
    As western winds, but then, ah me!
    May cannot come too soon!
Though the moral motive is rarely consistent with the artistic, yet in
the next poem of Miss Jessye’s I shall give there is a perfect
reconciliation. Original no doubt is the idea of this poem, but Sappho,
it seems to me, as one of her fragments bears witness, had meditated
upon the very same idea twenty-five centuries ago.
TO A ROSEBUD
    O dainty bud, I hold thee in my hand--
    A castaway, a dead, a lifeless thing,
    A few days since I saw thee, wet with dew,
    A bud of promise to thy parent cling,
    Now thou art crushed yet lovely as before,
    The adverse winds but waft thy fragrance more.
    How small, how frail! I tread thee underfoot
    And crush thy petals in the reeking ground:
    Perchance some one in pity for thy state
    Will pick thee up in reverence profound--
    Lo, thou art pure with virtue more intense,
    Thy perfume grows from earthly detriments.
    Why do we grieve? Let each affliction bear
    A greater beauty springing from the sod,
    May sweetness well as incense from the urn,
    Which, rising high, enshrouds the throne of God.
    Envoy of Hope, this lesson I disclose--
    “Be Ever Sweet,” thou humble, fragrant rose!
Miss Jessye, now a teacher of the piano in Muskogee, Oklahoma, was born
in Kansas and was graduated from Western University. She has taken
prizes in oratory, poetry, and essay-writing. Yet in her early twenties,
she has a volume of verse ready for publication.
_II. Mrs. J. W. Hammond_
[Illustration: MRS. J. W. HAMMOND]
Self-taught, and disclaiming knowledge of books, Mrs. Hammond of Omaha,
Nebraska, contributes to _The Monitor_ of that city verses of musical
cadences and gentle beauty. Her response to the scenes and objects of
nature is that of a poetic mind. The spirit of joy sings through her
verses. As a representative poem the following may be accepted:
THE OPTIMIST
    Who would have the sky any color but blue,
      Or the grass any color but green?
    Or the flowers that bloom the summer through
      Of other color or sheen?
    How the sunshine gladdens the human heart--
      How the sound of the falling rain
    Will cause the tender tears to start,
      And free the soul from pain.
    Oh, this old world is a great old place!
      And I love each season’s change,
    The river, the brook of purling grace,
      The valley, the mountain range.
    And when I am called to quit this life,
      My feet will not spurn the sod,
    Though I leave this world with its beauty rife,--
      There’s a glorious one with God!
One other poem of Mrs. Hammond’s I will give that is beautiful alike in
feeling and treatment.
TO MY NEIGHBOR BOY
    When sweet Aurora lifts her veil,
    And floods the world with rosy light,
    When morning stars, grown dim and pale,
    Proclaim the passing of the night--
    With waking bird and opening flower,
    I greet with joy the new-born day--
    For oft at this exquisite hour,
    I hear a strange new roundelay.
    No syncopating “jazz” or “blues,”
    Insults my eager listening ear,
    But softly as the falling dews,
    The strains come stealing sweet and clear.
    With lilting grace they rise above
    The early traffic’s sordid din--
    My neighbor boy is making love
        To his beloved violin.
    Sometimes I catch a quivering note--
    An over-burdened wordless cry.
    I say: “Those are the lines he wrote
    The day he told some one goodbye.”
    But when I hear a joyous strain
    Of melody serene and clear,
    I smile and say: “All’s well again--
    The little maiden must be near!”
    But best of all I love the mood
    That prompts a soft sweet minor key.
    My longing soul forgets to brood,
    While drinking in the melody.
    My restless spirit will not rove,
    Nor lose its faith in God and men,
    The while my neighbor boy makes love
      To his beloved violin.
_III. Mrs. Alice Dunbar-Nelson_
A sonnet has already been given from Mrs. Dunbar-Nelson to which I think
Mrs. Browning or Christina Rossetti might have appended her signature
without detriment to her fame. It is one of a series entitled _A Dream
Sequence_, the rest of the sequence being as yet unpublished. Instead
of pillaging this sequence, marring the effect of the individual member
so dislocated, I will take from her compilation, _The Dunbar
Speaker_,[3] so named for her first husband, the poet, two of her
original poems. The first is a war poem, doubtless, but the occasion is
immaterial. The spirit of rebellion against confinement to the petty
thing while the something big calls afar might be evoked into play by
any of a hundred situations.
[Illustration: ALICE DUNBAR-NELSON]
I SIT AND SEW
    I sit and sew--a useless task it seems,
    My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams--
    The panoply of war, the martial tread of men,
    Grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken
    Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,
    Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath--
    But--I must sit and sew.
    I sit and sew--my heart aches with desire--
    That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire
    On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things
    Once men. My soul in pity flings
    Appealing cries, yearning only to go
    There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe--
    But--I must sit and sew.
    The little useless seam, the idle patch;
    Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,
    When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,
    Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?
    You need me, Christ! It is no roseate dream
    That beckons me--this pretty futile seam,
    It stifles me--God, must I sit and sew?
The second poem I shall give is also not unrelated to the recent World
War, and to all war: the lights alluded to, shining across and down the
Delaware for miles, are the lights of the DuPont powder mills. It is a
poem of fine symmetry, highly poetic diction, and great allusive
meaning--a poem that will bear and repay many readings, never growing
less beautiful.
THE LIGHTS AT CARNEY’S POINT
    O white little lights at Carney’s Point,
      You shine so clear o’er the Delaware;
    When the moon rides high in the silver sky,
    Then you gleam, white gems on the Delaware.
    Diamond circlet on a full white throat,
      You laugh your rays on a questing boat;
    Is it peace you dream in your flashing gleam,
      O’er the quiet flow of the Delaware?
    And the lights grew dim at the water’s brim,
      For the smoke of the mills shredded slow between;
    And the smoke was red, as is new bloodshed,
      And the lights went lurid ’neath the livid screen.
    O red little lights at Carney’s Point,
      You glower so grim o’er the Delaware;
    When the moon hides low sombrous clouds below,
      Then you glow like coals o’er the Delaware.
    Blood red rubies on a throat of fire,
      You flash through the dusk of a funeral pyre;
    Are there hearth fires red whom you fear and dread
      O’er the turgid flow of the Delaware?
    And the lights gleamed gold o’er the river cold,
      For the murk of the furnace shed a copper veil;
    And the veil was grim at the great cloud’s brim,
      And the lights went molten, now hot, now pale.
    O gold little lights at Carney’s Point,
      You gleam so proud o’er the Delaware;
    When the moon grows wan in the eastering dawn,
      Then you sparkle gold points o’er the Delaware.
    Aureate filigree on a Crœsus’ brow,
      You hasten the dawn on a gray ship’s prow.
    Light you streams of gold in the grim ship’s hold
      O’er the sullen flow of the Delaware?
    And the lights went gray in the ash of day,
      For a quiet Aurora brought a halcyon balm;
    And the sun laughed high in the infinite sky,
      And the lights were forgot in the sweet, sane calm.
Mrs. Dunbar-Nelson has not applied herself to poetry as she has to prose
fiction. As a short-story writer she has special distinction.
_IV. Mrs. Georgia Douglas Johnson_
[Illustration: MRS. G. D. JOHNSON]
Exquisite artistry in verse, with infallible poetic content, is
exhibited in Mrs. Georgia Douglas Johnson’s _The Heart of a Woman_. It
is also the saddest book produced by her race. Perfect lyrical notes,
the most poignant pathos--that is an exact description of it. Triple
bronze cannot armor any breast successfully against its appeal. For the
heart that speaks here is a heart that has known its garden of sorrows,
its Gethsemane. This is the harvest of her sorrows--dreams and songs, of
which she comments:
    The dreams of the dreamer
      Are life-drops that pass
    The break in the heart
      To the Soul’s hour-glass.
    The songs of the singer
      Are tones that repeat
    The cry of the heart
      Till it ceases to beat.
Neither in memory nor in dreams is there a refuge for the life-wounded
heart of this woman:
    What need have I for memory,
      When not a single flower
    Has bloomed within life’s desert
      For me, one little hour?
    What need have I for memory,
      Whose burning eyes have met
    The corse of unborn happiness
      Winding the trail regret?
And thus of her dreams, on the last page of her book:
    I am folding up my little dreams
      Within my heart to-night,
    And praying I may soon forget
      The torture of their sight.
What are the experiences and what the conditions of life--what must they
have been--which have had the tragic power to make a soul “try to forget
it has dreamed of stars?” The world little kens what hearts in it are
breaking, and why. To the grave the secret goes with the many, one in a
million betrays it in a cry. But not here is it betrayed:
SMOTHERED FIRES
    A woman with a burning flame
      Deep covered through the years
    With ashes--ah! she hid it deep,
      And smothered it with tears.
    Sometimes a baleful light would rise
      From out the dusky bed,
    And then the woman hushed it quick
      To slumber on, as dead.
    At last the weary war was done,
      The tapers were alight,
    And with a sigh of victory
      She breathed a soft--goodnight!
Not without hurt to itself may the oyster produce its pearl. These poems
from the heart of a woman remind me of nothing so much as a string of
pearls. Each one is witness to a bruise or gash to the spirit. The lyric
cry has not been more piercing in anything written on American soil,
piercing all the more for the perfect restraint, the sure artistry. It
was a heart surcharged with sorrow in which these pearls of poesy took
shape from secret wounds. The heart of one woman speaks in them for
thousands in America, else inarticulate. “We weep,” says the African
proverb, “we weep in our hearts like the tortoise.” Without one word or
hint of race in all the book there is yet between its covers the
unwritten, unwritable tragedy of that borderland race which knows not
where it belongs in the world, a truly homeless race in soul. A sadder
book could hardly be.
Mrs. Georgia Douglas Johnson was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and received
her academic education in Atlanta University and a musical education at
Oberlin. She now lives in Washington, D. C. She is at the beginning of
her career as an author. Two other books of lyrics, under the titles of
_An Autumn Love Cycle_, and _Bronze_,[4] she has in preparation for the
press at this time. Some of their contents have already appeared in
magazines. These two new volumes will make an advance in power and in
richness of content beyond _The Heart of a Woman_. They will also
provide the key to the tragic mystery concealed in that book. A poem
that is to appear in _Bronze_ will be given in a later chapter. I will
here give another. Both have already been published in magazines.
THE OCTOROON
    One drop of midnight in the dawn of life’s pulsating stream
    Marks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its gleam.
    Forevermore her step she bends, insular, strange, apart--
    And none can read the riddle of her strangely warring heart.
    The stormy current of her blood beats like a mighty sea
    Against the man-wrought iron bars of her captivity.
    For refuge, succor, peace, and rest, she seeks that humble fold
    Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are purest gold.
_V. Miss Angelina W. Grimké_
[Illustration: MISS ANGELINA GRIMKÉ]
Not less distinctive in quality than Mrs. Johnson’s, and not less
beautiful in artistry, are the brief lyrics of Miss Angelina W. Grimké,
also of the city of Washington. If hers should be called imagist poetry
or no I cannot say, but I am certain that more vivid imaging of objects
has not been done in verse by any contemporary. This, too, in stanzas
that suggest in their perfection of form the work of the old lapidaries.
Nor is there but a surface or formal beauty. There is passion, there is
beauty of idea, the soul of lyric poetry is there as well as the form. I
am weighing well my words in giving this praise, and I know that not
one in the thousand of those who write good verse would deserve them.
But I ask the sceptical individual to re-read them after he has perused
the poems themselves.
I will present several without interrupting comment:
DAWN
    Grey trees, grey skies, and not a star;
      Grey mist, grey hush;
    And then, frail, exquisite, afar,
      A hermit-thrush.
A WINTER TWILIGHT
    A silence slipping around like death,
    Yet chased by a whisper, a sigh, a breath;
    One group of trees, lean, naked and cold,
    Inking their crests ’gainst a sky green-gold;
    One path that knows where the corn flowers were;
    Lonely, apart, unyielding, one fir;
    And over it softly leaning down,
    One star that I loved ere the fields went brown.
THE PUPPET-PLAYER
    Sometimes it seems as though some puppet-player.
      A clenched claw cupping a craggy chin.
    Sits just beyond the border of our seeing,
      Twitching the strings with slow, sardonic grin.
THE WANT OF YOU
    A hint of gold where the moon will be;
    Through the flocking clouds just a star or two;
    Leaf sounds, soft and wet and hushed,
    And oh! the crying want of you.
EL BESO
    Twilight--and you,
    Quiet--the stars;
    Snare of the shine of your teeth,
    Your provocative laughter,
    The gloom of your hair;
    Lure of you, eye and lip;
    Yearning, yearning,
    Languor, surrender;
      Your mouth,
    And madness, madness,
    Tremulous, breathless, flaming,
    The space of a sigh;
    Then awakening--remembrance,
    Pain, regret--your sobbing;
    And again quiet--the stars,
    Twilight--and you.
AT THE SPRING DAWN
    I watched the dawn come,
      Watched the spring dawn come.
    And the red sun shouldered his way up
      Through the grey, through the blue,
    Through the lilac mists.
    The quiet of it! The goodness of it!
      And one bird awoke, sang, whirred
    A blur of moving black against the sun,
      Sang again--afar off.
    And I stretched my arms to the redness of the sun,
      Stretched to my finger tips,
        And I laughed.
    Ah! It is good to be alive, good to love,
      At the dawn,
        At the spring dawn.
TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF CHARLOTTE FORTEN GRIMKÉ
    Still are there wonders of the dark and day;
    The muted shrilling of shy things at night,
    So small beneath the stars and moon;
    The peace, dream-frail, but perfect while the light
    Lies softly on the leaves at noon.
    These are, and these will be
    Until Eternity;
    But she who loved them well has gone away.
    Each dawn, while yet the east is veiled gray,
    The birds about her window wake and sing;
    And far away each day some lark
    I know is singing where the grasses swing;
    Some robin calls and calls at dark.
    These are, and these will be
    Until Eternity;
    But she who loved them well has gone away.
    The wild flowers that she loved down green ways stray;
    Her roses lift their wistful buds at dawn,
    But not for eyes that loved them best;
    Only her little pansies are all gone,
    Some lying softly on her breast.
    And flowers will bud and be
    Until Eternity;
    But she who loved them well has gone away.
    Where has she gone? And who is there to say?
    But this we know: her gentle spirit moves
    And is where beauty never wanes,
    Perchance by other streams, ’mid other groves;
    And to us here, ah! she remains
    A lovely memory
    Until Eternity.
    She came, she loved, and then she went away.
The subject of these beautiful memorial verses was not simply in feeling
but in expression also a poet herself. From “A June Song” written by her
I will take a stanza in evidence:
    How shall we crown her bright young head?
    Crown it with roses, rare and red;
    Crown it with roses, creamy white,
    As the lotus bloom that sweetens the night.
    Crown it with roses as pink as shell
    In which the voices of ocean dwell.
    And a fairer queen
    Shall ne’er be seen
    Than our lovely, laughing June.
_VI. Mrs. Anne Spencer_
Who can fathom to its depths the heart of womanhood? Under the
conditions of American
[Illustration: MRS. ANNE SPENCER]
life the Negro woman’s heart offers difficulties peculiar to itself.
These various writers--talented, cultured, with the keen sensibilities
of a specially sensitive people--have given us glimpses into some of the
depths, not all. A poet of the other sex, Mr. McKay, with that
divination which belongs to the poet, intimates in _The Harlem Dancer_,
quoted on page 128, that the index of the heart is not always in the
occupation or the face:
    But, looking at her falsely-smiling face,
    I knew her self was not in that strange place.
No, her self was free and too noble to be smirched by the “passionate
gaze of wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys.” It is a paradox that has puzzled
a recent white novelist. Cissie Dildine, in Mr. Stribling’s
_Birthright_, pilferer though she is, and sacrificer of her maidenhood,
yet does not lose caste among her people. They speak affectionately of
her and minister lovingly to her in jail, with no hint of reproach. It
is not other standards, as the novelist intimates, that we must apply,
but only right standards, in view of circumstances.
I am able to give here a poem that may start in the reader’s mind a
fruitful train of reflections, tending toward profound ethical truth.
The writer, Mrs. Anne Spencer of Lynchburg, Virginia, in all of her work
that I have seen, has marked originality. Her style is independent,
unconventional, and highly compressed. The poem which follows will
fairly represent her work and at the same time open another avenue to
the secret chambers of the Negro woman’s heart:
AT THE CARNIVAL
    Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank,
    I desire a name for you,
    Nice, as a right glove fits;
    For you--who amid the malodorous
    Mechanics of this unlovely thing,
    Are darling of spirit and form.
    I know you--a glance, and what you are
    Sits-by-the-fire in my heart.
    My Limousine-Lady knows you, or
    Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark
    Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile?
    Guilt pins a fig-leaf; Innocence is its own adorning.
    The bull-necked man knows you--this first time
    His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health,
    And thinks not of his avocation.
    I came incuriously--
    Set on no diversion save that my mind
    Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds
    In the presence of a blind crowd.
    The color of life was gray.
    Everywhere the setting seemed right
    For my mood!
    Here the sausage and garlic booth
    Sent unholy incense skyward;
    There a quivering female-thing
    Gestured assignations, and lied
    To call it dancing;
    There, too, were games of chance
    With chances for none;
    But oh! Girl-of-the-Tank, at last!
    Gleaming Girl, how intimately pure and free
    The gaze you send the crowd,
    As though you know the dearth of beauty
    In its sordid life.
    We need you--my Limousine-Lady,
    The bull-necked man, and I.
    Seeing you here brave and water-clean,
    Leaven for the heavy ones of earth,
    I am swift to feel that what makes
    The plodder glad is good; and
    Whatever is good is God.
    The wonder is that you are here;
    I have seen the queer in queer places,
    But never before a heaven-fed
    Naiad of the Carnival-Tank!
    Little Diver, Destiny for you,
    Like as for me, is shod in silence;
    Years may seep into your soul
    The bacilli of the usual and the expedient;
    I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day!
_VII. Miss Jessie Fauset_
[Illustration: MISS JESSIE REDMON FAUSET]
By way of indicating the idealistic aspirations of the colored people I
gave at the end of Chapter I. J. Mord Allen’s poem _The Psalm of the
Uplift_. For the same purpose I will give here, at the end of this
chapter, a poem of the very present day from one of the most
accomplished young women of the Negro race. Besides its intrinsic merit
as a poem it has the further recommendation for a place in this chapter
that it celebrates a woman of the black race who was the very embodiment
of its noblest qualities--illiterate slave though she was. It is a
splendid testimonial to her people of this later day that Negro
literature is filled with tributes to Sojourner Truth. She was indeed a
wonderful woman, altogether worthy to be ranked with the noble heroines
of biblical story. From a Negro historian I take the following
restrained account of her:[5]
     Two Negroes, because of their unusual gifts, stood out with great
     prominence in the agitation. These were Sojourner Truth and
     Frederick Douglass. Sojourner Truth was born of slave parents about
     1798 in Ulster County, New York. She remembered vividly in later
     years the cold, wet cellar-room in which slept the slaves of the
     family to which she belonged, and where she was taught by her
     mother to repeat the Lord’s Prayer and to trust in God at all
     times. When in the course of gradual emancipation in New York she
     became legally free in 1827, her master refused to comply with the
     law. She left, but was pursued and found. Rather than have her go
     back, a friend paid for her services for the rest of the year. Then
     came an evening when, searching for one of her children that had
     been stolen and sold, she found herself a homeless wanderer. A
     Quaker family gave her lodging for the night. Subsequently she went
     to New York City, joined a Methodist Church, and worked hard to
     improve her condition. Later, having decided to leave New York for
     a lecturing tour through the East, she made a small bundle of her
     belongings and informed a friend that her name was no longer
     Isabella but Sojourner. She went on her way, lecturing to people
     where she found them assembled and being entertained in many
     aristocratic homes. She was entirely untaught in the schools, but
     she was witty, original, and always suggestive. By her tact and her
     gift of song she kept down ridicule, and by her fervor and faith
     she won many friends for the anti-slavery cause. As to her name she
     said: “And the Lord gave me Sojourner because I was to travel up
     an’ down the land showin’ the people their sins an’ bein’ a sign
     unto them. Afterwards I told the Lord I wanted another name, ’cause
     everybody else had two names, an’ the Lord gave me Truth, because I
     was to declare the truth to the people.”
The poem follows, with the author’s note on the saying of Sojourner
Truth which occasioned it:
ORIFLAMME
     I can remember when I was a little, young girl, how my old mammy
     would sit out of doors in the evenings and look up at the stars and
     groan, and I would say, ‘Mammy, what makes you groan so?’ And she
     would say, ‘I am groaning to think of my poor children; they do not
     know where I be and I don’t know where they be. I look up at the
     stars and they look up at the stars!’--Sojourner Truth.
    I think I see her sitting bowed and black,
      Stricken and seared with slavery’s mortal scars,
    Reft of her children, lonely, anguished, yet
      Still looking at the stars.
    Symbolic mother, we thy myriad sons,
      Pounding our stubborn hearts on Freedom’s bars,
    Clutching our birthright, fight with faces set,
      Still visioning the stars!
“Still visioning the stars”--that is the idealism of the Negro. The soul
of Sojourner Truth goes marching on, star-led.

       <collex:text>CHAPTER V
THE NEW FORMS OF POETRY
The newer methods in poetry--free-verse, rhythmic strophes, polyphonic
prose--have been tried with success by only a few Negroes. Of free-verse
particularly not many noteworthy pieces have come from Negro poets. Well
or ill, each may judge according to his taste. But the objection has
been made that the Negro verse-makers of our time are bound by
tradition, are sophisticated craftsmen. More independence, more
differentness, seems to be demanded. But the conditions of their poetic
activity seem to me in this demand to be lost sight of. They are as much
the heirs of Palgrave’s Golden Treasury as their white contemporaries.
And the Negro is said to be preëminently imitative--that is, responsive
to environing example and influence. One requirement and only one can we
lay upon the Negro singer and that is the same we lay upon the artists
of every race and origin. However, for artistic freedom he has an
authority older than free-verse, and that authority is not outside his
own race. It is found in the old plantation melodies--rich in artistic
potentiality beyond exaggeration.
I. FREE-VERSE
In Negro newspapers and magazines, rarely as yet in books, are to be
found some free-verse productions of which I will give some specimens.
From Will Sexton I shall quote here two brief poems in this form and in
a later chapter another (p. 233). His Whitemanesque manner will be
remarked. These brief pieces will suggest a poet of some force:
_Songs of Contemporary Ethiopia_
THE BOMB THROWER
    Down with everything black!
    Down with law and order!
    Up with the red flag!
    Up with the white South!
    I am America’s evil genius.
THE NEW NEGRO
    Out of the mist I see a new America--a land of ideals.
    I hear the music of my fathers blended with
         the “Stars and Stripes Forever.”
    I am the crown of thorns Tyranny must bear
         a thousand years--
    I am the New Negro.
Another vers-librist of individual quality is Andrea Razafkeriefo. He is
a prolific contributor to _The Negro World_, the newspaper organ of the
Universal Negro Improvement Society. This paper regularly gives a
considerable portion of a page of each issue to original verse
contributions. One of Mr. Razafkeriefo’s recent free-verse poems is the
following, in which the style seems to me to be remarkably effective:
THE NEGRO CHURCH
    That the Negro church possesses
    Extraordinary power,
    That it is the greatest medium
    For influencing our people,
    That it long has slept and faltered,
    Failed to meet its obligations,
    Are, to honest and true thinkers,
    Facts which have to be admitted.
    For these reasons there are many
    Who would have the church awaken
    And adopt the modern methods
    Of all other institutions.
    Make us more enlightened Christians,
    Teach us courtesy and English,
    Racial pride and sanitation,
    Science, thrift and Negro history.
    Yea, the preacher, like the shepherd,
    Should be leader and protector,
    And prepare us for the present
    Just as well as for the future;
    He should know more than Scriptures,
    And should ever be acquainted
    With all vital, daily subjects
    Helpful to his congregation.
    Give us manly, thinking preachers
    And not shouting money-makers,
    Men of intellect and vision,
    Who will really help our people:
    Men who make the church a guide-post
    To the road of racial progress,
    Who will strive to fit the Negro
    For this world as well as heaven.
In another chapter I give one of Mr. Razafkeriefo’s poems in regular
stanzas of the traditional type. It is but just to state that his
productions exhibit a great variety of forms. His moods and traits, too,
are various. There is the evidence of ardent feeling and strong
conviction in most he writes.
[Illustration: LANGSTON HUGHES]
This poet gets his strange name (pronounced rä-zäf-ker-rāf) from the
island of Madagascar. His father, now dead, “falling in battle for
Malagasy freedom,” before the poet’s birth, was a nephew of the late
queen of Madagascar, Ranavalona III. His mother, a colored American, was
a daughter of a United States consul to Madagascar. The poet was born
in the city of Washington in 1895 and now resides in Cleveland, Ohio.
To a young student in Columbia University we are indebted for some of
the most symmetrical and effective free-verse poems that have come to my
attention. His name is Langston Hughes. For information about him I
refer the reader to the first index, at the end of this book. This poem
appeared in _The Crisis_, January, 1922:
THE NEGRO
    I am a Negro:
      Black as the night is black,
    Black like the depths of my Africa.
    I’ve been a slave:
      Cæsar told me to keep his door-steps clean,
    I brushed the boots of Washington.
    I’ve been a worker:
      Under my hand the pyramids arose.
    I made mortar for the Woolworth building.
    I’ve been a singer:
      All the way from Africa to Georgia I carried my sorrow songs.
    I made ragtime.
    I’ve been a victim:
      The Belgians cut off my hands in the Congo.
    They lynch me now in Texas.
    I am a Negro:
      Black as the night is black,
    Black like the depths of my Africa.
Other specimens of free-verse have been given on pages 67, 102, and 119.
In every instance the poet’s choice of this form seems to me justified
by the particular effectiveness of it.
II. PROSE POEMS
_I. W. E. Burghardt DuBois_
[Illustration: W. E. B. DUBOIS]
The name of no Negro author is more widely known than that of W. E.
Burghardt DuBois. Editor, historian, sociologist, essayist, poet--he is
celebrated in the Five Continents and the Seven Seas. It is in his
impassioned prose that DuBois is most a poet. _The Souls of Black Folk_
throbs constantly on the verge of poetry, while the several chapters of
_Darkwater_ end with a litany, chant, or credo, rhapsodical in character
and in free-verse form. In all this work Dr. DuBois is the spokesman of
perhaps as many millions of souls as any man living.
“A Litany at Atlanta,” placed as an epilogue to “The Shadow of the
Years” in _Darkwater_,[6] should be read as the litany of a race. Modern
literature has not such another cry of agony:
A LITANY AT ATLANTA
O Silent God, Thou whose voice afar in mist and mystery hath left our
ears an-hungered in these fearful days--
    _Hear us, good Lord!_
Listen to us, Thy children: our faces dark with doubt are made a mockery
in Thy Sanctuary. With uplifted hands we front Thy Heaven, O God,
crying:
    _We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!_
We are not better than our fellows, Lord; we are but weak and human men.
When our devils do deviltry, curse Thou the doer and the deed,--curse
them as we curse them, do to them all and more than ever they have done
to innocence and weakness, to womanhood and home.
    _Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners!_
And yet, whose is the deeper guilt? Who made these devils? Who nursed
them in crime and fed them on injustice? Who ravished and debauched
their mothers and their grandmothers? Who bought and sold their crime
and waxed fat and rich on public iniquity?
    _Thou knowest, good God!_
Is this Thy Justice, O Father, that guile be easier than innocence and
the innocent be crucified for the guilt of the untouched guilty?
    _Justice, O Judge of men!_
Wherefore do we pray? Is not the God of the Fathers dead? Have not seers
seen in Heaven’s halls Thine hearsed and lifeless form stark amidst the
black and rolling smoke of sin, where all along bow bitter forms of
endless dead?
    _Awake, Thou that steepest!_
Thou art not dead, but flown afar, up hills of endless light, through
blazing corridors of suns, where worlds do swing of good and gentle men,
of women strong and free--far from cozenage, black hypocrisy, and chaste
prostitution of this shameful speck of dust!
    _Turn again, O Lord; leave us not to perish in our sin!_
    From lust of body and lust of blood,--
        _Great God, deliver us!_
    From lust of power and lust of gold,--
        _Great God, deliver us!_
    From the leagued lying of despot and of brute,--
        _Great God, deliver us!_
A city lay in travail, God our Lord, and from her loins sprang twin
Murder and Black Hate. Red was the midnight; clang, crack, and cry of
death and fury filled the air and trembled underneath the stars where
church spires pointed silently to Thee. And all this was to sate the
greed of greedy men who hide behind the veil of vengeance.
    _Bend us Thine ear, O Lord!_
In the pale, still morning we looked upon the deed. We stopped our ears
and held our leaping hands, but they--did they not wag their heads and
leer and cry with bloody jaws: _Cease from Crime!_ The word was mockery,
for thus they train a hundred crimes while we do cure one.
    _Turn again our captivity, O Lord!_
Behold this maimed and broken thing, dear God: it was an humble black
man, who toiled and sweat to save a bit from the pittance paid him. They
told him: _Work and Rise!_ He worked. Did this man sin? Nay, but someone
told how someone said another did--one whom he had never seen nor known.
Yet for that man’s crime this man lieth maimed and murdered, his wife
naked to shame, his children to poverty and evil.
    _Hear us, O Heavenly Father!_
Doth not this justice of hell stink in Thy nostrils, O God? How long
shall the mounting flood of innocent blood roar in Thine ears and pound
in our hearts for vengeance? Pile the pale frenzy of blood-crazed
brutes, who do such deeds, high on Thine Altar, Jehovah Jireh, and burn
it in hell forever and forever!
    _Forgive us, good Lord; we know not what we say!_
Bewildered we are and passion-tossed, mad with the madness of a mobbed
and mocked and murdered people; straining at the armposts of Thy throne,
we raise our shackled hands and charge Thee, God, by the bones of our
stolen fathers, by the tears of our dead mothers, by the very blood of
Thy crucified Christ: What meaneth this? Tell us the plan; give us the
sign.
    _Keep not Thou silent, O God._
Sit not longer blind, Lord God, deaf to our prayer and dumb to our dumb
suffering. Surely Thou, too, art not white, O Lord, a pale, bloodless,
heartless thing!
    _Ah! Christ of all the Pities!_
Forgive the thought! Forgive these wild, blasphemous words! Thou art
still the God of our black fathers and in Thy Soul’s Soul sit some soft
darkenings of the evening, some shadowings of the velvet night.
But whisper--speak--call, great God, for Thy silence is white terror to
our hearts! The way, O God, show us the way and point us the path!
Whither? North is greed and South is blood; within, the coward, and
without, the liar. Whither? To death?
    _Amen! Welcome, dark sleep!_
Whither? To life? But not this life, dear God, not this. Let the cup
pass from us, tempt us not beyond our strength, for there is that
clamoring and clawing within, to whose voice we would not listen, yet
shudder lest we must,--and it is red. Ah! God! It is a red and awful
shape.
    _Selah!_
In yonder East trembles a star.
    _Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord!_
Thy Will, O Lord, be done!
    _Kyrie Eleison!_
Lord, we have done these pleading, wavering words.
    _We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!_
We bow our heads and hearken soft to the sobbing of women and little
children.
    _We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!_
Our voices sink in silence and in night.
    _Hear us, good Lord._
In night, O God of a godless land!
    _Amen!_
In silence, O Silent God.
    _Selah!_
_II. Kelly Miller_
[Illustration: KELLY MILLER]
Dr. Kelly Miller is professor of sociology in Howard University. He has
been professor of mathematics. He is the author of several prose
works--able expositions of aspects of inter-racial problems. It is
rumored that he is a poet. However that may be, his admirable volume of
essays entitled _Out of the House of Bondage_ concludes with a strophic
chant, highly poetical, and poured forth with the fervor of some old
Celtic bard, triumphant in the vision of a new day dawning:
I SEE AND AM SATISFIED
The vision of a scion of a despised and rejected race, the span of whose
life is measured by the years of its Golden Jubilee, and whose fancy,
like the vine that girdles the tree-trunk, runneth both forward and
back.
     I see the African savage as he drinks his palmy wine, and basks in
     the sunshine of his native bliss, and is happy.
     I see the man-catcher, impelled by thirst of gold, as he entraps
     his simple-souled victim in the snares of bondage and death, by use
     of force or guile.
     I see the ocean basin whitened with his bones, and the ocean
     current running red with his blood, amidst the hellish horrors of
     the middle passage.
     I see him laboring for two centuries and a half in unrequited toil,
     making the hillsides of our southland to glow with the snow-white
     fleece of cotton, and the valleys to glisten with the golden
     sheaves of grain.
     I see him silently enduring cruelty and torture indescribable, with
     flesh flinching beneath the sizz of angry whip or quivering under
     the gnaw of the sharp-toothed bloodhound.
     I see a chivalric civilization instinct with dignity, comity and
     grace rising upon pillars supported by his strength and brawny arm.
     I see the swarthy matron lavishing her soul in altruistic devotion
     upon the offspring of her alabaster mistress.
     I see the haughty sons of a haughty race pouring out their lustful
     passion upon black womanhood, filling our land with a bronzed and
     tawny brood.
     I see also the patriarchal solicitude of the kindly-hearted owners
     of men, in whose breast not even iniquitous system could sour the
     milk of human kindness.
     I hear the groans, the sorrows, the sighings, the soul striving of
     these benighted creatures of God, rising up from the low grounds of
     sorrow and reaching the ear of Him Who regardeth man of the
     lowliest estate.
     I strain my ear to supernal sound, and I hear in the secret
     chambers of the Almighty the order to the Captain of Host to break
     his bond and set him free.
     I see Abraham Lincoln, himself a man of sorrows and acquainted with
     grief, arise to execute the high decree.
     I see two hundred thousand black boys in blue baring their breasts
     to the bayonets of the enemy, that their race might have some
     slight part in its own deliverance.
     I see the great Proclamation delivered in the year of my birth of
     which I became the first fruit and beneficiary.
     I see the assassin striking down the great Emancipator; and the
     house of mirth is transformed into the Golgotha of the nation.
     I watch the Congress as it adds to the Constitution new words,
     which make the document a charter of liberty indeed.
     I see the new-made citizen running to and fro in the first fruit of
     his new-found freedom.
     I see him rioting in the flush of privilege which the nation had
     vouchsafed, but destined, alas, not long to last.
     I see him thrust down from the high seat of political power, by
     fraud and force, while the nation looks on in sinister silence and
     acquiescent guilt.
     I see the tide of public feeling run cold and chilly, as the vial
     of racial wrath is wreaked upon his bowed and defenceless head.
     I see his body writhing in the agony of death as his groans issue
     from the crackling flames, while the funeral pyre lights the
     midnight sky with its dismal glare. My heart sinks with heaviness
     within me.
     I see that the path of progress has never taken a straight line,
     but has always been a zigzag course amid the conflicting forces of
     right and wrong, truth and error, justice and injustice, cruelty
     and mercy.
     I see that the great generous American Heart, despite the temporary
     flutter, will finally beat true to the higher human impulse, and my
     soul abounds with reassurance and hope.
     I see his marvelous advance in the rapid acquisition of knowledge
     and acquirement of things material, and attainment in the higher
     pursuits of life, with his face fixed upon that light which shineth
     brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.
     I see him who was once deemed stricken, smitten of God, and
     afflicted, now entering with universal welcome into the patrimony
     of mankind, and I look calmly upon the centuries of blood and tears
     and travail of soul, and am satisfied.
_III. Charles H. Conner_
As a companion piece to this litany and this vision I will present
another vision that for calm, clear beauty of style takes us immediately
back to _Pilgrim’s Progress_. The author calls it a sermonette, and it
is one of three contained in a very small book entitled _The Enchanted
Valley_. But the author is no preacher. He is a ship-yard worker in
Philadelphia--I almost said a “common” worker. But such workmen were
never common, anywhere, at any time. Charles Conner wears the garb and
wields the tools of a common workman, but he has most uncommon visions.
He is a seer and a philosopher. He has informed me that there is
American Indian blood in his veins. From the mystical and philosophical
character of his writings, both prose and verse, I should have expected
an East Indian strain. Twice have I visited his humble habitation, and
each time it was a visit to the Enchanted Valley.
[Illustration: CHARLES H. CONNER]
THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN THE NATURAL WORLD
At the dawning of a day, in a deep valley, a man awoke.
     *       *       *       *       *
It was a valley of treasures that everywhere abounded.
     *       *       *       *       *
He opened his eyes, and beheld the greensward bedecked with many colored
jewels that sparkled in the light.
     *       *       *       *       *
His ears caught the medley of sounds, that awoke innumerable echoes; and
with the balmy air peopled the valley with delights. How he came there,
or why, he knew not; nor scarcely thought or cared.
     *       *       *       *       *
As he gazed upon the multitude of things, in his heart upsprung desire;
and he gathered the treasures that lay around, till his arms were full,
and his body decked in all their bright array.
     *       *       *       *       *
Then the sun went down behind the hill; and the vale grew dark; and the
night air chill; and the place grew solemn, silent, still.
     *       *       *       *       *
A new thing then, to mortal ken, seemed hovering on the threshold near.
A strange, fantastic thing, it crept, intangible, nearer, nearer swept,
the pallid, startling face of Fear!
     *       *       *       *       *
But, the night brings sleep at last--and dreams; and day follows night;
and sunshine follows storm throughout the length of days. But a trace of
the dreams remains, like the faintly clinging scent that marks a hidden
trail; and so, because of his dreams, the man’s desire reached out, and
scaled the lofty peaks that walled him in.
     *       *       *       *       *
His pleasant valley seemed too narrow and confined.
     *       *       *       *       *
So, with his treasures fondly pressed to his beating heart, he tried to
scale the heights.
     *       *       *       *       *
He scrambled and struggled with might and main, slipped and arose; and
fell again and again. The spirit was willing, and valiant, and brave;
but the treasure encumbered it with fatal hold; and held him bound, as
with fold on fold a corpse is held in its lowly grave. So, try as he
might, he could not rise much higher than one’s hands can reach; and one
by one, his gathered treasures lost their brightness and their charm; as
gathered flowers wilt and fade; and his arms weary from the burden that
they bore, let fall and scattered lie, little by little, more and more
of the things he had gathered and vainly prized. And each thing lost was
so much lightness gained, enabling him to mount a little higher up the
rugged steep. And so it was till night was come again at last; and worn
and weary, he sank down to sleep and rest.
     *       *       *       *       *
And, as he slept, his arms relaxed their hold; and down the steep his
dwindling treasures rolled, till the last of them found their natural
level and resting place, the lower stretch of ground. ’Twas then a
strange sight met my gaze, long to be remembered in the coming days of
trial and endeavor.
     *       *       *       *       *
From out that sleeping form a luminous haze arose, airy and white; and
glowed within it an amber fire, as it mounted higher, higher; and, as it
arose, it had the appearance of a man; and its countenance was the
countenance of him that slept. Thus up and up it winged its flight,
until above the highest peak ’twas lost to sight. I pondered the matter
in wonder and awe, until long past the midnight hour, how that a soul
at last gained its longed for power to win the distant height.
     *       *       *       *       *
There is a kingdom of earth, and of water and of air.
     *       *       *       *       *
Each has its own. The heavier cannot rise above its level, to the next
and lighter zone.
     *       *       *       *       *
The treasures of the soul’s desire, were treasures of earth, whose
lightest joys were too heavy and too gross to be sustained in the finer,
rarer atmosphere; and thus were as a leaden weight that anchored the
soul to earth, without its being at all aware that the things it thought
so pleasant and so fair, were shackles to bind it hard and fast; and
make it impossible for it to gain the region that instinctively it felt
and knew was the rightful place of its abode.
_IV. William Edgar Bailey_
Yet one more prose-poem I will give, as a sort of coda to the series. It
is taken from a paper-covered booklet entitled _The Firstling_, by
William Edgar Bailey, from which _The Slump_, on page 65, was taken:
TO A WILD ROSE
The wild rose silently peeps from its uncouth habitation, thrives and
flourishes in its glory; its fragrant bud bows to sip the nectar of the
morning. Its delicate blossom blushes in the balmy breeze as the wind
tells its tale of adoration. Performing well its part, it withers and
decays; the chirping sparrow perches serenely on its boughs, only to
find it wrapped in sadness and solemnity--yet its grief-stained leaf and
weather beaten branches silently chant euphonic choruses in natural
song, in solemn commemoration of its faded splendor.
Dead, yes dead--but in thy hibernal demise dost thou bequeath a truth
eternal as the stars. I saw thee, Rose, when the elf of spring hung thy
floral firstling upon that thorny bower and robed thy ungainly form in a
garb of green, and, Rose, thou wert sweet!
     *       *       *       *       *
I saw the same vernal sprite pay homage to thy highbrowed kinsman in
yonder stench-bestifled dell, and, in his pause of an instant, baptized
its sacred being in the same aromatic blood. I saw thee, Rose, in thy
autumnal desolation, when the Storm-God was wont to do thee harm, laid
waste thy foliage, and cast at thy feet, as a challenge, his mantle of
snow, and the Law of Non-resistance was still unbroken.
     *       *       *       *       *
Tell me thy story, Rose! Do the stars in their unweary watch breathe
forth upon thee a special benediction from the sky? Or did the wind waft
a drop of blood from the Cross to thy dell to sanctify thy being? Oh,
leave me not, thou Redeemer of the Woods, to plod the way alone! My
Nazarene, grant but to me a double portion of thy humble pride--and in
my tearful grief permit thou me to pluck a fragrant thought from thy
thorny bosom!
_V. R. Nathaniel Dett_
Primarily a composer and pianist, Mr. Dett exemplifies the close kinship
of poetry and music, for in the former art as well as in the latter he
exhibits a finely creative spirit. To speak first of his compositions
for the piano, the following works are widely known and greatly admired
by lovers of music: “Magnolia Suite,” “In the Bottoms Suite,” “Listen to
the Lambs,” “Marche Negre,” “Arietta,” “Magic Song,” “Open Yo’ Eyes,”
and “Hampton, My Home by the Sea.” Mr. Dett took a degree in music at
Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and a Harvard prize in music (1920). The
musical endowment for which his race is celebrated is cultured and
refined in him and guided by science. The basis of his brilliant
compositions is to be found in the folk melodies of his people. The
musical genius of his people expresses itself through him with
conscious, perfected art. To sit under the spell of his performance of
his own pieces is to acquire a new idea of the Negro people.
[Illustration: R. NATHANIEL DETT]
The same refined and exalted spirit reveals itself in Mr. Dett’s verse
as in his music. Having this combination of gifts, he cannot but raise
the highest expectations. I present in this place a poem in blank verse
of nobly contemplative mood, suggesting far more, as the best poems do,
than it says:
AT NIAGARA
   --No, no! Not tonight, my Friend,
     I may not, cannot go with you tonight.
     And think not that I love you any less
     Because this now I’d rather be alone.
     My heart is strangely torn; unwonted thoughts
     Have so infused themselves into my mind
     That altogether there is wrought in me
     A sort of hapless mood, whose phantom power
     Born perhaps of my own fantasies
     Has ta’en me. By its subtle spell
     I’m wooed and changed from what’s my natural self.
     I am so possessed I can but wish
     For nothing else save this and solitude.
     If in companionship I sought relief
     Yours indeed would be the first I’d seek.
     There is none other whom I so esteem,
     None who quite so perfect understands.
     Your presence always is a soothing balm,
   --Ne’er failing me when troubled. But tonight,
     Forgive me, Friend--I’d rather be alone.
     Leave me, let me with myself commune.
     Presently if no change come, I shall go
     Stand in the shadowed gorge, or where the moon
     Throws her silver on the rippling stream,
     List to the sounding cataract’s thundering fall,
     Or hark to spirit voices in the wind.
     For methinks sometimes that these strange moods
     Are heaven-sent us by the jealous God
     Who’d thus remind us that no human love
     Can fully satisfy the longing heart:
     Perhaps an intimation sent to souls
     That he would speak somewhat, or nearer draw.
     Therefore I’ll to Him. Talking waters, stars,
     The moon and whispering trees shall make me wise
     In what it is He’d have my spirit know.
     And Nature singing from the earth and sky
     Shall fill me with such peace, that in the morn
     I’ll be the gay glad self you’ve always known.
     Urge me no further, now you understand.
     A nobler friend than you none ever knew--
     But not this time. Tonight I’ll be alone;
     And if from moonlit valley God should speak,
     Or in the tumbling waters sound a call,
     Or whisper in the sighing of the wind,
     He’ll find me with an undivided heart
     Patient waiting to hear; but Friend,--alone.

       <collex:text>CHAPTER VI
            DIALECT VERSE
            The reader of these pages may ask: “But where is the Negro’s humorous
            verse? Here is the pathos, where is the comedy of Negro life?” It may
            also be asked where the dialect verse is, and the dramatic narratives
            and character pieces that made Dunbar famous.
            The present-day Negro poets do not, as has been asserted, spurn dialect.
            Many of them have given a portion of their pages to character pieces in
            dialect, humorous in effect. Whether those who have excluded such pieces
            from their books have done so on principle or not I cannot say. In
            general, however, these writers are too deeply earnest for dialect
            verse, and the “broken tongue” is too suggestive of broken bodies and
            servile souls. But by those who have employed dialect its uses and
            effects have been well understood. Dialect, as is proven by Burns,
            Lowell, Riley, Dunbar, often gets nearer the heart than the language of
            the schools is able to do, and for home-spun philosophy, for mother-wit,
            for folk-lore, and for racial humor, for whatever is quaint and peculiar
            and native in any people, it is the only proper medium. Poets of the
            finest art from Theocritus to Tennyson have so used it. Genius here as
            elsewhere will direct the born poet and instruct him when to use dialect
            and when the language that centuries of tradition have refined and
            standardized and encrusted with poetic associations. There is a world of
            poetic wealth in the strangely naïve heart of the rough-schooled Negro
            for which the smooth-worn, disconsonanted language of the cabin and the
            field is beautifully appropriate. There is also another world of poetic
            wealth in the Negro of culture for which only the language of culture is
            adequate. To such we must say: “All things are yours.”
            While, as remarked, many Negro verse-writers have used dialect
            occasionally, in the ways indicated, Waverley Turner Carmichael has made
            it practically his one instrument of expression in his little book
            entitled _From the Heart of a Folk_. A representative piece is the
            following:
            MAMMY’S BABY SCARED
            Hush now, mammy’s baby scaid,
            Don’ it cry, eat yo’ bread;
            Nothin’ ain’t goin’ bother you,
            Does’, it bothers mammy too.
            Mammy ain’t goin’ left it ’lone
            W’ile de chulen all are gone;
            Hush, now, don’ it cry no mo’e,
            Ain’t goin’ lay it on de flo’.
            Hush now, finish out yo’ nap,
            W’ile I make yo’ luttle cap;
            Blessid luttle sugar-pie,
            Hush now, baby, don’ it cry.
            Mammy’s goin’ to make its dres’,
            Go to sleep an’ take yo’ res’;
            Hush now, don’ it cry no mo’e,
            Ain’t goin’ lay you on de flo’.
            Carmichael was born at Snow Hill, Alabama, and in the Industrial
            Institute there received the rudiments of an education, which was added
            to by a summer term at Harvard. Since the book mentioned I have seen
            nothing from his pen.
            The elder Cotter in _A White Song and a Black Song_ gives us in the
            second part several dialect pieces in the most successful manner.
            Several are satirical, like the following:
            THE DON’T-CARE NEGRO
            Neber min’ what’s in your cran’um
            So your collar’s high an’ true.
            Neber min’ what’s in your pocket
            So de blackin’s on your shoe.
            Neber min’ who keeps you comp’ny
            So he halfs up what he’s tuk.
            Neber min’ what way you’s gwine
            So you’s gwine away from wuk.
            Neber min’ de race’s troubles
            So you profits by dem all.
            Neber min’ your leaders’ stumblin’

            Neber min’ what’s true to-morrow
            So you libes a dream to-day.
            Neber min’ what tax is levied
            So it’s not on craps or play.
            Neber min’ how hard you labors
            So you does it to de en’
            Dat de judge is boun’ to sen’ you
            An’ your record to de “pen.”
            Neber min’ your manhood’s risin’

            Neber min’ whar next you’s gwine to
            So you’s six foot under groun’.
            Raymond Garfield Dandridge in _The Poet and Other Poems_ has included a
            handful of dialect pieces which prove him a master of this species of
            composition. I will select but one to represent this class of his work
            here:
            DE INNAH PART
            I ’fess Ise ugly, big, an’ ruff,
            Mah voice is husky, mannah’s gruff;
            But, mah gal sed, “Neb mine yore hide,
            I jedged you by yore inside side”;
            An’ sed, dat she hab alwuz foun’,

            She claims dat offen rail ruff hides

            W’ile sum dat ’pear “sharp ez a tack”
            Kinceals a heart dat’s hard an’ black;
            An’, to prove her way ob thinkin’,

            Ole “Hones’ Abe,” so lank an’ tall,

            Yet he stood out miles erbove

            An’ in han’lin’ ’fairs of state,

            But, mos’ her time she spent, I know,
            Erpon de parts dat duzen show.
            Two poems by Sterling M. Means, one in standard English and one in
            dialect may well be placed here side by side for comparison as being
            identical in theme and feeling, and differing but in manner. They are
            taken from his book entitled _The Deserted Cabin and Other Poems_:
            THE OLD PLANTATION GRAVE
            ’Tis a scene so sad and lonely,
            ’Tis the site of ancient toil;
            Where our fathers bore their burdens,
            Where they sleep beneath the soil;
            And the fields are waste and barren,
            Where the sugar cane did grow,
            Where they tilled the corn and cotton,
            In the years of long ago;
            And along the piney hillside,
            Where the hound pursued the slave,
            In the dreary years of bondage,
            There he fills an humble grave.
            THE OLD DESERTED CABIN
            Dis ole deserted cabin
            Remin’s me ob de past;
            An’ when I gits ter t’inkin’,
            De tears comes t’ick an’ fast.
            I wunner whur’s A’nt Doshy,
            I wunner whur’s Brur Jim;
            I hyeahs no corn-songs ringin’,
            I hyeahs no Gospel hymn.
            Dis ole deserted cabin
            Am tumblin’ in decay;
            An’ all its ole-time dwellers
            Hab gone de silent way.
            Dey voices hushed in silence,
            De cabin drear an’ lone;
            An’ dey who used ter lib hyeah
            Long sense is dead an’ gone.
            J. Mord Allen’s poems and tales in dialect are worthy of distinction.
            They are executed in the true spirit of art. I should rank his book,
            elsewhere named, as one of the few best the Negro has contributed to
            literature. I will give here one specimen of his dialect verse:
            A VICTIM OF MICROBES
            NOTE.--Physicians are agreed that laziness is a microbe disease.
            Go en fetch er lawyer, ’Tilda,
            ’Kaze I wants ter make mah will;
            Neenter min’ erbout de doctor--
            ’Tain’t no use ter take er pill.--
            Chunk up de kitchen fire,
            En fetch mah easy-ch’er,
            En put er piller in it:
            Maybe I’ll git better hyeah.
            I done hyeahed de doctor say it--de doctor hisse’f said it--
            I’m plumb chock full o’ microbes en mah time’s ercomin’ quick.
            So, ’stid o’ up en fussin’ wid me fer bein’ lazy,
            Yer’d better be er nussin’ me, ’kaze I’m jes’ mighty sick.
            I ’spec’ I must er cotch it
            Back in Tennessee;
            ’Kaze, fur ez I kin ’member,
            I wuz bad ez I could be--
            P’intly hated hoein’ ’taters--
            Couldn’t chop er stick o’ wood--
            Couldn’t pick er sack o’ cotton--
            Never wuz er lick o’ good.
            En de folks dey called me lazy--my own mammy called me lazy
            When, ’stid o’ gwine plowin’, I wuz fishin’ in de creek;
            Took en tole de white folks ’bout it, en made er heap o’ trouble,
            En all fer want o’ medersun--me bein’ mighty sick.
            So, now yer knows de reason
            Why I’m always loafin’ ’roun’,
            When jobs is runnin’ after men
            In ev’y part o’ town.
            Dar’s patches on mah breeches,
            En you’s er sight ter see;
            Dat’s de work o’ dem same microbes,
            En it kain’t be laid on me.
            ’Kaze de doctor he explained it, en de doctor’s book explained it,
            En some Latin words explained it, en explained it mighty quick--
            It’s mah lights er else mah liver, er maybe, its mah stomach--
            It’s somep’n in mah insides, en it sho’ has made me sick.
            En so, I hope yer’ll git yerse’f
            Er washin’, now, er two,
            Er get er job o’ scrubbin’
            Er somp’n else ter do;
            ’Kaze dat doctor p’intly showed me
            So I couldn’t he’p but tell
            Dat dem microbes got me han’ en foot
            En I jes’ kain’t git well.
            Darfo’ I hope yer’ll he’p me ter pass mah las’ days easy,
            En keep er fire in de stove en somep’n in de pan.
            I know it’s hard ter do it, en I’m sorry I kain’t he’p yer;
            But me ’n de doctor bofe knows I’m er mighty sick man.
            James Weldon Johnson entitled a section of his book _Jingles and
            Croons_. Among these pieces, so disparagingly designated, are to be
            found some of the best dialect writing in the whole range of Negro
            literature. Every quality of excellence is there. The one piece I give
            is perhaps not above the average of a score in his book:
            MY LADY’S LIPS AM LIKE DE HONEY
            (Negro Love Song)
            Breeze a-sighin’ and a-blowin’,
            Southern summer night.
            Stars a-gleamin’ and a-glowin’,
            Moon jus shinin’ right.
            Strollin’, like all lovers do,
            Down de lane wid Lindy Lou;
            Honey on her lips to waste;
            ’Speck I’m gwine to steal a taste.
            Oh, ma lady’s lips am like de honey,
            Ma lady’s lips am like de rose;
            An’ I’m jes like de little bee a-buzzin’
            ’Round de flowers wha’ de nectah grows.
            Ma lady’s lips dey smile so temptin’,
            Ma lady’s teeth so white dey shine,
            Oh, ma lady’s lips so tantalizin’,
            Ma lady’s lips so close to mine.
            Bird a-whistlin’ and a-swayin’
            In de live-oak tree;
            Seems to me he keeps a-sayin’,
            “Kiss dat gal fo’ me.”
            Look heah, Mister Mockin’ Bird,
            Gwine to take you at yo’ word;
            If I meets ma Waterloo,
            Gwine to blame it all on you.
            Oh, ma lady’s lips am like de honey,
            Ma lady’s lips am like de rose;
            An’ I’m jes like de little bee a-buzzin’
            ’Round de flowers wha’ de nectah grows.
            Ma lady’s lips dey smile so temptin’,
            Ma lady’s teeth so white dey shine,
            Oh, ma lady’s lips so tantalizin’,
            Ma lady’s lips so close to mine.
            Honey in de rose, I ’spose, is
            Put der fo’ de bee;
            Honey on her lips, I knows, is
            Put der jes fo’ me.
            Seen a sparkle in her eye,
            Heard her heave a little sigh;
            Felt her kinder squeeze mah han’,
            ’Nuff to make me understan’.
            Numerous other writers would furnish quite as good specimens of
            dialectical verse as those given. This medium of artistic expression is
            not being neglected, it is only made secondary and, as it were,
            incidental. By perhaps half of the poets it is not used. With a few, and
            they of no little talent, it is the main medium. Among this few,
            Carmichael has been named; S. Jonathan Clark, of Dublin, Mississippi,
            and Theodore Henry Shackelford, of Jamaica Plains, New York, are others.
            [Illustration: THEODORE HENRY SHACKELFORD]
            Shackelford, with little schooling, displays a versatility of talent.
            His own pen has illustrated with interesting realistic sketches his book
            entitled _My Country and Other Poems_, and for some of his lyrics he has
            written music. A large proportion of his pieces are in dialect, much in
            the spirit of Dunbar. His best productions in standard English are
            ballads. He tells a tale in verse with Wordsworthian simplicity and
            feeling. Mr. Clark is a school principal, with the education that
            implies. He has not yet published a book.

THE POETRY OF PROTEST
[Illustration: EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL
(Photograph of a panel of the Carl Schurz Monument)]
As elsewhere intimated there is being produced in America a literature
of which America, as the term is commonly understood, is not aware. It
is a literature of protest--protest sometimes pathetic and prayerful,
sometimes vehement and bitter. It comes from Negro writers, in prose and
verse, in the various forms of fiction, drama, essay, editorial, and
lyric. It is only with the lyric form that we are here concerned. Of
that we shall make a special presentation, in this chapter.
An artistic and restrained expression of the protest against irrational
color prejudice, in the plaintive, pathetic key, is found in the
following free-verse poem by Winston Allen:
THE BLACK VIOLINIST
    I touched the violin,
    I, whose hand was black,
    I touched the violin
    In a grand salon.
    I touched the violin
    In a Russian palace.
    I touched the violin
    And the dream-born strains
    Chanted by the Congo
    Soared to Heaven’s chambers.
    Could I touch the violin?
    I, whose hand was black?
    And bring to life dream music?
    Men had taunted me,
    Age-worn months: their jeers
    Snapped to bits my heartstrings,
    Snapped my inner soul;
    And the sting of living
    Tortured me the livelong day.
Sometimes the protest runs in a lighter vein--as thus, in verses
entitled:
OLD JIM CROW
    Wherever we live, it’s right to forgive,
      It’s wrong to hold malice, we know,
    But there’s one thing that’s true, from all points of view,
      All Negroes hate old man Jim Crow.
    His home is in hell; he loves here to dwell;
      We meet him wherever we go;
    In all public places, where live both the races,
      You’ll always see Mr. Jim Crow.
    Be we well educated, even to genius related,
      We may have a big pile of dough,
    That cuts not a figger, you still are a nigger,
      And that is the law with Jim Crow.
            _The Nashville Eye._
But the Negro is seldom humorous these days on the subject of racial
discriminations. Occasionally, in dialect verse, he still makes merry
with the foibles or over-accentuated traits of certain types of the
Negro. In general, however, the Negro verse-smith goes to his work with
a grim aspect. He is there to smite. Sometimes the anvil clangs, more
mightily than musically. But there is precedent.
A stanza each from two poems somewhat intense will serve to show the
character of much verse in Negro newspapers. The first is from verses
entitled “Sympathy,” by Tilford Jones:
    Mourn for the thousands slain,
    The youthful and the strong;
    Mourn for the last; but pray,
    For those hung by the mobbing throng.
    Pray to our God above,
    To break the fell destroyer’s sway,
    And show His saving love.
The second is the last stanza of a poem entitled _Shall Race Hatred
Prevail?_ by Adeline Carter Watson.
    By the tears of Negro mothers,
    By the woes of Negro wives,
    By the sighs of Negro children,
    By your gallant snuffed-out lives,
    By the throne of God eternal;
    Standing hard by Heaven’s gate,
    Ye shall crush this cursed, infernal,
    Western stigma: groundless hate!
The following two poems have a world of pathos for every reflecting
person, in the unanswered question of each. The first is by Mrs. Georgia
Douglas Johnson:
TO MY SON
    Shall I say, “My son, you are branded in this country’s pageantry,
    Foully tethered, bound forever, and no forum makes you free?”
    Shall I mark the young light fading through your soul-enchanneled eye,
    As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of your sky?
    Or shall I with love prophetic bid you dauntlessly arise,
    Spurn the handicap that binds you, taking what the world denies?
    Bid you storm the sullen fortress built by prejudice and wrong,
    With a faith that shall not falter in your heart and on your tongue!
The second is by Will Sexton:
TO MY LOST CHILD
    It is well, child of my heart, the rosebush drops
         its petals on your grave.
    It is well, child of my heart, the sparrow sings to
         you when Aurora has rouged the sky.
    In your trundle bed deep in the bosom of the earth
         you can dream pleasanter dreams than I.
    You have never felt the sting of living in a white
         man’s civilization and beneath a white man’s laws.
    You have never been forced to dance to the music of
         hate played by an idle orchestra.
    You have never toiled long hours and bowed and
         scraped for the chance to breathe.
    In your dreams you wonder in the Heaven beyond the
         skies with the God civilization rebukes.
    Tell me, little child, are you not happy in that
         realm no white man can enter?
In much of this utterance of protest, this arraignment of the white
man’s civilization that rebukes God, there may be more passion than
poesy. But out of such passion, as it were a rumbling of thunder, the
lightning will one day leap. A poet born and reared in South Carolina,
Joshua Henry Jones, Jr., appeals from man’s inhumanities to God’s
prevailing power in passionate stanzas of which this is the first, the
rest being like:
    They’ve lynched a man in Dixie.
      O God, behold the crime.
    And midst the mad mob’s howling
      How sweet the church bells chime!
    They’ve lynched a man in Dixie.
      You say this cannot be?
    See where his lead-torn body
      Mute hangs from yonder tree.
This or a similar lynching provoked the following lines from another,
Walter Everette Hawkins, in a poem entitled _A Festival in Christendom_.
After relating that the white people of a certain community were on
their way to church on the Sabbath day, the poem continues:
    And so this Christian mob did turn
    From prayer to rob, to lynch and burn.
    A victim helplessly he fell
    To tortures truly kin to hell;
    They bound him fast and strung him high,
    They cut him down lest he should die
    Before their energy was spent
    In torturing to their heart’s content.
    They tore his flesh and broke his bones,
    And laughed in triumph at his groans;
    They chopped his fingers, clipped his ears
    And passed them round as souvenirs.
    They bored hot irons in his side
    And reveled in their zeal and pride;
    They cut his quivering flesh away
    And danced and sang as Christians may;
    Then from his side they tore his heart
    And watched its quivering fibres dart.
    And then upon his mangled frame
    They piled the wood, the oil and flame.
    Lest there be left one of his creed,
    One to perpetuate his breed;
    Lest there be one to bear his name
    Or build the stock from which he came,
    They dragged his bride up to the pyre
    And plunged her headlong in the fire,
    Full-freighted with an unborn child,
    Hot embers on her form they piled.
    And they raised a Sabbath song,
    The echo sounded wild and strong,
    A benediction to the skies
    That crowned the human sacrifice.
Few are the poets quoted or mentioned in this volume who have not
contributed to this literature of protest. James Weldon Johnson, whose
predominant motive is artistic creation, affords more than one poem in
which the note of protest is sounded in pathos. Pathos is indeed the
characteristic note of the great body of Negro verse. Aided by the two
preceding extracts to an understanding of Johnson’s point of view, the
reader will appreciate the following poem, remarkable for that restraint
which adds to the potency of art:
THE BLACK MAMMY
    O whitened head entwined with turban gay,
    O kind black face, O crude, but tender hand,
    O foster-mother in whose arms there lay
    The race whose sons are masters of the land!
    It was thine arms that sheltered in their fold,
    It was thine eyes that followed through the length
    Of infant days these sons. In times of old
    It was thy breast that nourished them to strength.
    So often hast thou to thy bosom pressed
    The golden head, the face and brow of snow;
    So often has it ’gainst thy broad, dark breast
    Lain, set off like a quickened cameo.
    Thou simple soul, as cuddling down that babe
    With thy sweet croon, so plaintive and so wild,
    Came ne’er the thought to thee, swift like a stab,
    That it some day might crush thine own black child?
There died in Fort McHenry hospital, February, 2, 1921, a soldier-poet
of the Negro race, who had been called “the poet laureate of the New
Negro,” his name Lucian B. Watkins. He deserved the title, whatever may
be the exact definition of “the New Negro.” For in his lyrics, of many
forms, racial consciousness reached a degree of intensity to which only
a disciplined sense of art set a limit.--He was born in a cabin at
Chesterfield, Virginia, struggled in the usual way for the rudiments of
book-knowledge, became a teacher, then a soldier. His health was wrecked
in the World War. He died before his powers were matured.--Short and
simple are the annals of the poet. Before one of his intenser race poems
I shall give his last lyric cry, uttered but a few days before his
lingering death:
[Illustration: LUCIAN B. WATKINS]
    My fallen star has spent its light
        And left but memory to me;
    My day of dream has kissed the night
        Farewell, its sun no more I see;
    My summer bloomed for winter’s frost:
        Alas, I’ve lived and loved and lost!
    What matters it to-day should earth
        Lay on my head a gold-bright crown
    Lit with the gems of royal worth
        Befitting well a king’s renown?--
    My lonely soul is trouble-tossed,
        For I have lived and loved and lost.
    Great God! I dare not question Thee--
        Thy way eternally is just;
    This seeming mystery to me
        Will be revealed, if I but trust;
    Ah, Thou alone dost know the cost
        When one has lived and loved and lost.
The following sonnet, entitled “The New Negro,” will serve to represent
much of Watkins’s verse:
    He thinks in black. His God is but the same
    John saw--with hair “like wool” and eyes “as fire”--
    Who makes the visions for which men aspire.
    His kin is Jesus and the Christ who came
    Humbly to earth and wrought His hallowed aim
    ’Midst human scorn. Pure is his heart’s desire;
    His life’s religion lifts; his faith leads higher.
    Love is his Church, and Union is its name.
    Lo, he has learned his own immortal rôle
    In this momentous drama of the hour;
    Has read aright the heavens’ Scriptural scroll
    ’Bove ancient wrong--long boasting in its tower.
    Ah, he has sensed the truth. Deep in his soul
    He feels the manly majesty of power.
The protest not infrequently takes the form of entreaty and appeal,
sometimes the form of an invocation of divine wrath upon the doers of
evil. The following poem from Watkins, unique and effective in form and
biblical phrasing, is the kind of appeal that will not out of the mind:
A MESSAGE TO THE MODERN PHARAOHS
    (Loose him and let him go--John 11.44)
    “Loose him!”--this man on whom you plod
    Beneath your heel hate-iron-shod;
    His silent sorrow troubles God--
          “Let him go!”
    There will be plagues, wars will not cease,--
    There cannot be a lasting peace
    Until this being you release--
          “Let him go!”
    Each doomful kingdom--throne and crown--
    Built on the lowly fettered down,
    Shall perish--lo, the heavens frown--
          “Let him go!”
    Naught but a name is Liberty,
    Naught but a name--Democracy,
    Till love has made each mortal free--
          “Let him go!”
    “Loose him!” He has his part to play
    In Life’s Great Drama, day by day,--
    He has his mission, God’s own way,--
          “Let him go!”
    “Loose him!” ’Twill be your master rôle,
    ’Twill be your triumph and your goal:
    ’Twill be the saving of your soul--
          “Let him go!”
Mr. Hawkins, whom I have quoted, entitled his book _Chords and
Discords_. What did he mean by “discords”? Perhaps a disparagement of
his muse’s efforts at music. Perhaps, and rather, something in the
content, for the contrasts are sharp, the tones are piercing. These
“discords” abound in contemporary Negro verse. Between the octave and
the sestet of the following sonnet, by Mrs. Carrie W. Clifford, the
discord is of the kind that stabs you:
AN EASTER MESSAGE
    Now quivering to life, all nature thrills
    At the approach of that triumphant queen,
    Pink-fingered Easter, trailing robes of green
    Tunefully o’er the flower-embroidered hills,
    Her hair perfumed of myriad daffodils:
    Upon her swelling bosom now are seen
    The dream-frail lilies with their snowy sheen,
    As lightly she o’erleaps the spring-time rills.
    To black folk choked within the deadly grasp
    Of racial hate, what message does she bring
    Of resurrection and the hope of spring?
    Assurance their death-stupor is a mask--
    A sleep, with elements potential, rife,
    Ready to burst full-flowered into life.
The Negro’s deep resentment of his wrongs has found its most artistic
expression in the verse of a poet who came to us from Jamaica--Mr.
Claude McKay. In another chapter I have given the reader an opportunity
to judge of his merits. He will be represented here by a sonnet,
written, I believe, shortly after the race-riot in the national capital,
July, 1919. It has been widely reprinted in the Negro newspapers.
IF WE MUST DIE
    If we must die, let it not be like hogs
      Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,
    While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
      Making their mock at our accursed lot.
    If we must die--oh, let us nobly die,
      So that our precious blood may not be shed
    In vain; then even the monsters we defy
      Shall be constrained to honor us, though dead!
    Oh, kinsmen! We must meet the common foe;
      Though far outnumbered, let us still be brave,
    And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow.
      What though before us lies the open grave?
    Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,
      Pressed to the wall, dying, but--fighting back!
Race consciousness has recently attained an extraordinary pitch in the
Negro, and there seems to be no prospect of any abatement. The
verse-smiths one and all have borne witness to a feeling of great
intensity on all subjects pertaining to their race--the discriminations
and injustices practised against it, the limitations that would be
imposed upon it, the contumelies that would offend it. Ardent appeals
are therefore made to race pride and ardent exhortations to race unity.
The ancient rôle of the poet whereby he is identified with the prophet
is being resumed by the enkindled souls of black men. With their natural
gift for music and eloquence, with their increasing culture, with their
building up of a poetic tradition now in process, with this
intensification of race consciousness, almost anything may be expected
of the Negro in another generation.

       <collex:text>It is now five years since James Weldon Johnson edited with a brilliant essay on "The Negro's Creative Genius" in The Book of American Negro Poetry, four years since the publication of Robert T. Kerlin’s Negro Poets and Their Poems, and three years since from the Trinity College Press in Durham, North Carolina, came An Anthology of Verse by American Negroes, edited by Newman Ivey White and Walter Clinton Jackson. The student of verse by American Negro poets will find in these three anthologies comprehensive treatment of the work of Negro poets from Phyllis Wheatley, the first American Negro known to have composed verses, to writers of the present day. With Mr. Johnson 's scholarly and painstaking survey, from both a historical and a critical standpoint, of the entire range of verse by American Negroes, and with Professor Kerlin 's inclusions of excerpts from the work of most of those Negro poets whose poems were extant at the time of his compilation, there would be scant reason for the assembling and publication of another such collection were it not for the new voices that within the past three to five years have sung so significantly as to make imperative an anthology recording some snatches of their songs. To those intelligently familiar with what is popularly termed the renaissance in art and literature by Negroes, it will not be taken as a sentimentally risky observation to contend that the recent yearly contests conducted by Negro magazines, such as Opportunity and The Crisis, as well as a growing tendency on the part of white editors to give impartial consideration to the work of Negro writers, have awakened to a happy articulation many young Negro poets who had thitherto lisped only in isolated places in solitary numbers. It is primarily to give them a concerted bearing that this collection has been published. For most of these poets the publication of individual volumes of their poems is not an immediate issue. However, many of their poems during these four or five years of accentuated interest in the artistic development of the race have become familiar to a large and ever-widening circle of readers who, we feel, will welcome a volume marshaling what would otherwise remain for some time a miscellany of deeply appreciated but scattered verse.
            
            The place of poetry in the cultural development of a race or people has always been one of importance; indeed, poets are prone, with many good reasons for their conceit, to hold their art the most important. Thus while essentially wishing to draw the public ear to the work of the younger Negro poets, there have been included with their poems those of modern Negro poets already established and acknowledged, by virtue of their seniority and published books, as worthy practitioners of their art. There were Negro poets before Paul Laurence Dunbar, but his uniquity as the first Negro to attain to and maintain a distinguished place among American poets, a place fairly merited by the most acceptable standards of criticism, makes him the pivotal poet of this volume.
            
            I have called this collection an anthology of verse by Negro poets rather than an anthology of Negro verse, since this latter designation would be more confusing than accurate. Negro poetry, it seems to me, in the sense that we speak of Russian, French, or Chinese poetry, must emanate from some country other than this in some language other than our own. Moreover, the attempt to corral the outbursts of the ebony muse into some definite mold to which all poetry by Negroes will conform seems altogether futile and aside from the facts. This country's Negro writers may here and there turn some singular facet toward the literary sun, but in the main, since theirs is also the heritage of the English language, their work will not present any serious aberration from the poetic tendencies of their times. The conservatives, the middlers, and the arch heretics will be found among them as among the white poets; and to say that the pulse beat of their verse shows generally such a fever, or the symptoms of such an ague, will prove on closer examination merely the moment's exaggeration of a physician anxious to establish a new literary ailment. As heretical as it may sound, there is the probability that Negro poets, dependent as they are on the English language, may have more to gain from the rich background of English and American poetry than from any nebulous atavistic yearnings toward an African inheritance. Some of the poets herein represented will eventually find inclusion in any discriminatingly ordered anthology of American verse, and there will be no reason for giving such selections the needless distinction of a separate section marked Negro verse.
            
            While I do not feel that the work of these writers conforms to anything that can be called the Negro school of poetry, neither do I feel that their work is varied to the point of being sensational; rather is theirs a variety within a uniformity that is trying to maintain the higher traditions of English verse. I trust the selections here presented bear out this contention. The poet writes out of his experience, whether it be personal or vicarious, and as these experiences differ among other poets, so do they differ among Negro poets; for the double obligation of being both Negro and American is not so unified as we are often led to believe. A survey of the work of Negro poets will show that the individual diversifying ego transcends the synthesizing hue. From the roots of varied experiences have flowered the dialect of Dunbar, the recent sermon poems of James Weldon Johnson, and some of Helene Johnson's more colloquial verses, which, differing essentially only in a few expressions peculiar to Negro slang, are worthy counterparts of verses done by John V. A. Weaver "in American." Attempt to hedge all these in with a name, and your imagination must deny the facts. Langston Hughes, poetizing the blues in his zeal to represent the Negro masses, and Sterling Brown, combining a similar interest in such poems as "Long Gone" and "The Odyssey of Big Boy" with a capacity for turning a neat sonnet according to the rules, represent differences as unique as those between Burns and Whitman. Jessie Fauset with Cornell University and training at the Sorbonne as her intellectual equipment surely justifies the very subjects and forms of her poems: "Touché," "La Vie C'est la Vie," "Noblesse Oblige," etc.; while Lewis Alexander, with no known degree from the University of Tokyo, is equally within the province of his creative prerogatives in composing Japanese hokkus and tankas. Although Anne Spencer lives in Lynchburg, Virginia, and in her biographical note recognizes the Negro as the great American taboo, I have seen but two poems by her which are even remotely concerned with this subject; rather does she write with a cool precision that calls forth comparison with Amy Lowell and the influence of a rock-bound seacoast. And Lula Lowe Weeden, the youngest poet in the volume, living in the same Southern city, is too young to realize that she is colored in an environment calculated to impress her daily with the knowledge of this pigmentary anomaly.
            
            There are lights and shades of difference even in their methods of decrying race injustices, where these peculiar experiences of Negro life cannot be overlooked. Claude McKay is most exercised, rebellious, and vituperative to a degree that clouds his lyricism in many instances, but silhouettes most forcibly his high dudgeon; while neither Arna Bontemps, at all times cool, calm, and intensely religious, nor Georgia Douglas Johnson, in many instances bearing up bravely under comparison with Sara Teasdale, takes advantage of the numerous opportunities offered them for rhymed polemics.
            
            If dialect is missed in this collection, it is enough to state that the day of dialect as far as Negro poets are concerned is in the decline. Added to the fact that these poets are out of contact with this fast-dying medium, certain sociological considerations and the natural limitations of dialect for poetic expression militate against its use even as a tour de force. In a day when artificiality is so vigorously condemned, the Negro poet would be foolish indeed to turn to dialect. The majority of present-day poems in dialect are the efforts of white poets. 
            This anthology, by no means offered asthe anthology of verse by Negro poets, is but a prelude, we hope, to that fuller symphony which Negro poets will in time contribute to the national literature, and we shall be sadly disappointed if the next few years do not find this collection entirely outmoded.
            The biographical notices carried with these poems have been written by the poets themselves save in three cases (Dunbar's having been written by his wife, the younger Cotter's by his father, and Lula Weeden's by her mother), and if they do not reveal to a curious public all it might wish to know about the poets, they at least reveal all that the poets deem necessary and discreet for the public to know.

       <collex:text>[Biographical note by Alice Dunbar-Nelson:]
            Paul LAURENCE DUNBAR. Born, Dayton, Ohio, June 27, 1872. Educated in public schools, and graduated from Dayton High School, where he achieved some distinction. Editor of school paper, and noted as a versifier, from his grammar-school days. Printed his first book, Oak and
            Ivy, in 1893.
            Two friends of his early manhood helped most to shape his career, and to encourage him in his days of struggle--- Dr. H. A. Tobey, the celebrated alienist of Toledo, Ohio, and Frederick Douglass. The former helped him to bring his second book, Majors and Minors, before the public; the latter, with whom he was associated in the Negro Building at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, was the hero of the poet's dreams, the one to whom he dedicated two of his
            most serious poems.
            Although Dunbar is remembered largely for his dialect verse, it was never his intention to concentrate on dialect. His poems in pure English constitute the greater bulk of his verse, and that to which he was most passionately devoted. The tragedy of his life was that the world “turned to praise the jingle in a broken tongue." His friendship for Booker Washington and a visit to Tuskegee inspired him to write the Tuskegee School Song, which is sung to the tune of “Fair Harvard.”
            The famous criticism of Majors and Minors by William Dean Howells in Harper's Weekly, June 27, 1897 established Dunbar's prestige as an important figure in American literature. From that time his success was assured. He was married to Alice Ruth Moore of New Orleans, &amp; teacher in Brooklyn, N. Y., in March, 1898.
            He was as indefatigable a writer of prose as of poetry; short stories, novels, criticism, essays and some short plays poured from his pen. His published works, exclusive of. the two volumes of verse mentioned above, are: Lyrics of Lowly Life, Lyrics of the Hearthside, Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow; several smaller volumes, illustrated editions of poems in the preceding volumes; short stories, Folks from Dixie, The Strength of Gideon; novels, The Uncalled, The Fanatics, The Love of Landry, The Sport of the Gods.
            He died in Dayton, Ohio, February 9, 1906.

       <collex:text>ERE SLEEP COMES DOWN TO SOOTHE THE WEARY EYES
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            Which all the day with ceaseless care have sought
            The magic gold which from the seeker flies;
            Ere dreams put on the gown and cap of thought,
            And make the waking world a world of lies,—
            Of lies most palpable, uncouth, forlorn,
            That say life's full of aches and tears and sighs,—
            Oh, how with more than dreams the soul is torn,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            Now all the griefs and heartaches we have known
            Come up like pois'nous vapors that arise
            From some base witch's caldron, when the crone,
            To work some potent spell, her magic plies.
            The past which held its share of bitter pain,
            Whose ghost we prayed that Time might exorcise,
            Comes up, is lived and suffered o'er again,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            What phantoms fill the dimly lighted room;
            What ghostly shades in awe-creating guise
            Are bodied forth within the teeming gloom.
            What echoes great of sad and soul-sick cries,
            And pangs of vague inexplicable pain
            That pay the spirit's ceaseless enterprise,
            Come thronging through the chambers of the brain,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            Where ranges forth the spirit far and free?
            Through what strange realms and unfamiliar skies
            Tends her far course to lands of mystery?
            To lands unspeakable—beyond surmise,
            Where shapes unknowable to being spring,
            Till, faint of wing, the Fancy fails and dies
            Much wearied with the spirit's journeying,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes.
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes,
            Now questioneth the soul that other soul—
            The inner sense which neither cheats nor lies,
            But self exposes unto self, a scroll
            Full writ with all life's acts unwise or wise,
            In characters indelible and known;
            So, trembling with the shock of sad surprise,
            The soul doth view its awful self alone,
            Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes
            When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes,
            The last dear sleep whose soft embrace is balm,
            And whom sad sorrow teaches us to prize
            For kissing all our passions into calm,
            Ah, then, no more we heed the sad world's cries,
            Or seek to probe th' eternal mystery,
            Or fret our souls at long-withheld replies,
            At glooms through which our visions cannot see,
            When sleep comes down to seal the weary eyes.

       <collex:text>  So we, who 've supped the self-same cup,
            To-night must lay our friendship by;
            Your wrath has burned your judgment up,
            Hot breath has blown the ashes high.
            You say that you are wronged--ah, well,
            I count that friendship poor, at best
            A bauble, a mere bagatelle,
            That cannot stand so slight a test.
            I fain would still have been your friend,
            And talked and laughed and loved with you;
            But since it must, why, let it end;
            The false but dies, 't is not the true.
            So we are favored, you and I,
            Who only want the living truth.
            It was not good to nurse the lie;
            'T is well it died in harmless youth.
            I go from you to-night to sleep.
            Why, what's the odds? why should I grieve?
            I have no fund of tears to weep
            For happenings that undeceive.
            The days shall come, the days shall go
            Just as they came and went before.
            The sun shall shine, the streams shall flow
            Though you and I are friends no more.
            And in the volume of my years,
            Where all my thoughts and acts shall be,
            The page whereon your name appears
            Shall be forever sealed to me.
            Not that I hate you over-much,
            'T is less of hate than love defied;
            Howe'er, our hands no more shall touch,
            We 'll go our ways, the world is wide.

            I look far out into the pregnant night,
            Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
            And catch the gleaming of a random light,
            That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.
            My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
            For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
            I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
            My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
            And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.
            O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
            O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
            Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
            That I may sight and check that speeding bark
            Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?

            We wear the mask that grins and lies,
            It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--
            This debt we pay to human guile;
            With torn and bleeding hearts we smile
            And mouth with myriad subtleties,
            Why should the world be over-wise.
            In counting all our tears and sighs?
            Nay, let them only see us, while
            We wear the mask.
            We smile, but oh great Christ, our cries
            To thee from tortured souls arise.
            We sing, but oh the clay is vile
            Beneath our feet, and long the mile,
            But let the world dream otherwise,
            We wear the mask!

            Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
            For he must fly back to his perch and cling
            When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
            And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
            And they pulse again with a keener sting--
            I know why he beats his wing!
            I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
            When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
            When he beats his bars and he would be free;
            It is not a carol of joy or glee,
            But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
            But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
            I know why the caged bird sings!

            Just for one riotous day,
            Years of regret and grief,
            Sorrow without relief.
            Pay it I will to the end--
            Until the grave, my friend,
            Gives me a true release--
            Gives me the clasp of peace.
            Slight was the thing I bought,
            Small was the debt I thought,
            Poor was the loan at best--
            God! but the interest!

       <collex:text>"I was born in Nelson County, Ky., February 2nd, 1861, on a farm owned by my great grandfather, Daniel Stapp, a tanner. In 1829 he bought himself and a part of his master's farm. Later he bought his daughter, Lucinda, my mother's mother.
            Martha, my mother, was born on a nearby farm owned by her English-Indian father, Fleming Vaughan. Prior to my birth she lived in Bardstown and was a servant at “My Old Kentucky Home.” She took me to Bardstown soon after my birth and brought me to Louisville in my fourth week, and here I have lived ever since. I attended a private school and could read before my fourth year. Conditions were such that my attendance at school was very irregular. I quit school in my eighth year, having completed the third grade, and did not return until my twenty-second year.
            During this time I picked up rags in the streets and worked in tobacco factories and brick-yards. My nineteenth year found me a distiller in one of the largest distilleries in Kentucky. A turn of fortune made me a teamster. I hauled cotton and tobacco and made up my mind to enter the prize ring. Another turn of fortune put me into a Louisville public night school. Here I began in the third grade where I left off in my eighth year.
            At the end of two school sessions of five months each I was promoted to the high school. I keep this diploma under lock and key, for it is the only one I have ever received.
            The man who turned my attention from prize-fighting to night school and then to school teaching, and who discovered my knack for writing verses, was Dr. W. T. Peyton of Louisville. He was my greatest benefactor. My talent of whatever kind comes from Martha, my mother. She was poet, story-teller, dramatist and musician. My published works are: A Rhyming, Links of Friendship, Caleb, the Degenerate, a poetic drama, A White Song And A Black One and Negro Tales. My unpublished works are: Life's Dawn And Dusk, poems, Caesar
            Driftwood and Other One Act Plays and My Mother And Her Family.

       <collex:text>Awarded Third Prize--Opportunity Contest (1926)
            There was a man
            —Whose name was Pete,
            And he was a buck
            —From his head to his feet.
            He loved a dollar,
            —But hated a dime;
            And so was poor
            —Nine-tenths of the time.
            The Judge said “Pete,
            —What of your wife?”
            And Pete replied
            —“She lost her life.”
            “Pete,” said the Judge,
            —“Was it lost in a row?
            Tell me quick,
            —And tell me how.”
            Pete straightened up
            —With a hic and a sigh,
            Then looked the Judge
            —Full in the eye.
            “O, Judge, my wife
            —Would never go
            To a Sunday dance
            —Or a movie show.
            “But I went, Judge,
            —Both day and night,
            And came home broke
            —And also tight.
            “The moon was up,
            —My purse was down,
            And I was the bully
            —Of the bootleg town.
            “I was crooning a lilt
            —To corn and rye
            For the loop in my legs
            —And the fight in my eye.
            “I met my wife;
            —She was wearing a frown,
            And catechising
            —Her Sunday gown.
            “ ‘O Pete, O Pete’
            —She cried aloud,
            ‘The Devil is falling
            —Right out of a cloud.’
            “I looked straight up
            —And fell flat down
            And a Ford machine
            —Pinned my head to the ground.
            “The Ford moved on,
            —And my wife was in it;
            And I was sober,
            —That very minute.
            “For my head was bleeding,
            —My heart was a-flutter;
            And the moonshine within me
            —Was tipping the gutter.
            “The Ford, it faster
            —And faster sped
            Till it dipped and swerved
            —And my wife was dead.
            “Two bruised men lay
            —In a hospital ward—
            One seeking vengeance,
            —The other the Lord.
            “He said to me:
            —‘Your wife was drunk,
            You are crazy,
            —And my Ford is junk.’
            “I raised my knife
            —And drove it in
            At the top of his head
            —And the point of his chin.
            “O Judge, O Judge,
            —If the State has a chair,
            Please bind me in it
            —And roast me there.”
            There was a man
            —Whose name was Pete,
            And he welcomed death
            —From his head to his feet.

       <collex:text>A FANCY halts my feet at the way-side well.
            It is not to drink, for they say the water is brackish.
            It is not to tryst, for a heart at the mile's end beckons me on.
            It is not to rest, for what feet could be weary when a heart at the mile's end keeps time with their tread?
            It is not to muse, for the heart at the mile's end is food for my being.
            I will question the well for my secret by dropping a pebble into it.
            Ah, it is dry.
            Strike lightning to the road, my feet, for hearts are like wells.
            You may not know they are dry 'til you question their depths.
            Fancies clog the way to Heaven, and saints miss their crown.

       <collex:text>JAMES WELDON JOHNSON was born in Jacksonville, Fla. He graduated from Atlanta University with the degree of A. B., and he received the degree of A. M. from the same University in 1904. He spent three years in graduate work at Columbia University in the City of New York. The honorary degree of Litt.D. was conferred upon him by Talladega College, Talladega, Ala., in 1917, and by Howard University in 1923.
            For several years Mr. Johnson was principal of the colored high school at Jacksonville. He was admitted to the Florida bar in 1897, and practiced law in Jacksonville, until 1901, when he moved to New York to collaborate with his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, in writing for the
            light opera stage.
            In 1906, he was appointed United States Consul at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, being transferred as Consul to Corinto, Nicaragua, in 1909. While in Corinto, he looked after the interests of his country during the stormy days of revolution which resulted in the downfall of Zelaya, and through the abortive revolution against Diaz. His knowledge of Spanish has been put to use in the translation of a number of Spanish plays. He was the translator for the English libretto of Goyescas, the Spanish grand opera produced by the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1915.
            Mr. Johnson was for ten years the Contributing Editor of the New York Age. He added to his distinction as a newspaper writer by winning in an editorial contest one of three prizes offered by the Philadelphia Public Ledger in 1916. His poems have appeared in the Century, the Independent, the Crisis and other publications. In the spring of 1920, Mr. Johnson was sent by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to the black republic of Haiti, where he made an investigation of U. S. misrule. The charges which Mr. Johnson published in The Nation, of New York, upon his return were taken up by Senator Harding, and as a consequence a Naval Board of Inquiry was sent to Haiti and a Congressional Investigation promised. The articles published in The Nation have since been republished in a pamphlet entitled, “Self-Determining Haiti.” Mr. Johnson is Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a member of the Board of Directors of the American Fund for Public Service (The Garland Fund), and a trustee of Atlanta University.
            Mr. Johnson's works include:
            The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man
            Fifty Years and Other Poems English Libretto of “Goyescas"
            The Book of American Negro Poetry

       <collex:text>  Three students once tarried over the Rhine,
            And into Frau Wirthin's turned to dine.
            "Say, hostess, have you good beer and wine?
            And where is that pretty daughter of thine?"
            "My beer and wine is fresh and clear.
            My daughter lies on her funeral bier."
            They softly tipped into the room;
            She lay there in the silent gloom.
            The first the white cloth gently raised,
            And tearfully upon her gazed.
            "If thou wert alive, O, lovely maid,
            My heart at thy feet would to-day be laid!"
            The second covered her face again,
            And turned away with grief and pain.
            "Ah, thou upon thy snow-white bier!
            And I have loved thee so many a year."
            The third drew back again the veil,
            And kissed the lips so cold and pale.
            "I've loved thee always, I love thee to-day,
            And will love thee, yes, forever and aye!"

            The beauty of the night was in her eyes.
            And over all her loveliness, the grace
            Of Morning blushing in the early skies.
            And in her voice, the calling of the dove;
            Like music of a sweet, melodious part.
            And in her smile, the breaking light of love;
            And all the gentle virtues in her heart.
            And now the glorious day, the beauteous night,
            The birds that signal to their mates at dawn,
            To my dull ears, to my tear-blinded sight
            Are one with all the dead, since she is gone.

       <collex:text>O BROTHERS mine, take care! Take care!    
            The great white witch rides out to-night.    
            Trust not your prowess nor your strength,    
            Your only safety lies in flight;    
            For in her glance there is a snare,            
            And in her smile there is a blight.    
            
            The great white witch you have not seen?    
            Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,    
            Like nursery children you have looked    
            For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;            
            But no, not so; the witch appears    
            In all the glowing charms of youth.    
            
            Her lips are like carnations, red,    
            Her face like new-born lilies, fair,    
            Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,            
            She moves with subtle grace and air,    
            And all about her head there floats    
            The golden glory of her hair.    
            
            But though she always thus appears    
            In form of youth and mood of mirth,            
            Unnumbered centuries are hers,    
            The infant planets saw her birth;    
            The child of throbbing Life is she,    
            Twin sister to the greedy earth.    
            
            And back behind those smiling lips,            
            And down within those laughing eyes,    
            And underneath the soft caress    
            Of hand and voice and purring sighs,    
            The shadow of the panther lurks,    
            The spirit of the vampire lies.            
            
            For I have seen the great white witch,    
            And she has led me to her lair,    
            And I have kissed her red, red lips    
            And cruel face so white and fair;    
            Around me she has twined her arms,            
            And bound me with her yellow hair.    
            
            I felt those red lips burn and sear    
            My body like a living coal;    
            Obeyed the power of those eyes    
            As the needle trembles to the pole;            
            And did not care although I felt    
            The strength go ebbing from my soul.    
            
            Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,    
            And heard your laughter loud and gay,    
            And in your voices she has caught            
            The echo of a far-off day,    
            When man was closer to the earth;    
            And she has marked you for her prey.    
            
            She feels the old Antaean strength    
            In you, the great dynamic beat            
            Of primal passions, and she sees    
            In you the last besieged retreat    
            Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,    
            Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.    
            
            O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!            
            The great white witch rides out to-night.    
            O, younger brothers mine, beware!    
            Look not upon her beauty bright;    
            For in her glance there is a snare,    
            And in her smile there is a blight.

       <collex:text>When I come down to sleep death's endless night,
            The threshold of the unknown dark to cross,
            What to me then will be the keenest loss,
            When this bright world blurs on my fading sight?
            Will it be that no more I shall see the trees
            Or smell the flowers or hear the singing birds
            Or watch the flashing streams or patient herds?
            No, I am sure it will be none of these.
            But, ah! Manhattan's sights and sounds, her smells,
            Her crowds, her throbbing force, the thrill that comes
            From being of her a part, her subtle spells,
            Her shining towers, her avenues, her slums—
            O God! the stark, unutterable pity,
            To be dead, and never again behold my city!

       <collex:text>I was born in Massachusetts and educated in her schools, at Fisk University, at Harvard and Berlin. My first published writings were news notes in The New York Age. Then I had an article in The Atlantic Monthly and in 1896 my doctor's thesis on the slave trade was published as my first book. The Souls of Black Folk appeared in 1903 and one or two other books thereafter. I taught at Wilberforce, Pennsylvania and Atlanta and became editor of The Crisis in 1910.

            Upon a dead man's brow;
            And that was long ago,--

       <collex:text>FATHER John's bread was made of rye,
            Felicite's bread was white;
            Father John loved the sun noon-high,
            Felicite, the moon at night.
            Father John drank wine with his bread;
            Felicite drank sweet milk;
            Father John loved flowers, pungent and red;
            Felicite, lilies soft as silk.
            Father John's soul was made of bronze,
            That God's salt was corroding;
            Felicite's soul was a wind that runs
            With a blue flame of foreboding.
            Between these two was the shadow of a dome
            That cut their lives in twain;
            But Dionysus led them home
            In a chariot of pain.

            Bade all her subject Days the past had known
            Arise and say what thing gave them renown
            Unforgetable, ‘Rising from the sea,
            I gave the Genoese his dreams to be;'
            'I saw the Corsican's Guards swept down;'
            'Colonies I made free from a tyrant's crown;
            So each Day told its immortality.
            And with these blazing triumphs spoke one voice
            Whose wistful speech no vaunting did employ:
            'I know not if 'twere by Fate's chance or choice
            I hold the lowly birth of an English boy;
            I only know he made man's heart rejoice
            Because he played with Beauty for a toy!'

            Stood upon a flaming star,
            Stood and let his feet hang down
            Till in China the toes turned brown.
            And he reached his fingers over
            The rim of the sea, like sails from Dover,
            And caught a Mandarin at prayer,
            And tickled his nose in Orion's hair.
            The sun went down through crimson bars,
            And left his blind face battered with stars---
            But the brown toes in China kept
            Hot the tears Del Cascar wept.

       <collex:text>James Edward McCall was born September 2, 1880 at Montgomery, Ala., and received his early education in the public schools of that city. Graduating from the Alabama State Normal in 1900 he entered Howard University as a medical student the same year, but some months later was forced to abandon his medical career, following an attack of typhoid fever leading to total blindness. Undaunted by this misfortune, he at once set out to develop his literary talent. During this period he read and studied much through the eyes of others, also writing many poems, a number of which were published in Southern dailies, the New York World and other periodicals. The Montgomery (Alabama) Advertiser styled him "The Blind Tom of Literature.” One of his poems, “Meditation," has been compared to Bryant's “Thanatopsis."
            Despite his handicap, McCall determined to acquire a college education. Accompanied by his sister, he entered Albion College (Michigan) in 1905, where he was graduated two years later, being the only sightless student in the college. Returning to his natal city, he took up journalistic work, for some years being employed as a special writer for one of the local white dailies, also contributing to other periodicals, and ultimately publishing at Montgomery a successful race weekly--The Emancipator. This blind writer is ably assisted in his journalistic work by his wife, to whom he was married in 1914. He and his family moved to Detroit in 1920. He is city editor and editorial writer for the Detroit Independent, his editorials in this publication having been widely read and re-published throughout the country during the past two years.

       <collex:text>He scans the world with calm and fearless eyes,
            Conscious within of powers long since forgot;
            At every step, new man-made barriers rise
            To bar his progress—but he heeds them not.
            He stands erect, though tempests round him crash,
            Though thunder bursts and billows surge and roll;
            He laughs and forges on, while lightnings flash
            Along the rocky pathway to his goal.
            Impassive as a Sphinx, he stares ahead—
            Foresees new empires rise and old ones fall;
            While caste-mad nations lust for blood to shed,
            He sees God's finger writing on the wall.
            With soul awakened, wise and strong he stands,
            Holding his destiny within his hands.

       <collex:text>HUSHED BY THE HANDS OF SLEEP
            (To Dr. George F. Grant)
            Ι
            HUSHED by the hands of Sleep,
            By the beautiful hands of Sleep.
            Very gentle and quiet he lies,
            With a little smile of sweet surprise,
            Just softly hushed at lips and eyes,
            Hushed by the hands of Sleep,
            By the beautiful hands of Sleep.
            II
            Hushed by the hands of Sleep,
            By the beautiful hands of Sleep.
            Death leaned down as his eyes grew dim,
            And his face, I know, was not strange, not grim,
            But oh! it was beautiful to him,
            Hushed by the hands of Sleep,
            By the beautiful hands of Sleep.

            And the green of little leaves ?

            Is not each blade of grass a mothering green finger,
            Hushing the heart that beats and beats and beats?

       <collex:text>THE EYES OF MY REGRET
            ALWAYS at dusk, the same tearless experience,
            The same dragging of feet up the same well-worn path
            To the same well-worn rock;
            The same crimson or gold dropping away of the sun,
            The same tints-rose, saffron, violet, lavender, grey,
            Meeting, mingling, mixing mistily;
            Before me the same blue black cedar rising jaggedly to a point;
            Over it, the same slow unlidding of twin stars,
            Two eyes unfathomable, soul-searing,
            Watching, watching—watching me;
            The same two eyes that draw me forth, against my will dusk after dusk;
            The same two eyes that keep me sitting late into the night, chin on knees,
            Keep me there lonely, rigid, tearless, numbly miserable,
            —The eyes of my Regret.

            WE Ask for peace. We, at the bound
            O life, are weary of the round
            In search of Truth. We know the quest
            Is not for us, the vision blest
            Is meant for other eyes. Uncrowned,
            We go, with heads bowed to the ground,
            And old hands, gnarled and hard and browned.
            Let us forget the past unrest,-
            We ask for peace.
            Our strainéd ears are deaf,—no sound
            May reach them more; no sight may wound
            Our worn-out eyes. We gave our best,
            And, while we totter down the West,
            Unto that last, that open mound,-
            We ask for peace.

       <collex:text>'Tis queer, it is, the ways o’men,
            Their comin's and their goin's;
            For there's the grey road,
            The straight road
            With the grey dust liftin'
            With ev'ry step
            And the little roads off-flingin'.
            Maybe it's a bit of a sly field
            That crooks a finger to them
            And sends them to the turnin';
            Or the round firm bosom
            Of a little hill
            Acallin' to them, them with their heads
            That heavy;
            Or maybe it's the black look
            Given out of the tail of the eye;
            Or a white word, wingin’;
            Maybe it's only the back of a little tot's neck
            In the sunlight;
            Or the red lips of a woman
            Parting slow. ...
            Sure there's no tellin'.
            One I saw goin' towards a white star
            At the edge of a daffydill sky,
            Its lights kissin' straight into his eyes.
            Maybe it's a gold piece
            To be taken from another
            In the dark;
            Or the neat place between the ribs
            Waitin' for the knife
            That one comes after carryin' for it.
            'Tis few, it is, that goes with the grey road
            The straight road
            All the way,
            With the grey dust liftin' at ev'ry step.
            'Tis queer, it is, the ways o' men,
            With a level look at you, or a crooked
            As they be passin'.
            Pouf!
            Sure, 'tis so fast they're goin',
            Does it matter about the turnin's?

            THERE is a tree, by day,
            That, at night,
            Has a shadow,
            A hand huge and black,
            With fingers long and black.
            All through the dark,
            Against the white man's house,
            In the little wind,
            The black hand plucks and plucks
            At the bricks.
            The bricks are the color of blood and very small.
            Is it a black hand,
            Or is it a shadow?

            A mantle of witching grace,
            When the smile and the tear of the young child year
            Dimple across its face,
            And then flee, when the wind all day is sweet
            With the breath of growing things,
            When the wooing bird lights on restless feet
            And chirrups and trills and sings
            To his lady-love
            In the green above,
            Then oh! my dear, when the youth's in the year,
            Yours is the face that I long to have near,
            Yours is the face, my dear.
            But the green is hiding your curls, my dear,
            Your curls so shining and sweet;
            And the gold-hearted daisies this many a year
            Have bloomed and bloomed at your feet,
            And the little birds just above your head
            With their voices hushed, my dear,
            For you have sung and have prayed and have pled
            This many, many a year.
            And the blossoms fall,
            On the garden wall,
            And drift like snow on the green below.
            But the sharp thorn grows
            On the budding rose,
            And my heart no more leaps at the sunset glow.
            For oh! my dear, when the youth's in the year,
            Yours is the face that I long to have near,
            Yours is the face, my dear.

       <collex:text>A MONA LISA
            1.
            I SHOULD like to creep
            Through the long brown grasses
            That are your lashes;
            I should like to poise
            On the very brink
            Of the leaf-brown pools
            That are your shadowed eyes;
            I should like to cleave
            Without sound,
            Their glimmering waters,
            Their unrippled waters,
            I should like to sink down
            And down
            And down ....
            And deeply drown.
            2. 
            Would I be more than a bubble breaking?
            Or an ever-widening circle
            Ceasing at the marge?
            Would my white bones
            Be the only white bones
            Wavering back and forth, back and forth
            In their depths?

       <collex:text>PARADOX
            WHEN face to face we stand
            And eye to eye,
            How far apart we are —
            As far, they say, as God can ever be
            From what, they say, is Hell.
            But, when we stand
            Fronting the other,
            Mile after mile slipping in between,
            O, close we are,
            As close as is the shadow to the body,
            As breath, to life, ........
            As kisses are to love.

            They are big hands, firm hands, gentle hands;
            Hair grows on the back near the wrist ....
            I have seen the nails broken and stained
            From hard work.
            And yet, when you touch me,
            I grow small ....... and quiet ......
            ......... And happy ........
            If I might only grow small enough
            To curl up into the hollow of your palm,
            Your left palm,
            Curl up, lie close and cling,
            So that I might know myself always there,
            ....... Even if you forgot.

            SOMETIMES it seems as though some puppet player
            A clenched claw cupping a craggy chin,
            Sits just beyond the border of our seeing,
            Twitching the strings with slow sardonic grin.

       <collex:text>A WINTER TWILIGHT
            A SILENCE slipping around like death,
            Yet chased by a whisper, a sigh, a breath;
            One group of trees, lean, naked and cold,
            Inking their crests 'gainst a sky green-gold;
            One path that knows where the corn flowers were;
            Lonely, apart, unyielding, one fir;
            And over it softly leaning down,
            One star that I loved ere the fields went brown.

       <collex:text>From Lynchburg, Va., where she lives, Anne Spencer writes, “Mother Nature, February, forty-five years ago forced me on the stage that I, in turn, might assume the rôle of lonely child, happy wife, perplexed mother-and, so far, a twice resentful grandmother. I have no academic honors, nor lodge regalia. I am a Christian by intention, a Methodist by inheritance, and a Baptist by marriage. I write about some of the things I love. But have no civilized articulation for the things I hate. I proudly love being a Negro woman-its so involved and interesting. We are the PROBLEM—the great national game of TABOO.”

            And my heart from hence
            Is closed to friendship,
            Nor the gods' knees hold but one;
            He watches with me thru the long night,
            And when I call he comes,
            Or when he calls I am there;
            He does not ask me how beloved
            Are my husband and children,
            Nor ever do I require
            Details of life and love
            In the grave---his home,---
            We are such friends.

       <collex:text>SUBSTITUTION
            Is LIFE itself but many ways of thought,
            Does thinking furl the poets' pleiades,
            Is in His slightest convolution wrought
            These mantled worlds and their men-freighted seas?
            He thinks—and being comes to ardent things:
            The splendor of the day-spent sun, love's birth,
            Or dreams a little, while creation swings
            The circle of His mind and Time's full girth ...
            As here within this noisy peopled room
            My thought leans forward ... quick! you're lifted clear
            Of brick and frame to moonlit garden bloom,–
            Absurdly easy, now, our walking, dear,
            Talking, my leaning close to touch your face ...
            His All-Mind bids us keep this sacred place!

            Let me learn now where Beauty is ;
            My day is spent too far toward night
            To wander aimlessly and miss her place;
            To grope, eyes shut, and fingers touching space.
            Her maidens I have known, seen durance beside,
            Handmaidens to the Queen, whose duty bids
            Them lie and lure afield their Vestal's acolyte,
            Lest a human shake the throne, lest a god should know his might:
            Nereid, daughter of the Trident, steering in her shell,
            Paused in voyage, smile beguiling, tempted and I fell;
            Spiteful dryads, sport forsaking, tossing birchen wreathes,
            Left the Druidic priests they teased so
            In the oaken trees, crying, “Ho a mortal! here a believer!"
            Bound me, she who held the sceptre, stricken by her, ah, deceiver ..
            But let me learn now where Beauty is;
            I was born to know her mysteries,
            And needing wisdom I must go in vain:
            Being sworn bring to some hither land,
            Leaf from her brow, light from her torchéd hand.

       <collex:text>LIFE-LONG, POOR BROWNING..
            LIFE-LONG, poor Browning never knew Virginia,
            Or he'd not grieved in Florence for April sallies
            Back to English gardens after Euclid's linear:
            Clipt yews, Pomander Walks, and pleachéd alleys;
            Primroses, prim indeed, in quite ordered hedges,
            Waterways, soberly, sedately enchanneled,
            No thin riotous blade even among the sedges,
            All the wild country-side tamely impaneled ...
            Dead, now, dear Browning, lives on in heaven,--
            (Heaven's Virginia when the year's at its Spring)
            He's haunting the byways of wine-aired leaven
            And throating the notes of the wildings on wing;
            Here canopied reaches of dogwood and hazel,
            Beech tree and redbud fine-laced in vines,
            Fleet clapping rills by lush fern and basil,
            Drain blue hills to lowlands scented with pines...
            Think you he meets in this tender green sweetness
            Shade that was Elizabeth ... immortal completeness!

            Just what the villagers lusted for
            To claim her one of their own;
            Fallen but once the lower felt she,
            So turned her face and died,
            With never a hounding fool to see
            'Twas a star-lance in her side!

       <collex:text>CREED 
            IF MY garden oak spares one bare ledge
            For a boughed mistletoe to grow and wedge;
            And all the wild birds this year should know
            I cherish their freedom to come and go;
            If a battered worthless dog, masterless, alone,
            Slinks to my heels, sure of bed and bone;
            And the boy just moved in, deigns a glance-assay,
            Turns his pockets inside out, calls, “Come and play!”
            If I should surprise in the eyes of my friend
            That the deed was my favor he'd let me lend;
            Or hear it repeated from a foe I despise,
            That I whom he hated was chary of lies;
            If a pilgrim stranger, fainting and poor,
            Followed an urge and rapped at my door,
            And my husband loves me till death puts apart,
            Less as flesh unto flesh, more as heart unto heart:
            I may challenge God when we meet That Day,
            And He dare not be silent or send me away.

       <collex:text>LINES TO A NASTURTIUM
            (A lover muses)
            FLAME-FLOWER, Day-torch, Mauna Loa,
            I saw a daring bee, today, pause, and soar,
            Into your flaming heart;
            Then did I hear crisp, crinkled laughter
            As the furies after tore him apart?
            A bird, next, small and humming,
            Looked into your startled depths and fled. ....
            Surely, some dread sight, and dafter
            Than human eyes as mine can see,
            Set the stricken air waves drumming
            In his flight.
            Day-torch, Flame-flower, cool-hot Beauty,
            I cannot see, I cannot hear your flutey
            Voice lure your loving swain,
            But I know one other to whom you are in beauty
            Born in vain:
            Hair like the setting sun,
            Her eyes a rising star,
            Motions gracious as reeds by Babylon, bar
            All your competing;
            Hands like, how like, brown lilies sweet,
            Cloth of gold were fair enough to touch her feet ...
            Ah, how the sense floods at my repeating,
            As once in her fire-lit heart I felt the furies
            Beating, beating.

       <collex:text>AT THE CARNIVAL
            Gay little Girl-of-the-Diving-Tank,
            I desire a name for you,
            Nice, as a right glove fits;
            For you—who amid the malodorous
            Mechanics of this unlovely thing,
            Are darling of spirit and form.
            I know you-a glance, and what you are
            Sits-by-the-fire in my heart.
            My Limousine-Lady knows you, or
            Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark
            Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile?
            Guilt pins a fig-leaf; Innocence is its own adorning.
            The bull-necked man knows you—this first time
            His itching flesh sees form divine and vibrant health,
            And thinks not of his avocation.
            I came incuriously,
            Set on no diversion save that my mind
            Might safely nurse its brood of misdeeds
            In the presence of a blind crowd.
            The color of life was gray.
            Everywhere the setting seemed right
            For my mood!
            Here the sausage and garlic booth
            Sent unholy incense skyward;
            There a quivering female-thing
            Gestured assignations, and lied
            To call it dancing;
            There, too, were games of chance
            With chances for none;
            But oh! the Girl-of-the-Tank, at last!
            Gleaming Girl, how intimately pure and free
            The gaze you send the crowd,
            As though you know the dearth of beauty
            In its sordid life.
            We need you—my Limousine-Lady,
            The bull-necked man, and I.
            Seeing you here brave and water-clean,
            Leaven for the heavy ones of earth,
            I am swift to feel that what makes
            The plodder glad is good; and
            Whatever is good is God.
            The wonder is that you are here;
            I have seen the queer in queer places,
            But never before a heaven-fed
            Naiad of the Carnival-Tank!
            Little Diver, Destiny for you,
            Like as for me, is shod in silence;
            Years may seep into your soul
            The bacilli of the usual and the expedient;
            I implore Neptune to claim his child to-day!

       <collex:text>(The Dew-drier)
            It is a custom in some parts of Africa for travelers into the jungles to send before them in the early morning little African boys called “Dew-driers” to brush with their bodies the dew from the high grasses—and be, perchance, the first to meet the leopard’s or hyena’s challenge—and so open the road. “Human Brooms,” Dan Crawford calls them.
            Brother to the firefly—
            For as the firefly lights the night
            So lights he the morning—
            Bathed in the dank dews as he goes forth
            Through heavy menace and mystery
            Of half-waking tropic dawns,
            Behold a little black boy, a naked black boy,
            Sweeping aside with his slight frame
            Night’s pregnant tears,
            And making a morning path to the light
            For the tropic traveler!
            Bathed in the blood of battle,
            Treading toward a new morning,
            May not his race—its body long bared to the world’s disdain,
            Its face schooled to smile for a light to come—
            May not his race, even as the dew-boy leads,
            Bear onward the world toward a new day-dawn
            When tolerance, forgiveness,
            Such as reigned in the heart of One
            Whose heart was gold,
            Shall shape the earth for that fresh dawning
            After the dews of blood?

            OH, THE blue blue bloom
            On the velvet cheek
            Of the little pansy's face
            That hides away so still and cool
            In some soft garden place!
            The tiger lily's orange fires,
            The red lights from the rose
            Aren't like the gloom on that blue cheek
            Of the softest flower that grows!

       <collex:text>Sassafras Tea
            The sass’fras tea is red and clear
            In my white china cup,
            So pretty I keep peeping in
            Before I drink it up.
            I stir it with a silver spoon,
            And sometimes I just hold
            A little tea inside the spoon,
            Like it was lined with gold.
            It makes me hungry just to smell
            The nice hot sass’fras tea,
            And that's one thing I really like
            That they say's good for me.

       <collex:text>SKY PICTURES
            SOMETIMES a right white mountain
            Or great soft polar bear,
            Or lazy little flocks of sheep
            Move on in the blue air.
            The mountains tear themselves like floss,
            The bears all melt away.
            The little sheep will drift apart
            In such a sudden way.
            And then new sheep and mountains come.
            New polar bears appear
            And roll and tumble on again
            Up in the skies so clear.
            The polar bears would like to get
            Where polar bears belong.
            The mountains try so hard to stand
            In one place firm and strong.
            The little sheep all want to stop
            And pasture in the sky,
            But never can these things be done,
            Although they try and try!

       <collex:text>THE QUILT
            I HAVE the greatest fun at night,
            When casement windows are all bright.
            I make believe each one's a square
            Of some great quilt up in the air.
            The blocks of gold have black between,
            Wherever only night is seen.
            It surely makes a mammoth quilt-
            With bits of dark and checks of gilt-
            To cover up the tired day
            In such a cozy sort of way.

       <collex:text>THE BAKER'S BOY
            The baker's boy delivers loaves
            All up and down our street.
            His car is white, his clothes are white,
            White to his very feet.
            I wonder if he stays that way.
            I don't see how he does all day.
            I'd like to watch him going home
            When all the loaves are out.
            His clothes must look quite different then,
            At least I have no doubt.

            He never seems to bother.
            He looks at mother and just smiles.
            All this seems strange to me,
            For when he plays with grown-up folks,
            He beats them easily.

       <collex:text>JOHN FREDERICK MATHEUS
            "I was born September 10, 1887, in Keyser, West Virginia. My early education was received in Steubenville, Ohio, my mother's home. I was graduated from High School in 1905. For one year thereafter I was bookkeeper and helper in a plumbing shop. Proceeding to Cleveland, Ohio, I entered Adelbert College of Western Reserve University. In 1910 I won the A.B. degree cum laude and a wife.
            I lived for a time in Philadelphia then began service in the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College at Tallahassee, as teacher, first of Mathematics, then of Latin and English. Later I became Professor of Romance Languages. During the war and after, I served as the college auditor and secretary.
            In 1921 I received the M.A. Degree from Columbia University and the Teachers College Diploma as teacher of French. In 1922 I became professor of Romance Languages in the West Virginia Collegiate Institute, Institute, West Virginia. In 1924 I traveled in Cuba; in 1925 I studied at the University of Paris during the summer and toured Switzerland, Italy and southern France.
            My interest in letters began early in grammar school days. The daily papers of my home town used to print my puerile efforts when copy ran low.
            Recently I have been the recipient of prizes and mention in the three annual Opportunity Literary Contests and in the 1926 Crisis contest, for short stories, personal sketches, a play and poems. The 1925 Opportunity prize story 'Fog' is published in the New Negro, edited by Alain Locke.”

            She wears, my beloved, a rose upon her head.
            Walk softly angels, lest your gentle tread
            Awake her to the turmoil and the strife,
            The dissonance and hates called life.
            She sleeps, my beloved, a rose upon her head.
            Who says she will not hear, that she is dead?
            The rose will fade and lose its lovely hue,
            But not, my beloved, will fading wither you.

       <collex:text>FENTON JOHNSON
            "I CAME into the world May 7, 1888. No notice was taken of the event save in immediate circles. I presume the world was too busy or preoccupied to note it. It happened in Chicago. I went to school and also college. My scholastic record never attained me any notoriety.
            Taught school one year and repented. Having scribbled since the age of nine, had some plays produced on the stage of the old Pekin Theatre, Chicago, at the time I was nineteen. When I was twenty-four my first volume A Little Dreaming was published. Since then Visions of the Dusk (1915) and Songs of the Soil (1916) represent my own collections of my work. Also published a volume of short stories Tales of Darkest America and a group of essays on American politics For the Highest Good.
            Work in poetry appears in the following anthologies: The New Poetry (Monroe and Henderson), Victory (Braithwaite), Others (Kreymborg), The Chicago Anthology (Blanden), Anthology of Magazine Verse (Braithwaite), Poetry by American Negroes (White and Jackson), Negro Poets and their Poetry (Kerlin), Poets of America (Wood), Book of American Negro Poetry (J. W. Johnson), Today's Poetry (Crawford and O'Neil) and others. Edited two or three magazines and published one or two of them myself.
            My complete autobiography I promise to the world when I am able to realize that I have done something."

            When I die my song shall be,
            Crooning of the summer breeze;
            When I die my shroud shall be,
            Leaves plucked from the maple trees;
            On a couch as green as moss
            And a bed as soft as down,
            I shall sleep and dream my dream
            Of a poet's laurel crown.
            II
            When I die my star shall drop
            Singing like a nightingale;
            When I die my soul shall rise,
            Where the lyre strings never fail;
            In the rose my blood shall lie,
            In the violet the smile,
            And the moonbeams thousand strong,
            Past my grave each night shall file.

       <collex:text>PUCK GOES TO COURT
            I WENT to court last night,
            Before me firefly light;
            And there was Lady Mab,
            On cheek a cunning dab
            Of rouge the sun sent down,
            King Oberon with crown
            Of gold eyed daisy buds
            Among potato spuds
            Was dancing roundelay
            With Lady Chloe and May.
            I hid among the flowers
            And spent the wee young hours
            In mixing up the punch;
            For I was on a hunch
            That sober men are dull
            And fairy dust will lull
            To rest the plodding mind
            Worn down by life's thick grind.
            The nobles drank the brew
            And called it sweetest dew;
            But when I left they lay
            Stunned by the light of day
            And Oberon had writ
            Decree that I must flit
            A hundred leagues from court.
            (Alas! Where is there sport?)

       <collex:text>The Marathon Runner 
            IF I have run my course and seek the pearls
            My Psyche fain would drink at Mermelon
            And rest content in wine and nectar cup
            Who knows but that the gods have found me whole
            And in their stewardship of man would bless
            The sweating lover fickle man once knew?
            I know that I might pull the tendon bands
            That hold my soul together-ay, might bend
            Each nerve and muscle spirit fain would keep
            That I might hear the maddening cheers of men
            Who when the morrow dawns forget the games
            And cast instead the dice in market place.
            But I have found sweeter peace than fame;
            And in the evening dwell on heights divine,
            Betwixt my lips a rose from Cupid's hands,
            Upon my brow the laurel Belvidere
            Entwines from tree beside the throne of Zeus
            And flowing from my speech Athene's words
            Dipped long in wisdom's fount to heal the soul.

       <collex:text>"PHILADELPHIA where I was born and educated was once the dear delight of my heart. But everything in my life has contrived to pull me away from it. First I travelled to Cornell University and came back with a Phi Beta Kappa key and a degree of Bachelor of Arts. That launched me. Since then I've seen England, Scotland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Algeria. The College de France and the Alliance Francaise have given me some points on the difference between the French of Stratford-atte-Bowe and that of Paris. And there was a pleasant year too at the University of Pennsylvania when I renewed my acquaintance with Philadelphia and earned a Master's Degree. So much for education.
            As to occupations I've taught Latin and French in the Dunbar High School in Washington, D. C. And served as Literary Editor on The Crisis in New York. Wonderful days those! Now I'm teaching French again in the City of New York which at present claims my love and allegiance. Like the French I am fond of dancing, and adore cards and the theatre probably because I am a minister's daughter. All my life I have wanted to write novels and have had one published. But usually, in spite of myself, I have scribbled poetry. ... I should like to see the West Indies, South America and Tunis and live a long time on the French Riviera. Aside from this I have few desires. And I find life perpetually enchanting.”

            We two who loved each other so!
            Only the moment before we were one,
            Using the language that lovers know.
            And then of a sudden, a word, a phrase
            That struck at the heart like a poignard’s blow.
            And you went beserk, and I saw red,
            And love lay between us, bleeding and dead!
            Dead! When we loved each other so!
            How could it happen that we quarreled!
            Think of the things we used to say!
            “What does it matter, dear, what you do?
            Love such as ours has to last for aye!”
            —“Try me! I love to ensure your test!”
            —“Love, we shall always love, come what may!”
            What are the words the apostle saith?
            “In the power of the tongue are Life and Death!”
            Think of the things we used to say!

       <collex:text>TOUCHE
            DEAR, when we sit in that high, placid room,
            "Loving” and “doving” as all lovers do,
            Laughing and leaning so close in the gloom,--
            What is the change that creeps sharp over you?
            Just as you raise your fine hand to my hair,
            Bringing that glance of mixed wonder and rue?
            “Black hair,” you murmur, “so lustrous and rare,
            Beautiful too, like a raven's smooth wing;
            Surely no gold locks were ever more fair."
            Why do you say every night that same thing?
            Turning your mind to some old constant theme,
            Half meditating and half murmuring?
            Tell me, that girl of your young manhood's dream,
            Her you loved first in that dim long ago
            Had she blue eyes? Did her hair goldly gleam?
            Does she come back to you softly and slow,
            Stepping wraith-wise from the depths of the past?
            Quickened and fired by the warmth of our glow?
            There I've divined it! My wit holds you fast.
            Nay, no excuses ; 'tis little I care.
            I knew a lad in my own girlhood's past,--
            Blue eyes he had and such waving gold hair!

       <collex:text>LOLOTTE, who attires my hair,
            Lost her lover. Lolotte weeps;
            Trails her hand before her eyes;
            Hangs her head and mopes and sighs,
            Mutters of the pangs of hell.
            Fills the circumambient air
            With her plaints and her despair.
            Looks at me:
            “May you never know, Mam’selle,
            Love's harsh cruelty."
            Love's dart lurks in my heart too,-
            None may know the smart
            Throbbing underneath my smile.
            Burning, pricking all the while
            That I dance and sing and spar,
            Juggling words and making quips
            To hide the trembling of my lips.
            I must laugh
            What time I moan to moon and star
            To help me stand the gaff.
            What a silly thing is pride!
            Lolotte bares her heart.
            Heedless that each runner reads
            All her thoughts and all her needs.
            What I hide with my soul's life
            Lolotte tells with tear and cry.
            Blurs her pain with sob and sigh.
            Happy Lolotte, she!
            I must jest while sorrow's knife
            Stabs in ecstasy.
            “If I live, I shall outlive.”
            Meanwhile I am barred
            From expression of my pain.
            Let my heart be torn in twain,
            Only I may know the truth.
            Happy Lolotte, blessed she
            Who may tell her agony!
            On me a seal is set.
            Love is lost, and—bitter ruth-
            Pride is with me yet!

       <collex:text>LA VIE C'EST LA VIE
            On summer afternoons I sit
            Quiescent by you in the park,
            And idly watch the sunbeams gild
            And tint the ash-trees' bark.
            Or else I watch the squirrels frisk
            And chaffer in the grassy lane;
            And all the while I mark your voice
            Breaking with love and pain.
            I know a woman who would give
            Her chance of heaven to take my place;
            To see the love-light in your eyes,
            The love-glow on your face!
            And there's a man whose lightest word
            Can set my chilly blood afire;
            Fulfilment of his least behest
            Defines my life's desire.
            But he will none of me, Nor I
            Of you. Nor you of her. 'Tis said
            The world is full of jests like these.--
            I wish that I were dead.

       <collex:text>I that found the way so smooth
            With gilly-flowers that beck and nod,
            Now find that same road wild and steep
            With need for compass and for rod,
            And yet with feed that bleed, I pant,
            On blindly-- stumbling back to God!

       <collex:text>FRAGMENT
            THE breath of life imbued those few dim days!
            Yet all we had was this,
            A flashing smile, a touch of hands, and once
            A fleeting kiss.
            Blank futile death inheres these years between!
            Still naught have you and I
            But frozen tears, and stifled words, and once
            A sharp caught cry.

       <collex:text>Snow in October
            Today I saw a thing of arresting poignant beauty:
            A strong young tree, brave in its Autumn finery
            Of scarlet and burnt umber and flame yellow,
            Bending beneath a weight of early snow,
            Which sheathed the north side of its slender trunk,
            And spread a heavy white chilly afghan
            Over its crested leaves.
            Yet they thrust through, defiant, glowing,
            Claiming the right to live another fortnight,
            Clamoring that Indian Summer had not come,
            Crying “Cheat! Cheat!” because Winter had stretched
            Long chill fingers into the brown, streaming hair
            Of fleeing October.
            The film of snow shrouded the proud redness of the tree,
            As premature grief grays the strong head
            Of a virile, red-haired man.

       <collex:text>I had not thought of violets of late,
            The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet
            In wistful April days, when lovers mate
            And wander through the fields in rapturous sweet,
            The thought of violets meant florists’ shops,
            And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine;
            And garish lights, and mincing little fops,
            And cabarets and songs, and deadenign wine.
            So far from the sweet real things my thoughts had strayed,
            I had forgot wide fields, and clear brown streams; 
            The perfect loveliness that God has made,--
            Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams.
            And now–unwittingly, you’ve made me dream 
            Of violets and my soul’s forgotten gleam.

       <collex:text>I SIT AND SEW
            I SIT and sew—a useless task it seems,
            My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams
            The panoply of war, the martial tread of men,
            Grim faced, stern eyed, gazing beyond the ken
            Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,
            Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath—
            But—I must sit and sew.
            I sit and sew—my heart aches with desire—
            That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire
            On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things
            Once men. My soul in pity flings
            Appealing cries, yearning only to go
            There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe—
            But—I must sit and sew
            The little useless seam, the idle patch;
            Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,
            When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,
            Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?
            You need me, Christ. It is no roseate dream
            That beckons me—this pretty futile seam
            It stifles me—God, must I sit and sew?

       <collex:text>Many years ago a little yellow girl in Atlanta, Georgia, came across a poem in a current paper that told of a rose struggling to bloom in a window in New York City. A child tended this flower and her whole life was wrapt up in its fate. This poem was written by William Stanley Braithwaite, years before the world knew how marvellous was his mind. Some one told the reader of these lines that the writer was colored and straightway she began to walk upward toward him.
            This little girl grew up, went to Atlanta University, Oberlin Conservatory, taught school, then married Henry Lincoln Johnson, always looking forward toward the light of the poet Braithwaite.
            Then her husband was appointed Recorder of Deeds under Taft and she was moved by circumstances to the capital—Washington. Dean Kelly Miller at Howard University saw some of her poetic efforts and was pleased. Stanley Braithwaite was his friend and he directed her to send something to him at Boston. She did so, and then began a quickening and a realization that she could do!
            Following this happy event, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois of the Crisis brought out two poems from her pen that awakened the interest of readers. At this time Jessie Fauset, the novelist, was teaching French in Washington and very generously helped her to gather together material for her first book The Heart of A Woman with an introduction by William Stanley Braithwaite. This was followed by Bronze, a book of color with an introduction by W. E. B. Du Bois. Her third attempt in poetry was An Autumn Love Cycle with an introduction by Alain Locke, the editor of The New Negro. At present she is connected with the Department of Labor at Washington, as Commissioner of Conciliation. At her home there you may find the young writers gathered together almost any Saturday night exchanging ideas, reciting new poems or discussing plans for new creations.

       <collex:text>Frail children of sorrow, dethroned by a hue,
            The shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through,
            The world has its motion, all things pass away.
            No night is omnipotent, there must be day.
            The oak tarries long in the depth of the seed,
            But swift is the season of nettle and weed.
            Abide yet awhile in the mellowing shade.
            And rise with the hour for which you were made.
            The cycle of seasons, the tidals of man
            Revolve in the orb of an infinite plan.
            We move to the rhythm of ages long done,
            And each has his hour — to dwell in the sun!

            I do not ask for love,--ah! no,
            Nor friendship's happiness,
            These were relinquished long ago
            I search for something less.
            I seek a little, tranquil bark
            In which to drift at ease
            Awhile, and then quite silently
            To sink in quiet seas.

            Till love has nothing more to ask
            And nothing more to give?
            I want to die while you love me,

            Grow dim, or cease to be!

       <collex:text>Consider me a memory, a dream that passed away;
            Or yet a flower that has blown and shattered in a day;
            For passion sleeps alas and keeps no vigil with the years
            And wakens to no conjuring of orisons or tears.
            Consider me a melody that served its simple turn,
            Or but the residue of fire that settles in the urn,
            For love defies pure reasoning and undeterred flows
            Within, without, the vassal heart—its reasoning who knows?

            Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam
            In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.
            
            The heart of a woman falls back with the night,
            And enters some alien cage in its plight,
            And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
            While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.

       <collex:text>"I was born in a very little village high up in the hills of the parish of Clarendon in the island of Jamaica. The village was so small it hadn't a name like the larger surrounding villages. But our place was called Sunny Ville. I was the youngest of eleven.
            My father was a peasant proprietor who owned his land and cultivated large tracts of coffee, cocoa, bananas and sugar-cane. When I was of school age I was sent to my brother who was a schoolmaster in a small town in the Northwestern part of the island. He educated me. He was a free-thinker and I became one, too, so soon as I could think about life and religion. I was never a child of any church. My brother had a nice library with books of all sorts and I read such free-thought writers as Haeckel, Huxley, Matthew Arnold, side by side with Shakespeare and the great English novelists and poets (excepting Browning) before I was fourteen. At that time Shakespeare to me was only a wonderful story-teller.
            When I was seventeen I won a Jamaica Government Trade Scholarship and was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker and wheelwright. I hated trade and quit. When I was nineteen I joined the Jamaica Constabulary and left it after ten months. An English gentleman who was collecting Jamaica folklore became interested in my dialect verses and helped me to publish my first book: Songs of Jamaica, in 1911. I was twenty years old then.
            The next year I went to the United States. First to an educational insti- tution for Negroes in the South. I did not like it, and left there after three months for a college in a Western state. There I stayed two years. Came to New York. Abandoned all thought of returning to the West Indies. Lost a few thousand dollars (a legacy) in high living and bad business. Went to work at various jobs, porter, houseman, longshoreman, bar-man, railroad club and hotel waiter. Kept on writing. The Seven Arts Magasine took two of my poems in 1917. In 1918 Frank Harris published some poems in Pearson's. In 1919 The Liberator published some things. The same year I went to Holland, Belgium and England. Lived in London over a year. Published Spring in New Hampshire. Returned to America in 1921. Got a job with Max Eastman on the Liberator. Kept it till Max Eastman left for Europe. Went to Russia in 1922. Harlem Shadows published 1922 by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co. Stayed six months in Moscow and Petrograd. Berlin in 1923. Paris at the end of 1923, where I was very ill for months. Been in France ever since trying to exist and write."

       <collex:text>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
            And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
            Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
            I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!
            Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,
            Giving me strength erect against her hate.
            Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
            Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state,
            I stand within her walls with not a shred
            Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.
            Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,
            And see her might and granite wonders there,
            Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,
            Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.

       <collex:text>Through the pregnant universe rumbles life’s
            terrific thunder,
            And Earth’s bowels quake with terror; strange
            and terrible storms break,
            Lightning-torches flame the heavens, kindling
            souls of me, thereunder:
            Africa! Long ages sleeping, O my motherland,
            awake!
            In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new
            dawn that is breaking,
            And its golden glory fills the western skies.
            O my brothers and my sisters, wake! Arise!
            For the new birth rends the old earth and the
            very dead are waking,
            Ghosts are turned flesh, throwing off the grave’s

            And the foolish, even children, are made wise;

            O my brothers, dreaming for dim centuries,
            Wake from sleeping; to the East turn, turn
            your eyes!
            Oh the night is sweet for sleeping, but the shining
            day’s for working;
            Sons of the seductive night, for your children’s
            children’s sake,
            From the deep primeval forests where the crouching
            leopard’s lurking
            Lift your heavy-lidded eyes, Ethiopia! Awake!
            In the East the clouds glow crimson with the new
            dawn that is breaking,
            And its golden glory fills the western skies.
            O my brothers and my sisters, wake! Arise!
            For the new birth rends the old earth and the

       <collex:text>So much have I forgotten in ten years,
            So much in ten brief years! I have forgot
            What time the purple apples come to juice,
            And what month brings the shy forget-me-not.
            I have forgot the special, startling season
            Of the pimento’s flowering and fruiting;
            What time of year the ground doves brown the fields
            And fill the noonday with the curious fluting.
            I have forgotten much, but still remember
            The poinsettia’s red, blood-red in warm December.
            I still recall the honey-fever grass,
            But cannot recollect the high days when
            We rooted them out of the ping-wing path
            To stop the mad bees in the rabbit pen.
            I often try to think in what sweet month
            The languid painted ladies used to dapple
            The yellow by-road mazing from the main,
            Sweet with the golden threads of the rose-apple.
            I have forgotten—strange—but quite remember
            The poinsettia’s red, blood-red in warm December.
            What weeks, what months, what time of the mild year
            We cheated school to have our fling at tops?
            What days our wine-thrilled bodies pulsed with joy
            Feasting upon blackberries in the copse?
            Oh some I know! I have embalmed the days,
            All innocent of passion, uncorrupt,
            At noon and evening in the flame-heart’s shade.
            We were so happy, happy, I remember,
            Beneath the poinsettia’s red in warm December.

            And house me from the cold,

            Droops in the grassy pen.

            Bow down my soul in worship very low
            And in the holy silences be lost.
            Bow down before the marble man of woe,
            Bow down before the singing angel host.
            What jewelled glory fills my spirit’s eye!
            What golden grandeur moves the depths of me!
            The soaring arches lift me up on high
            Taking my breath with their rare symmetry.
            Bow down my soul and let the wondrous light
            Of Beauty bathe thee from her lofty throne
            Bow down before the wonder of man’s might.
            Bow down in worship, humble and alone;
            Bow lowly down before the sacred sight
            Of man’s divinity alive in stone.

       <collex:text>DESOLATE
            MY SPIRIT is a pestilential city,
            With misery triumphant everywhere,
            Glutted with baffled hopes and lost to pity;
            Strange agonies make quiet lodgment there.
            Its bursting sewers ooze up from below,
            And spread their loathsome substance through its lanes,
            Flooding all areas with their evil flow,
            And blocking all the motion of its veins.
            Its life is sealed to love or hope or pity;
            My spirit is a pestilential city.
            Above its walls the air is heavy-wet,
            Brooding in fever mood and hanging thick
            Round empty tower and broken minaret,
            Settling upon the tree-tops stricken sick
            And withered in its dank contagious breath;
            Their leaves are shrivelled silver, parched decay,
            Like wilting creepers trailing underneath
            The chalky yellow of a tropic way.
            Round crumbling tower and leaning minaret,
            The air hangs fever-filled and heavy-wet.
            And all its many fountains no more spurt;
            Within the dammed-up tubes they tide and foam
            Around the drifting sludge and silted dirt,
            And weep against the soft and liquid loam,
            And so the city's ways are washed no more;
            All is neglected and decayed within.
            Clean waters beat against its high-walled shore
            In furious force, but cannot enter in.
            The suffocated fountains cannot spurt;
            They foam and weep against the silted dirt.
            Beneath the ebon gloom of mounting rocks
            The little pools lie poisonously still.
            And birds come to the edge in forlorn flocks,
            And utter sudden plaintive notes and shrill,
            Pecking at fatty grey-green substances;
            But never do they dip their bills and drink.
            They twitter sad, beneath the mournful trees,
            And fretfully flit to and from the brink,
            In little dull brown, green-and-purple flocks,
            Beneath the jet-gloom of the mounting rocks.
            And green-eyed moths of curious design,
            With gold-black wings and brightly silver-dotted,
            On nests of flowers among those rocks recline
            Bold, burning blossoms, strangely leopard-spotted,
            But breathing deadly poison at the lips.
            Oh, every lovely moth that wanders by,
            And on the blossoms fatal nectar sips,
            Is doomed in drooping stupor there to die
            All green-eyed moths of curious design
            That on the fiercely-burning rocks recline.
            Oh cold as death is all the loveliness
            That breathes out of the strangeness of the scene,
            And sickening like a skeleton's caress,
            With clammy clinging fingers, long and lean.
            Above it float a host of yellow flies,
            Circling in changeless motion in their place,
            Snow-thick and mucid in the drooping skies,
            Swarming across the glassy floor of space.
            Oh cold as death is all the loveliness
            And sickening like a skeleton's caress.
            There was a time when, happy with the birds,
            The little children clapped their hands and laughed;
            And midst the clouds the glad winds heard their words,
            And blew down all the merry ways to waft
            Their music to the scented fields of flowers.
            Oh sweet were children's voices in those days,
            Before the fall of pestilential showers,
            That drove them forth from all the city's ways.
            Now never, never more their silver words
            Will mingle with the golden of the birds.
            Gone, gone forever the familiar forms
            To which my spirit once so dearly clung,
            Blown worlds beyond by the destroying storms,
            And lost away like lovely songs unsung.
            Yet life still lingers, questioningly strange,
            Timid and quivering, naked and alone,
            Biding the cycle of disruptive change,
            Though all the fond familiar forms are gone
            Forever gone, the fond familiar forms,
            Blown worlds beyond by the destroying storms.

       <collex:text>Your words dropped into my heart like pebbles into a pool,
            Rippling around my breast and leaving it melting cool.
            Your kisses fell sharp on my flesh like dawn-dews from the limb
            Of a fruit-filled lemon tree when the day is young and dim.
            Like soft rain-christened sunshine, as fragile as rare gold lace,
            Your breath, sweet-scented and warm, has kindled my tranquil face.
            But a silence vasty-deep, oh deeper than all these ties
            Now, through the menacing miles, brooding between us lies.
            And more than the songs I sing, I await your written word,
            To stir my fluent blood as never your presence stirred.

       <collex:text>MY HOUSE
            For this peculiar tint that paints my house
            Peculiar in an alien atmosphere
            Where other houses wear a kindred hue,
            I have a stirring always very rare
            And romance-making in my ardent blood,
            That channels through my body like a flood.
            I know the dark delight of being strange,
            The penalty of difference in the crowd,
            The loneliness of wisdom among fools,
            Yet never have I felt but very proud,
            Though I have suffered agonies of hell,
            Of living in my own peculiar cell.
            There is an exaltation of man's life,
            His hidden life, that he alone can feel.
            The blended fires that heat his veins within,
            Shaping his metals into finest steel,
            Are elements from his own native earth,
            That the wise gods bestowed on him at birth.
            Oh each man's mind contains an unknown realm
            Walled in from other men however near,
            And unimagined in their highest flights
            Of comprehension or of vision clear;
            A realm where he withdraws to contemplate
            Infinity and his own finite state.
            Thence he may sometimes catch a god-like glimpse
            Of mysteries that seem beyond life's bar;
            Thence he may hurl his little shaft at heaven
            And bring down accidentally a star,
            And drink its foamy dust like sparkling wine
            And echo accents of the laugh divine.
            Then he may fall into a drunken sleep
            And wake up in his same house painted blue
            Or.white or green or red or brown or black-
            His house, his own, whatever be the hue.
            But things for him will not be what they seem
            To average men since he has dreamt his dream!

       <collex:text>Jean Toomer was born in Washington, D. C., in 1894. He has since lived there and in New York, receiving his education mainly in these cities. Having traveled over a good part of America, experiencing varied aspects of its life and studying the elements of contemporary problems, in 1918 in the midst of a general interest in art, he gradually centered on that of literature. There followed a four year period devoted entirely to writing, the results of which were first given printed form by The Double Dealer of New Orleans. And soon thereafter, sketches, poems, short stories, and critical reviews began appearing in Broom, The Crisis, The Dial, The Liberator, The Little Review, Opportunity, etc. These brought him in contact
            with a literary and artistic group in New York composed of such men as Waldo Frank, Alfred Steiglitz, Paul Rosenfeld, Gorham B. Munson, and others. With these he has been associated in the effort to articulate the diverse significances of America. In 1923 his first book, Cane, was published by Boni and Liveright, New York.

            In their hip-pockets as a thing that’s done,   
            And start their silent swinging, one by one.   
            Black horses drive a mower through the weeds,   
            And there, a field rat, startled, squealing bleeds.   
            His belly close to ground. I see the blade,   
            Blood-stained, continue cutting weeds and shade.

       <collex:text>Georgia Dusk
            The sky, lazily disdaining to pursue
            The setting sun, too indolent to hold
            A lengthened tournament for flashing gold,
            Passively darkens for night’s barbecue,
            A feast of moon and men and barking hounds,
            An orgy for some genius of the South
            With blood-hot eyes and cane-lipped scented mouth,
            Surprised in making folk-songs from soul sounds.
            The sawmill blows its whistle, buzz-saws stop,
            And silence breaks the bud of knoll and hill,
            Soft settling pollen where plowed lands fulfill
            Their early promise of a bumper crop.
            Smoke from the pyramidal sawdust pile
            Curls up, blue ghosts of trees, tarrying low
            Where only chips and stumps are left to show
            The solid proof of former domicile.
            Meanwhile, the men, with vestiges of pomp,
            Race memories of king and caravan,
            High-priests, an ostrich, and a juju-man,
            Go singing through the footpaths of the swamp.
            Their voices rise…the pine trees are guitars,
            Strumming, pine-needles fall like sheets of rain…
            Their voices rise…the chorus of the cane
            Is caroling a vesper to the stars…
            O singers, resinous and soft your songs
            Above the sacred whisper of the pines,
            Give virgin lips to cornfield concubines,
            Bring dreams of Christ to dusky cane-lipped throngs.

       <collex:text>Song of the Son
            (This poem first appeared in The Crisis, Volume 23, No. 6, April 1922)
            Pour O pour that parting soul in song,
            O pour it in the sawdust glow of night,
            Into the velvet pine-smoke air to-night,
            And let the valley carry it along.
            And let the valley carry it along.
            O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree,
            So scant of grass, so profligate of pines,
            Now just before an epoch’s sun declines
            Thy son, in time, I have returned to thee,
            Thy son, I have in time returned to thee.
            In time, for though the sun is setting on
            A song-lit race of slaves, it has not set;
            Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet
            To catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone,
            Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone.
            O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums,
            Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air,
            Passing, before they stripped the old tree bare
            One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes
            An everlasting song, a singing tree,
            Caroling softly souls of slavery,
            What they were, and what they are to me,
            Caroling softly souls of slavery.

            silver-gray,

            Her eyes—
            mist of tears
            condensing on the flesh below
            And her channeled muscles
            are cluster grapes of sorrow
            purple in the evening sun
            nearly ripe for worms.

       <collex:text>Boll-weevil's coming, and the winter’s cold,
            Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,
            And cotton, scarce as any southern snow,
            Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,
            Failed in its function as the autumn rake;
            Drouth fighting soil had caused the soil to take
            All water from the streams; dead birds were found
            In wells a hundred feet below the ground—
            Such was the season when the flower bloomed.
            Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed
            Significance. Superstition saw
            Something it had never seen before:
            Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,
            Beauty so sudden for that time of year.
            "November Cotton Flower" was first published in The Nomad 2, in Summer 1923.

       <collex:text>At Thanksgiving time 1894 Paul Laurence Dunbar, the Negro poet, was a guest in my house in Louisville, Ky. Here for the first time in the South he read the Negro dialect poems that afterwards made him famous.
            September 2nd, 1895, my son, the late Joseph S .Cotter , Jr., was born in the room in which these poems were read . He learned to read and write from his sister , Florence Olivia,who was two years older. Before he entered school at the age of six years he had read about thirty books — these included all the readers in the elementary schools 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 -8th grades and parts of the Bible.
            Mrs.Maria F. Cotter, my wife, and I held both children back. We refused to allow them to bepromoted in several instances . Both were graduated from the Louisville Central High School under 16; Florence Olivia won first honor of her class and Joseph the second. He was graduated June 1911.  After a year and a half at Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn ., Florence Olivia wrote us that Joseph had tuberculosis and must leave school. He returned home and was put under a doctor. The 16th of the following December, Florence Olivia returned from Fisk with tuberculosis, and one year from that day she died. It was grieving over his sister's death that discovered to Joseph his poetic talent. He died February 3rd, 1919 , leaving his published poems , — The Band of Gideon and two other unpublished works --one of poems and one of one act plays.

            On the dusty earth-drum
            Beats the falling rain;
            Now a whispered murmur,
            Now a louder strain.
            Slender, silvery drumsticks,
            On an ancient drum,
            Beat the mellow music
            Bidding life to come.
            Chords of earth awakened,
            Notes of greening spring,
            Rise and fall triumphant
            Over every thing.
            Slender, silvery drumsticks
            Beat the long tattoo-
            God, the Great Musician,
            Calling life anew.

            I Am so tired and weary,
            So tired of the endless fight,
            So weary of waiting the dawn
            And finding endless night.
            That I ask but rest and quiet,
            Rest for the days that are gone,

            That I must journey on.

            On such a day as this,
            When earth and sky and nature's whole

            And balmy zephyrs gently waft
            Upon your cheek a kiss;
            Sufficient is it just to live
            On such a day as this.

       <collex:text>THE DESERTER
            I know not why or whence he came
            Or how he chanced to go;
            I only know he brought me love
            And going, left me woe.
            I do not ask that he turn back,
            Nor seek where he may rove;
            For where woe rules can never be
            The dwelling place of love.
            For love went out the door of hope,
            And on and on has fled;
            Caring no more to dwell within
            The house where faith is dead.

       <collex:text>THE BAND OF GIDEON
            The band of Gideon roam the sky,
            The howling wind is their war-cry,
            The thunder's roll is their trump's peal,
            And the lightning's flash their vengeful steel.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            And men below rear temples high
            And mock their God with reasons why,
            And live in arrogance, sin and shame,
            And rape their souls for the world's good name.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            "The sword of the Lord and Gideon."
            The band of Gideon roam the sky
            And view the earth with baleful eye;
            In holy wrath they scourge the land
            With earth-quake, storm and burning brand.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            “The Sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
            The lightnings flash and the thunders roll,
            And “Lord have mercy on my soul,”
            Cry men as they fall on the stricken sod,
            In agony searching for their God.
            Each black cloud
            Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            “The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
            And men repent and then forget
            That heavenly wrath they ever met,
            The band of Gideon yet will come
            And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb.
            Each black cloud Is a fiery steed.
            And they cry aloud
            With each strong deed,
            “The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”

        <collex:text>I was born on a farm near Franklin, Kentucky, April 15, 1896, and received my education variously ... public schools, Bowling Green Academy, Simmon's University and Summer schools. No degree. Taught for several years in my native state. I am a lover of music and divide my time  between the typewriter and piano. First published in Franklin Favorite, later, Louisville Leader, Chicago Defender, Pittsburgh Courier, Crisis, Opportunity and Wayfarer. My favorite poets are Countee Cullen, Georgia Douglas Johnson and Edna St. Vincent Millay; my favorite past-time,
            walking along a crowded street. I have a hunch that I shall become a short story writer and my favorite exertion is trying to perfect my “technique.”
            At present I am living in Sewickley, Penna.

        <collex:text>THE WALLS OF JERICHO
            JERICHO is on the inside
            Of the things the world likes best;
            “We want in,” the dark ones cried,
            “We will love it as the rest.”
            “Let me learn,” the dark ones say.
            They have learned that Faith must do
            More than meditate and pray
            That a boulder may fall through
            Making one large man size entrance
            Into wondrous Jericho.
            They have learned: forget the distance,
            Count no steps, nor stop to blow.
            Jericho still has her high wall,
            Futile barrier of Power. ...
            Echoed with the dark ones' footfall
            Marching around her every hour;
            Knowledge strapped down like a knapsack
            Not cumbersome, and money
            Not too much to strain the back. ...
            Dark ones seeking milk and honey.
            Over in the city staring
            Up at us along the wall
            Are the fat ones, trembling, swearing
            There is no room there for us all!
            But there've been too many rounds
            Made to give the trip up here.
            Shout for joy ... hear how it sounds. ...
            The very walls echo with cheer!

        <collex:text>POEM
            AH, I know what happiness is. ...!
            It is a timid little fawn
            Creeping softly up to me
            For one caress, then gone
            Before I'm through with it ...
            Away, like dark from dawn!
            Well I know what happiness is ...!
            It is the break of day that wears
            A shining dew decked diadem ...
            An aftermath of tears.
            Fawn and dawn, emblems of joy ...
            I've played with them for years,
            And always they will slip away
            Into the brush of another day.

        <collex:text>REVELATION
            She walked along the crowded street
            Forgetting all but that she
            Was walking as the other girls
            And dressed as carefully.
            The windows of the stores were frilled
            To lure femininity,
            To empty little pocketbooks
            And assuage queen vanity.
            And so my walker liked a dress
            Of silver and of gold,
            Draped on a bisque mannequin
            So blond and slim and bold.
            She took the precious metal home
            And waved her soft black hair;
            Powder, rouge and lipstick made
            Her very neat and fair.
            She slipped the dress on carefully,
            Her vain dream fell away. ...
            The mirror showed a brownskin girl
            She hadn't seen all day!
            “You have classic features,
            Something like Cleopatra.
            Eyes like whirlpools
            And as dangerous. ...
            Weeping willow eyelashes
            Shade the mighty depth
            Of your eyes. Your lips
            Are danger signals
            Which a fool like me
            Will not regard. ...
            But go dashing past them
            To gain a kiss ... or Death."
            That is what he said to me,
            I filled with a sweet and vain regret
            That Beauty, the stranger, and I had met.
            His praise was heat to drink me dry.
            So I found a stream, and with a sigh
            I stooped to drink . . . ah, to see
            The cruel water reflecting me!
            Dark-eyed, thick-lipped, harsh, short hair ...
            But Lucifer saw himself, too, fair.

        <collex:text>That Hill
            This poem won honorable mention in THE CRISIS contest of 1926.
            It crawled away from ’neath my feet,
            And left me standing there;
            A little at a time, went up
            An atmospheric stair.
            I couldn’t go for watching it,
            To see where it would stop;
            A tree sprang out and waved to me
            When it had reached the top.
            The tree kept nodding friendly like,
            Beckoning me to follow;
            And I went crawling up and up,
            Like it did from the hollow.
            Then I saw why the thing would go
            A-soaring from the dell—
            T’was nearing Heaven every bound,
            And fleeing fast from Hell!

        <collex:text>TO AN ICICLE
            CHILLED into a serenity
            As rigid as your pose
            You linger trustingly,
            But a gutter waits for you.
            Your elegance does not secure
            You favors with the sun.
            He is not one to pity fragileness.
            He thinks all cheeks should burn
            And feel how tears can run.

        <collex:text>FOUR WALLS
            Four great walls have hemmed me in.
            Four strong, high walls:
            Right and wrong,
            Shall and shan't.
            The mighty pillars tremble when
            My conscience palls
            And sings its song---
            I can, I can't.
            If for a moment Samson's strength
            Were given me I'd shove
            Them away from where I stand;
            Free, I know I'd love
            To ramble soul and all,
            And never dread to strike a wall.
            Again, I wonder would that be
            Such a happy state for me ...
            The going, being, doing, sham---
            And never knowing where I am.
            I might not love freedom at all;
            My tired wings might crave a wall---
            Four walls to rise and pen me in
            This conscious world with guarded men.

        <collex:text>BORN in New York City, August 18, 1899, I have lived all but about six years in Brooklyn. I studied at the College of the City of New York, and was guilty there of my first sonnet; but am ever so much more proud of my varsity letters won on the track_once ran a “10 flat” hundred and a 51 sec. quarter. Went to the Northern Illinois College of Ophthalmology-took degree “Doctor of Optometry.”
            Have practiced in Chicago and New York. At present writing, am doing some teaching and publicity work at the Fort Valley High and Industrial School, Georgia, while recovering from a mean illness. Have had a hankering to write as long as I can remember, but Charles Johnson, Editor of Opportunity and a certain Gwendolyn Bennett are responsible for my trying it openly. My "published works” are limited to the indulgence of Opportunity, The Crisis, and Braithwaite's Anthology. It is the perver- sity of my nature to crave the ability to write good prose,
            and yet my attempts at poetry are the only things to which any notice is given.”

            A CATHOLIC CHURCH
            It is fitting that you be here
            Little brown boys
            With Christ-like eyes
            And curling hair.
            Look you on yon crucifix
            Where He hangs nailed and pierced
            With head hung low
            And eyes a'blind with blood that drips
            From a thorny crown ...
            Look you well,
            You shall know this thing.
            Judas' kiss will burn your cheek
            And you shall be denied
            By your Peter
            And Gethsemane ....
            You shall know full well
            Gethsemane ...
            You, too, will suffer under Pontius Pilate
            And feel the rugged cut of rough hewn cross
            Upon your surging shoulder-
            They will spit in your face
            And laugh ...
            They will nail you up twixt thieves
            And gamble for your little garments.
            And in this you will exceed God
            For on this earth
            You shall know Hell-
            O little brown boys
            With Christ-like eyes
            And curling hair
            It is fitting that you be here.

            * * *
            To All of You
            My little stone
            Sinks quickly Into the bosom of this deep, dark pool
            Of oblivion...
            I have troubled its breast but little.
            Yet those far shores
            That knew me not
            Will feel the fleeting, furtive kiss
            Of my tiny concentric ripples.... 
            To Lewellyn
            You have borne full well
            The burden of my friendship—
            I have drunk deep
            At your crystal pool,
            And in return
            I have-polluted its waters
            With the bile of my hatred,
            I have flooded your soul
            With tortuous thoughts,
            I have played Iscariot
            To your Pythias... 
            To Mother
            I came In the blinding sweep
            Of ecstatic pain,
            I go In the throbbing pulse
            Of Aching Space,
            In the eons between
            I piled upon you
            Pain on pain
            Ache on ache
            And yet as I go
            I shall know
            That you will grieve
            And want me back..... 
            To Bennetti
            You have freed me—
            In opening wide the doors
            Of fiesh—
            You have freed me
            Of the binding leash.
            I have climbed the heights
            Of white disaster.
            My body screaming
            In the silver crash of passion.....
            Before you gave yourself
            To him
            I had chained myself
            For you.
            But when at last
            You lowered your proud flag
            In surrender complete
            You gave me too, as hostage—
            And I have swept my joy
            At the dawn-tipped shrine
            Of many breasts. 
            To Jean
            When you poured your love
            Like molten flame
            Into the throbbing mold
            Of her pulsing veins
            Leaving her blood a river of fire
            And her arteries channels of light,
            I hated you... 
            Hated with that primal hate
            That has its wells
            In the flesh of me
            And the flesh of you
            And the flesh of her
            I hated you—
            Hated with envy
            Your mastery of her being. .
            With one fleshy gesture
            You pricked the irridescent bubble
            Of my dreams
            And so to make
            Your conquest more sweet
            I tell you now
            That I hated you...
            To Catalina
            Love thy piano,Oh girl,
            It will give you back
            Note for Note
            The harmonies of your soul.
            It will sing back to you
            The high songs of your heart.
            It will give
            As well as take.
            To Mariette
            I sought ccnsolation
            In the sorrow of your eyes.
            You sought reguerdon
            In the crying of my heart. .
            We found that shattered dreamers
            Can be bitter hosts.... 
            To ————
            You call it
            Death of the Spirit
            And I call it Life...
            The vigor of vibration,
            The muffled knocks,
            The silver sheen of passion’s flood,
            The ecstacy of pain..
            You call it
            Death of the Spirit
            And I call it Life.
            To Telie
            You have made my voice
            A rippling laugh
            But my heart
            A crying thing .
            ’Tis better thus,
            A fleeting kiss
            And then,
            The dark
            To “Chick”
            Oh Achilles of the moleskins
            And the gridiron
            Do not wonder
            Nor doubt that this is I
            That lie so calmly here—
            This is the same exultant beast
            That so joyously
            Ran the ball with you
            In those far flung days of abandon.
            You remember how récklessly
            We revelled in the heat and the dust
            And the swirl of conflict?
            You remember they called us
            The Terrible Two?
            And you remember
            After we had battered our heads
            And our bodies
            Against the stonewall of their defense,—
            You remember the signal
            I would call
            And how you would look at me
            In faith and admiration
            And say “Let’s go”...
            How the lines would clash
            And strain,
            And how I would find an opening,
            A wee small space,
            Amidst tangling arms and torsos,
            And how I would slip through
            Fighting and squirming
            Over the line
            To victory.
            You remember, Chick?
            When you gaze at me here
            Let that same light
            Of faith and admiration
            Shine in your eyes
            For I have battered the stark stonewall
            Before me. 
            I have kept faith with you
            And now
            I have called my signal,
            Found my opening
            And slipped through
            Fighting and squirming
            Over the line
            To victory.
            To Wanda
            To you, so far away
            So cold and aloof, -
            To you, who knew me so well,
            This is my last Grand Gesture
            This my last Great Effect
            And as I go winging
            Through the black doors of eternity
            Is that thin sound I hear
            Your applause? .....

        <collex:text>NEGRO WOMAN
            THE sky hangs heavy tonight
            Like the hair of a Negro woman.
            The scars of the moon are curved
            Like the wrinkles on the brow of a Negro woman.
            The stars twinkle tonight
            Like the glaze in a Negro woman's eyes,
            Drinking the tears set flowing by an aging hurt
            Gnawing at her heart.
            The earth trembles tonight
            Like the quiver of a Negro woman's eye-lids cupping
            tears.

            Though yet the scourges of a monstrous hand
            Roam on your ruined fields, your trampled lanes,
            Your ravaged homes and desolated fanes;
            Thou are not dead, but sleeping,-- Motherland.
            A mighty country, valorous and free,
            Thou shalt outlive this terror and this pain;
            Shall call thy scattered children back to thee,
            Strong with the memory of their brothers slain;
            And rise from out thy charnel house to be
            Thine own immortal, brilliant self again!

            I return the bitterness
            It is washed by tears;
            Now it is a loveliness
            Garnished through the years.
            I return it loveliness,
            Having made it so;
            For I wore the bitterness
            From it long ago.

        <collex:text>THE DARK BROTHER
            "Lo, I am black but I am comely too,
            Black as the night, black as the deep dark caves.
            I am the scion of a race of slaves
            Who helped to build a nation strong that you
            And I may stand within the world's full view,
            Fearless and firm as dreadnoughts on rough waves ;
            Holding a banner high whose floating braves
            The opposition of the tried untrue.
            Casting an eye of love upon my face,
            Seeing a newer light within my eyes,
            A rarer beauty in your brother race
            Will merge upon your visioning fullwise.
            Though I am black my heart through love is pure,
            And you through love my blackness shall endure!"

            I
            Could I but retrace
            The winding stairs fate built me.
            They fell from my feet.
            Now I stand on the high round.
            Down beneath height above depth-
            Through the eyes of life
            I looked in at my own heart:
            A long furrowed field
            Grown cement waiting for seed
            Baking in desolation.

            Drink in moods of joy!
            Why should the sky be lonely?
            Neither sun nor moon-
            How my heart is shy of night
            Like Autumn's leaf brown pendants.
            IV
            Cold against the sky
            The blue jays cried at dawning.
            The larks where are they?
            Heavily upon the air
            My ears tuned in to listen.
            So this is the reed?
            The very pipes for singing-
            Life plays me new songs.
            Wistfully from out the dawn
            The crows broke across the sky!
            VI
            And now Spring has come
            Blossoming up my garden.
            I alone unchanged.
            Moving in my house of Autumn.
            One leaf alone saves a tree.
            VII
            By the pool of life
            Willows are drooping tonight
            I can see no stars.
            What dances in the water?
            O my clouds dripping with tears.
            VIII
            Could I hear your voice
            O but this silence is sweet
            Words mar all beauty.
            Turn then into your own heart
            And pluck the roots from the soil-

            O APPLE blossoms
            Give me your words of silence,
            Yes, your charming speech.
            If you would know me,
            Do not regard this display ;
            Mingle with my speech.
            Why sit like the sphinx,
            Watching the caravan pass?
            Join in the parade.
            What if the wind blows?
            What if the leaves are scattered,
            Now that they are dead?
            While trimming the plants
            I saw some flowers drooping.
            I am a flower.
            This is but my robe,
            His Majesty gave to me.
            Garments will decay.
            On the flowering twig,
            Lo! the robin is singing.
            It must be spring.
            Looking up the hill
            The road was long before me.
            This road is longer.
            Death is not cruel
            From what I have seen of life;
            Nothing else remains.
            Life is history.
            Turn not away from the book.
            Write on every page!
            If you had not sung
            Then what would I imitate,
            Happy nightingale?
            Sitting by the pool,
            I looked in and saw my face.
            O that I were blind!

        <collex:text>DAY AND NIGHT
            THE day is a Negro
            Yelling out of breath.
            The night is a Negro
            Laughing up to death.
            The day is a jazz band
            Blasting loud and wild.
            The night is a jazz band
            Moaning Blues songs, child.
            The day is the sunshine
            Undressed in the street.
            The night is the sunshine
            Dressed from head to feet.
            I am like a rainbow
            Arched across the way.
            Yes, I am a rainbow
            Being night nor day.

        <collex:text>I was born in Washington, D. C., the first of May, 1901. I received primary and secondary education in the Public Schools of that city, and on a farm near Laurel, Md.; entered Williams College in 1918, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1921, graduated in 1922; and received my Master of Arts Degree at Harvard in 1923. Since that time I have been seeking a more liberal education teaching school. I have been inflicted on unsuspecting, helpless students; teaching diverse things at Manassas Summer School in Virginia, Rhetoric and Literature at Virginia Seminary and College, Lynchburg, Va., and Literature at Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Mo.
            From early years I have lisped in numbers but the numbers seem improper fractions. I have always been interested in people, particularly and generally, and in books. The list runs from Homer to Housman. Except for an essay on Roland Hayes submitted to an Opportunity contest, and occasional poems and reviews, I have published nothing of the voluminous works cluttering my desk.

            Deep in the ground
            Might as well pray for her
            That she sleep sound. ...

        <collex:text>TO A CERTAIN LADY, IN HER GARDEN
            (A. S.)
            LADY, my lady, come from out the garden,
            Clayfingered, dirtysmocked, and in my time
            I too shall learn the quietness of Arden,
            Knowledge so long a stranger to my rhyme.
            What were more fitting than your springtime task?
            Here, close engirdled by your vines and flowers
            Surely there is no other grace to ask,
            No better cloister from the bickering hours.
            A step beyond, the dingy streets begin
            With all their farce, and silly tragedy-
            But here, unmindful of the futile din
            You grow your flowers, far wiser certainly,
            You and your garden sum the same to me,
            A sense of strange and momentary pleasure,
            And beauty snatched—oh, fragmentarily
            Perhaps, yet who can boast of other seizure?
            Oh, you have somehow robbed, I know not how
            The secret of the loveliness of these
            Whom you have served so long. Oh, shameless, now
            You flaunt the winnings of your thieveries.
            Thus, I exclaim against you, profiteer. ...
            For purpled evenings spent in pleasing toil,
            Should you have gained so easily the dear
            Capricious largesse of the miser soil?
            Colorful living in a world grown dull,
            Quiet sufficiency in weakling days,
            Delicate happiness, more beautiful
            For lighting up belittered, grimy ways“
            Surely I think I shall remember this,
            You in your old, rough dress, bedaubed with clay,
            Your smudgy face parading happiness,
            Life's puzzle solved. Perhaps, in turn, you may
            One time, while clipping bushes, tending vines,
            (Making your brave, sly mock at dastard days)
            Laugh gently at these trivial, truthful lines-
            And that will be sufficient for my praise.

        <collex:text>SALUTAMUS
            ("O Gentlemen the time of Life is short "---Henry IV)
            The bitterness of days like these we know;
            Much, much we know, yet cannot understand
            What was our crime that such a searing brand
            Not of our choosing, keeps us hated so.
            Despair and disappointment only grow,
            Whatever seeds are planted from our hand,
            What though some roads wind through a gladsome land?
            It is a gloomy path that we must go.
            And yet we know relief will come some day
            For these seared breasts; and lads as brave again
            Will plant and find a fairer crop than ours.
            It must be due our hearts, our minds, our powers;
            These are the beacons to blaze out the way.
            We must plunge onward; onward, gentlemen. ...

        <collex:text>CHALLENGE
            I SAID, in drunken pride of youth and you
            That mischief-making Time would never dare
            Play his ill-humoured tricks upon us two,
            Strange and defiant lovers that we were.
            I said that even Death, Highwayman Death,
            Could never master lovers such as we,
            That even when his clutch had throttled breath,
            My hymns would float in praise, undauntedly.
            I did not think such words were bravado.
            Oh, I think honestly we knew no fear,
            Of Time or Death. We loved each other so.
            And thus, with you believing me, I made
            My prophecies, rebellious, unafraid....
            And that was foolish, wasn't it, my dear?

            Have found an alien and unknown content
            In seeing how some bits of cloud-filled sky
            Are framed in bracken pools; through chuckling hours
            Have watched the antic frogs, or curiously
            Have numbered all the unnamed, vagrant flowers,
            That fleck the unkempt meadows, lavishly.
            Or where a headlong toppling stream has stayed
            Its racing, lulled to quiet by the song
            Bursting from out the thickleaved oaken shade,
            There I have lain while hours sauntered past---
            I have found peacefulness somewhere at last,
            Have found a quiet needed for so long.

        <collex:text>“I was born at Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, in the Twentieth Century, and spent my early years in what is known as the 'Black Belt.' This was followed by seven years in New England (1916-1923), three at Bradford Academy, and four at Wellesley College, where my southern blood became tinged with something of the austerity of that section. Three years of teaching in the Dunbar High School of Washington, D. C., convinced me that though the children were interesting, teaching was not my metier. In the fall of 1926 I was married. Since completing a study of Delinquency and Neglect among Negro children in New York City, my career has been that of a wife, and as careers go, that is an interesting and absorbing one."

            It floods me like the sun
            On rain-drenched trees
            That flash with silver and green.
            I abandon myself to joy-
            I laugh-I sing.
            Too long have I walked a desolate way,
            Too long stumbled down a maze
            Bewildered.

        <collex:text>SOLACE
            My window opens out into the trees
            And in that small space
            Of branches and of sky
            I see the seasons pass
            Behold the tender green
            Give way to darker heavier leaves.
            The glory of the autumn comes
            When steeped in mellow sunlight
            The fragile, golden leaves
            Against a clear blue sky
            Linger in the magic of the afternoon
            And then reluctantly break off
            And filter down to pave
            A street with gold.
            Then bare, gray branches
            Lift themselves against the
            Cold December sky
            Sometimes weaving a web
            Across the rose and dusk of late sunset
            Sometimes against a frail new moon
            And one bright star riding
            A sky of that dark, living blue
            Which comes before the heaviness
            Of night descends, or the stars
            Have powdered the heavens.
            Winds beat against these trees;
            The cold, but gentle rain of spring
            Touches them lightly
            The summer torrents strive
            To lash them into a fury
            And seek to break them-
            But they stand.
            My life is fevered
            And a restlessness at times
            An agony—again a vague
            And baffling discontent
            Possesses me.
            I am thankful for my bit of sky
            And trees, and for the shifting
            Pageant of the seasons.
            Such beauty lays upon the heart
            A quiet.
            Such eternal change and permanence
            Take meaning from all turmoil
            And leave serenity
            Which knows no pain.

            The night was made for rest and sleep,
            For winds that softly sigh;
            It was not made for grief and tears;
            So then why do I cry?
            The wind that blows through leafy trees
            Is soft and warm and sweet;
            For me the night is a gracious cloak
            To hide my soul's defeat.
            Just one dark hour of shaken depths,
            Of bitter black despair-
            Another day will find me brave,
            And not afraid to dare.

        <collex:text>THE MASK
            So detached and cool she is
            No motion e'er betrays
            The secret life within her soul,
            The anguish of her days.
            She seems to look upon the world
            With cold ironic eyes,
            To spurn emotion's fevered sway,
            To scoff at tears and sighs.
            But once a woman with a child
            Passed by her on the street,
            And once she heard from casual lips
            A man's name, bitter-sweet.
            Such baffled yearning in her eyes,
            Such pain upon her face!
            I turned aside until the mask
            Was slipped once more in place.

        <collex:text>LANGSTON HUGHES was born in Joplin, Missouri, on the first of February, 1902. His mother was a school teacher, his father a lawyer. During most of his childhood he lived with his grandmother in Lawrence, Kansas, where he went to school. This old lady, Mary Sampson Patterson Leary Langston, was the last surviving widow of John Brown's Raid, her first husband having been one of the five colored men to die so gloriously at Harper's Ferry. She had then married Charles Langston, brother of the Negro senator, John M. Langston, and in the seventies they came to Kansas where the mother of the poet was born.
            When Langston Hughes was thirteen this grandmother died and the boy went to live with his mother in Lincoln, Illinois. A year later they moved to Cleveland where he attended and was graduated from the Central High School. Then followed fifteen months in Mexico where his father had been located for some years. Here the young man learned Spanish, taught English, and attended bull-fights. Here, too, he wrote “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” his first poem to be published in the magazines. In 1921 he went to New York for a year at Columbia University. A break with his father followed and he secured work for the summer on a truck farm on Staten Island. Then for almost two years he travelled as a member of the crew of freight steamers voyaging to the West Coast of Africa and Northern Europe. In February, 1924, he went to Paris. When he arrived he had seven dollars in his pockets; so he soon found a job as doorman in a Montmartre cabaret. Later he became second cook and pan-cake maker at the Grand Duc, a Negro night club where Buddy Gilmore sometimes played and Florence sang. That summer he went to Italy, and September learned Solocated teen months found him stranded in Genoa. He worked his way back to New York on a tramp steamer, painting and scrubbing decks.
            A year in Washington followed where he worked in the office of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, and later as a bus boy at the Wardman Park Hotel. There Vachel Lindsay read some of his poems and he was discovered by the newspapers. Then his first book, The Weary Blues, appeared. He has now resumed his formal education at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, which he says is a place of beauty and the ideal college for a poet. His second book of poems, Fine Clothes for the Jew, is a study in racial rhythms.

            Nobody'll dare
            Say to me,
            'Eat in the kitchen,' then. 
            Besides,

            I, too, am America.

            They hung my black young lover
            To a cross roads tree.
            Way Down South in Dixie
            (Bruised body high in air)
            I asked the white Lord Jesus
            What was the use of prayer.
            Way Down South in Dixie
            (Break the heart of me)
            Love is a naked shadow
            On a gnarled and naked tree.

            I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
            I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
            I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
            I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
            went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy
            bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

        <collex:text>Well, son, I'll tell you:
            Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
            It's had tacks in it,
            And splinters,
            And boards torn up,
            And places with no carpet on the floor----
            Bare.
            But all the time
            I'se been a-climbin' on,
            And reachin' landin's,
            And turnin' corners,
            And sometimes goin' in the dark
            Where there ain't been no light.
            So boy, don't you turn back.
            Don't you set down on the steps
            'Cause you finds it's kinder hard .
            Don't you fall now----
            For I'se still goin', honey,
            I'se still climbin',
            And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

        <collex:text>Thunder of the Rain God:
            And we three
            Smitten by beauty.
            Thunder of the Rain God:
            And we three
            Weary, weary.
            Thunder of the Rain God:
            And you, she, and I
            Waiting for nothingness.
            Do you understand the stillness
            Of this house
            In Taos
            Under the thunder of the Rain God?
            Sun
            That there should be a barren garden
            About this house in Taos
            Is not so strange,
            But that there should be three barren hearts
            In this one house in Taos —
            Who carries ugly things to show the sun?
            Moon
            Did you ask for the beaten brass of the moon?
            We can buy lovely things with money,
            You, she, and I,
            Yet you seek,
            As though you could keep,
            This unbought loveliness of moon.
            Wind
            Touch our bodies, wind.
            Our bodies are separate, individual things.
            Touch our bodies, wind,
            But blow quickly
            Through the red, white, yellow skins
            Of our bodies
            To the terrible snarl,
            Not mine,
            Not yours,
            Not hers,
            But all one snarl of souls.
            Blow quickly, wind,
            Before we run back
            Into the windlessness —
            With our bodies —
            Into the windlessness
            Of our house in Taos.

        <collex:text>GWENDOLYN B. BENNETT was born in Giddings, Texas, on July 8th, 1902. Her father was a lawyer and her mother was a school teacher. She received her elementary training in the Public Schools of Washington, D. C., and Harrisburg, Pa. She was graduated from the Girls' High School in Brooklyn, New York, during January, 1921.
            While she was in attendance there she was a member of the Felter Literary Society and the Girls' High School
            Dramatic Society, being the first Negro girl to have been elected to either of these societies. In an open contest
            she was awarded the first prize for a poster bearing the slogan Fresh Air Prevents Tuberculosis.
            She matriculated in the Fine Arts Department of Teachers' College, Columbia University, where she remained for two years. She then entered the Normal Art Course at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. She was the author of her class play each of the two years she was there. In her Junior Year she played the leading part in the play which she had herself written. She was graduated from Pratt Institute June 1924. She then became a member of the Howard University Faculty in Fine Arts as Instructor in Design, Water-color and Crafts. During the Christmas holidays of the school year 1924-25 Miss Bennett was awarded the Thousand Dollar Foreign Scholarship by the Alpha Sigma Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority at its Annual Convention held in New York City.
            She sailed for Cherbourg, France on June fifteenth, 1925. While in Paris she studied at the Académie Julian,
            The Académie Coloraossi and the École de Pantheon. Through the influence of Konrad Bercovici she was thrown in contact with the artist, Frans Masereel, one of France's best known modern painters. M. and Mme. Masereel offered Miss Bennett the hospitality of their home and together with their circle of friends did much to encourage her in her work while in Paris. She returned to America during June 1926.
            For the summer of 1926 she was employed at the Opportunity magazine where she acted in the capacity of Assistant to the Editor. September 1926 she returned to Howard University where she resumed her classroom
            work after a year's leave of absence.

            You were a sophist,
            Pale and quite remote,
            As you bade me
            Write poems—
            Brown poems
            Of dark words
            And prehistoric rhythms ...
            Your pallor stifled my poesy
            But I remembered a tapestry
            That I would some day weave
            Of dim purples and fine reds
            And blues
            Like night and death--
            The keen precision of your words
            Wove a silver thread
            Through the dusk softness
            Of my dream-stuff...

        <collex:text>TO A DARK GIRL
            I LOVE you for your brownness
            And the rounded darkness of your breast.
            I love you for the breaking sadness in your voice
            And shadows where your wayward eye-lids rest.
            Something of old forgotten queens
            Lurks in the lithe abandon of your walk
            And something of the shackled slave
            Sobs in the rhythm of your talk.
            Oh, little brown girl, born for sorrow's mate,
            Keep all you have of queenliness,
            Forgetting that you once were slave,
            And let your full lips laugh at Fate!

        <collex:text>YOUR SONGS
            When first you sang a song to me
            With laughter shining from your eyes,
            You trolled your music liltingly
            With cadences of glad surprise.
            In after years I heard you croon
            In measures delicately slow
            Of trees turned silver by the moon
            And nocturnes sprites and lovers know.
            And now I cannot hear you sing,
            But love still holds your melody
            For silence is a sounding thing
            To one who listens hungrily.

        <collex:text>FANTASY
            I SAILED in my dreams to the Land of Night
            Where you were the dusk-eyed queen,
            And there in the pallor of moon-veiled light
            The loveliest things were seen ...
            A slim-necked peacock sauntered there
            In a garden of lavender hues,
            And you were strange with your purple hair
            As you sat in your amethyst chair
            With your feet in your hyacinth shoes.
            Oh, the moon gave a bluish light
            Through the trees in the land of dreams and night.
            I stood behind a bush of yellow-green
            And whistled a song to the dark-haired queen ...

        <collex:text>Cemeteries are places for departed souls
            And bones interred,
            Or hearts with shattered loves.
            A woman with lips made warm for laughter
            Would find grey stones and roving spirits
            Too chill for living, moving pulses . . .
            And thou, great spirit, wouldst shiver in thy granite shroud
            Should idle mirth or empty talk
            Disturb thy tranquil sleeping.
            A cemetery is a place for shattered loves
            And broken hearts . . .
            Bowed before the crystal chalice of thy soul,
            I find the multi-colored fragrance of thy mind
            Has lost itself in Death's transparency.
            Oh, stir the lucid waters of thy sleep
            And coin for me a tale
            Of happy loves and gems and joyous limbs
            And hearts where love is sweet!
            A cemetery is a place for broken hearts
            And silent thought . . .
            And silence never moves, nor speaks,
            Nor sings.

            I shall hate you 
            Like a dart of singing steel
            Shot through still air
            At even-tide.
            Or solemnly
            As pines are sobre
            When they stand etched
            Against the sky.
            Hating you shall be a game
            Played with cool hands
            And slim fingers.
            Your heart will yearn
            For the lonely splendour
            Of the pine tree;
            While rekindled fires 
            In my eyes
            Shall wound you like swift arrows.
            Memory will lay its hands
            Upon your breast
            And you will understand
            My hatred.

            1
            With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,
            And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back
            In a carven sheath of Tamarack.
            He came with footsteps beautifully slow,
            And spoke in voice meticulously low.
            He came and Romance followed in his track. ...
            I did not ask his name I thought him Love;
            I did not care to see his hidden face.
            All life seemed born in my intaken breath;
            All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.
            He bent to kiss and raised his visor's lace ...
            All eager-lipped I kissed the mouth of Death.

            SOME things are very dear to me
            Such things as flowers bathed by rain
            Or patterns traced upon the sea
            Or crocuses where snow has lain ...
            The iridescence of a gem,
            The moon's cool opalescent light,
            Azaleas and the scent of them,
            And honeysuckles in the night.
            And many sounds are also dear-
            Like winds that sing among the trees
            Or crickets calling from the weir
            Or Negroes humming melodies.
            But dearer far than all surmise
            Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes.

        <collex:text>ARNA BONTEMPS explains that he was just tall enough to see above window sills when the first trolley car came down Lee Street in Alexandria, La. His mother, Marie Pembroke, had been born in this same town but his father had come out of Marksville, a smaller town of that state. Though exceedingly young and very frail, Marie Pembroke had taught school until her marriage, while her husband, Paul Bontemps, was a brick mason, the son and grandson of brick masons.
            With Arna Bontemps in his third year and a second child, a girl, just past one, the family left the South for San Francisco. However, they stopped in Los Angeles to visit relatives and have never moved further. Here the boy's mother died some nine years later and here his father is still living. Here also he received his early education in a rather irregular attendance of a number of schools. He went through the schools rapidly enough and in spite of being out several years received a college degree in his twentieth year.
            In the year following that he lost his illusions with reference to a musical career and returned to an original intention to eat bread by the sweat of teaching school. It is to be remembered that he went to college first with the purpose of taking a medical course but it took him only a day or two to decide better.
            He lives in New York City and is now twenty-four and married.

        <collex:text>I
            Once more, listening to the wind and rain,
            Once more, you and I, and above the hurting sound
            Of these comes back the throbbing of remembered rain,
            Treasured rain falling on dark ground.
            Once more, huddling birds upon the leaves
            And summer trembling on a withered vine.
            And once more, returning out of pain,
            The friendly ghost that was your love and mine.
            II
            Darkness brings the jungle to our room:
            The throb of rain is the throb of muffled drums.
            Darkness hangs our room with pendulums
            Of vine and in the gathering gloom
            Our walls recede into a denseness of
            Surrounding trees. This is a night of love
            Retained from those lost nights our fathers slept
            In huts; this is a night that must not die.
            Let us keep the dance of rain our fathers kept
            And tread our dreams beneath the jungle sky.
            III
            And now the downpour ceases.
            Let us go back once more upon the glimmering leaves
            And as the throbbing of the drums increases
            Shake the grass and dripping boughs of trees.
            A dry wind stirs the palm; the old tree grieves.
            Time has charged the years: the old days have returned.
            Let us dance by metal waters burned
            With gold of moon, let us dance
            With naked feet beneath the young spice trees.
            What was that light, that radiance
            On your face? — something I saw when first
            You passed beneath the jungle tapestries?
            A moment we pause to quench our thirst
            Kneeling at the water's edge, the gleam
            Upon your face is plain: you have wanted this.
            Let us go back and search the tangled dream
            And as the muffled drum-beats throb and miss
            Remember again how early darkness comes
            To dreams and silence to the drums.
            IV
            Let us go back into the dusk again,
            Slow and sad-like following the track
            Of blowing leaves and cool white rain
            Into the old gray dream, let us go back.
            Our walls close about us we lie and listen
            To the noise of the street, the storm and the driven birds.
            A question shapes your lips, your eyes glisten
            Retaining tears, but there are no more words.

        <collex:text>A BLACK MAN TALKS OF REAPING
            I HAVE sown beside all waters in my day.
            I planted deep, within my heart the fear
            That wind or fowl would take the grain away.
            I planted safe against this stark, lean year.
            I scattered seed enough to plant the land
            In rows from Canada to Mexico
            But for my reaping only what the hand
            Can hold at once is all that I can show.
            Yet what I sowed and what the orchard yields
            My brother's sons are gathering stalk and root,
            Small wonder then my children glean in fields
            They have not sown, and feed on bitter fruit.

        <collex:text>TO A YOUNG GIRL LEAVING THE HILL COUNTRY
            THE hills are wroth; the stones have scored you bitterly
            Because you looked upon the naked sun
            Oblivious of them, because you did not see
            The trees you touched or mountains that you walked upon.
            But there will come a day of darkness in the land,
            A day wherein remembered sun alone comes through
            To mark the hills; then perhaps you'll understand
            Just how it was you drew from them and they from you.
            For there will be a bent old woman in that day
            Who, feeling something of this country in her bones,
            Will leave her house tapping with a stick, who will (they say)
            Come back to seek the girl she was in these familiar stones.

            I thought I saw an angel flying low,

            Above the mulberry trees; but not again.
            Bethesda sleeps. This ancient pool that healed
            A host of bearded Jews does not awake.
            This pool that once the angels troubled does not move
            No angel stirs it now, no Saviour comes
            With healing in His hands to raise the sick
            And bid the lame man leap upon the ground.
            The golden days are gone. Why do we wait
            So long upon the marble steps, blood
            Falling from our open wounds? and why
            Do our black faces search the empty sky?
            Is there something we have forgotten? some precious thing
            We have lost, wandering in strange lands?
            There was a day, I remember now,
            I beat my breast and cried, “Wash me God,
            Wash me with a wave of wind upon
            The barley; O quiet One, draw near, draw near!
            Walk upon the hills with lovely feet
            And in the waterfall stand and speak.
            “Dip white hands in the lily pool and mourn
            Upon the harps still hanging in the trees
            Near Babylon along the river's edge,
            But oh, remember me, I pray, before
            The summer goes and rose leaves lose their red.”
            The old terror takes my heart, the fear
            Of quiet waters and of faint twilights.
            There will be better days when I am gone
            And healing pools where I cannot be healed.
            Fragrant stars will gleam forever and ever
            Above the place where I lie desolate.
            Yet I hope, still I long to live.
            And if there can be returning after death
            I shall come back. But it will not be here;
            If you want me you must search for me
            Beneath the palms of Africa. Or if
            I am not there then you may call to me
            Across the shining dunes, perhaps I shall
            Be following a desert caravan.
            I may pass through centuries of death
            With quiet eyes, but I'll remember still
            A jungle tree with burning scarlet birds.
            There is something I have forgotten, some precious thing.
            I shall be seeking ornaments of ivory,
            I shall be dying for a jungle fruit.
            You do not hear, Bethesda.
            O still green water in a stagnant pool!
            Love abandoned you and me alike.
            There was a day you held a rich full moon
            Upon your heart and listened to the words
            Of men now dead and saw the angels fly.
            There is a simple story on your face;
            Years have wrinkled you. I know, Bethesda!
            You are sad. It is the same with me.

        <collex:text>Then the golden hour
            Will tick its last
            And the flame will go down in the flower.
            A briefer length of moon
            Will mark the sea-line and the yellow dune.
            Then we may think of this, yet
            There will be something forgotten
            And something we should forget.
            It will be like all things we know :
            A stone will fail; a rose is sure to go.
            It will be quiet then and we may stay
            Long at the picket gate,
            But there will be less to say.

            THE fruit of the orchard is over-ripe, Elaine,
            And leaves are crisping on the garden wall.
            Leaves on the garden path are wet and rain
            Drips from the low shrubs with a steady fall.
            It is long, so long since I was here, Elaine,
            Moles have gnawed the rose tree at its root;
            You did not think that I would come again,
            Least of all in the day of falling fruit.

            All that night I walked alone and wept.
            I tore a rose and dropped it on the ground.
            My heart was lead; all that night I kept
            Listening to hear a dreadful sound.
            A tree bent down and dew dripped from its hair.
            The earth was warm; dawn came solemnly.
            I stretched full-length upon the grass and there
            I said your name but silence answered me.

        <collex:text>A TREE DESIGN
            A TREE is more than a shadow
            Blurred against the sky,
            More than ink spilled on the fringe
            Of white clouds floating by.
            A tree is more than an April design
            Or a blighted winter bough
            Where love and music used to be.
            A tree is something in me,
            Very still and lonely now.

        <collex:text>BLIGHT
            I HAVE seen a lovely thing
            Stark before a whip of weather:
            The tree that was so wistful after spring
            Beating barren twigs together.
            The birds that came there one by one,
            The sensuous leaves that used to sway
            And whisper there at night, all are gone,
            Each has vanished in its way.
            And this whip is on my heart;
            There is no sound that it allows,
            No little song that I may start
            But I hear the beating of dead boughs.

        <collex:text>[Awarded Alexander Pushkin Poetry Prize by Opportunity Magazine, June 1926]
            Golgotha is a mountain, a purple mound
            Almost out of sight.
            One night they hanged two thieves there,
            And another man.
            Some women wept heavily that night;
            Their tears are flowing still. They have made a river;
            Once it covered me.
            Then the people went away and left Golgotha
            Deserted.
            Oh, I've seen many mountains:
            Pale purple mountains melting in the evening mists and blurring on the borders of the sky.
            I climbed old Shasta and chilled my hands in its summer snows.
            I rested in the shadow of Popocatepetl and it whispered to me of daring prowess.
            I looked upon the Pyrenees and felt the zest of warm exotic nights.
            I slept at the foot of Fujiyama and dreamed of legend and of death.
            And I've seen other mountains rising from the wistful moors like the breasts of a slender maiden.
            Who knows the mystery of mountains!
            Some of them are awful, others are just lonely.
            ...
            Italy has its Rome and California has San Francisco,
            All covered with mountains.
            Some think these mountains grew
            Like ant hills
            Or sand dunes.
            That might be so —
            I wonder what started them all!
            Babylon is a mountain
            And so is Nineveh,
            With grass growing on them;
            Palaces and hanging gardens started them.
            I wonder what is under the hills
            In Mexico
            And Japan!
            There are mountains in Africa too.
            Treasure is buried there:
            Gold and precious stones
            And moulded glory.
            Lush grass is growing there
            Sinking before the wind.
            Black men are bowing.
            Naked in that grass
            Digging with their fingers.
            I am one of them:
            Those mountains should be ours.
            It would be great
            To touch the pieces of glory with our hands.
            These mute unhappy hills,
            Bowed down with broken backs,
            Speak often one to another:
            " A day is as a year, " they cry,
            " And a thousand years as one day. "
            We watched the caravan
            That bore our queen to the courts of Solomon;
            And when the first slave traders came
            We bowed our heads.
            "Oh, Brothers, it is not long!
            Dust shall yet devour the stones
            But we shall be here when they are gone. "
            Mountains are rising all around me.
            Some are so small they are not seen;
            Others are large.
            All of them get big in time and people forget
            What started them at first.
            Oh the world is covered with mountains!
            Beneath each one there is something buried:
            Some pile of wreckage that started it there.
            Mountains are lonely and some are awful.
            ...
            One day I will crumble.
            They'll cover my heap with dirt and that will make a mountain.
            I think it will be Golgotha.

        <collex:text>Born in New York City, May 30, 1903, and reared in the conservative atmosphere of a Methodist parsonage, Countee Cullen's chief problem has been that of reconciling a Christian upbringing with a pagan inclination. His life so far has not convinced him that the problem is insoluble. Educated in the elementary and high schools of New York City, with an A.B. degree and a Phi Beta Kappa Key from New York University, an M.A. from Harvard, arrantly opposed to any form of enforced racial segregation, he finds it a matter of growing regret that no part of his academic education has been drawn from a racial school. As a poet he is a rank conservative, loving the measured line and the skillful rhyme; but not blind to the virtues of those poets who will not be circumscribed; and he is thankful indeed for the knowledge that should he ever desire to go adventuring, the world is rife with paths to choose from. He has said, perhaps with a reiteration sickening to some of his friends, that he wishes any merit that may be in his work to flow from it solely as the expression of a poet—with no racial consideration to bolster it up. He is still of the same thought. At present he is employed as Assistant Editor of Opportunity, A Journal of Negro Life. His published works are Color, The Ballad of the Brown
            Girl, and Copper Sun.

            (First Published as "Lines to Certain of One's Elders" in Opportunity, June 1926. Republished as "Lines to Our Elders" in Caroling Dusk)
            (To Melanie)
            YOU too listless to examine
            If in pestilence or famine
            Death lurk least, a hungry gamin
            Gnawing on you like a beaver
            On a root, while you trifle
            Time away nodding in the sun,
            Careless how the shadows crawl
            Surely up your crumbling wall,
            Heedless of the Thief’s footfall,
            Death’s whose nimble fingers rifle
            Your heartbeats one by weary one,—
            Here’s the difference in our dying:
            You go dawdling, we go flying.
            Here’s a thought flung out to plague you:
            Ours the pleasure if we’d liever
            Burn completely with the fever
            Than go ambling with the ague.

            In days I hope will come,
            Ere youth has sped, and strength of mind,
            Ere voices sweet grow dumb.
            I have a rendezvous with Life,
            When Spring's first heralds hum.
            Sure some would cry it's better far
            To crown their days with sleep
            Than face the road, the wind and rain,
            To heed the calling deep.
            Though wet nor blow nor space I fear,
            Yet fear I deeply, too,
            Lest Death should meet and claim me ere
            I keep Life's rendezvous.

            (To John Trounstine)
            I LONG not now, a little while at least,
            For that serene interminable hour
            When I shall leave this Barmecidal feast
            With poppy for my everlasting flower;
            I long not now for that dim cubicle
            Of earth to which my lease will not expire,
            Where he who comes a tenant there may dwell
            Without a thought of famine, flood, or fire.
            Surely that house has quiet to bestow—
            Still tongue, spent pulse, heart pumped of its last throb,
            The fingers tense and tranquil in a row,
            The throat unwelled with any sigh or sob—
            But time to live, to love, bear pain and smile,
            Oh, we are given such a little while!

            Inscrutable His ways are, and immune
            To catechism by a mind too strewn
            With petty cares to slightly understand
            What awful brain compels His awful hand.

            GIVE over to high things the fervent thought⁠
            You waste on Earth; let down the righteous bar
            Against a wayward peace too dearly bought
            Upon this pale and passion-frozen star.
            Sweethearts and friends, are they not loyal? Far
            More fickle, false, perverse, far more unkind
            Is Earth to those who give her heart and mind.
            And you whose lusty youth her snares intrigue,
            Who glory in her seas, swear by her clouds,
            With Age, man’s foe, Earth ever is in league.
            Time resurrects her even while he crowds
            Your bloom to dust, and lengthens out your shrouds
            A day’s length or a year’s; she will be young,
            When your last cracked and quivering note is sung.
            She will remain the Earth, sufficient still,
            Though you are gone and with you that rare loss
            That vanishes with your bewildered will.
            And there shall flame no red, indignant cross
            For you, no quick white scar of wrath emboss
            The sky, no blood drip from a wounded moon,
            And not a single star chime out of tune.

            We shall not always plant while others reap
            The golden increment of bursting fruit,
            Nor always countenance, abject and mute,
            That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap ;
            Not everlastingly while others sleep
            Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
            Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
            We were not made eternally to weep.
            The night whose sable breast relieves the stark,
            White stars is no less lovely being dark,
            And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
            In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall.
            So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
            And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds.

        <collex:text>I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
            There never was a spring like this;
            It is an echo, that repeats
            My last year's song and next year's bliss.
            I know, in spite of all men say
            Of Beauty, you have felt her most.
            Yea, even in your grave her way
            Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
            Spring never was so fair and dear
            As Beauty makes her seem this year..
            I cannot hold my peace, John Keats,
            I am as helpless in the toil
            Of Spring as any lamb that bleats
            To feel the solid earth recoil
            Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
            Her tocsin call to those who love her,
            And lo! the dogwood petals cover
            Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
            White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
            About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
            While white and purple lilacs muster
            A strength that bears them to a cluster
            Of color and odor; for her sake
            All things that slept are now awake.
            And you and I, shall we lie still,
            John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
            Somehow I feel your sensitive will
            Is pulsing up some tremulous
            Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
            Grow music as they grow, since your
            Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
            For life that opens death's dark door.
            Though dust, your fingers still can push
            The Vision Splendid to a birth,
            Though now they work as grass in the hush
            Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.
            "John Keats is dead,” they say, but I
            Who hear your full insistent cry
            In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
            Know John Keats still writes poetry.
            And while my head is earthward bowed
            To read new life sprung from your shroud,
            Folks seeing me must think it strange
            That merely spring should so derange
            My mind. They do not know that you,
            John Keats, keep revel with me, too.

        <collex:text>Once riding in old Baltimore,
            Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,
            I saw a Baltimorean
            Keep looking straight at me.
            Now I was eight and very small,
            And he was no whit bigger,
            And so I smiled, but he poked out
            His tongue, and called me, "Nigger."
            I saw the whole of Baltimore
            From May until December;
            Of all the things that happened there
            That's all that I remember.

        <collex:text>DONALD JEFFREY Hayes was born November 16, 1904, in Raleigh, N. C. At the age of five his parents brought him to Atlantic City, N. J., where he attended the public schools through the freshman year of High School. In 1913 he moved with his family to Pleasantville, N. J.,
            where in his sophomore year of High School he was awarded, after a near student strike, court action and the dismissal of a member of the faculty—the highest debating honors. Following this unpleasantness, he went to Chicago where he studied privately the forms of poetry while completing his High School work. He graduated in 1926 from Englewood an honor student, and distinguished, as it were, as "The poet of Englewood” and “The Bronze God” as his fellow students dubbed him. He is at present planning a volume of his verse and studying the voice, planning to make his career in the concert field.

            Only a ghost inhabits here
            A ghost without desire
            Who sits before a shadowed hearth
            And warms to a spectral fire. ......

        <collex:text>"I was born at Axim on the African Gold Coast in 1904 on the 11th of May to singularly cultured and intellectual parents, my mother being one of the daughters of Judge Smith, the first Judge of the Excomission Court of Sierra  Leone, and my father being one of the three pioneer lawyers of the Gold Coast. 
            I am a Fanti, of the Fanti tribe which spreads from Axim right down the Gold Coast, to Acera, and is subdivided into groups speaking different dialects. It is said that the Acera branch, at one time, wandered away from the main body and eventually arrived also at the sea coast, speaking another tongue, but retaining the same customs. I spent five years in England, three of which were spent in school. I went to Penrohs College, Colwyn Bay in Wales, and on my return home became a school teacher in The Girls Vocational School, Sierra Leone. By twenty, I had the firm conviction that I was meant to write for Africa. This was accentuated by the help which our boys and girls need so much and fired by the determination to show those who are prejudiced against colour, that we deny inferiority to them, spiritually, intellectually and morally; and to prove it. I argued that the first thing to do, was to imbue our own people with the idea of their own beauty, superiority
            and individuality, with a love and admiration for our own country, which has been systematically suppressed. Consequently I studied the beautiful points of Negro physique, texture of skin, beauty of hair, soft sweetness of eyes, charm of curves, so that none should think it a shame to be black, but rather a glorious adventure."

        <collex:text>NATIVITY
            WITHIN a native hut, ere stirred the dawn,
            Unto the Pure One was an Infant born
            Wrapped in blue lappah that his mother dyed.
            Laid on his father's home-tanned deer-skin hide
            The babe still slept by all things glorified.
            Spirits of black bards burst their bonds and sang,
            “Peace upon earth" until the heavens rang.
            All the black babies who from earth had fled,
            Peeped through the clouds, then gathered round His head.
            Telling of things a baby needs to do,
            When first he opens his eyes on wonders new;
            Telling Him that to sleep was sweeter rest,
            All comfort came from His black mother's breast.
            Their gifts were of Love caught from the springing sod,
            Whilst tears and laughter were the gifts of God.
            Then all the wise men of the past stood forth
            Filling the air East, West, and South and North;
            And told him of the joys that wisdom brings
            To mortals in their earthly wanderings.
            The children of the past shook down each bough,
            Wreathed Frangepani blossoms for His brow;
            They put pink lilies in His mother's hand,
            And heaped for both the first fruits of the land.
            His father cut some palm fronds that the air
            Be coaxed to zephyrs while He rested there.
            Birds trilled their hallelujahs; and the dew
            Trembled with laughter till the babe laughed too.
            All the black women brought their love so wise,
            And kissed their motherhood into his mother's eyes.
            Note:
            lappah-a straight woven cloth tied round the waist to form a skirt. 
            Frangepani-An African flower.

        <collex:text>Rainy Season Love Song
            By Gladys May Casey Hayford
            Out of the tense awed darkness, my Frangepani comes;
            Whilst the blades of Heaven flash round her, and the roll of thunder drums,
            My young heart leaps and dances, with exquisite joy and pain,
            As storms within and storms without I meet my love in the rain.
            “The rain is in love with you darling; it’s kissing you everywhere,
            Rain pattering over your small brown feet, rain in your curly hair;
            Rain in the vale that your twin breasts make, as in delicate mounds they rise,
            I hope there is rain in your heart, Frangepani, as rain half fills your eyes.”
            Into my hands she cometh, and the lightning of my desire
            Flashes and leaps about her, more subtle than Heaven's fire;
            “The lightning’s in love with you darling; it is loving you so much,
            That its warm electricity in you pulses wherever I may touch.
            When I kiss your lips and your eyes, and your hands like twin flowers apart,
            I know there is lightning Frangepani, deep in the depths of your heart.”
            The thunder rumbles about us, and I feel its triumphant note
            As your warm arms steal around me; and I kiss your dusky throat;
            “The thunder'’s in love with you darling. It hides its power in your breast.
            And I feel it stealing o'er me as I lie in your arms at rest.
            I sometimes wonder, beloved, when I drink from life’s proffered bowl,
            Whether there's thunder hidden in the innermost parts of your soul.”
            Out of my arms she stealeth; and I am left alone with the night,
            Void of all sounds save peace, the first faint glimmer of light.
            Into the quiet, hushed stillness my Frangepani goes.
            Is there peace within like the peace without? Only the darkness knows.

        <collex:text>The calabash wherein she served my food,
            Was smooth and polished as sandalwood:
            Fish, as white as the foam of the sea,
            Peppered, and golden fried for me.
            She brought palm wine that carelessly slips
            From the sleeping palm tree's honeyed lips.
            But who can guess, or even surmise
            The countless things she served with her eyes?

        <collex:text>BABY COBINA
            Brown BABY COBINA, with his large black velvet eyes,
            His little coos of ecstacies, his gurgling of surprise,
            With brass bells on his ankles, that laugh where'er he goes,
            It's so rare for bells to tinkle, above brown dimpled toes.
            BROWN BABY CORINA is so precious that we fear
            Something might come and steal him, when we grown-ups are not near;
            So we tied bells on his ankles, and kissed on them this charm---
            “Bells, guard our Baby Cobina from all devils and all harm."

        <collex:text>I was born in Lumberton, North Carolina, September 10, 1905. My parents, Professor and Mrs. D. P. Allen, were then in charge of Whitin Normal School, a thriving secondary school which was discontinued at my father's death some ten years ago.
            My high school days were spent at Redstone Academy, located at Lumberton. I can think of nothing of interest to mention concerning this period, except that I was an omnivorous reader, and learned to love literature, and especially poetry, with a passionate intensity.
            Four years of college at Johnson C. Smith University followed, during which time I studied a little, read a great deal, and dabbled in music and literature. Among other things, I experimented with the piano enough to become a fairly advanced performer. It was during my stay at college that my longing to become a writer grew particularly ardent. A good many of my literary attempts saw the light in  school and local periodicals, some bringing encouraging comment. In June of 1926, I was graduated, having been chosen as valedictorian for that year.
            I feel it necessary to mention here that my college career was made possible mainly through the sacrifices of my noble and devoted mother. In the past winter I was engaged in teaching at Kendall Institute in Sumter, S. C. During this time some of my work appeared in Opportunity, American Life, The Southwestern Christian Advocate, and The Lyric West. This year one of my poems, “To Melody," was awarded the prize for the best sonnet in a state-wide contest conducted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (North Carolina Division).

            And graceful as a swallow on the wing!
            A melody that seems to move, and sing,
            And quiver, in its radiant ecstasy,
            That bends and rises like a slender tree
            Which sways before the gentle winds of Spring!
            Ah, men will ever love thee, holy art!
            For thou, of all the blessings God hath given,
            Canst best revive and cheer the wounded heart
            And nearest bring the weary soul to Heaven!
            Of all God's precious gifts, it seems to me,
            The choicest is the gift of melody.

            Her cheeks? The ripened chestnut's hue,–

            Caressed by sunbeams dancing through
            Red leaves that flutter down.
            Her form? A slender pine that sways

            In summer, when the south wind plays
            Soft music through the trees.
            Herself? A laughing, joyous sprite
            Who smiles from dawn till dark,

            And carefree as a lark.

        <collex:text>Written by the author for Caroling Dusk: 
            I was born in Washington, D. C., on the second of July, 1906, and have never ceased to marvel at the fact. After attending public school with very good marks (I was thrashed if I did not lead my class), I attended Dunbar High School of the same city. When I was thirteen my father died, my greatest impression being the crowded church and the vault. Mother left Washington for New York where my brother and I joined her in a few months. New York was an adventure and still is. A glorious something torn from a novel. Even the first hard winter with mother ill and my feet on the ground was just a part of it. My gathering bits of fur to paste on newspaper to cut out for inner soles for my shoes, the walking to work to save carfare, and getting lunch as best I could, all seemed romantic and highly colored. Weren't there theatres and lights, Broadway, Fifth Avenue ... and lights?
            Noise and bustle and high silk hats and flowers in pots in the Bowery. Hobble cars creeping like caterpillars up Broadway. Taxis and people and forty-second street. Traffic towers and tall buildings. Wasn't this New York? A year later I discovered Harlem. I was at that time an art apprentice at seven fifty a week. But that was too little money. So I became in turn errand boy for ten dollars, bell hop in an all-womens' hotel for eleven fifty-five, eighteen with tips, secretary and confidence man for a modiste for twenty-five, ornamental iron-worker and designer for twenty-eight, and elevator operator for thirty. Then I had the mumps and despite the glamor of New York, I wanted to go, just go somewhere. So I went to Panama working my way. Then New York again and a costume design class. A visit home to D. C. where I met Langston Hughes. Opportunity accepted my first poem. Washington for eleven months then New York again. I arrived penniless and have remained so. Dilatory jobs, trips to New England, Florida, California and Canada, but always New York again. The few drawings and sketches made on these trips were either destroyed, lost, or given away en route. I began to write seriously and to paint just as seriously; I entered contests but never won. I am still penniless and happy and planning to go to Paris and Vienna by hook or crook.

            A silhouette am I
            On the face of the moon
            Lacking color
            Or vivid brightness
            But defined all the clearer
            Because
            I am dark,
            Black on the face of the moon.
            A shadow am I
            Growing in the light,
            Not understood
            As is the day,
            But more easily seen
            Because
            I am a shadow in the light.

        <collex:text>The Death Bed
            All the time they were praying
            He watched the shadow of a tree
            Flicker on the wall.
            There is no need of prayer,
            He said,
            No need at all.
            The kin-folk thought it strange
            That he should ask them from a dying bed.
            But they left all in a row
            And it seemed to ease him
            To see them go.
            There were some who kept on praying
            In a room across the hall
            And some who listened to the breeze
            That made the shadows waver
            On the wall.
            He tried his nerve
            On a song he knew
            And made an empty note
            That might have come,
            From a bird's harsh throat.
            And all the time it worried him
            That they were in there praying
            And all the time he wondered
            What it was they could be saying.

        <collex:text>A Triviality
            By Waring Cuney
            Not to dance with her
            Was such a trivial thing.
            There were girls more fair than she,—
            Today
            Ten girls dressed in white.
            Each had a white rose wreath.
            They made a dead man’s arch
            And ten strong men
            Carried a body through.
            Not to dance with her
            Was a trivial thing.

            And I wonder, had I been there,
            Would I have doubted too
            Or would the dream have told me,
            What this man speaks is true.

            You proud ones, proud of the skill
            With which you play this game—Civilization;
            Do not forget that it is a very old game.
            Men used to play it on the banks
            Of the Tigris and the Euphrates
            When the world was a wilderness.
            There is a circle around China

            Carthage is a heap of ashes.
            And Rome knew the pomp and glory

            Dust,
            Shall it stir again?
            Will Pharaohs rise and rule
            And their armies march once more?
            Civilization continually shifts
            Upon the places of the earth.

        <collex:text>No Images
            By Waring Cuney
            She does not know
            Her beauty
            She thinks her brown body
            Has no glory
            If she could dance
            Naked
            Under palm trees
            And see her image in the river
            She would know
            But there are no palm trees
            On the street
            And dish water gives back no images

            They cannot untie.
            Then I come in
            Uninvited.
            They do not ask me in;
            I am the radical,
            The bomb thrower,
            I untie the knot
            That they have made,
            And they never thank me.

        <collex:text>HER love is true I know,
            Much more true
            Than angel's love;
            For angels love in heaven
            Where a thousand harps
            Are playing
            She loves in a tenement
            Where the only music
            She hears
            Is the cry of street car brakes
            And the toot of automobile horns
            And the drip of a kitchen spigot
            All day.
            Her love is true I know.

        <collex:text>SOUTH STREET
            (Philadelphia, Pa.)
            South Street is not beautiful,
            But the songs of people there
            Hold the beauty of the jungle,
            And the fervidness of prayer.
            South Street has no mansions,
            But the hands of South Street men
            Built pyramids along the Nile
            That Time has failed to rend.
            South Street is America,
            Breast of the foster mother
            Where a thousand ill-kept children
            Vie for suck, with one another.

        <collex:text>Jungle Taste
            There is a coarseness
            In the songs of black men 
            Of the sea.
            There is a weird strangeness
            In the songs of black men 
            Which sounds not strange
            To me.
            There is beauty
            In the faces of black women,
            Jungle beauty
            And mystery.
            Dark, hidden beauty
            In the faces of black women
            Which only black men
            See.
            Finality
            Trees are the souls of men
            Reaching skyward.
            And while each soul
            Draws nearer God
            Its dark roots cleave
            To earthly sod :
            Death, only death
            Brings triumph to the soul.
            The silent grave alone
            Can bare the goal.
            Then roots and all
            Must lie forgot
            To rot.

            What do I care for morning,
            For a shivering aspen tree,
            For sun flowers and sumac
            Opening greedily?
            What do I care for morning,
            For the glare of the rising sun,
            For a sparrow's noisy prating,
            For another day begun?
            Give me the beauty of evening,
            The cool consummation of night,
            And the moon like a love-sick lady,
            Listless and wan and white.
            Give me a little valley
            Huddled beside a hill,
            Like a monk in a monastery,
            Safe and contented and still,
            Give me the white road glistening,
            A strand of the pale moon's hair,
            And the tall hemlocks towering
            Dark as the moon is fair.
            Oh what do I care for morning,
            Naked and newly born--
            Night is here, yielding and tender--
            What do I care for dawn!

        <collex:text>SONNET TO A NEGRO IN HARLEM
            You are disdainful and magnificent-
            Your perfect body and your pompous gait,
            Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate,
            Small wonder that you are incompetent
            To imitate those whom you so despise
            Your shoulders towering high above the throng,
            Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song,
            Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.
            Let others toil and sweat for labor's sake
            And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.
            Why urge ahead your supercilious feet?
            Scorn will efface each footprint that you make.
            I love your laughter arrogant and bold.
            You are too splendid for this city street!

        <collex:text>SUMMER MATURES
            SUMMER matures. Brilliant Scorpion
            Appears. The Pelican's thick pouch
            Hangs heavily with perch and slugs.
            The brilliant-bellied newt flashes
            Its crimson crest in the white water.
            In the lush meadow, by the river,
            The yellow-freckled toad laughs
            With a toothless gurgle at the white-necked stork
            Standing asleep on one red reedy leg.
            And here Pan dreams of slim stalks clean for piping,
            And of a nightingale gone mad with freedom.
            Come. I shall weave a bed of reeds
            And willow limbs and pale nightflowers,
            I shall strip the roses of their petals,
            And the white down from the swan's neck.
            Come. Night is here. The air is drunk
            With wild grape and sweet clover.
            And by the sacred fount of Aganippe
            Euterpe sings of love. Ah, the woodland creatures,
            The doves in pairs, the wild sow and her shoats,
            The stag searching the forest for a mate,
            Know more of love than you, my callous Phaon.
            The young moon is a curved white scimitar
            Pierced thru the swooning night.
            Sweet Phaon. With Sappho sleep like the stars at dawn.
            This night was born for love, my Phaon.
            Come.

        <collex:text>POEM
            LITTLE brown boy,
            Slim, dark, big-eyed,
            Crooning love songs to your banjo
            Down at the Lafayette
            Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
            High sort of and a bit to one side,
            Like a prince, a jazz prince. And I love
            Your eyes flashing, and your hands,
            And your patent-leathered feet,
            And your shoulders jerking the jig-wa.
            And I love your teeth flashing,
            And the way your hair shines in the spotlight
            Like it was the real stuff.
            Gee, brown boy, I loves you all over.
            I'm glad I'm a jig. I'm glad I can
            Understand your dancin' and your
            Singin', and feel all the happiness
            And joy and don't care in you.
            Gee, boy, when you sing, I can close my ears
            And hear tom toms just as plain.
            Listen to me, will you, what do I know
            About tom toms? But I like the word, sort of,
            Don't you? It belongs to us.
            Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
            And the way you sing, and dance,
            And everything.
            Say, I think you're wonderful. You're
            Allright with me,
            You are.

            [Opportunity Poetry Prize 1926] 
            To climb a hill that hungers for the sky,
            To dig my hands wrist deep in pregnant earth,
            To watch a young bird, veering, learn to fly,
            To give a still, stark poem shining birth.
            To hear the rain drool, dimpling, down the drain
            And splash with a wet giggle in the street,
            To ramble in the twilight after supper,
            And to count the pretty faces that you meet.
            To ride to town on trolleys, crowded, teeming
            With joy and hurry and laughter and push and sweat —
            Squeezed next a patent-leathered Negro dreaming
            Of a wrinkled river and a minnow net.
            To buy a paper from a breathless boy,
            And read of kings and queens in foreign lands,
            Hyperbole of romance and adventure,
            All for a penny the color of my hand.
            To lean against a strong tree's bosom, sentient
            And hushed before the silent prayer it breathes,
            To melt the still snow with my seething body
            And kiss the warm earth tremulous underneath.
            Ah, life, to let your stabbing beauty pierce me
            And wound me like we did the studded Christ,
            To grapple with you, loving you too fiercely,
            And to die bleeding — consummate with Life.

        <collex:text>BOTTLED
            Upstairs on the third floor
            Of the 135th Street library
            In Harlem, I saw a little
            Bottle of sand, brown sand
            Just like the kids make pies
            Out of down at the beach.
            But the label said: “This
            Sand was taken from the Sahara desert.”
            Imagine that! The Sahara desert!
            Some bozo's been all the way to Africa to get some sand.
            And yesterday on Seventh Avenue
            I saw a darky dressed fit to kill
            In yellow gloves and swallow tail coat
            And swirling a cane. And everyone
            Was laughing at him. Me too,
            At first, till I saw his face
            When he stopped to hear a
            Organ grinder grind out some jazz.
            Boy! You should a seen that darky's face!
            It just shone. Gee, he was happy!
            And he began to dance. No
            Charleston or Black Bottom for him.
            No sir. He danced just as dignified
            And slow. No, not slow either.
            Dignified and proud! You couldn't
            Call it slow, not with all the
            Cuttin' up he did. You would a died to see him.
            The crowd kept yellin' but he didn't hear,
            Just kept on dancin' and twirlin' that cane
            And yellin' out loud every once in a while.
            I know the crowd thought he was coo-coo.
            But say, I was where I could see his face,
            And somehow, I could see him dancin' in a jungle,
            A real honest-to-cripe jungle, and he wouldn't have on them
            Trick clothes—those yaller shoes and yaller gloves
            And swallow-tail coat. He wouldn't have on nothing.
            And he wouldn't be carrying no cane.
            He'd be carrying a spear with a sharp fine point
            Like the bayonets we had “over there."
            And the end of it would be dipped in some kind of
            Hoo-doo poison. And he'd be dancin' black and naked and gleaming.
            And he'd have rings in his ears and on his nose
            And bracelets and necklaces of elephants' teeth.
            Gee, I bet he'd be beautiful then all right.
            No one would laugh at him then, I bet.
            Say! That man that took that sand from the Sahara desert
            And put it in a little bottle on a shelf in the library,
            That's what they done to this shine, ain't it? Bottled him.
            Trick shoes, trick coat, trick cane, trick everything--
            all glass--
            But inside--
            Gee, that poor shine!

        <collex:text>Summer comes.
            The ziczac hovers
            'Round the greedy-mouthed crocodile.
            A vulture bears away a foolish jackal.
            The flamingo is a dash of pink
            Against dark green mangroves,
            Her slender legs rivalling her slim neck.
            The laughing lake gurgles delicious music in its throat
            And lulls to sleep the lazy lizard,
            A nebulous being on a sun-scorched rock.
            In such a place,
            In this pulsing, riotous gasp of color,
            I met Magalu, dark as a tree at night,
            Eager-lipped, listening to a man with a white collar
            And a small black book with a cross on it.
            Oh Magalu, come! Take my hand and I will read you poetry,
            Chromatic words,
            Seraphic symphonies,
            Fill up your throat with laughter and your heart with song.
            Do not let him lure you from your laughing waters,
            Lulling lakes, lissome winds.
            Would you sell the colors of your sunset and the fragrance
            Of your flowers, and the passionate wonder of your forest
            For a creed that will not let you dance?

        <collex:text>Ah, little road all whirry in the breeze,
            A leaping clay hill lost among the trees,
            The bleeding note of rapture streaming thrush
            Caught in a drowsy hush
            And stretched out in a single singing line of dusky song.
            Ah little road, brown as my race is brown,
            Your trodden beauty like our trodden pride,
            Dust of the dust, they must not bruise you down.
            Rise to one brimming golden, spilling cry!
