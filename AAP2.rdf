APOSTROPHE TO TIME. 
O, fleeting Time! whence art thou come? 
   And whither do thy fotsteps tend? 
Deep in the past where was thy home, 
   And where thy future journey’s end? 
Thou art from vast eternity, 
   And unto boundless regions found; 
But what and where’s infinity? 
   And what know we of space unbound? 
The furrowed brow betokens age; 
   But who thy centuries can tell? 
Was ancient seer or learned sage 
   In wisdom’s lore e’er versed so well? 
From childhood hast thou wandered thus, 
   Companionless and lone, through space, 
With mystery o’er thy exodus, 
   And darkness ’round thy resting place? 
What lengthened years have come and gone, 
   Since thou thy tireless march began? 
Since Luna’s children sang at dawn, 
   The wonders of creation’s plan? 
How many years of gloom and night 
   Had passed, long ere yon king of day 
Had reigned his fiery steeds of light, 
   And sped them on their shining way? 
Thou knowest—Thou alone, O thou! 
   Omniscient and eternal Three! 
To whose broad eye all time is now— 
   The past, with all eternity; 
In whose dread presence shall I stand, 
   When time shall sink to rise no more, 
In that broad sea of thy command, 
   Whose waves roll on, without a shore. 
(January 3, 1863) 
CREATION LIGHT. 
Deep in the unrecorded past, 
There was an age of darkness vast, 
And boundless as the realms of space. 
An age that held in its embrace, 
And in an embryotic state, 
All worlds and systems, small and great. 
An inorganic age, a night 
In which no star or ray of light, 
In all the myriad ages gone, 
Had rose or smiled that night upon. 
A dismal, shoreless waste and void, 
Where nature, crude and unemployed, 
A shapeless, heterogenous mass 
Had lain for ages, that surpass 
The numerate skill of all the line 
Of men or angels to define. 
But when in spirit the mighty God 
Moved o’er the dark, abysmal flood, 
And raised his omnific voice of might, 
And said to the deep, "Let there be light!” 
Lo! a bright orb of deathless flame 
From out the womb of darkness came, 
And ere the silence was restored, 
In radiant beams of light were poured 
Upon a drear and cheerless waste, 
Where gloom and chaos had long embraced. 
“Let there be light!” and God’s first born, 
Clothed in the princely garb of morn, 
Assumed his long pre-ordered place, 
And dropped the mantling from his face. 
Grim darkness saw, and filled with dread, 
Her ebon pinions widely spread, 
And flew with terror-stricken fright 
Before the piercing beams of light. 
“Let there be light!” and high in heaven, 
Sun, moon and stars, and planets seven, 
Stood in their lots, moved in their spheres, 
And time began his march of years. 
As nature law immured in gloom, 
And rayless as the lifeless tomb, 
Until the orient dawn of light 
Dispelled the darkness of the night. 
E’en so, in ignorance groped mankind, 
Till reason’s torch illumed the mind. 
They saw the burning sun at noon, 
And the ever-changing moon, 
And saw the myriad stars that blaze 
And fill with their resplendent rays 
The deep nocturnal vaults on high, 
But never thought or questioned why. 
Thought makes the man, ’tis thought that soars 
Reason, the realms of thought explores. 
Oh, reason! wondrous attribute, 
Thou land-mark drawn ’twixt man and brute 
Thou art creation’s highest test, 
Her universal alchymist; 
For by thy torch mankind may trace 
Nature e’en to her secret place, 
And there with meek, becoming pride, 
May cast the mystic veil aside; 
May check the lightning in its speed, 
Make it subservient to his need; 
Measure the sun as with a chain, 
Prognosticate the snow, the rain; 
Distance the earth from pole to pole, 
And mark the seasons as they roll. 
Oh, thou! eternal source of light, 
Ineffable and infinite, 
Whom angels praise and saints adore, 
Whose glory is and was before. 
Before the morning stars in songs sublime, 
Chanted the wondrous birth of time, 
Whose glory is, was and shall be, 
When time has filled his destiny; 
And when the orbit lamps above, 
Those burning children of thy love, 
Shall fade from out the vaulted sky, 
And sun and moon any systems die; 
Creation sink in rayless gloom, 
And night and chaos their reign resume, 
Still wilt Thou all changeless be, 
God, Jehovah, Deity. 
ADMONITION.* 
*This poem was delivered by the author at the Freed¬ 
man’s and Union Commission picnic, Park hotel 
grounds, Alamed, Tuesday, May 15, 1866.
Where e’er the fetter has been broken, 
Where e’er the bondsman has been freed, 
Where e’er a sentence has been spoken 
In behalf of human need. 
Whether on towering, snow-capped mountain, 
Or in the soft and flowery vale, 
Whether beside the gurgling fountain, 
Or ’long the streamlet’s watery trail. 
Whether amid, the leafy wildness 
Of Bashan’s sturdy oaks and pines, 
Or ’midst the sheen and plastic mildness 
Where art presides and genius shines. 
In grand effect they still are living, 
Unblurred by age or flight of time; 
And unto earth are ever giving 
Lessons, wondrous and sublime. 
Like trees of fadeless beauty growing, 
In all their grand omnific pride, 
Whose fruits of life and joy bestowing, 
Have blest the land and blest the tide. 
Those noble acts, through all the ages 
Have lived, all worthy to commend, 
And the true historian’s pages, 
With such, shall glow ’till time shall end. 
For there’s a link that binds together 
All the peoples of this our earth, 
A band which nothing can dissever, 
The germ of man’s primeval birth; 
A deathless kinship—a relation, 
A brotherhood that knows no bounds, 
Pervading earth in every station 
Where e’er the human form is found. 
And there, without regard to nation, 
Without respect to birth or hue, 
Man stands sublime in his creation, 
Begirt with freedom as his due. 
The ox and yoke have some relation, 
As do the horse and curbing rein. 
But in the day of man’s formation 
He was not fashioned for the chain. 
And nowhere, save through base perversion 
Of the grand “wherefore” he was made, 
Has dark presumption’s foul coercion 
E’er dared his freedom to invade. 
That freedom which to him was given 
Ere Eden’s first-born rose had died, 
Or sin the human heart had riven, 
Or man his Maker had defied. 
Given, and with it came dominion 
O’er all the fish that throng the sea, 
O’er all the birds of downy pinion, 
O’er all the prowling beasts of prey; 
And o’er the cattle wildly roving, 
And over every creeping thing; 
And o’er the earth with God’s approving 
Smile, man was crowned Creation’s king. 
And yet, in all this vast arrangement, 
In all the amplitude of plan, 
No grant is found for the estrangement 
Whereby man lords it over man. 
“I am the Lord!” said the Eternal. 
“Worship thou no God but me! 
Nor in thy memory hold supernal 
Aught of all thy destiny.” 
And wheresoever an invasion 
’Gainst this injunction has been planned* 
Heaven has made it the occasion 
For rendering bare his chastening hand. 
And oh! how dire the retributions 
Which have followed evermore, 
Intestine wars and revolutions 
Have drenched the earth with human gore. 
Egypt, and Greece, and Rome, and Carthage, 
This heaven injunction set at naught, 
And where are they? The merest vestige 
Remains of all they proudly wrought. 
Those rock-bound cities whose proud basis 
Seemed all impervious to decay, 
Time’s mighty besum, that erases 
The pride of man, has swept away. 
Nor has our birth-land been excepted, 
Her hundred fields all bathed in blood, 
Bear the impress of truth rejected, 
And scourgings of an angry God. 
The chastenings of a God whose justice 
And fearful judgments move apace, 
And faithful ever in their office 
To vindicate an injured race. 
Beware! if God has built this nation, 
All its constituents are good 
And needful to its preservation, 
Whether they be stone or wood. 
We may not comprehend the structure 
In full minutia and design, 
‘Nor trace its varied architecture 
In arris, groove, and curve, and line. 
Be faithful and the great Grand Master 
Will on his trestle-board make plain 
All that’s obtuse, but no whit faster 
Than ’twere needful to explain. 
But, we'll not pain the ear by telling 
Of all the wrongs they have endured, 
Of all the brutal, fiend-impelling 
Outrage, to which they’ve been inured. 
No, these shall form their own dark story, 
The which, like spectres from the dust, 
Shall haunt this nation, bruised and gory, 
Till all her laws are pure and just. 
Till there shall be no class restriction, 
Her statutes free from every flaw, 
Her native sons without distinction, 
Stand equals all—before the law. 
That those from whom the chains are falling 
May be inspired with a zeal 
Commensurate with the lofty calling, 
Which every patriot heart should feel. 
The chain, thank God! the chain is broken, 
Its severed links may do us harm; 
But the Grand Fiat has been spoken, 
And free forever is the arm. 
Though free from chains, yet there are thousands 
Poor, homeless, clotheless and unfed, 
And these, in praying us to aid them, 
They plead the merits of their dead. 
They plead their feeless toil and labor, 
Conducive to this nation’s worth, 
Whereby she stands today a neighbor, 
Courted by all the realms of earth. 
And they plead the noble daring 
Of their two hundred thousand brave 
Warriors, who with manly bearing 
Went forth, a struggling land to save. 
And hence, their deathless claim upon us, 
Claims such as we can ne’er forego; 
Ay, claims that truth doth urge upon us, 
The just assuagement of their woe. 
Though poor they be, and very many, 
Their care and keeping’s in our hands, 
The rich man’s pound, the poor man’s penny, 
If not withheld when need demands. 
But freely tendered and with kindness, 
To these, the long and sore oppressed, 
Know that our land with heaven’s benignness, 
In rich abundance shall be blest. 
Though poor they be, yet their condition 
And of its wherefore, know we all, 
We know the base of their petition, 
The truth and justness of their call. 
And if we fail in our high station, 
And turn a deaf ear to their cry, 
And death remove them through starvation, 
Know we that God, the God Most High, 
Will charge to us the “deep damnation” 
Of their death so premature; 
And we shall perish as a nation, 
As sure as truth and heaven are pure. 
But since a far more righteous era 
Has dawned upon our erring land, 
And one whose morning sun shines clearer 
Than when it shone upon the brand. 
Therefore, in view of all the sorrows; 
In view of all the grief and pain; 
In view of all the nameless horrors, 
Foul emanations of the chain. 
O let us toil with might unceasing 
Until the land which gave us birth, 
Whose glorious sunlight is increasing, 
Becomes the flower of all the earth. 
Until beneath her spreading pinions, 
And outstretched folds of liberty, 
Men of all nations and dominions 
Shall dwell in peace and unity. 
To this great end, then, let us labor, 
Knowing the fruits of our employ, 
Shall raise up many a prostrate, neighbor, 
And fill their grateful hearts with joy. 
And then the “Union Aid Commission,” 
Whose worthy object is to bless 
And change the hapless, sad condition 
Of all the sons of wretchedness, 
Shall in its mission work a marvel, 
In seeking out the passing poor, 
Of roofless cabin, hut and hovel, 
And blessings leave at every door. 
O wondrous mission, high and holy! 
Never is labor so sublime 
As when it seeks to lift the lowly, 
Without regard to class or clime, 
And thus forgeteth self for others, 
And labors for a common good, 
Regarding all mankind as brothers, 
And earth as one great neighborhood. 
God bless that mission! may it prosper 
And spread its. wings o’er land and seas, 
Till like the gentle dews of vesper, 
Its joys are felt in every breeze. 
THE BLACK MAN’S WRONGS. 
Breathe softly on my harp, O Muse! 
In gentle strains now clothe its songs, 
And thy inspiring* force infuse, 
While singing of the black man’s wrongs 
Wrongs that defy the painter’s skill, 
Nor can the tongue e’er tell them o’er, 
They seem at first a tiny rill, 
And then a sea without a shore. 
But here the feelings of the soul 
Defy the language of the tongue. 
Therefore if we in part unroll 
The black man’s wrongs, our task is done. 
First view him in the Torrid Zone, 
Sporting amid luxurious groves 
Where nature delveth all alone, 
And man in search of pleasure roves. 
While there his every meal was spread 
By genial nature’s bounteous hand, 
Where he from childhood’s morn had fed, 
With all her gifts at his command. 
At noon beneath the spreading palm, 
Or prostrate in some shady bower, 
His soul inhaled the fragrant balm, 
By zephyrs brought from fruit and flower. 
No raging sea of sorrow there 
Had e’er their muddy billow swept, 
Over his soul’s instilling fear, 
Nor had the man of pleasure wept. 
But alas! this home was entered, 
Entered by Christians wise and bold; 
Christians, whose great heart was centered 
On their nation’s god of gold. 
By Christians he was borne away, 
In fetters o’er the trackless main, 
To where the gospel’s blaze of day 
Looks smilingly on blood and pain. 
Then begins a tale of weeping, 
Qf rapine and of woe, 
Only known to him that's keeping 
The record of man’s acts below. 
For since he crossed the rolling flood, 
And landed on Virginia’s shore, 
His path presents a scene of blood 
Unknown to history’s page of yore. 
His dearest friends are crushed and torn 
Asunder, ne’er to meet again. 
Fettered and branded, gazed and borne 
Where moral death and darkness reigned. 
Their wailing cries afflict the ear, 
Their groans and sighs so pain the heart, 
Till often the unconscious tear 
For these poor hapless, sad ones start. 
Tis not in mortal man to paint 
The damning scenes transacted there, 
At thought of which the heart grows faint 
And clouds the brow with dark despair. 
Were all the gags, bolts, bars and locks, 
The thumbscrews, handcuffs and the chain, 
The branding-iron and the stocks 
That have increased the Afric’s pain, 
Piled up by skillful smith or mason 
With care in one great concave heap, 
Those gory gyves would form a basin 
Unnumbered fathoms wide and deep. 
Could all their blood and tears alone 
Flow in this basin, deep and wide, 
The proudest ship the world hath known 
Could on that basin's bosom ride. 
And then, could all their groans and sighs. 
Their anguished wailings of despair, 
But freight that ship, just where she lies, 
'Twould sink that mammoth vessel there. 
Their blood and tears are treasured up 
Where all their sighs and groans are stored, 
And will from retribution's cup 
Upon this guilty land be poured. 
America, where is thy blush? 
Or, is thy very heart of stone? 
Will not thy millions cease to crush 
The sable outraged few that groan? 
Should they, because their skins are dark, 
Forever wear the galling chain? 
Has hope for them no cheering spark 
That wrong will one day cease to reign? 
Thou great Goliath, stay thy frown! 
Boast not thyself in thy great strength, 
The brooklet's stone may bring thee down! 
Thy sword may clip thy head at length! 
Gone forth, long since, is the decree 
That binds my shattered hopes in one, 
Though I shall sleep, yet time will be, 
What God has spoken, He will have done. 
“Judgment is mine! I will repay!” 
Thus saith the builder of the sky, 
Although his judgments still delay, 
With every sun they're drawing nigh. 
Though hand in hand the wicked join, 
“They shall be punished,” saith the Lord. 
Although like floods their strength combined, 
They cannot stay the scourging cord. 
For wrongs and outrage shall surcease; 
The millions shall not cry in vain, 
For God the captive will release 
And break the bondsman's galling chain. 
From 'neath the lash thev shall extend 
Their bleeding, trembling hand to God, 
And He will to their rescue send 
This retributive, chastening rod. 
For if the blood of Abel slain 
When crying, reached the Eternal's ear, 
And was avenged on guilty Cain, 
Has not this land great cause to fear? 
And if the soul poured out in prayer, 
Together with the falling tear, 
Be objects of kind Heaven’s care, 
Then surely, retribution’s near. 
And if the darkest hour of night 
Is just before the misty dawn, 
Which flies away for morning light, 
To gild and glad the fragrant dawn. 
Then soon will freedom’s clarion burst, 
In sweet clear strains of liberty, 
For of all time this is the worst 
And darkest night of slavery. 
Then, lo! the sages of your land 
Assembled in your highest court, 
There leagued in sacrilegious band, 
Send to the world the foul report, 
Which funded with the horse and cow, 
And merchandise of every name, 
All men who wear the sable brow, 
Regardless of their rank or fame. 
Because the negro’s skin is dark 
They say he’s made but for a slave; 
They felt not this when he, a mark, 
On Bunker Hill stood ’mid the brave; 
Nor felt they thus when Attucks fell 
In seventeen seventy—fifth of March, 
When proud Boston tolled a bell 
That caused each freeman’s brow to arch. 
Attucks, that brave and manly black, 
Whose heart’s blood was the first to flow 
When England made her first attack 
On Boston’s freemen, years ago. 
Then, then, was that proposal made 
Which drew those black men in the field, 
Who gladly joined the great crusade 
And learned to die, but not to yield. 
They said, “To all who will bear arms, 
And fight in freedom’s holy war, 
Will liberty with open arms 
Receive, and crown with freedom’s star.” 
Then bondmen threw their chains aside, 
Grasped a sword without a sheath, 
And to the siege rushed on with pride 
To fight for liberty, or death. 
And when old England’s ships of war 
Came dashing through the crested foam, 
Threatening to blot out every star 
That gemmed and decked their father’s home. 
Then, black and white men stood abreast, 
A massive wall of living stone, 
And on, with earthquake tread, they pressed 
And wrung this land from England’s throne. 
They, at the siege of Lexington, 
At Bunker Hill and Brandywine, 
At Monmouth and at Bennington, 
Marched in freedom’s battling line. 
Nor. did they sheathe their reeking sword. 
Nor lay their heavy armor down, 
Till the last booming cannon roared 
That swept the English from Yorktown. 
Black warriors lay amid the host 
That slumbers now near Bunker’s heights. 
Who fell contending at their post 
For liberty and equal rights. 
And on every hard-fought field, 
Where freedom’s noble sons were slain, 
There, stretched beside their battle shield, 
Lay black and white men on the plain. 
When pestilential famine’s breath 
Swept through the camp at Valley Forge, 
There black and white men slept in death, 
And gentle Schuylkill sang their dirge. 
In days of yore, when carnage stared 
This then great nation in the face, 
Then blacks, as men they did regard, 
And classed them with the human race. 
But now they have no wars to fight, 
No “Independence” to be won; 
Sweet, smiling peace veils Bunker’s heights. 
And all their battling work is done. 
Now from this nation’s hall of state 
Comes Roger Tanney’s vile desire, 
Composed of all the pith and hate 
Of that dark land of slavery. 
With him this guilty land unites 
In trampling down the wronged and wrecked. 
By claiming Negroes have no rights 
That bind the white man to respect. 
And thus, the men whose father’s fought, 
Of tyranny this land to rid, 
They crushed to earth without a thought 
Of the'great deeds their father’s did. 
Alas! are there no meeds of praise 
For freedom’s heroes who have died, 
Who bore the burden in those days 
When bravest men’s brave hearts were tried 
Is gratitude forever dead 
If not, would they thus destroy 
The men whose father’s fought and bled 
For blessings that they now enjoy? 
Look on the face of men like Ward, 
Day, Douglas, Pennington, and then 
Tell me whether these should herd 
With beasts of burden, or with men? 
Why not in view of all the lights 
That mirror forth the black man’s wrongs, 
Extend to them those sacred rights 
That justly to a man belongs? 
They say he’s veiled in sable hues, 
And hence, with them of sinners chief, 
They’re more fastidious than the Jews, 
Who hung the Christ and spared the thief. 
Consistency, spread, spread thy wings! 
Fly! fly! thou hast no mission here! 
Fly to the land of pagan kings 
And unfurl thy bright credentials there. 
Thou hast no mission in a land 
Where man is crushed for being black; 
As well go preach among the damned, 
Or sing songs to a maniac! 
But, oh, how long, great God! how long, 
Shall this sad state of things remain? 
How long shall right succumb to wrong? 
How long shall justice plead in vain? 
How long! Oh, may we live to see 
That natal day of jubilee, 
When every fetter shall be riven, 
And every heart praise God in heaven. 
THE DAWN OF FREEDOM.* 
* Delivered at River Park, Toledo, August 3, 1868, 
at the grand festival in commemoration of the abolition 
of slavery in the British West India Isles. 
When summer’s hot and sultry rays 
Are burdening our summer days, 
And men and beast are sore oppress’d, 
And vainly sigh and pant for rest; 
Rest from the turbid cares of life, 
Their wild convulsions and its strife— 
Then something whispers in our ear, 
And tells us of a covert near; 
A quiet, soft and cool retreat, 
Where morn and evening dew drops meet; 
Where Nature in her gorgeous dress, 
Stands forth in all her loveliness; 
And where the gentle zephyrs play, 
And sport with leaflets all the day: 
Oh! who would not for such a scene 
Of artless beauty, native sheen, 
Turn from the busy haunts of men, 
And from the city’s noxious fen, 
And hie to some sequestered nook, 
Some peaceful dell beside the brook, 
Or bask within the ample shade 
Of some proud monarch of the glade, 
Where every passing breath of air, 
Comes fraught with odors rich and rare; 
Though housed beneath this sylvan bower, 
Where Sol's hot rays lose half their power, 
And where the green sward at our feet, 
Invites us to an humble seat? 
Yet come we not from homes afar, 
By coach and boat and flying car, 
These native scenes to eulogize, 
How much soe’er their wealth we prize— 
’Tis not of thee my native land, 
   Nor of thy triple folds so bright, 
Nor of thy legions proud and grand, 
   That slew oppression in the fight. 
’Tis not of thee, though worthy thou, 
Of many a song and plighted vow. 
'Tis not of thee that we have ta’en, 
Our harp to wake its humble strain; 
But of a land and far away, 
   Bathed by the ever restless sea— 
A land where freedom’s sons to-day, 
   Are met in gladsome jubilee. 
With them we would commemorate 
   An epoch in the march of years, 
An epoch ever proud and great, 
   The chief of freedom’s pioneers. 
A day that saw a million chains 
   Fall from a million shackled limbs, 
And heard a million glad refrains, 
   Of mingled shouts and prayers and hymns. 
A day that saw a million men 
   Stand up in God's pure sunlight free, 
Who never in all their lives till then, 
   Had breathed one breath of liberty. 
The driver’s horn, at early morn, 
   Had bid them to their task repair, 
Where oft the lash, and many a gash 
   Was waiting their arrival there. 
And thus they had from youth to age, 
   And from the cradle to the tomb, 
Been driven forth from stage to stage, 
   Through moral night and mental gloom. 
The day that saw their fetters riven— 
   The day that saw their gloom depart, 
And heard their prayers and thank shouts given, 
   To freedom’s God fresh from the heart. 
They’ve met to-day to celebrate, 
   And while they sing our songs shall rise, 
And bowing, we shall venerate 
   A common parent in the skies. 
Hail! hail! glad day, thy blest return, 
   We greet with prayer and speech and song, 
And while from eulogies full urn, 
   We drink to thee, march proudly on: 
March proudly on as heretofore, 
   Thou Black man's borrowed day of joy, 
For long our native land was poor, 
   Too poor to yield such grand employ; 
Columbia had her many days 
   Of frolic, sport and joy, and glee 
But none of universal praise— 
   No soul-inspiring jubilee— 
No day on which from palace dome, 
   And from the lowly thatched-roof tent, 
Would mutual heartfelt greetings come, 
   Memorial of some grand event. 
She had her Independence day, 
   But what was July's Fourth to him 
Whose class and kind and kindred lay, 
   All fetter-bound in mind and limb; 
And what the pilgrim’s yearly feast, 
   And what the birth of Washington, 
To him whose grievous bonds increased 
   With each new day’s unfolding sun? 
He had no day—there was not one 
   Of all the days that formed the year, 
Which did not point to wrongs begun, 
   And oft beguile him of a tear. 
And thus ten score of years passed by, 
   And yet no star of hope arose— 
No rainbow arched his gloomy sky, 
   Nor respite offered to his woes. 
Hence, when at length the British Isles, 
   Burst forth in shouts of liberty, 
He set at naught a thousand miles, 
   And joined them in their jubilee. 
Glad but to know on God’s green earth, 
   One spot was consecrate and free, 
Where Truth and right had given birth, 
   Unto a black man’s jubilee! 
Though subjects of another land, 
   And dwellers ’mid a tropic sea, 
Yet they, like him, had worn the brand, 
   And now were what he longed to be. 
And in that act he faintly scan’d 
   The outstretched arms of Deity; 
Extending t’ward his native land, 
   The golden wand of Liberty, 
And dimly saw four million chains, 
   In broken wild disorder lay. 
And Slavery’s blight with all its stains, 
   Banished his native land for aye— 
Hence, when upon the wheels of time, 
   The glorious First would roll its round, 
His gladsome notes with theirs would chime, 
   And cause the-valleys to resound— 
In honor of that day and deed 
   When Briton’s swarthy sons were freed— 
That day when Justice wrenched from Might 
   The keys of power so long detained, 
And clothed on man his every right, 
   Which foul oppression had restrained. 
That day, when, after twenty years’ 
   Persistence, pleading and appeal, 
Midst all the scorn and taunt and jeers 
   That selfish bigots dare reveal— 
When those who pleaded had grown gray, 
And many, alas! had passed away— 
Passed away, and left undone 
The work their noble hearts begun. 
But Wilberforce—long live his name! 
With trembling voice, still pressed his claim 
In Parliament, in Court, or Hall; 
His theme was, LIBERTY FOR ALL! 
He claimed that Briton had no right 
To suffer man, nor black nor white, 
To wear perforce a slavish chain 
Within her realm, by land or main 
That such too long had been the case. 
And even then, to her disgrace, 
A group of Isles, far out from land, 
And sheltering ’neath her own command/ 
Were pouring forth a piteous wail 
On every breeze and passing gale. 
His voice at length Britannia heard, 
And lo! her mighty heart was stirred— 
Stirred for the tale so often told, 
And unto thousands had grown old, 
Fell for the first time on her ear, 
And from her heart compelled a tear— 
Compelled a tear for the man enchained— 
Compelled a tear for the sin which stained 
The proud escutcheon of her land, 
And stamped it with a slaver’s brand. 
Then swiftly went an edict forth, 
Of grave importance, matchless worth; 
Close followed by that proud decree 
Which swept the land and swept the sea, 
Where’er the British flag unfurled 
Throughout the regions of the world, 
And there established in the name 
Of Briton’s throne, of Britain’s fame, 
Upon the purest, broadest plan, 
ETERNAL LIBERTY FOR MAN! 
Then Freedom’s joyous angel flew 
   With lightning speed o’er land and wave, 
And loud her clarion trumpet blew, 
   And woke to life each panting slave. 
Woke them to life? They did not sleep, 
   But there in anxious silence stood, 
Waiting the welcome sound to sweep 
   Athwart Atlantic’s briny flood. 
And when the sound fell on their ear, 
They laughed, they wept, they knelt in prayer 
And rising from their bended knees, 
They sang in joyous ecstacies, 
Till hill and vale and distant plain 
Gave back the gladsome sound again. 
Oh! for a Raphael’s hand to draw 
   The matchless grandeur of that sight, 
That earth might see as angels saw 
   From off the parapets of light; 
For shining ones of heavenly birth 
   Bent o’er the jasper walls on high, 
And caught the jubilant songs of earth 
   And bore them upward to the sky; 
And Heaven gave audience to the strain 
   Of those fair minstrels as they sang, 
Gathering up the glad refrain 
   With which the hills and valleys rang, 
And sending them forever on, 
   And on, and on, eternally; 
For Heaven itself can boast no song 
   Of sweeter strain than Liberty. 
The heart with exultation glows, 
   Discanting on the joyous theme 
Of broken chains and buried woes— 
   ’Twere glorious, though ’twere but a dream. 
But since it is a truth sublime, 
   On history’s page inscribed as such, 
And brightening with the march of time, 
   We cannot say in praise too much. 
We cannot laud the truth too high, 
   Nor praise too much the noble deed; 
Nor can we brand too deep the lie 
   Where innocence is caused to bleed 
Nor can we say too much in praise 
   Of Britain’s bloodless victory; 
Nor of the glow and halo blaze 
   Which circling India's Jubilee, 
When Freedom waved her wand and spoke, 
And lo! a million chains were broke. 
No weary interregnum lay 
'Twixt Slavery’s night and Freedom’s day; 
But when their fetters fell to earth, 
’Twas followed by a very birth. 
And in the change which there began, 
Stood up a Briton and a man— 
A Briton, in fact, in every sense, 
His new creation to commence. 
Though great as was this noble deed, 
Whereby a million souls were freed, 
And a million Britons made 
Of men whom crime had long betrayed. 
Yet ’twas no action based upon 
Some worthy deed these may have done— 
Some service rendered in a time 
Of revolution, blood and crime. 
No, these had no such claims to press— 
Their only plea was their distress; 
They ne’er had fought ’gainst Scot or Dane, 
That British freedom might obtain; 
Nor had they in dread peril’s hour, 
When bravest hearts were wont to cower, 
Been called to take a patriot's stand 
And quell the treason of the land. 
Yet, when their liberties were given 
’Twas like the genial rays of heaven— 
So pure, so just—no rights denied; 
’Twas Freedom, broad, unqualified. 
Yes, Freedom in its broadest sense, 
Of unrestrained significance; 
No force work that—no soulless cheat; 
But thorough, once done and complete! 
In this, Britannia’s proudest act, 
The world beheld a noble fact; 
They saw what truth had long required— 
Humanity had long desired— 
They saw it, and they understood, 
For Britain did it as she should; 
She broke the yoke, banished the chain, 
And left no link thereof remain! 
No, not in all her broad spread land 
Left she a relic of the brand! 
But let us here a question press: 
Could she, in justice, have done less 
Could she a single right suppress 
And not have made a mockery 
Of all her towers of Liberty? 
Would not the whole, from base to dome, 
Become the meanest cheat, a sham, a gnome 
Whereon the finger of disdain 
Might trace the link-marks of the chain? 
Though men may prate of Blacks and Whites, 
There is no such thing as halving rights! 
All partial justice is unjust, 
And merits man's profound distrust! 
In truth there is no safety short 
Of freedom's unrestrained resort; 
All less than this is tyranny— 
All more than that is bigotry. 
The principle that dare withold 
The least known rights, on growing bold 
Would grind the subject to a brute 
And e'en the claim to life dispute, 
Despite all vain prerogatives! 
Despite the fame which power gives — 
Despite the verdict of the throng. 
What e’er curtails a right is wrong 
And quite as wrong in temperate zone 
   As 'twere beneath a tropic sky; 
'Neath a Republic or a Throne 
   'Twere but the same, a heartless lie! 
'Gainst which in Truth all conquering might 
The brave should arm themselves and fight 
For manhood, self-hood and the right, 
Valiant and fearless, though all alone, 
Knowing that if they battle on, 
That in the future ever near 
To those who fight, and trust and fear, 
Success will crown their work of love, 
And God, in smiling from above, 
Will say, “Well done, faithful and true, 
A crown of stars and a robe's thy due!" 
Now cast your eyes o’er this fair land, 
   Where hopes and fears alternate rise, 
Where long the demon of the brand 
   Stalked boldly forth in native guise. 
Here, where in opulence he sat, 
   And waved his ebon rod of might, 
And waved it where our rulers met, 
   And many trembled at the sight 
Their trembling fed his arrogance 
   And flattered his ambitious dream, 
Till puffed with vain intolerance, 
   He dared aspire to rule supreme, 
And seized the dictatorial chair— 
   Blandished the weapons of his power, 
And by his own vain greatness swore 
   To rule or ruin from that hour. 
Then rose the legions of the North 
   In all their majesty and might, 
And ’gainst his minions and the South 
   Went forth to battle and to fight; 
And after much of wasted life, 
   Attended by a fearful cost, 
The South, o’ercome, gave up the strife, 
   And all her hopes as staked and lost. 
Had then this land her duty done, 
   In justice and without delay, 
There would have been beneath the sun 
   No land so free as this today. 
Not only would the chain be broke, 
   But veil be rent and wall removed, 
And all that would the taunt provoke 
   In simple justice disapprove 
All the base relics of the night, 
   Of barbarism’s foulsome reign; 
We should have banished at the sight 
   Of reason’s torch and freedom’s train, 
For there’s no spot where in its pride 
   Yon tri-hued starry flag doth wave, 
That manhood’s claims should be denied, 
   Or rights withheld the recent slave. 
The yester bondsman must be made 
   Not only part, but wholly free: 
There must not live a single shade 
   To dim his manhood’s liberty; 
When such obtains, throughout the land, 
   Then shall this gladsome song be sung 
By myriad voices proud and grand, 
   The aged mingling with the young: 
“The long black night of bondage, 
   With all its fiendish train, 
Of nameless wrongs and outrage, 
   At length has ceased to reign; 
And Freedom has arisen, 
   And gone forth in her might, 
Nor left a slavish prison 
   Her glorious name to blight; 
And chains that were enthralling, 
   The friendless and the poor, 
And yokes that were so galling, 
   Have changed to molten ore, 
And o’er our mighty nation 
   Now and forever free, 
Floats proud in exultation, 
   Our Bird of Liberty. 
Throw out your starry banners, 
   And let them float the gale, 
Sweeping our broad Savannas, 
   With freedom in their trail— 
Out, out! on every flag-staff, 
   Or low or towering grand, 
Out and let the welkin laugh 
   In honor of our land; 
And you, ye lofty mountains, 
   And gorgeous vales profound, 
Where gush forth crystal fountains, 
   Your gladsome notes resound; 
And lake and flowing river, 
   And streamlets everywhere, 
In ripling wavelets quiver 
   The joys ye would declare; 
And merry woodland songsters, 
   And beast and lowing kine, 
And fish and ocean monster 
   Your varied notes combine— 
Then shall the sons of gladness, 
   Five millions, wronged, arise, 
And with the shouts of gladness 
   All nature vocalize, 
Until the hosts of Heaven 
   Shall catch the joyous strain, 
Floating aloft unriven, 
   From mountain, vale and main; 
And by that crystal river, 
   And on that glassy sea, 
Where harpers stand forever, 
   Reecho Liberty; 
For O, there is in earth or Fleaven 
   No sweeter note or purer key 
To mortals known, or angels given, 
   Than peerless, chainless Liberty!” 
Now in conclusion e’er we lay 
   Our shattered harp in silence by, 
To westward turn the mental eye, 
   And once more greet the far away. 
Though years have passed since freedom’s morn, 
   First dawned on those glad Isles at sea, 
Yet there to-day is upward borne, 
   The grateful peans of the free— 
To God, who holds within his hands 
   The destiny of men and lands; 
The destiny of every sphere 
   In heaven’s blue fields remote or near— 
To Him, God of the earth and skies, 
   To-day their songs and prayers arise. 
And thus we stretch our puny arm, 
   Across the broad, unfathomed deep, 
With heart-congratulations warm, 
   For all the free-born joys they reap. 
Long may their Island-home remain, 
   As now, beneath the fostering care 
Of Freedom’s wise and glorious reign,' 
   Where each his manly rights may share. 
Long may the banner of the free, 
   Wave o’er them in its purity— 
Pure as the zephyrs in their flight— 
   Chaste as the radiant stars of night. 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 
The Poet laments the discord of his Harp, and 
its disuse, until answering Freedom's call he again 
essays its harmony. He portrays the conflict, and 
- gives thanks to God for the dawning day of Free¬ 
dom. He rejoices that Columbia is free; he 
eulogizes the moral heroes, and describes how 
America is “marching on" in the footsteps of the 
warlike “Hero John." 
The cause of this fratricidal war is next given, 
and the challenge of Slavery to Liberty. He 
then invokes the spirits of our “sleeping sires" 
from their “beds of dust," and bids the nation 
listen to their warning voices. He concludes by 
prophecying that a glorious peace will be secured 
when Liberty is inscribed upon the banners of the 
Union. 
Emancipation of the slaves in the District of Columbia and in the British West Indian Isles. 
Harp of my soul, though thou hast hung 
Suspended from the willow bough 
Till much distorted, warped and sprung, 
And discord reigns within thee now, 
Yet glad I take thee thence again, 
Responsive to the joyous call 
Which comes from isles far o’er the main, 
And from this nation’s stately hall. 
Thy shattered chords I strive to mend, 
That they may no preventive be. 
And all thy latent powers I’ll bend 
To chant one song to Liberty. 
O, Liberty! inspiring theme, 
Thou innate boon from God to man! 
Without thee joy were but a dream, 
And life—a drear and wretched span. 
But with thee, every breeze that’s given 
Seems wafted from some sunny isle; 
They swell the heart with joyous leaven, 
And paint the cheek with pleasure’s smile. 
Oh! heavenly boon, destined to be 
This erring nation’s honored guest, 
When shall the blessings of the free 
Pervade the millions now oppressed? 
Hark, hark! what sounds are those that sweep 
Thitherward o’er the vasty deep? 
Louder by far than aught before— 
Terrible as the thunder’s roar! 
Lo! ’tis the clash of Freedom’s stars 
Rushing on to the field of Mars; 
Rushing on with a force unknown— 
Rushing on through the torrid zone; 
Legion’s their name, and in their wake 
The heavens veil and the mountains quake, 
And streamlets, long before run dry, 
Now flood the land with crimson dye, 
While ’long their banks, o’er field and plain, 
Are thickly strewn the recent slain, 
And from the breath which they exhale 
A rank miasma fills the vale. 
Thank God! a glorious dawn betides 
Oppression’s long and rayless night, 
And one that promise well provides 
With many a hoped for ray of light—- 
A light that bids far to extend, 
E’en to the deepest, darkest vales, 
And from visual orbits rend 
All vile accumulated scales. 
For Liberty, though long enthralled, 
Is rending now each servile band, 
And will, ere long, become installed 
Proud monarch of this glorious land; 
The tiny cloud, the promise star, 
Are now above the horizon— 
Behold them, through the ranks of war, 
In graceful triumph marching on. 
Unfurl your banners to the breeze— 
Let Freedom’s tocsin sound amain! 
Until the islands of the seas 
Reecho with the glad refrain: 
Columbia’s free! Columbia’s free! 
Her teeming streets, her vine-clad groves, 
Are sacred now to Liberty 
And God, where every right approves. 
Thank God, the Capital is free; 
The slaver’s pen, the auction block, 
And gory lash of cruelty 
No more this nation’s pride shall mock; 
No more within those ten miles square 
Shall men be bought and women sold, 
Or infants sable-hued and fair, 
Exchanged again for paltry gold. 
Today the Capital is free! 
And free those halls where Adams stood 
And plead for man’s humanity, 
And for a common brotherhood; 
Where Sumner stood, whose world wide fame 
And eloquent philosophy 
Has clustered round his deathless name, 
Bright laurels for eternity; 
Where Wilson, Lovejoy, Wade and Hale, 
And other lights of equal power, 
Have stood, like warriors clad in mail, 
Before the giant of this hour, 
Co-workers in a common cause, 
Laboring for their country’s weal 
By just enactments, righteous laws, 
And burning, eloquent appeal; 
To whom we owe, and gladly bring, 
The grateful tributes of our hearts. 
And while we live to muse and sing, 
These in our songs shall claim their parts. 
For now Columbia’s air doth seem 
Much purer than in days agone, 
And now her mighty heart, I deem, 
Has lighter grown by marching on! 
Marching on! through blood and strife, 
Marching on! through wasted life, 
Marching on! to the glorious day 
When the last foul brand is swept away. 
Marching on! o’er the graveless dead, 
Marching on! through streamlets red— 
Red with the vain hearts ebbing tide 
Of rebels slain in their vaunted pride. 
Marching on! with a foot as firm 
As that which careless treads the worm, 
With sword unsheathed and power to wield, 
And a dauntless heart that will not yield. 
Thus Liberty goes marching on, 
Step for step, with the “hero John!” 
In whom oppression basely slew 
The bravest son e’er freedom knew. 
He fell—but Freedom set her price, 
Counting his silver threads o’er thrice; 
She pledged to each and ev^ry one 
A heartless tyrant sire or son, 
But while her lenient wrath delayed, 
Still fiercer grew oppression’s raid, 
And when denied the Chair of State, 
He boldly donned the guise of hate. 
And forthwith armed his minions all, 
With rifle, cannon, bomb and ball, 
And in the frenzy of his ire, 
On Sumpter rained a storm of fire. 
Thus slavery threw the gauntlet down, 
And stripped it bare of every guise, 
Then rent a star from Freedom’s crown 
And closed the door of compromise. 
Though Liberty indignant grew, 
Yet, with an all-forbearing hand, 
She strove to tame the ranting shrew, 
And save the glory of her land. 
But no! a tyrant’s cup of guilt 
Was now preparing to run o’er — 
The sheathless sword, from point to hilt, 
Must revel in the purple gore. 
From warnings oft they’d nothing learned, 
In sin more sinful still had grown, 
Till Heaven’s displeasure they have earned, 
And lo! their blood must now atone. 
Warned by all their sleeping sires, 
Whose lives were pledged ’gainst tyranny, 
Who taught beside their homestead fires 
The dread results of slavery; 
Who drew from reason living facts, 
Based on the ever present past, 
To prove that sure destruction tracks 
Oppression’s train, however vast, 
And floating down the lapse of years, 
Their voice of warning calls to us, 
In tones expressive of their fears— 
Fears for their country’s future—thus: 
“We find within the Book of Fate 
This page of small uncertainty: 
At any risk, however great, 
Ere long the bondmen will be free: 
For when the measure of their grief 
Will not contain another tear, 
And bitter groanings call rejief, 
Then surely God will interfere. 
“Beware, lest what ye deal to those, 
At length upon yourselves recoil— 
The arm of right will interpose, 
And then the spoiled will reap the spoil. 
For wrong doth execute with wrong, 
And surely will he execute, 
Though retributions tarry long— 
Yet fail they never in their fruit. 
“When we the future contemplate, 
And then reflect that God is just, 
We tremble for our country's fate.” 
Thus speak they from their beds of dust. 
Nor could they, even had the cloud 
Which veils the future from our view 
Been quite removed, and they allowed 
To range beyond, spoke aught more true. 
What if the dead, the noble dead, 
Keep watch above their former state; 
Would these no spirit-tears have shed 
O'er scenes enacted here of late? 
Think you that shriek and dying groan 
Arising from the gory sward, 
Could sweep athwart their spirit zone 
And stir no sympathetic chord? 
But wherefore this unmeaning strife, 
And wherefore all this waste of life? 
The richest blood of northern veins 
Is pouring out like heaven’s rains; 
And still their braves are rallying round 
The stripes and stars, at the bugle sound; 
But still we press the question, why 
Are all these brave ones called to die? 
Why, is the bristling bayonet 
Upon the death charged rifle set? 
Why does the deafening cannon’s roar, 
Reverberate from shore to shore? 
And why (the question still is pressed), 
Why is the nation sore distressed? 
America! America! 
Thine own undoing thou hast wrought, 
For all thy wrongs to Africa 
This cup has fallen to thy lot, 
Whose dregs of bitterness shall last 
Till thou acknowledge God in man; 
Till thou undo thine iron grasp, 
And free thy brother and his clan. 
Till thou restore again the pledge, 
The garment, and the golden wedge; 
Till Achan, and his latest kin, 
Without the camp shall meet their sin. 
Till then, this fratricidal war, 
Which all so justly should abhor, 
Will neither change its wasting mood, 
Nor with a shallow truce conclude. 
No! no! there ne’er will come a peace, 
Nor will this war of brothers cease, 
While on Columbia’s fair domain, 
A single bondsman clanks his chain. 
For God, who works through fire and sword, 
And through the spirit of His word, 
Has witnessed all their bitter grief, 
And now has come to their relief. 
To hasten freedom’s glorious time, 
And save in treasure and in life, 
Count Hunter’s policy no crime; 
Arm each and all to end the strife. 
Upon your rallying banner’s write, 
The magic words of liberty— 
And thousands, panting for the fight, 
Will press to war and victory. 
Then will the Northern loyal blacks, 
Who anxious are to join the fray, 
Soon buckle on their haversacks, 
/ And shoulder arms, and hie away. 
And then the war which bids to last 
Through years to come, will soon be past 
And rolling years shall but increase 
In permanence our glorious peace. 
For the land shall bloom when the foe is slain, 
And peace, long exiled, shall return again; 
And the door of Janus again shall close, 
And the crimson’s sword in its sheath repose 
And the galling chain, and yoke of the slave, 
Shall pollute no more the home of the brave. 
Till then let us pray—till then let us trust 
Ever in God, who is faithful and just. 
THE DAY AND THE WAR. 
SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THE IMMORTAL 
Captain JOHN BROWN, 
THE HERO, SAINT AND MARTYR OF HARPER’S FERRY, 
The following poem is most respectfully inscribed, 
by one who loved him in life, and in death 
would honor his memory. 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 
The Poet laments the long- years of enslave¬ 
ment of his race, but rejoices that the Emancipa¬ 
tion Proclamation is the harbinger of the good 
time coming, and has at length given him 
“A fitting day to celebrate.” 
He shows how this wicked Rebellion, instituted 
to perpetuate Slavery, will cause “the final aboli¬ 
tion’' of the accursed institution.—The Colored 
people are incited to prove themselves worthy of 
the position they must assume, by patriotism, for¬ 
titude and virtue. 
The deceitful policy of the European Govern¬ 
ments is examined and criticised—their jealousy 
of the growing power of the American Union; 
their sympathy with the Rebels; the material aid 
and comfort they render unto the Confederacy, 
and their desire to effect the dismemberment of 
the Republic. England, remembering the loss of 
the Colonies, is covertly aiding the Rebellion, and, 
while professing neutrality, is supplying them 
with ships and munitions of war. 
He next sings of the heroism of the colored 
troops—their deeds of valor at Milliken’s Bend— 
bravery of Miller’s men, of which company all 
save one were either slain or wounded—and of 
the heroic achievements of the Black Brigade. 
He relates a vision of the War, and portrays 
in vivid colors the horrors of a battlefield after 
the fight. An angel appears, who announces the 
advent of Peace. The warrior returns from the 
carnage of battle; his sword is turned into a plow¬ 
share, his spear into a reaping-hook, and a “real 
Republic” is formed. 
In conclusion, he eulogizes the God-approving 
act of President Lincoln in issuing the great 
Emancipation Proclamation, and predicts that 
when posterity is enumerating the benefactors of 
mankind, “great Lincoln’s name will lead the 
host.” 
P. A. BELL. 
THE DAY AND THE WAR. 
Twelve score of years were long to wait 
A fitting day to celebrate: 
’Twere long upon one’s natiye soil 
A feeless drudge in pain to toil. 
But Time that fashions and destroys, 
And breeds our sorrows, breeds our joys, 
Hence we at length have come with cheer, 
To greet the dawning of the year— 
The bless’d return of that glad day, 
When, through Oppression’s gloom, a ray 
Of joy and hope and freedom burst, 
Dispelling that insatiate thirst 
Which anxious years of toil and strife 
Had mingled with the bondman’s life. 
A fitting day for such a deed, 
But far more fit when it shall lead 
To the final abolition 
Of the last slave’s sad condition: 
Then when the New Year ushers in, 
A grand rejoicing shall begin; 
Then shall Freedom’s clarion tone 
Arouse no special class alone, 
But all the land its blast shall hear, 
And hail with joy the jubilant year; 
And maid and matron, youth and age, 
Shall meet upon one common stage, 
And Proclamation Day shall be 
A National Day of Jubilee. 
No longer ’neath the weight of years— 
No longer merged in hopeless fears— 
Is now that good time, long delayed, 
When right, not might, shall all pervade. 
Drive hence despair—no longer doubt, 
Since friends within and foes without 
Their might and main conjointly blend 
To reach the same great, glorious end— 
The sweeping from this favored land 
The last foul chain and slavish brand. 
No longer need the bondman fear, 
For lo! the good time’s almost here, 
And doubtless some beneath our voice 
Shall live to hail it and rejoice; 
For almost now the radiant sheen 
Of freedom’s glad hosts may be seen 
The ear can almost catch the sound, 
The eye can almost see them bound, 
As thirty million voices rise 
In grateful peans to the skies. 
But of the present we would sing, 
And of a land all bathed in blood— 
A land where plumes the eagle’s wing, 
Whose flaming banner, stars bestud— 
A land where Heaven, with bounteous hand, 
Rich gifts hath strewn for mortal weal, 
Till vale and plain and mountain grand 
Have each a treasure to reveal: 
A land with every varying clime, 
From torrid heat to frigid cold— 
With natural scenery more sublime 
Than all the world beside unfold, 
Where vine-clad France may find a peer, 
And Venice an Italian sky, 
With streams whereon the gondolier 
His feather'd oar with ]oy may ply. 
O, heaven-blest and favored land, 
Why are thy fruitful fields laid waste? 
Why with thy fratricidal hand 
Hast thou thy beauty half defaced? 
Why do the gods disdain thy prayer? 
And why in thy deep bitterness 
Comes forth no heaven-clothed arm to share 
A part, and help in the distress? 
Hast thou gone forth to reap at noon 
And gather where thou hadst not strewn 
Hast thou kept back the hireling’s fee 
And mocked him in his poverty? 
Hast thou, because thy God hath made 
Thy brother of a different shade, 
Bound fast the iron on his limb, 
And made a feeless drudge of him? 
Hast thou, to fill thy purse with gold, 
The offsprings of his nature sold? 
And in thy brutal lust, beguiled 
His daughter and his couch defiled? 
For all this wrong and sad abuse, 
Hast thou no offering of excuse? 
No plea to urge in thy defense 
'Gainst helpless, outraged innocence? 
Then fearful is thy doom indeed, 
If guilty thou canst only plead. 
Thy sin is dark, and from the law 
No dint of pity canst thou draw. 
If thou are charged, 'twill hear thy suit; 
If guilty, swift to execute, 
Eye for an eye and tooth for tooth; 
Yet, Oh forbid it, God of truth: 
Let not thine arm in anger fall, 
But hear a guilty nation’s call; 
And stay the vial of wrath at hand, 
Pour not its contents on the land; 
Should they the last dregs in the cup 
Of bitterness be called to sup, 
And all the contents of the vial 
Of thy just wrath be poured the while, 
With all the tortures in reserve, 
’Twould scarce be more than they deserve, 
For they have sinned ’gainst thee and man. 
But wilt thou not, by thy own plan, 
Bring them past this sea of blood, 
Ere they are buried ’neath its flood? 
America! I thee conjure, 
By all that’s holy, just and pure, 
To cleanse thy hands from Slavery’s stain, 
And banish from thy soil the chain. 
Thou canst not thrive, while with the sweat 
Of unpaid toil thy lands are wet, 
Nor canst thou hope for peace or joy 
Till thou Oppression doth destroy. 
Already in the tented field 
Are thy proud hosts that will not yield— 
Already are they sweeping forth, 
Like mighty whirlwinds from the North, 
And from the East and West afar 
With earthquake tread they press to war, 
Until from where Atlantic raves, 
And wildly beats his rock-bound shore, 
To where the calm Pacific laves 
A land of fruits and shining oar, 
The thundering voice of Mars is heard, 
And echoing vales repeat each word, 
And mountains tremble to their base! 
For lo! in arms a mighty race, 
Of mighty genius, mighty strength, 
Have ta’en the field as foes at length,— 
A nation, whom but yesterday 
The bands of union joined in one, 
Now clad in war’s dread panoply, 
Their marshaling hosts to battle run. 
But not as blind ambition’s slaves 
Rush wildly on those breathing waves: 
Nor as the dread sirocco’s breath, 
All indiscriminate in death— 
But they (as freemen should and must, 
When ruthless, ruffian hands assail 
Their rightful cause of sacred trust, 
And ’gainst that cause would fain prevail), 
Have seized the rifle, sword and spear, 
And charged upon the foeman near. 
And Europe’s clans all interest grew, 
When North and South their sabres drew, 
For they had long with jealous fear 
Marked this vast Republic here, 
And watched its almost magic growth, 
Compared with their dull rounds of sloth; 
Flence, when the bomb on Sumter fell, 
They felt a half-unconscious swell 
Of exultation flame the heart, 
And inly hoped that bomb might part 
The web and woof which bound in one 
Their greatest rival ’neath the sun. 
For where’s the monarch that could rest 
Secure beneath his royal crest, 
And see a land like this of ours— 
Radiant with eternal flowers, 
With hills and vales of solid gold, 
That centuries yet will scarce unfold, 
And holding out a welcome hand 
To all the subjects of his land, 
And they responding to the call 
Like the sear’d foliage of the fall— 
And feel no inward joy or pride 
In aught that promised to divide, 
And e’en to tatter’d fragments rend, 
The land where all those virtues blend? 
For scarce a wave that sweeps the sea, 
However small or great it be, 
Nor scarce a sail that drinks the spray, 
But bears some despot’s slave away. 
Hence to the North their word of mouth, 
While heart and soul’s been with the South 
Been with the South from first to last, 
And will be till the war is past, 
Despite non-intervention’s cry,— 
Which, by-the-way, a blacker lie 
Ne’er came from Pandemonium’s cell 
Nor from the foulest niche in hell, 
Than ’twere for Europe to affirm 
That she has wholly neutral kept, 
The while this dark and fearful storm 
Of civil war has o’er us swept; 
Not intervene, and still erect 
Rebel warships by the score, 
And give them succor, and protect 
Upon her coast as many more? 
Not intervene! Whence the supply 
Of war munitions by the ton, 
That sweep our blocking squadrons by, 
And into Southern harbors run? 
Not intervene, and ’neath her dock 
Shelter a well-known privateer— 
And to prevent her capture, mock 
With self-raised queries till she’s clear? 
Not intervene! and yet propose 
To recognize the South when she 
Discards the source of half her woes, 
And sets her long bound captives free? 
If this non-intervention is, 
Then O may Jeff deliver us: 
For better had we bow as his, 
Than fall where nations reason thus. 
All this was done, but wonder not 
The half-healed wound is ne’er forgot; 
It may assume perfection’s state 
And e’en the heart with joy elate; 
While crouched beneath a gauze-like crest, 
Its germ and root and fibres rest; 
Where slightest scratch or bruise or sprain 
May wake them into life again. 
Thus Britain wounded years before, 
Remembers still the painful sore, 
And were the time more opportune, 
Columbia’s sun she’d veil at noon. 
She’s envious of her growing wealth, 
Her fruitful fields, her joy, her health, 
Her mighty rivers grand and free, 
Creation’s highways to the sea: 
And fain would sway her sceptred hand, 
And bring them all ’neath her command; 
For kindred spirits there are none, 
Twixt a Republic and a throne. 
Then wonder not that Europe’s choice, 
Her strength of purse, her strength of voice, 
Have favored every foul excess 
Through which this nation might grow less. 
And that this wasting war proceed, 
And to the utter ruin lead 
Of this Republic, they have prayed, 
And praying lent the South their aid; 
And hence the war is raging still, 
And the nation's good or ill 
Hangs on the issue of the fight— 
The triumph of the wrong or right. 
Many have been the grounds of strife 
Where man has sacrificed his life, 
And many causeless wars have been 
Since Michael fought and conquered sin; 
Yet many battles have been fought, 
And many lands that blood have bought, 
Through wars that have been justified, 
Where struggling thousands fought and died 
fought and died, and were proud that they 
On the shrine of truth had a life to lay; 
Fought and died, nor trembling came 
They to the life-devouring flame, 
But, like Winkleride of yore, 
Their sheathless breasts they bravely bore. 
For he who battles for the right, 
When in the thickest of the fight 
Doth feel a God-approving glow, 
Which bids defiance to the foe; 
And though he falls beside his shield, 
Fie sleeps a victor on the field. 
And Freedom is that sacred cause, 
Where he that doth his lancet poise, 
Shall, living, reap the world's applause, 
Or, dying, win unclouded joys. 
But now the query to be solved 
Is, shall the Union be dissolved? 
Shall this fair land our fathers gave 
Ungrudgingly their lives to save 
From kingly rule and tyranny, 
Be rent in twain by Slavery? 
And shall the line of Plymouth stock— 
Whose sires trod that hoary rock, 
Which rendered sacred e'en the soil 
Whereon they after deign’d to toil— 
Allow this refuge of black lies, 
Quintessence of all villanies, 
To rear thereon his demon throne, 
Or claim one footprint as his own? 
What though the dark and foulsome raid 
Of South Carolina should pervade 
The whole entire South, and they, 
Like hungry wolves in quest of prey, 
Rush down upon the Union fold, 
Rivaling e’en the Gauls of old? 
Shall we, because of that dark raid, 
See Freedom’s shrine in ruins laid, 
And her long-spread banner furl’d, 
To grow the butt of all the world: 
And passive keep, the while this horde, 
From mountain height and valley pour’d, 
Ride rampant over field and plain, 
Dread carnage strewing in their train, 
Until they plant their standard where 
Old Bunker rears his head in air? 
To gain this zenith of their pride, 
Through human gore waste-deep they’d ride. 
Waist-deep! aye, more—they love the sin, 
And some would brave it to the chin, 
Could they upon old Bunker’s mound 
Dole out their man flesh by the pound! 
Nor would they with their souls demur, 
E’en though the venal purchaser 
Should in his fiendish lust demand 
The fairest daughters of the land; 
Nor would they scruple as to hue, 
But eyes of jet and eyes of blue, 
And fair-brow’d maids with flowing hair, 
Such as Anglo-Saxons wear, 
Would grace as oft their auction-blocks 
As those less fair with fleecy locks. 
But never! never! never, no! 
No, never while the North winds blow, 
Shall vile oppression desecrate 
One foot of earth in that old State! 
Not while the gallant Fifty-fourth, 
In all the spirit of the North, 
Stand pledged Secession to defy, 
Or in the cause of Freedom die; 
Not while a single hand remains 
To grasp the sword or touch the spring, 
Shall that foul dagon god of chains 
Thither his courts and altars bring. 
To this audacious end they’ve bent 
Their ever-craven, vulturous eye, 
Till now their fiendish, dark intent, 
Stands out before the noonday sky; 
And all equip’d for death and war, 
With rifle, bomb and cimeter, 
They boldly stand on Richmond’s height, 
And claim secession as a right. 
But, whether right or wrong, still they 
Have sworn no longer to obey 
Edict sent or mandate given, 
From any court this side of Heaven, 
Except that court in concert be 
With chains and endless slavery. 
At length the war assumes a phase, 
Though long apparent, oft denied: 
We speak it in the nation’s praise— 
The land they never can divide. 
Therefore this fact should none surprise— 
If Slavery lives, the Union dies; 
And if the Union’s e’er restored, 
’Twill be when Freedom is secured; 
And liberty, man’s rightful due, 
Is not proscribed by grade nor hue. 
Hence he that would avert the doom, 
And rescue from sepulchral gloom 
His freedom, must, with sword in hand, 
March ’gainst the slavery of this land. 
Then gird thy loins, for lo! thy course, 
O brother, long oppress’d by force, 
With stalwart arm and ebon brow, 
\vas never half so plain as now: 
Nor half so ominously bright 
With Hope’s refulgent beams of light— 
For with each deafening cannon’s roar, 
Thy hated chains grow less secure: 
And, like the fumes of war, shall they 
Dissolve ere long, and pass away. 
Meanwhile, from thraldom’s gloomy slough 
Millions shall come forth such as thou, 
And Fame a laurel wreath shall twine 
For many a brow of Afric line. 
But prate thou not of liberty, 
While still in shackled slavery 
The most remote of all thy kin 
Bow down beneath its damning sin! 
Nor make thy boast of English birth, 
Nor French descent, nor Celtic worth; 
This leave for English, French or Dane, 
Whose kindred wear no galling chain. 
But thou, O man of Afric hue, 
This vaunting spirit pray subdue, 
And bide thy time to boast till he, 
Thy last chained brother, shall be free. 
Not only free from lash and yoke, 
But free from all that should provoke 
The just, indignant wrath of those 
Who now his budding rights oppose; 
Not only free to shoulder arms, 
When foeman thick as locusts swarm, 
Securely wrapped in coats of mail, 
Seem almost certain to prevail; 
Not only free to pay a tax 
To each scrip-monger, who exacts 
His hard-earned dollar as a rule, 
For purposes of State oi* school: 
While they the children of his loins, 
Through some base act which hate enjoins, 
Are not allowed within the door 
Where Wisdom sits to bless the poor! 
Not only free to tell the truth 
Where Justice, mocked at, sits forsooth! 
But free from all that should impair 
The rights of freemen anywhere! 
Till then, thou shouldst not, must not boast, 
But rather at thy lowly post, 
With zeal and fortitude combined, 
Discharge the duties there assigned. 
Should struggling Freedom call for thee, 
Come forth with proud alacrity; 
Gird on dread war’s habiliments, 
And nobly stand in her defense, 
And thereby thou shalt win a place 
For thee and for thy injured race, 
Above the vulgar taunt and jeer, 
That grates so harshly on thy ear. 
Though Tennyson, the poet king, 
Has sung of Balaklava’s charge, 
Until his thund’ring cannons ring 
From England’s center to her marge, 
The pleasing duty still remains 
To sing a people from their chains— 
To sing what none have yet assay’d, 
The wonders of the Black Brigade. 
The war had raged some twenty moons, 
Ere they in columns or platoons, 
To win them censure or applause, 
Were marshal’d in the Union cause— 
Prejudged of slavish cowardice, 
While many a taunt and foul device 
Came weekly forth with Harper’s sheet, 
To feed that base, infernal cheat. 
But how they would themselves demean, 
Has since most gloriously been seen. 
’Twas seen at Milliken’s dread bend, 
Where e’en the Furies seemed to lend 
To dark Secession all their aid, 
To crush the Union Black Brigade. 
The war waxed hot, and bullets flew 
Like San Francisco’s summer sand, 
But they were there to dare and do, 
E’en to the last, to save the land. 
And when the leaders of their corps 
Grew wild with fear, and quit the field, 
The dark remembrance of their scars 
Before them rose, they could not yield: 
And, sounding o’er the battle din, 
They heard their standard-bearer cry— 
'‘Rally! and prove that ye are men! 
Rally! and let us do or die! 
For war, nor death,- shall boast a shade 
To daunt the Union Black Brigade!” 
And thus he played the hero’s part, 
Till on the ramparts of the foe 
A score of bullets pierced his heart, 
He sank within, the trench below. 
His comrades saw, and fired with rage, 
Each sought his man, him to engage 
In single combat. Ah! ’twas then 
The Black Brigade proved they were men 
For ne’er did Swiss! or Russ! or knight! 
Against such fearful odds array’ed, 
With more persistent valor fight, 
Than did the Union Black Brigade! 
As five to one, so stood their foes, 
When that defiant shout arose, 
And ’long their closing columns ran, 
Commanding each to choose his man! 
And ere the sound had died away, 
Full many a ranting rebel lay 
Gasping piteously for breath— 
Struggling with the pangs of death, 
From bayonet thrust or shining blade, 
Plunged to the hilt by the Black Brigade. 
And thus they fought, and won a name— 
None brighter on the scroll of Fame; 
For out of one full corps of men, 
But one remained unwounded, when 
The dreadful fray had fully past— 
All killed or wounded but the last! 
And though they fell, as has been seen, 
Each slept his lifeless foes between, 
And marked the course and paved the way 
To ushering in a better day. 
Let Balaklava’s cannons roar, 
And Tennyson his hosts parade, 
But ne’er was seen and never more 
The equals of the Black Brigade! 
Then nerve thy heart, gird on thy sword, 
For dark Oppression’s ruthless horde 
And thy tried friends are in the field— 
Say which shall triumph, which shall yield. 
Shall they that heed not man nor God— 
Vile monsters of the gory rod — 
Dark forgers of the rack and chain: 
Shall they prevail—and Thraldom’s reign, 
With all his dark unnumber’d ills, 
Become eternal as the hills? 
No! by the blood of freemen slain, 
On hot-contested field and main, 
And by the mingled sweat and tears, 
Extorted through these many years 
From Afric’s patient -sons of toil— 
Weak victims of a braggart’s spoil— 
This bastard plant, the Upas tree, 
Shall not supplant our liberty! 
But in the right, our sword of power 
We’ll firmly grasp in this dread hour, 
And in the life-tide’s crimson flow 
Of those that wrong us, write our No! 
No! by all that’s great and good; 
No! by a common brotherhood, 
The wrong no longer shall prevail, 
Its myriad horrors to entail! 
Better in youth pass off life’s stage, 
Battling ’gainst a tyrant’s rage, 
Than live to three-score years and ten, 
Disown’d of God, despised of men; 
Better that cities, hamlets, towns, 
And every hut where life abounds, 
In conflagration’s ruins lie, 
Than men as things should live and die; 
Better the whetted knife be brought, 
And quick as lightning speeds a thought, 
Hurl life all wreaking from its throne, 
Than live their manhood to disown, 
Sooner than bear a hell of pain, 
And wear a festering, galling chain, 
To hoary age e’en from their birth, 
And die the meanest thing on earth. 
There is no deed they should not do, 
Could they thereby obtain the clue, 
The motive power and the might 
To set their outraged people right! 
Then grasp the sword, discard the sheath, 
And strike for Liberty or Death! 
But what is death? ’Tis, after all, 
The merest transit from this ball 
To some bright state or gloomy sphere, 
Remote, perhaps—perhaps quite near. 
And what is life? Hath it a charm, 
While fetters gall the neck and arm, 
And from no species of contempt, 
However base, to be exempt? 
Tis true a noble bard hath said 
That to the regions of the dead 
“What dreams may come, now give us pause. 
But who can so thwart Nature’s laws 
As to evade that dread unknown, 
Through aid or effort of his own? 
But is there aught to haunt a dream, 
That man should so unwelcome deem, 
As to regard it worse than stripes— 
Worse than slavery’s mildest types? 
No, no! there’s nothing, rest assured, 
In life or death to be endured— 
There are no tortures to excel 
The fires of a Southern hell! 
The lash, the yoke, the gag, the chain, 
May each produce a world of pain; 
But what are these, though all combined, 
To gross sterility of mind? 
To chain and scourge this mortal frame, 
It were a sin and burning shame; 
But who can estimate the doom 
Of those that quench and shroud in gloom 
The only lamp which God hath giverr, 
To light the soul in earth or heaven? 
While this external will expand, 
In proud defiance of the brand, 
The mind, that germ of tender growth— 
That plant of far transcendent worth, 
Will neither bud nor bloom nor bear, 
Where thraldom’s breath infects the air. 
Then onward roll, thou dreadful War, 
If thou, and thou alone, canst bring 
The boon of Freedom from afar; 
Roll darkly on, while we sing: 
We would not have thee slack thy speed, 
Nor change the tenor of thy way, 
Till each infernal law and creed 
That fosters wrong, is swept away! 
If needs be, lay proud cities waste! 
And slay thy thousands at a meal! 
But in thy wake let Freedom haste, 
With oil to soothe and balm to heal. 
And here permit me to diverge 
From real to fancy’s flow’ry marge, 
And sing of what I seem’d to see 
While there enshrined in reverie. 
The past, and what is yet to be 
Reveal’d in blank futurity, 
Swept like a phantom through my brain, 
Of which some shadows still remain: 
And to those shadows let me call 
The eye and silent ear of all. 
One evening,, wrapp’d in pensive mood, 
On fancy’s wing I soar d afar, 
Till, seeing and unseen, I stood 
Amid the hidden springs of War: 
And there upon a canvas vast 
I saw this cruel war sweep past— 
Its former battles fought again, 
With all the unfought in their train. 
Upon the sea and on the shore 
Each battle scene was marked with gore; 
And bleaching there on sea and plain, 
Lay mangled bodies of the slain. 
Of some were nothing save their trunk, 
Whose life the thirsty earth had drunk: 
With legs and arms all torn away 
By some dread shell’s destructive play; 
And massive trees ball-riven stood, 
All draped with powder, drenched with blood, 
While clotted hair and flesh still clung 
Their sear’d and shattered boughs among. 
And ’neath the deep and angry waves, 
Thousands had found their liquid graves: 
And sleeping there ’mid shoals and rocks, 
Were many braves with fleecy locks. 
Of such were many of the slain, 
On every battle-field and plain. 
But wild to pierce futurity, 
Its deep veiled ultimatum see, 
And learn the final of this war— 
The waning of our evil star— 
I turned the tardy canvas from, 
And sped me on, when lo! a bomb, 
Deeper in tone than aught I’d heard— 
So deep the very earth was stirr’d, 
As though the gods, in wrath or sport, 
Had touch’d some pillar of her court. 
Of Peace it was the harbinger— 
The long-prayed, welcome messenger. 
But eager still, I onward sped, 
Unknowing why, or whither led, 
Till in my path an angel rose, 
My further progress to oppose. 
His form was tall and passing fair— 
His raiment like the driven snow, 
And trod he’ on the ambient air 
As mortals walk the earth below. 
His voice, though soft, seemed to expand, 
And e’en in compass to increase, 
Till every nook of our fair land 
Rang with the joyous song of Peace! 
Peace! and the loud-mouth’d cannon’s roar 
In silence slept, to wake no more! 
Peace! and the soldier quits the field, 
And doffs his corslet, sword and shield, 
And in the burden of his lay, 
The din of battle died away: 
And lilies bloom’d and olives spread 
In rich profusion o’er the dead. 
The dark Rebellion had been crushed, 
And every-wailing sound was hushed; 
And there was not a slavish chain 
In all Columbia’s fair domain. 
And then and there I saw unfold, 
All fresh and bright from. Freedom’s mould, 
A real Republic—such a one 
As should have passed from sire to son; 
A real Republic—free! uncurs’d! 
The sole intention of the first— 
In which the bright Damascus blade 
Became the farmer’s plowing spade: 
And with the spear he pois’d of yore 
His golden harvest did secure. 
And far away as the eye could span, 
In its vast sweep from strand to strand, 
I saw no South, North, East nor West, 
But one broad land, all free and blest; 
And there was not a jarring sound 
In all the vastitude profound— 
No wail, no sob, no sigh, no tear, - 
To dim the eye or mar the ear. 
And violets bloomed the banks along, 
And the lark poured forth his matin song, 
And the lowly cot and massive dome 
Had each the air of a joyous home; 
And temples rear’d their spires on high, 
Pointing away to the clear blue sky; 
And myriad souls had gathered there, 
Whose grateful hearts went up in prayer 
To the God of love, whose gracious hand 
Had clothed in peace their bleeding land. 
With one allusion, we have done 
The task so joyously begun: 
It is to speak, in measured lays, 
Of him the Nation loves to praise. 
When that inspired instrument, 
The subject of this great event, 
Forth from the Halls of Congress came, 
With even justice as its aim, 
’Twas deem’d by some a fiendish rod, 
But otherwise adjudged of God, 
Who, turning earthward from His throne, 
Beheld great Lincoln all alone, 
With earth-bent brow, in pensive mood, 
Pondering o’er some unsubdued 
And knotty problem, half dissolved, 
And half in mystery yet involved. 
The interest of a continent, 
All broken lip by discontent— 
His own dear land, land of his love, 
The fairest ’neath the realms above— 
Weighed down his form and rack’d his brain. 
And filled his patriot heart with pain. 
But when his mind conceived the thought 
To WRITE FOUR MILLION CAPTIVES FREE! 
An angel to his conscience brought 
Approving smiles of Deity; 
And ere he had with flesh conferr’d, 
He gave the bright conception birth, 
And distant nations saw and heard, 
And bless’d his mission on the earth. 
And we today reiterate, 
With warmth of heart and depth of soul, 
God bless Americ’s Magistrate! 
Long may he live to guide, control; 
Long may that arching brow and high— 
That spiritual and piercing eye: 
That tall, majestic, manly form— 
Live, our rainbow ’midst the .storm; 
And when the roar of battle's pass’d; 
When vain Secession’s breath’d his last; 
When peace and order are restored, 
And Freedom sits at every board; 
And when the Nation shall convene 
In mass, as ne’er before was seen, 
And render eulogistic meeds 
To worthy heroes’ noble deeds, 
A lengthened train shall claim their boast, 
But Lincoln’s name shall lead the host! 
His name shall grow a household word, 
Where’er the human voice is heard; 
And tribes and peoples yet unborn, 
Shall hail and bless his natal morn. 
ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA. 
Thank God! from our old ensign 
Is erased one mark of shame, 
Which leaves one less to rapine, 
One less to blight our fame. 
For two and sixty summers 
Has our broad escutcheon waved, 
Amid the ceaseless murmurs 
And wails of the enslaved; 
But in the blest hereafter 
Shall our oft afflicted ears, 
Be solaced with bright laughter, 
With gladsome praise and cheers. 
For freedom's altar’s basis 
More permanent shall be, 
When rid the gaunt embraces 
Of fell barbarity. 
% % * * * * * 
If Congress hath the power 
To expel from ten miles square 
The Goliah of the hour, 
And charge the tainted air 
With the pure breath of freedom, 
As to baffle all return, 
Should she not e’en from Sodom 
The vaunted monster spurn? 
Roaring like distant waters 
Which no power can repress, 
Up from ten thousand quarters 
Comes the responsive yes! 
Yes! yes; our nation’s banner 
We should purge from all its stains, 
Nor yield to might nor manner, 
Till Right triumphant reigns. 
THE PROGRESS OF LIBERTY. 
Dedicated to Rt. Rev. Jabez Pitt Campbell, bishop of 
the A. M. E. church, as a slight tribute to his many 
noble qualities, his exalted piety, and his labors in be¬ 
half of his oppressed race. 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 
The “Progress of Liberty” is delineated in the 
events of the past four years—the overthrow of the 
rebellion, the crushing of the spirit of anarchy, the 
total extinction of slavery, and the return of peace and 
joy to our beloved country. 
The invincibility of Liberty is illustrated in the 
beautiful episode of the Swiss patriot, William Tell, 
wherein the goddess is personified by an eagle tower¬ 
ing amidst the clouds. 
The poet claims the full enfranchisement of his race 
from political, as well as personal thraldom, and de¬ 
clares that the “Progress of Liberty” will not be com¬ 
plete until the ballot is given to the loyal freedmen. 
The noble actions and self-sacrificing spirit of the 
immortal Lincoln is next sung, and in mournful strains 
the poet bewails his martyrdom. This concludes with 
a touching eulogy on our sainted martyr. 
The reconstruction policy of President Johnson i6 
reviewed, and, while objecting, the poet does not 
wholly condemn his motives, but warns the ruling 
powers that unless the spirit of rebellion is wholly ob¬ 
literated and every vestige swept away, it will only 
slumber to awake again with renewed ferocity. 
THE PROGRESS OF LIBERTY. 
Never, in all the march of time, 
Dawned on this land a more sublime 
And grand event, than that for which 
Today the lowly and the rich 
From thrice ten thousand altars send 
Their orisons to God, their friend. 
The severance of the bondsman’s chain; 
The opening wide the prison door, 
And ushering in this glorious reign 
Of liberty from shore to shore, 
Has formed an epoch in the life 
Of this great nation that shall stand 
And consecrate to sanguine strife 
The full redemption of the land. 
Hail! hail! glad day! thy blest return 
We greet with speech and joyous lay. 
High shall our altar-fires burn, 
And proudly beat our hearts today. 
And thou, thou ancient holiday! 
We hail thee with a new delight, 
Since hope’s bright beams and freedom’s ray 
Have dawned upon the bondsman’s night— 
Dawned on his night and interspersed 
A deathless yearning to be free; 
A heaven-approved and burning thirst, 
That naught can quench but liberty. 
O, Liberty, what charm so great! 
One radiant smile, one look of thine 
Can change the drooping bondsman’s fate, 
And light his brow with hope divine. 
His manhood, wrapped in rayless gloom, 
At thy approach throws off its pall, 
And rising up, as from the tomb, 
Stands forth defiant of the thrall. 
No tyrant’s power can crush the soul 
Illumed by thine inspiring ray; 
The fiendishness of base control 
Flies thy approach as night from day. 
Ride onward, in thy chariot ride, 
Thou peerless queen; ride on, ride on— 
With Truth and Justice by thy side— 
From pole to pole, from sun to sun! 
Nor linger in our bleeding South, 
Nor domicile with race or clan; 
But in thy glorious goings forth, 
Be thy benignant object Man. 
Of every clime, of every hue, 
Of every tongue, of every race, 
’Neath heaven’s broad, etheral blue; 
Oh! let thy radiant smiles embrace: 
Till neither slave nor one oppressed 
Remain throughout creation’s span, 
By thee unpitied and unblest 
Of all the progeny of man. 
We fain would have the world aspire 
To that proud height of free desire, 
That flamed the heart of Switzer’s Tell 
(Whose archery skill none could excel), 
When once upon his Alpine brow, 
He stood reclining on his bow, 
And saw, careering in his might— 
In all his majesty of flight— 
A lordly eagle float and swing 
Upon his broad, untramelled wing. 
He bent his bow, he poised his dart, 
With full intent to pierce the heart; 
But as the proud bird nearer drew, 
His stalwart arm unsteady grew, 
His arrow lingered in the groove— 
The cord unwilling seemed to move, 
For there he saw personified 
That freedom which had been his pride; 
And as the eagle onward sped, 
O’er lofty hill and towering tree, 
He dropped his bow, he bowed his head; 
He could not shoot—’twas Liberty! 
For men have ever been disposed 
To crush their weaker fellows down; 
Their selfish natures stand opposed 
To the heart’s free, aspiring bound. 
For e’er since Time his march began 
Or mighty rivers seaward ran, 
In greater or in less degree 
The world’s been cursed by slavery. 
Nor has the system been confined 
To any nation, race or kind; 
The Celt, the Saxon and the Dane, 
Each, in their turn, have worn the chain; 
Each have been slaves—each bought and sold; 
Their blood-price paid in paltry gold, 
And from their kinships, loved and lorn, 
To distant lands by strangers borne, 
S6 
Where suffered they full many a wrong— 
And where in bondage served they long. 
Though long enthralled, yet there remains 
Not e’en a vestige of their chains; 
And were it not for history’s lore, 
The buried fact none could explore. 
Freedom has swept their chains away 
Arid clothed them with a brighter day. 
For in despite all efforts made, 
There e’er has been a certain grade 
In the enslavement of a race, 
At which reaction takes its place; 
A point at which the crushed to earth, 
Impelled by irate manly worth, 
Throw off the yoke, discard the brand, 
And claim their peerage in the land! 
They rise, and fate proclaims the hour; 
They seize the reigns and march to power. 
As in the past, so shall it be 
Through all the unborn years afar; 
Till earth is wholly purged and free, 
Will man ’gainst man go forth to war. 
Wake, in your minds the sleeping world,. 
From Eden’s banished pair till now, 
Behold war’s crimson flag unfurled 
On every plain and mountain brow. 
The sword has been the pioneer— 
The civilizer of mankind— 
The John the Baptist sent to clear 
The way and fix the erring mind; 
And the priest, ' with Bible spread, 
Walks more securely where the tread 
Of the swordsman in his wrath 
Has left his foot-prints in the path. 
Nor could the sciences unfold 
Their wings that’s purer far than gold, 
Had not the savage in the breast 
Of savage men been put to rest. 
Thus, on her even-tenored way 
Fair truth has ever kept her course, 
Battling now with fell delay— 
Now sweeping on with matchless force. 
In mystic armor, bright and fair, 
Her braves stand mailed ’gainst dread despair. 
Hence, they who battle for the right 
Are always stronger than the foe, 
And only need the radiant light 
Of liberty their strength to know. 
Although its light may be withdrawn, 
And error’s blackening clouds increase, 
Yet time will bring the glorious dawn 
Of Liberty and Truth and Peace. 
Their strength, numerically viewed, 
May seem but nothing in the scale; 
Yet, if their hearts are each imbued 
With liberty, they cannot fail; 
For they who fight for liberty, 
They fight to conquest or to death, 
And gain their proudest victory 
When the cause receives their breath. 
Though error’s numerous hosts array 
The march of freedom to impede, 
’Twere vain : no forces can delay 
A Heaven-commissioned mortal need. 
The wrong cannot forever last— 
The right is mightier than the chain, 
And in the future, as in the past, 
Liberty must and shall obtain. 
The tyrant’s hand may firmly clasp 
And strive to hold within his grasp 
Those whom his baseness has betrayed— 
His fiendish nature helped degrade— 
Yet, in power and might and main, 
Liberty must and shall obtain. 
The bondsman’s gloomy night has passed; 
The slavery of this land is dead; 
Nor tyrant’s power, however vast, 
Can wake it from its gory bed. 
For in the order of events, 
And after an ignoble reign, 
It died. None mourned its going hence, 
Nor followed in its funeral train; 
Ignoble birth, ignoble life, 
Ignoble death, ignoble doom! 
Conceived by fiends in deadly strife, 
And cast into a nameless tomb. 
Though slavery’s dead, yet there remains 
A work for those from whom the chains 
Today are falling one by one; 
Nor should they deem their labor done, 
Nor shrink the task, however hard, 
While it insures a great reward, 
And bids them on its might depend 
For perfect freedom in the end. 
Commend yourselves through self-respect; 
Let self-respect become your guide: * 
Then will consistency reflect 
Your rightful claims to manhood’s pride. 
But while you cringe and basely cower, % 
And while you ostracise your class, 
Heaven will ne’er assume the power 
To elevate you as a mass. 
In this yourselves must take the lead; 
You must yourselves first elevate; 
Till then the world will ne'er concede 
Your claims to manhood’s high estate. 
Respect yourself; this forms the base 
Of manhood’s claim to man’s regard.' 
Next to yourself, respect your race, 
Whose care should be your constant ward; 
Remember that you are a class 
Distinct and separate in this land, 
And all the wealth you may amass, 
Or skill, or learning, won’t command 
That high respect you vainly seek, 
Until you practice what you claim— 
Until the acts and words you speak 
Shall, in the concrete, be the same. 
Screen not behind a pallid brow; 
Paint lends no virtue to the face; 
Until the Black’s respected, thou 
With all the branches of his race, 
Must bow beneath the cruel ban 
And often feel the wrinkled brow 
Bent on you be a fellow-man 
Not half so worthy, oft, as thou. 
Away with caste, and let us fight 
As men, the battles of the free, 
And Heaven will arm you with the might 
And power of man’s divinity. 
There may be causes for distrust, 
And many an act that seems unjust; 
But who, when taking all in all, 
And summing up our present state, 
Would find no objects to extol, 
No worthy deeds to emulate? 
If such there be, deem him confessed 
Before the shrine of liberty 
As one that would the truth arrest 
And crush to earth humanity; 
For who, unless their sympathies 
Are with the spoilers of the poor, 
Could heedless pass realities 
So fraught with freedom's genial lore? 
Although the car of freedom moves 
Less swift by far than we desire, 
Yet stations gained and passed should prove 
The destined goal is drawing nigher. 
What though upon some distant verge, 
Or in some ray less cave or den, 
The cruel, fiendish tyrant's scourge 
Doth still afflict the poor of men : 
Has not the conquering arm of Right 
Become the power behind the throne? 
Shall not the fell oppressor, Might, 
For all his ruthless acts atone? 
To solve this query, ask not Tyre, 
Nor wander back to Greece or Rome; 
But of the living now enquire, 
And read those foot-prints 'round your home. 
9 
Read but the record that appears 
Upon the scroll of four short years, 
And truth enough, I vow, you'll find 
To satisfy an honest mind. 
Four years ago fell slavery's reign 
Within this land was absolute; 
The brand, the fetter and the chain 
Were forged for man as for the brute. 
And in those ten miles square of earth, 
Which ever sacred should have been 
To liberty and manly worth, 
The statesman sold and bought his kin; 
For there the auction-block was seen, 
And hard by stood the whipping-post, 
Where oft, alas! from fiendish spleen, 
The poor have yielded up the ghost. 
Four years have gone, and now that square 
Of two-score miles in circuit round, 
Freights every passing breath of air 
With freedom’s grand and joyous sound. 
The whipping-post, the slaver’s mart, 
The scourge, the brand, the yoke, the chain, 
Have all been banished from the heart 
Of fair America’s domain. 
Four years ago, and there was not 
A sable freeman in this land; 
Though thousands gloried in their lot, 
Yet were they all beneath the brand. 
That foul rendition law, which gave 
To avarice unquestioned right 
To seize the:man deemed as a slave, 
And drag him down to thraldom’s night, 
Exposed six hundred thousand souls 
To insult, outrage and abuse, 
In view of all the perjured scrolls 
That fiends incarnate could adduce; 
But that base law and baser hearts 
Of those who gave it prominence, 
Have each on earth performed their parts, 
And gone to their dread recompense. 
Nor is this all that has been done 
In four short years beneath the sun: 
Liberia has been recognized— 
Also the Haytian’s island home; 
And lo*! a Negro undisguised 
Has preached within the nation’s dome! 
And proud Columbia’s highest court 
Receives a counselor elect, 
Which gives the lie to the report 
That fain would rob us of respect, 
While Taney, with curses on his grave, 
Has gone to stand that Judge before, 
At whose dread bar the poorest slave 
Is judged a man, and he—no more. 
Like Cana’s wine, the last and best, 
And far transcending all the rest, 
Is that grand act for which we meet 
Each New Year day to laud and greet— 
The issuance of that blest decree 
Through which the millions now are free. 
We laud the act and laud the worth 
Of the noble heart which gave it birth; 
For which today we gladly raise 
Our hands and hearts in grateful praise 
To Him who spake, and lo! ’twas done; 
Whose work is finished—e’er begun; 
And while innumerous songs shall rise 
In grand memorials to the skies, 
The burden of all our songs shall be 
To Lincoln, God and Liberty! 
Sing, oh! my harp, one song of cheer 
To that fond name we all revere; 
Sing of his trust, sing of his love, 
O, sing of his home in the realms above! 
High on the towering spire of fame, 
In bold relief stands out a name 
Which time can ne’er efface or dim: 
It is the peerless name of him 
Who dared his frowning land despite, 
Do what his conscience deemed as right; 
Who dared proclaim, that all might hear, 
The dawn of freedom’s jubilant year. 
And when the glorious news went forth, 
It fell, like Heaven’s benignant dew, 
Upon the bondsmen of the south, 
And all that wore the sable hue— 
Not only those of sable hue, 
But every lover of the right 
Grasped his unsheathed sword anew, 
And nerved his heart with tenfold might, 
Determined to wipe out the stain — 
The vile excresence to remove— 
And free from each obnoxious ban 
The home and country of his love. 
Yon proclamation of the free 
Is now the living testament 
Of that great soul of liberty, 
Whose heart conceived its continent, 
Whose mission was to rend the chain 
And let the long oppressed go free; 
And having wholly filled his reign, 
He laid aside mortality 
And donned the vesture of the spheres, 
And passed beyond our mortal ken, 
To regions far remote from men— 
Where all that’s great and good appear. 
Though gone from earth, he is not dead; 
The great, the good, they never die; 
But when these transient forms they shed, 
In fadeless youth they bloom on high. 
Oh! could we pass beyond the doom 
And range through fields forever fair, 
Arrayed in Heaven's eternal bloom, 
We'd find our benefactor there. 
The Moses kind Heaven in mercy had lent 
To lead us away from our discontent, 
For we, like Israel, were oppressed, 
And long our bleeding hearts' unrest 
Has fallen on the dewy night 
While pleading with the Infinite. 
The orbit-lamps which burn on high 
And flood with joy the azure sky— 
The silver moon and clouds that sweep 
Athrough the far-off realms so deep, 
Are all familiar with our woe, 
And of our griefs how much they know: 
For when from pleasure’s jovial round 
The careless world lay slumber-bound, 
We’ve knelt and looked up through our tears, 
And asked of Heaven, how many years 
Shall vile injustice basely reign? 
How many years from 'neath the chain 
Shall Godlike man, a creature made 
But one step lower in the grade 
Of wisdom’s all-creative skill 
Than those bright heralds of His will 
Which stand His throne forever by, 
Or on their spotless pinions fly; 
Pour forth upon the midnight air 
The doleful wail of his despair; 
And oft from out the lunar heaven 
Glad signs of promise have been given. 
A Moses has been typified— 
A prophet and a people’s guide; 
And we by faith have looked away 
Beyond the night to the glorious day 
When in His strength the arm of God 
Should rend the chain and break the rod, 
And lead the oppressed from ’neath the brand 
To manhood's joy in freedom's land. 
Although intense the darkness grew, 
As nearer still and nearer drew 
The rising dawn ordained to bring 
The day of promise on its wing, 
And every hand against us turned, 
And on us every passer spurned, 
Yet, was our deathless trust the same 
In Him who gave the sun his flame, 
And spake from dark chaotic gloom 
Bright worlds on worlds to live and bloom, 
And by some deep, unfathomed source 
Bound them forever to their course, 
And on their broad and convexed face 
To all the breathing tribes gave place; 
To these that ply their finny oar, 
And live where ocean thunders roar; 
To those that float upon the breeze 
And build their homes ’mid rocks and trees; 
To those that prowl in quest of prey, 
When night has closed the eye of day, 
And those that serve and blessings bring, 
With every beast and creeping thing, 
And holds forever in His hands 
The destiny of men and lands— 
The destiny of every sphere 
In heaven’s blue fields, remote or near, 
While every creature He has made 
Commands His care and special aid. 
A God like this, we’d fain adore; 
His friendship ours, our cause is sure. 
As Israel, when they neared that sea 
Whose waves rolled back with majesty, 
And stood congealed in all their pride, 
A liquid wall on either side; 
Assembled on the farther strand, 
And holding up their leader’s hand, 
They prayed, harped, danced and sung, 
The aged mingling with the young, 
While this refrain was heard afar, 
‘'The Lord, the Lord’s a Man of war, 
And like no other God is He; 
God of the whirlwind and the sea!” 
And while they danced did Miriam sing: 
“The Lord’s my strength, the Lord’s my king!” 
Like them, we’ve halted on the shore, 
To sing and tell our triumphs o’er. 
The bondsman’s chains at length are riven, 
The fettered limbs forever free; 
Shout thou, O Earth, and thou, O Heaven, 
Proclaim the gladsome jubilee! # 
Now, to that feature of our lay 
Involving interests of today— 
Involving interests of the state— 
Interests small and interests great; 
The interest of the rich and poor— 
Their interest now and evermore. 
The rebels—crushed in their endeavor 
To rend in twain this glorious land— 
Are still its foes, and will forever 
Upon the side of treason stand, 
Till all the streets which lead to power 
Freedom shall firmly barricade; 
They’ll wait in hope and pray the hour 
Auspicious to their fiendish raid. 
The panther changeth not his nature, 
Though chained, is still a treacherous beast, 
Seeking ever for his capture 
And on his captor’s life to feast. 
To this extent doth bloody treason 
Pervade the powerless rebel’s heart; 
They still are traitors, and bide their season 
To hurl at truth their poisoned dart. 
Look to those streets which lead to office: 
’Tis long those by-paths they would come; . 
Place there a strong and trusty police; 
Guard well the nation’s classic dome. 
Raise no seceder to position, 
Place no foul traitor in command, 
And thereby hinder a sedition 
Deep as the base-work of our land. 
Oh, let it not in truth be spoken, 
For four long years we’ve war’d in vain; 
The gordian knot remains unbroken, 
And we are yet beneath the chain, 
And they, the plotters of secession, 
Have still their rods above our head, 
Extorting from us a concession 
E’en in the face of all our dead. 
Where is that fiend-like will which fostered 
The dark rebellion at the first? 
Deem it not dead, or e’en exhausted— 
It waits its time to slake its thirst, 
And in an hour the least expected, 
And from a source we little deem— 
When liberty’s the least protected, 
’Twill start again the crimson stream. 
Unless the roots are all extracted, 
The cancer will return again; 
For partial surgery, when enacted, 
Imperils life, engenders pain. 
Unless the causes which incited 
This fearful war we now remove, 
The torch again will be ignited— 
And peace an airy bubble prove. 
Of what avail is their parolment— 
What vow so sacred could they make, 
That, once released from war’s controlment, 
Their perjured natures would not break? 
There are no oaths, nor vows can alter 
The life-long purpose of the heart; 
Though firmly pledged, man will not falter 
When chance proclaims to play his part. 
Go, ferret out those vile seceders— 
Seek them anear, and seek them afar, 
And bring to justice all their leaders— 
Base plotters in this bloody war. 
Be they bishops, priests, or laymen, 
Bring them, nor through pity spare; 
Confine them where the truth placed Haman— 
Confine them in the middle air. 
There let them swing from early morning 
Till night shall wrap the earth in gloom, 
A fit rebuke and needful warning 
To all who chance escape their doom; 
That ne’er again while Sol illumines 
The regions of unbounded space, 
May dark, mysterious, fearful omens 
O’erspread our land with such disgrace. 
Oh, ye, who claim to scan the future, 
And read for man—unborn events, 
Pray tell us what shall be the nature 
Of the bondsmen’s future tense; 
Shall they from whom the yoke has fallen, 
From whom the fetter has been loosed, 
Aspire to no loftier calling, 
But still live on to be abused? 
And will this land of boasted freedom, 
In whose defense our braves have died, 
Now, when the cause no more doth need them, 
Remand them back without a guide, 
And institute no laws to shield them 
From the brutal acts of those 
Who long in abject bondage held them, 
Whose heart no love nor pity knows? 
Those swarthy troops, who bore their rifles, 
And bravely fought the nation’s foe, 
Regarding e’en their lives as trifles 
Compared with freedom’s overthrow, 
Won them laurels, and should inherit 
The ballot as their rightful due; 
Aye, should inherit, if deeds of merit 
E’er merit aught that’s good and true. 
0 
Tis not enough, to rend the fetter; 
’Tis not enough, to part the chain— 
The soldier merits something better— 
A full erasure of his stain, 
That future years, in their enfolding, 
May of those wrongs no vestige find— 
No shadowy clue to base withholding 
Of human rights from human kind. 
There is no civil right that can equal 
The ballot in a freeman’s hand; 
It is the apex and the sequel 
To all that’s noble, great and grand. 
The poorest of the land invested 
With the ballot, may stand erect, 
And pass this life through unmolested, 
Commanding ever a respect. 
Rescind all systems of oppression; 
Raise all men to a common plain; 
And there will not of vain secession 
Nor root, nor limb, nor branch remain. 
O! give Columbia’s swarthy subjects— 
The valiant-hearted and the true— 
A noble base for future prospects; 
Give them the ballot—as their due. 
Their due for deeds of manly bearing, 
Whene’er the chances were revealed, 
And for their brave, chivalric daring 
On many a hot-contested field. 
Give it for victories won the nation, 
And often, too, ’gainst fearful odds, 
Such as, at times, to keep their station 
Appeared a mystery to the gods. 
Now, in four memories backward wander, 
And near Fort Hudson take your stand; 
Where you may in safety ponder 
Upon the fearful and the grand. 
Hark! hark! that deafening sound pervading 
The hills anear and hills afar; 
Lo! ’tis the charge and cannonading 
Of the veteran hosts of war. 
Look you kindly on that battle— 
The former slaves are in that fight! 
They who have herded long with cattle 
Are warring for the freeman’s right. 
From off the earthworks of the foemen, 
See how the grape and bullets fly— 
Mowing down my hardy yeomen 
As doth the scythe the autumn rye; 
But onward! onward! nothing daunted, 
Sword unsheathed or hand on spring, 
To where those murderous guns are planted, 
Whose mighty force those missiles fling. 
Now, see them, as the foe advances, 
With sabres drawn, on hurried feet; 
They halt, and now they poise their lances, 
And now the fierce combatants meet. 
The former slave and former master— 
See how furiously they rave; 
Which shall outlive the disaster, 
The master or his former slave? 
List to their swords and sabres clashing, 
As slave confronts his tyrant lord; 
See! see them, at each other dashing— 
Now, see them writhing on the sward! 
See the struggling; hear the screaming; 
Hear the curse and hear the prayer; 
See the crimson life-tide streaming 
From their sword-points through the air. 
Now the blacks are beaten backward— 
Backward beaten by the foe; 
And now again they rally onward; 
On to the breastwork, on they go! 
The walls are gained, their braves have scaled, 
them; 
Behold the stars and stripes on high! 
The former .masters’ hearts have failed them; 
See! see! before their slaves they fly. 
See on the field the dead, the wounded— 
Fallen, fallen to rise no more; 
Beside them, see their sabres grounded, 
All reeking still with human gore. 
And shall the heroes of such battles, 
Who fought for liberty for all, 
Again be classed with goods and chattels— 
With beasts of burden in the stall? 
Shall patriots have their rights contested, 
And thereby forced to wear a brand, 
While heartless rebels are invested 
With all the honors of the land? 
Ye men who prize Columbia’s honor; 
Ye who should guide her in the right: 
Oh, suffer not this base dishonor; 
Let naught so foul her glory blight. 
Remove your doubts, dispel your fears, 
And in the right move bravely on; 
For ere one round decade of years 
Have passed, full liberty shall dawn. 
Your every right shall be obtained, 
And you respected here shall be; 
Here in this land, where long enchained, 
You’ve worn the badge of slavery; 
While here we sing of liberty 
Upon this far-off western strand, 
The soul-inspiring symphony 
Is welling up o’er all the land. 
For lo! Arkansas doth rejoice, 
And Texas sings with cheerful voice, 
And Mississippi’s heart doth swell, 
And hail with joy the rising knell 
Now sounding on her gulf-bound coast— 
The dirge of a departed ghost. 
And Louisiana’s fields of cane 
Doth wave in triumph the refrain; 
And Alabama’s lofty pines, 
And Florida’s sweet-scented vines 
Today doth joyously exhale 
Rich odors on each passing gale. 
And Georgia, freed from every vice, 
Now offers up her fields of rice— 
And South Carolina—first to err— 
Repentant of the days that were, 
Now waves her chainless hands on high, 
In praise of freedom’s victory. 
And North Carolina’s Dismal Swamp, 
Arrayed in rich and gorgeous pomp, 
Doth hail with pride the loud acclaim, 
And sweetly sing in freedom’s name. 
And Old Virginia, proud and grand, 
With her fair sister, Maryland, 
Doth chant the chorus, swell the song, 
The which today shall roll along 
In paeans deep, and loud, and strong, 
O’er every hill and vale and plain 
Throughout the land, from Gulf to Maine, 
And in one grand halo of sound, 
Sweep fair Columbia’s distant bound, 
And on the radiant wings of light 
Soar upwards to the Infinite, 
And pour upon the Eternal’s ear 
One song and shout of grateful cheer. 
And now, my muse, thy song resume, 
’Twixt hope and doubt, ’twixt joy and fear, 
’Twixt morning gray and twilight gloom, 
Along a path nor dark, nor clear— 
Sing now of him in high estate, 
On whom is bent the nation’s eye— 
Where all her glories culminate 
To form a radiance for her sky. 
The now incumbent of that chair 
Where he, our good friend, sat before— 
Has spoke full oft and loud and clear, 
Within the audience of the poor. 
And poorer none than those that wait 
And feeless serve his native state— 
A shoeless, coatless, hatless throng, 
Who ne’er have deemed the journey long, 
If ’twere to catch his words and smiles, 
Between them lay a score of miles; 
With hasty feet they’d wend their way— 
No child in heart more blessed than they 
With but one word, or e’en a look 
From him who had his friends forsook, 
And stood apledged before high Heaven, 
That he would see their fetters riven: 
That he would be their fathful guide, 
And lead them past the crimson tide, 
Athrough the wilderness that lay 
Between their night and that bright day 
Which shines forever on the rest 
Of all the worthy, free and blest; 
That he their Moses would become 
And bring them to the freeman’s home— 
That he their cause would ne’er forsake, 
Nor his pledge nor promise break, 
Till every bondsman in the land 
Should on the plains of freedom stand— 
Pledged to the sacred cause of truth; 
Pledged in the early days of youth; 
Pledged by the summer, the winter and spring, 
And pledged by all that truth may bring. 
And now, that he sits in high estate 
And holds the interests of the great; 
The interest of the passing poor — 
Their interest now and evermore 
Within the hollow of his hand, 
Oh! will he, will he firmly stand? 
Or, in the mantlings of the just 
Will he betray his sacred trust? 
Forbid it, Pleaven! O, Heaven, forbid! 
And moisten not the trusting lid 
With scalding teardrops from the heart,. 
Which needs must flow should he depart 
Now, from the sacred cause of truth, 
And from the pledges of his youth. 
To these, oh, may he ever stand! 
Firm as the mountains of his land! 
And from his high, majestic place, 
Look favoring on an injured race, 
And use his Heaven-entrusted might, 
To raise them from oppression’s night, 
And in this all-auspicious hour, 
Invest them with a freeman’s power: 
Whereby they may themselves protect 
Against the wiles of base neglect, 
And cause this glorious land to be, 
In fact, the home-land of the free. 
Then shall mankind call him blest, 
And when he sinks to his quiet rest, 
From that bright, hoary autumn, he will look 
back and see 
This broad land—all happy and free. 
MODERN MOSES, OR “MY POLICY” 
MAN. 
There is a tide in men's affairs, 
Leading to fame not wholly theirs— 
Leading to high positions, won 
Through noble deeds by others done. 
And crowns there are, and not a few, 
And royal robes and sceptres, too, 
That have, in every age and land, 
Been at the option and command 
Of men as much unfit to rule, 
As apes and monkeys are for school. 
For seldom an assassin’s blow 
Has laid a benefactor low 
Of any nation, age or clime, 
In all the lengthened march of time, 
That has not raised to power and might, 
Some braggart knave or brainless wight, 
Whose acts unseemly and unwise, 
Have caused the people to despise 
And curse the hours of his reign, 
And brand him with the marks of Cain. 
And yet to crown the mystery, 
All these have had a Policy. 
Though Cain was treaclTrous and unjust, 
And smote a brother to the dust— 
’Tis not of him we wish to speak, 
Nor of the wife he went to seek; 
Nor of the blood his Nimrod spilt, 
Or famous city which he built. 
But choose we rather to discant, 
On one whose swaggish boast and rant, 
And vulgar jest, and pot-house slang, 
Has grown the pest of every gang 
Of debauchees wherever found, 
From Baffin’s Bay to Puget Sound. 
And yet he occupies a sphere 
And fills a more exalted chair, 
(With arrogant unworthiness, 
To his disgrace, I must confess), 
Than any officer of State, 
Or king, or princely magistrate 
Of royal blood or noble birth, 
Throughout the kingdoms of the earth. 
But how he chance attain’d that hight, 
Amid the splendor and the light, 
The effulgent glory and the ray 
Of this the nineteenth century, 
May, to the superficial mind, 
Seem much complexed and undefined; 
But when the dark and shameless truth, 
Is properly ascribed to Booth, 
The strangeness vanishes in haste, 
And we through murder stand disgraced. 
Disgraced! Perhaps some other word, 
Or milder term should be preferred; 
And if preferred, that term might be 
Exposed to My Policy. 
But there’s a legend much in vogue, 
The act of some knave, wit or rogue, 
A sort of fabled heresy, 
Clothed in the garb of prophecy; 
In which ’tis said that “in the day, 
When kith and kindred shall array, 
Their hostile armies and engage 
In deadly contest, youth and age, 
Lo! from the people shall arise, 
One of the people in disguise; 
A man loquacious in his way, 
And greatly given to display; 
A self-wrought garment he shall wear, 
And beverage be his constant fare; 
Akin his normal state shall be, 
To a ship unballas’d and at sea. 
And he shall favor all that's mean, 
Or low, or vicious and obscene; 
And pay to neither age nor youth, 
A due regard, nor e’en to truth— 
And he shall by his subtle vows, 
Induce the people to arouse, 
And bear him in their confidence, 
Toward a lofty eminence. 
Just here occurs a short hiatus, 
And then concludes the legend thus— 
And he shall owe to tragedy, 
His zenith of felicity; 
And unto gross apostacy, 
The basis of My Policy.” 
But this is so obtuse, of course; 
No one can really see its force; 
And if they could, what is there in it 
To claim attention for a minute— 
Or, by which to point the hand, 
To him the Chief of all the land? 
In reason’s name, in what relation 
Could it refer to his high station, 
Unless some bloody-handed fray, 
Had to his office paved the way? 
For you and I are well aware, 
Just how he chanced obtain that chair; 
P"or any rustic lad of skill, 
Who knows the way to the nearest mill, 
Would not regard the thing a task, 
But say in substance, were he asked, 
First and foully, through a stub and twist, 
And then as the farmer claims his grist, 
By being second on the list; 
Why, ’tis just as plain to sanity, 
As the logic of My Policy. 
But as for Mose, he has been 
And is to-day as free from sin 
As that fond friend who kissed his Lord, 
In presence of a Roman horde. 
Tis true he did somewhat disguise 
His real intentions, and surprise 
The loyal voters of the North, 
By feigning hatred to the South; 
Through which he gained their confidence, 
And won that lofty eminence. 
Tis said, and yet I know not why, 
His fingers wear a crimson dye, 
The which retraced, would likely lead 
Aback to some unlawful deed, 
And only back perhaps, alas, 
To constant pressure of the glass — 
Or to his deep intensity, 
Of interest in My Policy. 
But, lest the treachery of the mind 
Should chance forget a liege so kind, 
We deem this quite a fitting place 
To draw a picture of his grace. 
Ill 
His age, since men so far excel, 
Their seemings none can rightly tell; 
And some there are, on earth’s broad stage, 
Who do not really know their age; 
Others who would not like their’s told, 
Lest some gay flame should deem them old. 
But to the physiognomy 
Of him, my liege, My Policy, 
Of rather more than medium size, 
A blooming nose and hazel eyes, 
And mien, that one might think him given 
To beverage, morning, noon and even’; 
And judge that his proboscis wore 
Its crimson from the overstore; 
For there are some rare nectars known 
And taken to impart a tone 
To the stomach, which will produce, 
By repetition and abuse, 
The like results; hence, many think 
His glow the sad effects of drink; 
Others, more prone to charity, 
Ascribe it to My Policy . 
’Tis said he wanders why it is, 
That all the land makes such a phiz, 
And why they keep in strict reserve, 
A shield for the olfactory nerve; 
When e’er My Policy is brought 
Within the radius of their thought. 
They surely do not see the point, 
But act as though some out-of-joint 
Machine had gained the track, 
And now was keeping progress back. 
O, is it not a burning shame, 
That any folks with such a name 
For science and philosophy, 
To thus regard My Policy. 
Sumner he claims is much at fault, 
And Stevens plotting a revolt 
Of Congress ’gainst the President, 
And ’gainst his noble sentiment— 
With which e’en Davis doth agree, 
And all his learned constituency; 
Hence, Sumner must not there remain, 
And Stevens’ might we ought restrain, 
And Phillips should not be allowed 
To exercise before the crowd, 
His foul bombastic heresy, 
In variance to My Policy. 
His life he deems quite insecure, 
And such a thought long to endure, 
Is torturous in the extreme, 
And breeds full many a fitful dream. . 
He fears some hireling knave may prove 
Recreant to pretended love, 
And give for brandy, water instead, 
And thus consign him to the dead, 
With all his virtue on his head. 
His friends have counseled ’gainst alarm, 
And ’gainst all apprehended harm, 
And well they might, since few are more 
From hurt and violence secure. 
For those who practice lawless deed, 
And on the life of virtue feed, 
Are not accounted with his foes, 
But now and e’er have been of those 
Who would through nameless years protract 
His office and his life intact— 
The dauntless sons of chivalry, 
Who glory in My Policy. 
Tis said, that in the days agone, 
Pie pledged himself to the forlorn; 
He pledged himself the bondsman’s friend, 
And one on whom they might depend 
For counsel, succor or redress, 
In all their hours of wretchedness, 
And swore that he would be their guide, 
And lead them past the crimson tide, 
And through the wilderness that lay 
Between their night and that blest day 
That shines forever on the rest 
Of all the worthy, free and blest; 
That he their Moses would become, 
And lead them to a freeman’s home 
And swore that he would ne’er forsake 
Them, nor his pledge or promise break, 
Till every bondsman in the land 
Should on the plains of freedom stand. 
Pledged to the sacred cause of truth; 
Pledged in the early days of youth; 
Pledged by the summer, winter, spring, 
And pledged by all the truth may bring; 
With all these pledges on his soul, 
And clothed with power to control 
The future destiny of those, 
His wards by all his recent oaths. 
Mark well his action when for aid 
Their suppliant prayer to him was made? 
Witness an instance of his love, 
And all your former doubts remove. 
Mark when that bill for the supply 
Of starving millions met his eye; 
A breadless, clotheless, houseless throng, 
Thus rendered by his nation’s wrong. 
Does he the bill in haste receive 
And sign, their suff’rings to relieve? 
Yes, if withholding of the cup 
From parched lips, whereof one sup 
Would quite allay an inward pain, 
And quite restore to health again 
A prostrate mortal, doomed to die, 
Unless his needs met swift supply, 
Can be accounted as relief— 
Then he in their deep hour of grief, 
Did them relieve and kept his vow; 
When with a dark and wrinkled brow, 
He stamped his veto on their prayer, 
And doomed the suppliants to despair. 
O, what a “Moses” he has been! 
How strenuously against the sin 
Of his fathers he has fought; 
And how ingeniously besought 
The nation in this trying hour, 
To invest with all their wonted power 
Our late rebellious, loving foes, 
To whom for all our recent woes, 
Our wasted treasure, wasted lives, 
Our orphaned children, widowed wives, 
Our prostrate cities, deserted farms, 
And all the joys of wars alarms, 
We are most deeply debtors all, 
And in meek gratitude should fall 
Prostrate before them in the dust, 
And yield the nation to their trust; 
And to enforce the reason why, 
That we should not this boon deny, 
Propounds with matchless dignity, 
His ineffable —My Policy. 
School’d in his childhood to regard 
Foul treason worthiest of reward, 
And loyalty an empty name, 
Meriting dark reproach and shame; 
Therefore, he deems the rebels more 
Worthy positions than before; 
Before their nameless deeds of horror 
Spread o’er our land the veil of sorrow; 
And fain would from the very scurf, 
E’en as from the rising surf 
Of rebeldom, at once create 
Grand officers of high estate, 
And bring them to the nation’s court, 
His grave My Policy to support. 
’Tis said the clergy everywhere, 
Have held up holy hands in prayer 
For his redemption from the thrall, 
And pit of his apostate fall; 
But recently by dream or word, 
Have been most signally assured, 
That there are no blest agencies 
Of grace, outside the promises, 
And in that almost boundless plan, 
Salvation offered unto man, 
Are no provisions that embrace 
A proffered pardon in his case; 
That it were madness to bewail, 
Since all their efforts can but fail; 
For he, to use a term uncivil, 
Has long been mortgaged to the Devil; 
But the fact which no one knows, 
Is why the deuce he don’t foreclose. 
Perhaps he entertains a doubt, 
And fears that Mose might turn him out; 
Hence, His Satanic Majesty’s 
Endorsement of My Policy. 
He claims that suffrage, if applied 
To Negroes, should be qualified; 
That they diplomacied, should hail 
From Dartmouth, Harvard or from Yale, 
Before entrusted for an hour 
With manhood’s great elective power. 
But every rebel in the land, 
From Maine to Georgia’s distant strand; 
Though dark their minds as rayless night, 
Should exercise this manly right, 
Though destitute of reason’s force 
As Balaam’s ancient riding horse: 
On these the boon he would confer, 
Without a scruple or demur, 
Because these gentlemen, quoth he, 
Are members of My Policy. 
His vetoes—gracious! what a list! 
Never in time did there exist 
Such an array of negative, 
Bombastic and explanative; 
’Tis said their reasons are profound, 
Their logic almost passing sound; 
And that such lucid rays they shed, 
They’re understood before they’re read. 
The Bureau Bill is deemed the first 
Of numerous acts, by him reversed; 
The power that bill sought to confer 
On him, provoked his just demur, 
And for this strange, unlikely fault, 
His meekness rose in fierce revolt, 
And flamed with wrath and power to kill, 
He hurled his veto at the bill; 
For actions of humanity, 
Accord not with My Policy. 
He next reversed the bill of rights, 
Lest all the girls—that is the whites— 
Should Desdemonia’s become, 
And fly each one her cherished home, 
And take to heart some sooty moor, 
As Fathers did in days before. 
If but the legal right were given, 
He fears that six in every seven 
Of all the maids in all the land, 
Would give the matrimonial hand 
Unto some swarthy son or other, 
And some, perhaps, might wed a brother. 
This horrid thought his wrath excites, 
And swearing ’gainst all “woman’s rights,” 
He grasped the veto in his ire, 
And doomed the bill to endless fire; 
For all such reciprocity, 
Was foreign to My Policy. 
This ghost-like thought preyed on his soul, 
And robbed him of all self control, 
Till from his fears, lest they obtain, 
He got the veto on the brain; 
The inflated type, the very worst, 
With which a mortal e’er was cursed. 
And hence, when e’er an act is brought, 
For which his signature is sought, 
How plain soever the device, 
He fancies that he “smells a mice,” 
And forthwith runs the trap to bring 
My Policy, and sets the spring, 
And waits with pain-suspended cough, 
To see the curious thing go off. 
And when the fancied mouse is caught 
Within his fancied trap of thought, 
To hear him in that frenzied laugh, 
And see that full three-fingered quaff 
Pass down the lining of his throat, 
And find a lodgment ’neath his coat, 
Would crimson o'er the cheek with shame, 
And send a tremor through the frame, 
The which would cause the heart to yield 
To poignant truth so oft revealed, 
And in that act confess they see 
The secrets of My Policy. 
The little giant of the West— 
His labor done, was laid to rest, 
And to eternalize his fame, 
And thus immortalize his name, 
Moses, with vassals of renown, 
Comes swinging past from town to town 
And makes a quite imposing tour, 
Save that he proves himself a boor 
At divers times in divers ways, 
# All through his eagerness for praise, 
For e’en despite the peerless Grant, 
And monument he came to plant, 
All those that were not wholly blind, 
Could see he had an axe to grind; 
The monument was but a ruse, 
A subtle means to introduce 
My liege of graceless dignity, 
The author of My Policy . 
Tis said that he at times would come 
To cities which were not “to home,” 
From which long ere the pageant closed. 
The peerless Grant grew indisposed, 
And to the banks of Erie’s Lake, 
Repaired for reputation’s sake. 
But be this statement false or true, 
It has the smallest part to do 
With the matter of fact at hand, 
Which is this, when through the land 
He’d gone and played the knave and clown, 
In every city, village, town, 
And felt My Policy was sure 
To win by virtue of the tour, 
The people rise in mass and vote, 
And thus most signally denote 
By their vote and by their voice, 
And by the subjects of their choice, 
That they had blindly failed to see 
The beauties of My Policy. 
Hence, when the massive cavalcade 
Swung round and round in grand parade, 
With much chagrin, they’re all dispensed, 
Just where their fruitless tour commenced. 
’Tis said that Moses had a dream, 
The which has been his constant theme 
Of thought, and converse ever since, 
It seems as though he can’t convince 
Himself that there in truth is not 
Some pre-arranged, mischievous plot 
In embryo, a thing accursed; 
And yet, ere long destined to burst 
On him and from his famed renown 
And apec glory, drag him down; 
Though but a dream, ’twas so akin 
Unto a fact that should have been, 
And because he does not know 
But what it really may be so, 
And like the general that was “lame,” 
Who started ere the foeman came, 
Has suddenly become distres’t 
With pains and achings in the breast— 
J Tis said when night had laid him down 
(His sainted form) in sleep profound, 
There stole athwart his fevered brain 
A dream which caused his spirit pain; 
It seemed that 'reft of every doubt, 
His myriad sins had found him out, 
And charged with numerous crimes and blood, 
Before the bar he trembling stood, 
And heard he all the evidence, 
The prosecution and defense, 
And heard the verdict of the court, 
And felt the truth of their report; 
But that which seemed to pain him most, 
And deepest heartfelt anguish cost, 
Was not to find the charge sustained, 
But 'twas to find himself constrained 
Forthwith to abdicate and be 
A martyr to My Policy. 
The mansion rose in all its pride, 
With all its sweetness multiplied 
Its grand exterior, spotless white, 
A nation’s glory and delight— 
Its massive portals swinging round, 
Without a jar or grating sound— 
Its Brussels carpet, velvet chairs, 
Downy couches, levees and fairs, 
O, from such rare joys to part, 
It seemed as though ’t would break his heart. 
What next occasioned much regret, 
Was the receptions which he met; 
For while he knew full many there, 
Not one but with a scornful air, 
Spurned on him as they passed him by, 
As though they feared in coming nigh 
Contamination might ensue, 
And they grow leprosied and untrue; 
Such ingrate acts were rather more 
Than he could bear His cup ran o’er, 
And streaming down his blooming face, 
He felt the hot tears of disgrace; 
He thought of Willy, and ran in haste, 
But found that he had been displaced; 
He next sought Revey, Vail and Wood, 
But found them in a sullen mood, 
Red-eyed and swollen, as though the three 
Had been in perfect sympathy; 
Before them sat a demijohn, 
Partly filled and partly gone— 
Twas quite enough; he’d found the place, 
He held the huge thing to his face, 
Till through his hands it slipped and broke, 
And springing forward, he awoke 
And found himself stretched on the floor, 
And loudly rapping at the door 
Were wardens, whom from sleep profound, 
Had been affrighted by the sound; 
And to each other wildly calling, 
To learn what ponderous thing had fallen. 
“Go way,” from the within was said, 
“No one is hurt —confound that bed;” 
Then gathering up his graceless form, 
Exhausted some, and somewhat worn, 
And opening wide his hazel eyes, 
And gazing round in glad surprise, 
Poured on the night’s tranquility, 
This strange and marked soliloquy— 
“Can these bright scenes belie their seeming 
What means all this—have I been dreaming? 
Surely, this is the mansion still, 
Despite their numerous threats of ill; 
Despite him and his numerous wiles, 
I’m still the heir of fortune’s smiles, 
Despite them and their myriad threats, 
Their aimless, soulless epithets; 
I am still the President 
Of proud Columbia’s vast extent.” 
And forthwith from his breast a flask 
He drew, and stripped it of its mask, 
All sparkling to its very fill, 
A goodly half-pint, less a gill, 
The which in oriental style, 
Dispatched he at a single smile; 
Then threw the needless flask aside, 
And with a pompous look of pride, 
And seeming consequential air, 
He sank into an easy chair, 
And gravely mused upon the past, 
And mused on subjects far too vast, 
Except for some learned debauchee, 
Or adept in My Policy. 
O, were I but a dramatist, 
What stores of thought I would enlist 
What telling words I would indite, 
And what a play my pen should write 
I’d hie me to the nation’s dome; 
Amid its splendors I would roam, 
Discant on palace, hall and court, 
And on the nation’s grave support, 
Until I placed upon the stage 
The grandest burlesque of the age; 
"Moses! Moses!” should be my theme; 
Not He that through the crimson stream 
Led out from Egypt Israel’s host; 
But "our Mose” of rant and boast, 
Who from the nation’s balcony, 
Cajoled a drunken revelry, 
In telling words of pothouse lore, 
The which had ne'er been heard before, 
Since Kidd, the terror of the wave,' 
Placed men’s life-chart within the grave 
Oh, Demosthenes! in silence rest 
Henceforth "our Mose” shall be the test 
Of all oratorical display, 
And for a sample, by the way, 
Witness his chaste and classic art, 
In his description of sweetheart, 
And Penny nibbling at his heels, 
And then how graphic he reveals 
His wond’rous buncombe, and his pluck, 
In that grave story of the duck. 
And when you have read, O think of the stage, 
And the wonderful star of a wonderful age! 
PREFACE. 
The wonderful change that has taken place 
in the political character of the United States, in 
the last ten years, is well calculated to excite the 
Poetic feelings of any man having a spark of 
Poesy in him. 
The march of events have been peculiarly ro¬ 
mantic, outstripping all human expectations, and 
leaving even prophecy in the rear. 
The present Poem is given to the public with 
the hope of perpetuating, to some extent, the 
remembrance of the “good time/’ and of send¬ 
ing to the future some little knowledge of the 
trials, struggles, and triumph of Liberty in our 
land. 
The Author felt his incompetency to do justice 
to the task—it being an unexplored field—but he 
has opened the way, and leaves to others the duty 
of following, if they will. 
This Poem was written during hours snatched 
from other occupations. Still, we send it forth, 
confident that the theme of which it treats, and 
the earnest sincerity of the Author, will win for 
it the public approbation. It is a statement of 
facts—not fiction—and, gentle reader, we ask you 
to follow it to the close, trusting it may nerve 
you anew for the right, and encourage you in 
the cause of humanity. 
HON. JOHN D. RICHARDS. 
Detroit, Michigan. 
THE TRIUMPH OF LIBERTY. 
TO HIS EXCELLENCY 
HENRY P. BALDWIN, 
Governor of the State of Michigan, 
As a slight testimonial to his generosity of heart and 
nobleness of mind, the following Poem 
is most respectfully inscribed. 
That truth, than fiction, is more strange, 
There's not the shadow of a doubt, 
When we regard the wondrous change 
One short decade has brought about. 
The leopard may have changed his spots, 
Or the Ethiop changed his skin, 
And would far less excelled our thoughts, 
Than those great changes which have been. 
For nought exists in earth or air 
Or ocean’s depths of endless shade, 
With which we justly can compare 
The changes of the last decade. 
Had one deep-skilled in mystic lore, 
Some favored heir or providence, 
Proclaimed abroad from door to door 
The last decade’s unborn events, 
The multitudes who may have heard 
His auguries, though chastely clad, 
Would have pronounced them most absurd, 
And their prognostic author mad. 
Or, had an angel of the sky 
Left for a time his watch and ward, 
And from some towering mountain high 
Cried mightily, thus saith the Lord! 
Columbia’s sons, a million strong 
Shall panoply themselves for war, 
And o’er their hills and vales ere long 
To battle rush from near and far! 
The century bound and fettered slave 
Shall grasp the hilt of freedom’s sword 
And rush amid the struggling brave 
And write his liberties restored; 
He shall have faith where others doubt 
And onward press to lead the van, 
Till slavery’s stain he washes out 
In treason’s gore, and stands a man. 
And ere one full decade has passed 
The land redeemed shall proudly see, 
Of slavery’s relics e’en the last 
Engulfed in freedom’s boundless sea. 
Would we have deemed the message true 
Brought by the heavenly ward so near, 
And gave to it that reverence due 
A message from the glory sphere? 
We might have lent a patient ear 
And thus the message have received, 
We might have felt a sense of fear 
But never would our hearts believed: 
It would have been impossible, 
So wedded were we to the wrong, 
Our hearts had grown invulnerable 
To all appeals however strong. 
No message sent from hell or heaven, 
Brought by the living or the dead, 
Could e’er the mighty spell have riven 
By which dark wrong and we were wed 
Our natures had been schooled to look 
Adversely on each phrase of right, 
Until our hearts could proudly brook 
The truth made bare in reason’s light— 
For error’s potent chords had twined 
About our hearts from early age, 
Till like the tillers of the mind 
Our guides were they in every stage— 
We could not comprehend the thought, 
That freedom was of native mold, 
Heaven inspired and heaven taught 
Which neither chains nor cells can hold: 
Therefore we could not reconcile 
The seeming gross absurdity, 
That he, the slave and long reviled, 
Nursed yet the germs of liberty. 
If not how could he rise above 
His present status of disgrace, 
Or what incentive could him move 
The all auspicious to embrace? 
But changes of the recent past 
Have swept our theories away, 
And crowned with wonders unsurpassed 
The radiant glories of to-day. 
Within the lapse of one decade 
More history we have lived and made 
Than during all the years before, 
Since first our fathers sped them o’er 
The deep blue ocean’s heaving breast, 
And came to this proud land, the West. 
And we have grown in moral hight 
When viewed by heaven’s or freedom’s light 
More in these years a thousand fold 
Than during all the years of old. 
- One decade back and every eye 
That scann’d us closely saw the lie, 
And turned from our spread banner’s face 
To men in chains, and cried disgrace, 
And, hissing, pointed with disdain 
At Freedom forging slavery’s chain. 
One decade back and slavery’s beck 
Alike held State and Church in check, 
How grave or trivial the affair 
On no account would either dare 
To move one hair-breadth in extent 
Till clothed with his august consent— 
When e’er he waved his Sceptered hand 
The mighty millions of our land 
Were filled with wonderment and awe 
And eager to obey his law— 
He stamped his foot, and Liberty 
Trembled as doth the aspen tree, 
When old Boreas from his cave, 
Begirt with wrath comes forth to rave. 
The court, to do him honor, made 
Him a license to invade 
The lowly cot and palace dome, 
And sacred precincts of each home, 
Where ever found upon our soil 
In quest of his assumptive spoil. 
• And men who ranked in high estate 
Would breathless on his bidding wait, 
And all our proud official corps, 
Like blood-hounds, ran from door to door, 
And often forced their presence where 
E’en decency would cry forbear; 
And all for what? Why, simply 
This, and nothing more—Liberty! 
Innate and deathless as the soul 
Had swelled beyond the chains control, 
And e’en inspired the base born slave 
To seek for freedom or the grave. 
Our prisons, too, whose chief intent 
Was crime to punish and prevent, 
Became the slave-pens of the land, 
To which the Tyrant of the brand 
To check-mate human liberty 
Held in his grasp both lock and key. 
Besides all this, a hoary sage, 
A highly honored legal chief 
Just passing from this earthly stage, 
Gave this as his profound belief: 
“Blacks have no rights, not life except, 
Which bind the zvhite man to respect ” 
This formed the climax of support 
Which slavery drew from Freedom’s Court. 
While thus the Court strained every nerve 
Her wonted fealty to preserve, 
The Church was not a whit behind; 
For she, with all her strength combined, 
Was moving earth and fiends and hell 
In order that she might excel 
The baseness of the Court, and rise 
Pre-eminent in Slavery 3 s eyes. 
To do him honor prelates came 
Of nearly every creed and name, 
All decked in sacerdotal gear, 
Each rivaling each as to appear, 
While void of ostentatious pride, 
Most potent, grave and dignified. 
And each to Court his reverence bowed, 
And prayed to him both long and loud; 
And temples reared they in his name, 
And grand memorials to his fame, 
Whose every brick and massive stone 
Was purchased with a human bone, 
And all the mortar ’twixt their layers 
Was mingled flesh and blood and tears 
Of captives whom dark wrong had slain 
To rear up Slavery’s Godless fain. 
And thus with rant hypocrisy 
And sacrilegious blasphemy, 
The Church sought to surpass the Court 
In crowning slavery with support 
Oh, if the cheek was ever flushed 
Of devils, then they must have blushed 
At these base scenes of mammon greed 
Which hell itself could scarce exceed! 
For there, midst all this mock display, 
This scowl upon the face of day, 
The truth lay prostrate, and the right 
Was chained and gagged, while reason’s light 
Shone like a taper in a tomb, 
And half extinguished by the gloom. 
Oh! ne’er did goodly land thus sink 
As ours so near to ruin’s brink. 
Our fathers might have wept, and did, 
If earthly scenes are not all hid 
From eyes of those blest ones who stand 
Or near or far in glory land. 
But unto God that’s ever near, 
The righteous are His special care; 
And in our land there were a few 
Firm friends of Freedom, tried and true. 
A few who ne’er had bowed the knee 
Nor sacrificed to Slavery; 
A faithful, zealous noble band. 
The salt and savors of our land, 
Whose meritorious deeds should blaze 
In letters of undying praise. 
But while we thus them all revere, 
Of two we’d fain make mention here. 
ONE decade back there lived a man, 
A strict, unswerving Puritan; 
And though as brave as Ammon’s son, 
No gods had he to serve but one, 
The God of Justice, God of Truth, 
Whom he had served from early youth. 
His heart was not inured to wrong, 
Though he had seen and felt it long; 
Yet had he oft implored the time 
When there should be an end to crime, 
When Truth should rise, assert her claim, 
And wrong sink down to whence it came. 
At length he grew to feel inspired 
To what his heart had long desired, 
To strike one blow for Liberty, 
Where it should end in victory; 
Though he should perish in the deed, 
He felt that he could plant the seed 
From which the harvest would arise, 
And shrank not from the sacrifice; 
Him call enthusiast, if you will, 
Fanatic, or something- wilder still, 
It will not blur his deathless name, 
Nor bar his onward march to fame. 
For when he felt the hour had come 
He left his fair North Elba home 
And with e’en less than a score of men, 
Went forth, and in the very den 
And citadel of Slavery 
Unsheathed his sword for Liberty. 
This, this was old John Brown, the brave 
Whom great Virginia hanged, to save 
Through sacrifice to Slavery, 
Her panic stricken chivalry. 
For from the night on which he made 
Their State the center of his raid, 
Until the law pronounced him dead, 
Of him they lived in constant dread. 
Although confined within a cell, 
By many a bolt and lock as well, 
And prostrate on a fevered cot, 
Through consequences ill-begot, 
From care and pain and loss of blood, 
And from the much he had withstood, 
Besides all this, of armed men, 
To guard that ancient veteran, 
A regiment were scattered round, 
All o’er that half enchanted ground, 
Lest he should from his mat of straw, 
Come forth and by his presence awe, 
And terrify e’en unto death 
Famed Chivalry’s half-suspended breath. 
Although like Sampson he was ta’en, 
And by the base Philistines slain, 
Yet he in death accomplished more 
Than e’er he had in life before. 
His noble heart, which ne’er had failed, 
Proved firm, and e’en in death prevailed; 
And many a tear drop dimmed the eye 
Of e’en his foes who saw him die— 
And none who witnessed that foul act 
Will e’er in life forget the fact. 
Twas on a clear December day, 
So mild it seemed, that gentle May 
Had, in respect for that dread hour, 
Donated one from her sweet bower. 
No clouds were seen in all the sky, 
Save one, and that was hovering nigh, 
As though its mission w^s to screen 
From angels’ ken the awful scene. 
For when upon the scaffold bare, 
The hero stood, that cloud was there, 
But when the throng pronounced him dead 
That mystic cloud and screen had fled. 
His lifeless form his friends besought, 
And far, far from that wretched spot, 
And from those scenes of suffering 
To which such dreadful memories cling, 
And to a freer, purer soil, 
Uncursed by sweat of unpaid toil, 
And to an unfrequented nook, 
Whereon no craven eye may look, 
Where Freedom doth her vigil keep, 
They laid him down to dreamless sleep. 
Scarce had his friend in calm repose 
Entombed his form, when there arose 
A restless spirit, which obtained 
Where e’er of liberty remained, 
A single spark of honest thought, 
Too sacred to be sold or bought. 
And thus the truths for which he died 
Spread everywhere, and multiplied, 
And rolled on like a foaming sea, 
Until the Sons of Liberty 
In all their majesty came forth, 
And styled themselves the mighty North; 
And from their ranks selected one, 
An unassuming woodman’s son, 
Who bore their standard midst the feud, 
And mighty contest which ensued. 
He was from nature’s plastic mold, 
What kings and mighty men of old 
Through lengthened years of toil, in vain 
Had sought and striven to attain; 
All that a language could express 
Of noble-hearted faithfulness. 
There was no grace he did not court, 
Nor blemish in his manly port, 
Tall, and of commanding form 
And Heaven ordained to rule the storm. 
There was a calm serenity, 
A kind, persuasive, artless art 
Pervading the Divinity 
Which filled his great and manly heart. 
All manly forms that graced his sight, 
He deemed them men or black or white; 
He bowed to all with deference, 
And won a world of reverence. 
He was that Son of Liberty, 
Whose Heaven-approved fidelity 
Made every act of his sublime. 
And safely might we challenge Time, 
With his deep, enveloped page, 
The annals of a nameless age, 
To bring forth one of purer mold, 
Or one who had a stronger hold 
Upon his country’s throbbing heart, 
Then he whose native, artless art 
Has carved his own undying name 
Upon the deathless scroll of fame. 
Need I here that name pronounce, 
Where if each heart would speak at once, 
The glorious, grand response would be 
“Lincoln, the friend of Liberty!” 
If Fame’s all glorious scroll were lost, 
And there remained the merest ghost 
Of all the present, of all the past, 
If deathless liberty could last, 
Her share of glory to receive, 
Great Lincoln’s name would also live! 
But to return, when slavery’s hosts 
Saw how that all their plans had failed, 
And how that he, they envied most, 
Had e’en despite their wiles prevailed; 
They grew incensed, and madly blind, 
And swore by all that had been done 
To rend the sacred bands which bind 
Our many glorious states in one,— 
And in their stead, build of their own 
A time enduring dynasty, 
Whose spreading base and corner stone 
Should rest on human slavery. 
To such an epoch they had bent, 
For thirty years their vulturous eye, 
And well-provisioned the event, 
With every species of supply. 
The arsenals were in their hands, 
And in their hands were all the spoil, 
And all the soldiery of our lands 
Were rendezvousing on their soil, 
With these unique advantages, 
And deeming their success as sure, 
Like Hell-inspired savages 
Upon the nation’s flag they pour 
Volleys of grape and canister, 
Then seized the navy, and reversed 
Its purpose, so as to deter 
The North, then dared them to their worst. 
The news spread forth with speed of thought 
In all directions o’er the land; 
Nor nook nor point was there forgot. 
It swept its length from strand to strand, 
The State was like the storm-lashed sea, 
Chafing itself with wild unrest, 
No bounds were there to the degree 
Of rage, apparent and expressed. 
All business lay in blank suspense; 
And men stood idly here and there, 
With no apparent deference 
To secular pursuit or care. 
No ships of war, nor arms nor men, 
The treasury in a broken state; 
And every post a rebel den, 
Where treason brawled in high debate,— 
Is but a picture faintly drawn, 
Too faint by far except to cull 
Some scattered fragments of the dawn 
Of Lincoln's first inaugural. 
Now, as our chief executive, 
His first great office to perform 
Was on the moment to conceive 
A means by which to check the storm, 
Which soon would burst from its confines, 
And sweep along our northern lines 
With lightning flash and thunder roar, 
More terrible than aught before. 
He called for loyal men of war, 
Five and seventy thousand strong: 
'Twas heralded anear and far, 
And answered by a mighty throng. 
They came of every clime and race 
Of which our glorious land can boast, 
With anxious hearts to take their place 
In freedom's cause at any post. 
And some there came of Afric’s hue, 
Though born and reared upon our shore, 
Who eager were to don the blue, 
As they had done in days before. 
As they had done at Lexington, 
At Bunker Hill and Brandywine, 
At Monmouth and at Bennington, 
'Midst freedom’s boasts in freedom's line. 
As they had done at New Orleans, 
And on Lake Erie’s troubled waves, 
And in a word, 'midst all the scenes, 
Made sacred through our struggling braves. 
But prejudice and foul disdain 
Rebuked and scorned their proffered aid. 
And taunting, urged that slavery’s chain 
Bore no relation to the raid. 
And thus they grew, the jeer and butt 
Of the derisive and the vile; 
And suffered many a cruel cut 
From rostrum and from press the while. 
These prated of a White Man’s war, 
And claimed that Negroes feared to die; 
That face of those zvho placed the scar 
Upon their backs would make them fly. 
Such was the feelings which possessed 
The loyal heart when Sumpter’s fort 
By rebel soldiers was distressed, 
And we could render no support. 
And such the feeling which prevailed 
Up to our sad Bull Run retreat; 
For ever yet our arms had failed 
The rebel forces to defeat. 
Our dead lay bleaching on the plains, 
By scores of. thousands slept they there, 
While liberty, with plaintive strains, 
Was calling fresh recruits to war. 
Our hospitals were running o’er 
With all our sick and wounded braves; 
And in one line a thousand score 
Of stalwart, hail and idle slaves. 
Of these their masters some were dead, 
And prisoners some, but all were foes, 
Who from their slaves and homes had fled, 
The Union forces to oppose. 
O Prejudice! thou art to blame 
For half of all the noble braves 
Who fell in Freedom's sacred name; 
’Twas thy base deeds that dug their graves! 
Witness thy truckling course, and then 
Defer thy case to honest men; 
To judge betwixt thy soul and mine. 
Behold within the Union line 
Scores of thousands of brawny arms 
Held up in view of war’s alarms, 
Pulsating with their force of life, 
And anxious for the scenes of strife,— 
Anxious to wield the battle sword 
’Gainst vile oppression’s murderous horde, 
Praying heaven, and praying earth 
To grant them license to go forth 
And bear their part where freedom’s braves 
Were falling in untimely graves. 
Alas! alas, their humble prayer 
Fell heedless on the murky air, 
And met no answer in return, 
Except a cold and heartless spurn. 
And yet, while thou wert scorning these, 
Our forces, both by land and seas, 
Were being worsted in the fight, 
And pressed at times e’en unto flight, 
Leaving behind their graveless dead, 
And wounded braves, uncared or fed. 
And yet thou hold’st at thy command, 
Ready whereon to lay thy hand, 
A hundred thousand stalwart blacks 
Eager to don their haversacks 
And rush with muskets to the field, 
Or swords dissevered from their shield, 
And there to pledge ’neath Heaven’s blue sky 
To conquer treason’s host or die. 
And yet they were denied the right— 
Denied the privilege to fight 
’Gainst rebels who had veiled in gloom 
Full many a Northern heart and home. 
And wherefore were they thus denied 
Until the glory and the pride 
Of all our mighty North was taken 
And lifeless strewn o’er many a plain? 
Oh! Prejudice! thou art to blame 
For half of all the noble braves 
Who fell in fredom’s sacred name; 
’Twas thou, foul fiend, that dug their graves 
But for thy forked tongue of guile 
Blood would have flowed not half the while; 
But for thy craven heart of guilt 
Not half the blood would have been spilt; 
Yet, in despite thy rant’and boast 
The right shall live when e’en thy ghost, 
Thy hated ghost, thou cursed thing, 
Shall to the drift of raiment cling! 
The mission of the war was plain, 
But prejudice so dimmed our sight 
That long we blindly strove in vain, 
Groping our way amidst the light. 
The mission of the war was this— 
To force the bolt, unbar the door, 
And let the long oppressed go free; 
It was no veiled hypothesis, 
But plain, so plain that all might see, 
E’en to the poorest of the poor. 
And some did see, and feigned they saw it not, 
While others saw and cursed their hapless lot. 
But those who long in darkness dwelt, 
And those who in death’s shadow stood, 
Saw its bright beams; they saw and felt, 
And well its purpose understood. 
For straight they took their harps once more 
From off the boughs where they had hung, 
And ran their stiffened fingers o’er 
Their chords, to which the moss had clung, 
When lo! to their too great surprise, 
Those chords possessed their wonted glee 
And chanted to the very skies 
The rising dawn of jubilee. 
But those who dwelt upon the plain, 
Or sported on the mountain high, 
When prejudice had left his stain, 
Saw no bright bow of promise nigh. 
For we had sought to crush the South, 
Without the black man or his aid, 
And to this end had taxed the North, 
And West and East to quell the raid, 
And yet the rebels kept the field 
With reinforcements in reserve, 
Before our troops they would not yield, 
Nor widely from their purpose swerve. 
Full twenty moons had waxed and waned, 
And war had darkened many a home, 
Before the anxious black obtained 
The right, a soldier to become. 
But not till we had vainly tried 
To reconcile our traitorous foe: 
Not until we, with humbled pride, 
Had really begged them to forego, 
And e’en were driven to destroy 
Their institution of support, 
Did we a single black employ, 
In rank or navy, field or fort. 
But when the time had quite expired; 
The hundred days of the decree, 
And God and justice now required 
The bondsman’s promised liberty— 
Then noble Lincoln, armed with might, 
And clothed with honor, truth and right, 
Stretched forth his hand, and took the quill, 
And tracing it along the page, 
He framed, with heaven-admiring skill, 
The crowning feature of his age— 
That God inspired instrument! 
Charter of manhood—Liberty! 
Heaven ordained and heaven sent 
To rid our land of slavery! 
The news thereof spread far and wide, 
And filled each humble slave’s abode 
With the grand and joyous tide 
Of blessings which had been bestowed. 
BELL'S POEMS. 
Then wild the Union to assist, 
As regulars or volunteers, 
The blacks rushed forward to enlist 
’Midst thunder shouts and deafening cheers. 
Old Massachusetts’ Fifty-fourth 
Filed into line, and swelled the ranks, 
And charged so nobly on the South 
As to extort the Nation’s thanks. 
Then came the arming of the slaves, • 
The noble Butler's “contrabands,” 
Who proved themselves not only braves, 
But ranked the soldiers of our lands. 
Then black men went as substitutes 
While timid white men staid at home; 
Thus swelled the ranks of all recruits, 
Till bloody treason met its doom. 
Two hundred thousand strong they stood, 
And fought for liberty and right, 
And quite as freely shed their blood 
As those proud braves whose skins were white. 
They bravely fought! And is that all 
That truth can say in their defense? 
They drank the very dregs of gall, 
And bore a world of insolence. 
And yet of Liberty’s tried friends, 
They ranked the truest of the true; 
Ne’er having swerved for selfish ends, 
Nor coupled treason with their hue. 
For twelve score years in feeless toil, 
They labored for our country’s good, 
Delved in our mines, wrought on our soil, 
And fertilized our fields with blood. 
In all our wars they bore their part, 
Nor shrank from dangers imminent, 
Mingling the life-blood of their heart 
With that of braves most eminent. 
And yet, through all those lengthened years 
Their life was one of grief and pain* 
And groans, and sighs, and bitter tears, 
And worse than all, a life of chains. 
But there’s to every day an eve, 
And unto every night a morn, 
And joys there are for those who grieve, 
Howe’er dejected and forlorn! 
The wrong may triumph for a while, 
But right comes uppermost at last, 
And love shall bloom, and peace shall smile. 
When error’s hated reign is past. 
Lift up your hearts, ye long oppressed, 
And hail the gladsome rising dawn, 
For Slavery’s night, that sore distressed 
And tortured you, has passed and gone! 
And Liberty’s refulgent blaze 
Lights up our broad, unbroken land, 
And nowhere ’neath her spreading rays 
Lives there a fetter or a brand! 
All hail! the land has been redeemed 
From thraldom's foul and ruthless sway; 
And Freedom's radiant light has streamed 
Along the bondman’s gloomy way! 
And in those dungeons of dispair, 
Whence every ray of hope had fled, 
Blest Liberty had entered there 
And breathed new life into the dead. 
And o’er those regions of the brand, 
Where toil was recompensed with scorn, 
Has waved abroad her flaming wand; 
And lo! a nation there is born— 
And clothed upon with sacred rights; 
Those sacred rights of jealous care, 
In whose defense the torch she lights, 
And strips her arm of vengeance bare. 
O, Liberty! thou peerless queen! 
Thou quenchless essence of the soul, 
Preside o’er these in every scene, 
And ward them ’gainst all base control; 
Plant in their hearts a love of thought, 
An anxious spirit to acquire 
Those mighty truths that are only bought 
With perseverance and desire. 
Move them to grasp with hand and heart, 
And with a deathless will beside, 
Each mode of science, skill and art, 
Consistent with our Nation’s pride: 
So that the world may ne’er regret 
The mighty work that’s been performed, 
And so that Time his seal may set 
Upon their future all adorned.

There is no right a freeman has 
So purely sacred as his choice. 
How e’er bereft he’ll cling to this, 
And in its potency rejoice: 
For in its exercise he stands 
The peer of titled wealth and state, 
How e’er possessed of spreading lands, 
Or gifted they in high debate— 
He is their peer, however grand, 
Or much upon themselves they dote, 
For there’s no station in our land 
Which ranks a man above his vote. 
The right to exercise a right; 
The right to choose ’twixt man and man 
The right to battle for the right, 
And in the right do what we can, 
Is manhood clothed with liberty— 
The just, inherent right of all, 
Regardless of ability, 
Or age, or sex, or great or small! 
That right today the black man wields 
With gratitude, though long denied, 
For deep within his heart he feels 
A sacredness of joy and pride. 
Nobly the war has done its work, 
And nobly the Republicans, 
With no apparent wish to shirk, 
Have canceled Freedom’s high demands. 
They took the fetters in their hand, 
And wrenched them from the bleeding limb; 
Then took the slave ’neath their command, 
And nurtured and disciplined him. 
They gave subsistence to his wife, 
And to his little ones gave bread, 
And thus amid the scenes of strife 
Were countless thousands clothed and fed. 
They formed the Freedmen’s Bureau Bill, 
Which placed the letter in his hand, 
And gave him schools, despite the will 
Of him, the tyrant, in command. 
They framed the Bill of Civil Rights, 
By which his living was secured 
Against those vile malevolent whites 
Whose souls to treason were inured. 
Then toward our fundamental laws 
They bent their hearts in zealous toil, 
And thereunto affixed a clause 
Which banished slavery from our soil. 
This nobly done, they still propose 
Our charter further to amend, 
By making citizens of those 
The law had proffered to defend. 
Though ’twas a grave step in the right, 
The party claimed it none the less, 
And girding well their loins with might, 
They fought the issue to success. 
This contest, proudly fought and won, 
Left one just claim uncanceled yet, 
Before the world-wide shout, well done! 
Would ring from freedom’s minaret. 
To council this, the final claim, 
And merit freedom’s grand applause, 
And win a fadeless wreath of fame, 
Through noble deeds in manhood’s cause; 
They concentrated all their might, 
Which great Ulysses deigned to lead? 
And claimed the Franchise as a right, 
And just investment of the freed. 
To every State went forth the claim, 
How e’er convenient or remote, 
And everywhere, in freedom’s name, 
They pressed the freedman’s right to vote. 
State after State endorsed the fact, 
Which lent new ardor to their zeal—■ 
A zeal which no incentive lacked 
To strengthen or enforce appeal. 
Full thirty States at length filed out, 
And proudly stood on manhood’s side; 
And Freedom raised the joyous shout, 
“Well done! All hail! All satisfied!” 
This was the crowning act of all; 
And placed upon one common base, 
Of all this mighty rolling ball 
A specimen of every race. 
Freedom’s proud temple’s now complete, 
Crowned with the long-rejected stone; 
And we are here to hail and greet 
The master minds bv which ’twas done. 
Hail! Master Workmen, noble band! 
And hail the key-stone, and the arch, 
The pride and glory of our land! 
And hail, to manhood’s onward march! 
The night of gloom, the night of sorrow, 
The night of wrong, the night of chains, 
At length has passed, and lo! the morrow 
Of joy has dawned, and Freedom reigns. 
For, in our nation’s Senate Hall, 
A Negro has his seat today, 
Where, e’en in memory’s brief recall, 
Sat Calhoun, Webster, Cass and Clay. 
Rejoice, O land, bought by the sword, 
Redeemed and by the sword set free! 
Let all thy sons, with one accord, 
Be jubilant o’er thy victory. 
That we should have a member, where 
One decade back, ’twere worth the head 
Of such as he, to even dare 
Within those sacred halls to tread, 
Proves that the world doth surely move, 
And proves that men of worth may rise 
From low estate, and soar above 
Their former selves in nature's guise. 
How wondrous the coincident, 
That from the Great Arch Rebel's home, 
His erring State to represent, 
Our first Black Senator should come, 
A seat of office to complete, 
Made vacant through Jeff's recreancy. 
O, for the privilege to greet 
That Negro in that Rebel’s seat! 
'Twere worth the distance and expense. 
But this, is not the only post 
By Negroes filled, deserving boast: 
We have a Judge upon the seat, 
And Ministers in foreign lands, 
At home, a Governor, to greet, 
And Legislators e’en in bands. 
The prayed-for time has come at last— 
The time of which we used to sing, 
The good time talked of in the past, 
Is here today upon its wing— 
The ballot's in the black man’s hand; 
Promotion waits him at his door, 
And peace and plenty crown our land, 
And freedom reigns from shore to shore. 
Strike all your bells, ye lofty spires! 
Wave all your banners, freedom wave! 
Loose your tongues, ye tell-tale wires, 
And you, ye thundering cannons rave! 
America, the land of science, 
The land of every nation's love, 
Has formed with Freedom an alliance 
So pure, ’tis registered above! 
Lift up your heads, ye lofty mountains! 
Clap your glad hands, ye mighty seas! 
Leap for joy, ye crystal fountains, 
And odors waft sweet balmy breeze! 
The crowning work is now accomplished, 
The builders have received the stone! 
Dark Slavery’s fame has been demolished, 
And all his Dagon gods o’erthrown! 
And on its base a mighty temple, 
Gorgeous, grand, sublime and free! 
O’er whose proud dome and lofty steeple 
Presides eternal Liberty! 
Stand proudly up, aged sire! 
Be filled with hope, elastic boy; 
Bring forth the lute and tune the lyre, 
And let us have a feast of joy! 
For lo! the hand that held the musket, 
And strangled treason in the fight, 
Flas laid aside the war-worn corselet, 
And taken the ballot as a right! 
And the right at his discretion 
To wield it as his faith may guide 
Responsible for each digression, 
To God, his country, and his pride! 
And now, in conclusion, accept a brief line 
Inscribed to our country, thy country and mine. 
Hail! hail mighty Land with thy proud destiny! 
Enduring as time, all chainless and free! 
Hail! hail to thy mountains majestic and high, 
Reclining their heads against the blue curtained 
sky. 
And hail to thy valleys so fragrant and fair, 
With wild flowers blooming and scenting the air! 
And hail to thy prairies, outspreading and wide, 
Resembling the Ocean's broad billowless tide. 
And hail to thy Streamlets, all wending their way 
Adown to their Rivers, more mighty than they; 
And hail to thy Rivers as onward they sweep 
Through th’ low valley lands to their home in the 
deep! 
And hail to thy Oceans, all dotted with sails, 
Their white wings extended, inviting the gales! 
And hail to thy Commerce, the pride of the world, 
And hail to thy Standard so proudly unfurled! 
And hail to thy Cities all teaming with life, 
Where the interest of all is the center of strife. 
And hail to thy Railroads and steam-driven trains 
That sweep through thy mountains and dash o'er 
thy plains! 
And hail to thy Telegraph, thy glory and prime, 
Defying all distance, and outstripping Time, 
Extending its arms through the heart of the sea 
And binding all Realms to the Land of the Free! 
And hail to thy Magistrates, Judges and Courts, 
And Armies and Navies, thy strength and sup¬ 
ports. 
And hail to thy Congress, where thy statesmen 
are met, 
Where thy wisdom for ages in Counsel have sat. 
And hail to thy Chief, the Bright Crown of thy 
State, 
The gallant Ulysses, all glorious and great! 
And hail, once again, thy glory and pride! 
Bright Banner of Freedom, out-spreading and 
wide! 
There's not a dark spot on thy features today! 
As pure as the heavens, and radiant as they! 
Thus, ever proud Banner, exultingly wave! 
Thou glory and pride of the unfettered slave! 
POEM, 
In commemoration of the death of Abraham 
Lincoln, delivered at the great public meeting 
of colored citizens on Tuesday evening, April 
18, 5, Sacramento, Cal. 
Wherefore half-mast and waving sadly 
And seeming ill-disposed to move, 
Are those bright emblems which so gladly 
Were wont to wave our homes above? 
And why is all this lamentation? 
And why those outward signs of woe? 
And why is this all-glorious nation 
Thus in her hour of hope bowed low? 
Wherefore those marks of grief and sorrow 
So visible on every face? 
To what foul deed of bloody horror 
Do all those gloomy signs retrace? 
Aback to the walls and lofty spire! 
Back to the Nation’s Halls of State! 
Back to our country’s bleeding sire! 
Back to our dying Magistrate! 
We know not why God has permitted 
This tragic scene, this bloody deed; 
An act so seemingly unfitted, 
In this auspicious hour of need. 
Though none perhaps may the intention, 
Or the wonderous purpose tell, 
Of this direful life-suspension— 
Yet God, the Lord, doeth all things well! 
Our Nation’s Father has been murdered! 
Our Nation’s Chieftain has been slain! 
By traitorous hands most basely ordered; 
And we, his children, feel the pain. 
Our pain is mixed with indignation, 
Our sorrow is not purely grief, 
And nothing short of a libation 
From Treason's heart can bring relief. 
And we, in sight of earth and heaven, 
On bended knee, with lifted hand, 
Swear as we hope to be forgiven, 
To drive foul Treason from the land! 
And that fair land so long polluted 
By the sweat of unpaid toil, 
Shall be by liberty uprooted, 
And thickly spread with freedom’s soil. 
Thus we’ll avenge the death of Lincoln, 
His noble principles maintain, 
Till every base inhuman falcon 
Is swept from freedom’s broad domain; 
Until from tower and from turret, 
From mountain height and prairie wide, 
One flag shall wave—and freedom’s spirit 
In peace and love o’er all preside! 
THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, IN THE 
UNITY OF THE RACES. 
Respectfully dedicated to 
BISHOP BENJAMIN W. ARNETT, 
A life-long and devoted friend and a noble and 
loyal citizen whose work for God and the good 
of the race is bearing its fruits, presenting to 
the present generation of colored youth an 
inspiring example for their honest, earnest, 
individual effort. 
Once in a time along the Jordan, 
And e'en from Beersheba to Dan, 
The question rife and all-absorbing 
Hither and thither wildly ran, 
What think you of this Christ, this Jesus? 
What of his intercourse with man? 
The which to solve full many a thesis 
Has been the sport of mind and pen. 
But we today would feign a question 
Bring home to each American; 
No deep-veiled, mystified suggestion, 
But simply, what think you of man? 
Not of the angels high and holy, 
Not of the streets of shining gold, 
Nor of the doomed in hades lowly, 
Nor of time, with his step so bold. 
J57 
These were themes for speculation, 
On which the mind might cogitate 
And weary e’en imagination, 
With heights, and depths, and breadth so great. 
But what of man, is he thy brother, 
In all his variableness of hue? 
And is thy God and God thy Father, 
Alike his God and Father, too? 
Is he entitled and deserving 
In all that's common to the race, 
Whether in ruling or in serving, 
Adjudged by fitness in the case? 
These are the questions of the hour, 
And these the issues of the day; 
On these the wisdom, skill and power 
Of this great nation deigns to play. 
For here, not only the religion, 
But each man’s patriot faith and creed, 
Will blazen forth in his decision 
Till even he that runs may read. 
Therefore, let him within whose nature 
An impulse lives, though weak, to do 
Aright by every living creature, 
Cherish that impulse and be true— 
True to a grand and generous manhood; 
True to the spirit of the age, 
Whose motto is untrammeled selfhood 
For human life in every stage, 
And on this heaven-established basis 
Whoever builds near need not make haste, 
For coming freedman’s glorious trace, 
Too radiant are to be defaced. 
Too high within the mortal heaven 
Has risen the star of destiny, 
And far too wide has spread the leaven 
Of freedom and equality. 
We may not with a will concede it, 
As from the fullness of our hearts, 
But freedman’s God has thus decreed it 
And the boon we must impart. 
No combined power of human effort 
Can turn the joyous time aside, 
Laden with fruits of hope and comfort 
To anxious millions long denied. 
As well confront the mighty ocean, 
Lashing with rage his rock-bound shores, 
And strive to curb his wild commotion, 
Or drown the thunder of his roar, 
As to resist the coming morrow 
Which liberty, and truth, and God 
Have promised these dark sons of sorrow 
So long enchained and ’neath the rod. 
Must we put forth our vain endeavors 
And waste our efforts on the wind, 
And learn too late that mortals never 
Can change what heaven has designed? 
We may provoke God’s indignation, 
And cause the heavens again to frown, 
Till his avenging visitations 
Cause us in sorrow to bow down, 
Yet on and on will sweep the current, 
Now putting in from Freedom’s sea, 
Rushing onward like a torrent, 
Flooding the land with liberty. 
We may attempt to drive them from us, 
Beyond the confines of our shore, 
For even now are there among us 
Monsters with thoughts so vile in store. 
But dare we do it, these jester's slave-men, 
Poor dupes of unrequited toil, 
When we can no longer deprave them, 
Drive them to other lands, the spoil 
Of a miasma wildly raging 
Beneath an endless summer's sun, 
Where listless sloth has been enslaving 
The mind of man since time begun? 
Dare we do this, and righteous heaven 
Pour out on us new vials of wrath, 
Until our land, all rent and riven, 
Shall welter in a crimson bath? 
Oh, stand in awe of God's displeasure; 
Our sure destruction we may buy. 
And through our baseness fill the measure 
Of our guilt, and cursed of heaven die. 
The means of life and self destruction 
Are placed in every nation’s reach, 
While error, the bane of reproduction, 
Insinuates at every breach. 
Beware! If God has built this nation 
All its constituents are good 
And needful to its preservation, 
Whether they be stone or wood. 
We may not comprehend the structure 
In full minutial design, 
Nor trace its varied architecture 
In arris, groove, and curve, and line. 
Be but faithful, and the Great Grand Master 
Will on his trestle board make plain 
All that's obtuse, but no whit faster 
Than ’twere needful to explain. 
But can we not perceive a purpose 
In the peopling of this land, 
Destined of God to be the foremost 
And the grandest of the grand? 
And have we not beheld the nations 
In spreading o’er the vastly sphere, 
That as they spread them weaker traces 
Of their varied types appear? 
There is a principle in nature, 
And demonstrative everywhere, 
Inanimate and breathing creature, 
The self-established truth declare; 
All branches of the common center 
Diminish and weaken in their course, 
The germ in every part doth enter, 
But ever with abated force. 
Behold the oak with spreading branches, 
The trunk-life lives in every branch, 
But as in length each limb advances 
It loses strength and sustenance. 
The giant oak’s unbroken forces 
Within no single branch is found, 
And faultless nature ne’er reverses 
This law in all her varied round. 
The huge oak’s branches closely blended, 
And all completely unified, 
Would rival all the force expended 
And varied life so long supplied. 
Turn to those early peopled regions— 
To Europe, Asia, Africa: 
The home of science and religions, 
And tell us what of them today? 
Where now is all their former glory? 
And where that grandeur and renown 
That radiates the page of story, 
As diamond jettings doth a crown? 
Where now their sculptures and their sages, 
Their painters and their orators? 
And where the pride of all the ages— 
Their poets and philosophers? 
Where now the minds that planned their temples. 
The proud Colossus reared at Rhodes, 
Grand .architectural examples 
And ever-living sculptural modes? 
Their day of grandeur has departed; 
Their sun of glory has gone down, 
And passed away the valiant hearted, 
Their mighty men of great renown. 
Their wondrous temples are in ruins, 
Apollo sleeps beneath the sea;. 
For time has here wrought sad undoings 
And carved on all degeneracy. 
The branch had here become too distant 
From the great Adamic tree, 
And hence the germ and life assistant 
Had grown too meagre in degree; 
For where man lives in isolation, 
Though vast possessions he embrace, 
As family, tribe, kingdom or nation, 
Degeneracy has marked the race. 
Hence, while the clannish tribes were sweeping 
The wide-spread east in their unrest, 
Heaven for a glorious end was keeping 
In blest reserve the mighty west; 
But not until their wasted powers 
Gave evidence of sure decay, 
Was this wealth-flowing land of ours 
Thrown in a wandering seaman’s way, 
Wherein a branch of every nation 
And tongue and tribe beneath the sun, 
, Should spend the days of their probation 
And finally converge into one— 
One, wherein the scattered forces 
Of the great Adamic tree, 
With all its varied life resources, 
Should blend in perfect harmony. 
And by that unifying process, 
Give earth once more a glorious type 
Of wisdom, grace and noble prowess 
Co-equal with the architype; 
A genius of a new creation, 
Whom all shall hail with loud acclaim, 
Whose boast shall be a blood relation 
To all the kindred sons of fame. 
Toward this seeming innovation 
Point all the dial hands of fate, 
And to its final consummation 
On fleeting Time’s revolving plate. 
It may be years, it may be ages, 
The finale is with God alone, 
Who measures not by dates and pages, 
But by the fiat of his throne; 
For in the near and distant future 
Of all those tribal branches here, 
Scarce aught will live in speech or feature 
Of what their great ancestors were. 
For with the unity of branches 
Will come a unity of speech, 
Correcting old and groundless fancies 
Discordant tongues could never reach. 
Dependent are we on each other 
And parts essential to a whole, 
Strive as we may this fact to smother, 
The truth will brook all vain control. 
One man, Jehovah, God created, 
In whom all graces did combine, 
To whom earth’s myriads are related 
E’en as the branch is to the vine. 
And as the thrifty vine while growing 
Round distant limbs its fibers twine, 
With all its wealth of shade bestowing, 
Comprises but a single vine. 
So, in the light of heaven’s deeming, 
Whose broad eye doth creation span 
Earth’s tribes in all their varied seeming, 
Combine to form a single man. 
We are not independent creatures; 
Our brothers’ keepers are we all, 
Bearing the likeness and the features 
Of God, our Maker, great and small; 
Though darker than the shades of blackness, 
Or fairer than the morning light, 
It matters not, in strict exactness, 
God’s image are we, black or white. 
The inspirations of our natures, 
Declare to us, though erring creatures, 
Of each we are integral parts. 
Then here, where fortune has assigned us, 
’Neath God’s blue dome of liberty, 
Let deathless bands of friendship bind us 
In bonds of blest fidelity, 
That in the future grand unfolding, 
When all our dark, perplexing fears 
Respecting rights and their withholding 
Are buried in the grave of years, 
Man shall arise in all his grandeur, 
In all his native dignity, • 
And go forth daring fear or danger, 
The ward of peace and liberty. 
THE YOUTHFUL VILLAGER AND THE 
HERMIT. 
Once on a clear autumnal day, 
With weary heart and spirit bowed, 
I sought a silent scene away 
From all the turmoil of the crowd. 
And where a rent primeval rock 
Reared high its head o’er spire and dome, 
Which seemed majestic and to mock 
The structure of my plebeian home. 
I bent in gaze my straining eye, 
And yielding to a transient freak, 
Resolved within my soul to try 
And scale the towering cloud-capped peak. 
What tiresome moments, more or less, 
I toiled in gaining half its height, 
When lo! a shadowy, deep recess 
Allured and filled me with delight. 
And turning from my onward march 
I found it easy of access, 
And passing ’neath a rural arch, 
I gained a scene of loveliness. 
It might have been a warrior’s home, 
The home of chiefs who dealt in scars, 
Its walls were antique and its dome 
Was flaming with a thousand stars. 
I scanned its countless beauties o'er, 
And turning from a scene too grand, 
I passed again its arching door 
And gazed upon my own loved land. 
I saw beneath, amid the throng, 
The poor man subject to the proud; 
And while I thought of right and wrong, 
I, all forgetting, thought aloud. 
Till then, alas; I little knew 
Of man’s inhuman acts to man, 
But from that panoramic view 
I, half complaining, thus began: 
“If there were less of selfishness, 
If friends were less untrue; 
How much of all earth’s wretchedness 
Would vanish from our view. 
The rich man then would cease to grind 
The fate of him that’s poor; 
And soon the wretch, and wandering hind 
Would vanish from our door. 
And if the stream of kindness ran 
More freely through the heart, 
Then, erring man would feel for man 
And act a brother’s part; 
The golden rule he would obey, 
And seek the poor man’s cot; 
And with his kindly aid assay 
To change his hapless lot. 
For there’s enough for every one; 
Enough, and some to spare. 
Enough of comforts ’neath the sun 
For all that breathe to share. 
Were only half that’s vainly spent 
To make an empty show, 
Amid the haunts of sorrow sent, 
’Twould heal a world of woe. 
And oh! how fragrant would become 
Each balmy breath of morn, 
If every hovel was a home, 
And there were none forlorn. 
As fair as Eden’s blooming grove, 
Would this sad world appear; 
If'man to man would only prove, 
In all his acts, sincere. 
But man! oh, selfish, sordid man! 
How like a fiend at heart, 
Deep skilled in every wily plan, 
He plays a demon’s part. 
See him exulting in his might 
Of pageantry and pride, 
Passing unmoved amid the blight 
Of hunger unsupplied. 
The orphan’s cry for charity; 
The widow’s lonely moan, 
Awakes no chord of sympathy 
Within his heart of stone. 
BELL'S POEMS. 
Although his basket and his store 
Have plenty in supply, 
He doth unto the aged poor 
A crust of bread deny. 
O Thou! the source of every cause 
In air, and earth, and sea! 
Whose ceaseless and unerring laws 
Move all in harmony; 
Why do thy gifts to man on earth 
Unequal still appear? 
Why go some toiling from their birth, 
E’en to their graves in fear? 
While others, decked in fine array, 
Drink deep at pleasure’s court, 
And pass this life as but a day, 
In idle glee and sport! 
Why do the thousands starve and thirst, 
And others die of cold? 
And last of all, and still the worst, 
Why are the millions sold? ' 
Perchance there lies some latent good 
Beyond my feeble ken, 
By angels seen and understood, 
But not perceived by men. 
Yet why should not the culprit know 
Wherefore he stands arraigned? 
Why should the expiating blow 
Fall on him unexplained? 
Fain would we hope in Adam’s fall 
To have seen the problem solved; 
But find alas! his guilt for all 
In life’s great cup dissolved. 
For of one blood all men were made, 
To dwell in all the earth; 
And Adam’s sin was shared and laid 
At each man’s door at birth. 
Condemned to toil were all the race; 
But is it thus with all? 
The gilded idler struts apace 
Mid rank and pomp and ball. 
Their, oh! from whence hath man the power. 
The absolute control, 
To play the mock-god for an hour 
O’er human heart and soul?” 
* * * * ❖ * 
The sun had rolled his golden car 
Adown behind the western hill; 
And I, amid the rocks afar, 
Stood wrapped in meditation still. 
While o’er the landscape far and near 
A greyish, sombre veil had spread, 
Suggesting to the soul the drear 
And awful silence of the dead. 
Fair Cynthia with her smiling face, 
And all her diamond-spangled train, 
Were pouring from the fields of space 
Their silver beams o’er hill and plain. 
Just as I turned to leave the scene 
And seek again my humble cot, 
I spied a man with hoary mien, 
The hermit of some lonely grot. 
‘'Be not in haste,” said he, “young man; 
Thy task is incomplete. 
In quest of truth thou oughtest scan 
Beneath the surface sheet. 
And that thine age may ne’er undo 
The labors of thy youth, 
Learn this, no superficial view 
Hath e’er revealed a truth. 
There is a source for every stream, 
A cause for every woe, 
But veiled in mist they often seem 
To mortals here below. 
Canst thou behold yon silvery moon 
And all the stars above, 
And still the omniscient God impugn 
With motives less than love? 
Those stars are worlds, for aught we know, 
And peopled like our own; 
And move and live within the glow 
And presence of God’s throne. 
For earth is but a speck of sand 
Compared to all the spheres 
That ushered from Jehovah’s hand 
When time began his years. 
And canst thou think! Ah, think again! 
Casnt thou believe that he 
The God of all yon starry train, 
Would work thy misery? 
But thou wouldst know why wrongs abound, 
And whence man hath the power 
To crush his fellow to the ground, 
And like a beast, devour. 
Thou mayst find in Adam’s fall 
A key for every ‘why/ 
Of blood and want and woe, with all 
The wrongs beneath the sky. 
For man, the last and crowning sheaf, 
The sixth day’s work of Heaven, 
Was made by God, and crowned a chief, 
And wide dominion given. 
Made like his God, God of his will, 
With reason for his guide, 
And power to choose the good or ill, 
Or either cast aside. 
Thus crowned was he when first he trod 
Fair Eden’s vale and wood, 
And wore the image of his God, 
And God pronounced him good. 
Good was the earth and all its bowers, 
Good every cool retreat; 
And all the birds and beasts and flowers 
With goodness were replete.” 
TRIUMPHS OF THE FREE. 
Hail, thou observed of many lands, 
Let all thy banners be unfurled, 
This brilliant act of thine commands 
The commendations of the world; 
And all the brave of every tongue 
Shall heap encomiums on thy name, 
While many a lute shall there be strung 
To chant the wonders of thy fame. 
No victory won by land or sea, 
No battle fought since war began, 
Idas done so much for liberty— 
So much for humanizing man— 
And never while that old flag waves, 
Proud ensign of the noble free, 
Wilt thou achieve for all thy braves 
A more ennobling victory. 
For lo! the lightning spark which flew 
With thought-like speed from east to west, 
Brought to the honest, good, and true, 
Glad tidings—while to the oppressed 
And writhing bondsman 'neath the yoke, 
It was as when o'er Bethlehem's plains 
An angel-choir the silence broke, 
And charmed the shepherds with their strains. 
To them, poor, hopeless, and forlorn, 
It seemed a Savior had been given— 
A very Jesus had been born, 
The gift of God—a child of heaven. 
For all the hopes of all their race, 
Swung on the slender thread of choice, 
But interposing heavenly grace 
Controlled events, hence we rejoice. 
Rejoice! rejoice! the bondsmen’s free, 
The last foul link in their last chain, 
This glorious Union victory 
Will change to molten ore again. 
Rejoice! rejoice! our prayer’s been heard; 
Let all who love the truth rejoice, 
For lo! the man our hearts preferred 
Becomes again the nation’s choice. 
Her choice to fill that high estate, 
Grand place of trust, most lofty sphere, 
Commandant and chief magistrate 
O’er all her interest far and near; 
Her choice, but not from blood or birth, 
Or vague hereditary claim; 
But chosen by the mighty North 
For honest truth and patriot fame! 
Chosen because he loved this land, 
Dear home of his progenitors— 
Too well to countenance a band 
Of traitorous conspirators; 
Too well to see that noble flag, 
Beneath whose folds his fathers fought, 
Insulted as a worthless rag, 
And thrust beneath the earth to rot. 
Chosen again, though not as when 
The nation only deemed him true; 
For now since all the skill of men 
Combined with treason’s dastard crew. 
In vain for four long years have tried 
His god-like truth to compromise, 
He's grown a struggling nation's pride 
Whom millions love and idolize. 
Whom millions love—why should they not? 
And though they verge idolatry, 
When we compare their present lot 
With that of chains and slavery, 
We scarcely can prefer a charge, 
'Tis so in keeping with the race 
That whence they draw in blessings large, 
Thither their hearts best loves we trace. 
But what had Lincoln done for those— 
Those weltering 'neath the gory rod? 
Who through their chains and cruel blows, 
Had long been looking up to God? 
This hath he done, by Truth's control, 
Gave Earth and Heaven the best decree, 
Which though it fail to reach the soul, 
Has rent the veil of Slavery. 
Surely the gods have interposed, 
And surely heaven has answered prayer, 
Else why are mercy's doors unclosed; 
And why this seeming special care; 
And why this steady onward march 
Of Justice, Truth and Liberty; 
And why doth heaven’s o’er-spreading arch 
Look down with such complacency? 
And why this overwhelming vote 
By which great Lincoln’s been retained, 
Whose wondrous acts of world-wide note 
Bears freedom to the long enchained? 
God grant to him an arm of strength 
Co-equal to his mighty heart; 
Then shall our bleeding land at length 
Bloom like the rose in every part. 
To whom save him could we commit 
The nation's weal till strife is closed, 
And feel that he, in every whit, 
Was equal to the task imposed? 
Or, taking all our ills in view, 
Together with this fiendish war, 
Of all our noble heroes, who 
Would we exchange our Lincoln for? 
There’s valiant Sherman, Grant and Sigel, 
Each have bright laurels from the field, 
For which of them could we our legal 
Claim upon our faithful Lincoln yield? 
Believe it, ye who will or may, 
Of all earth's millions there are none 
For whom America today 
Would change her honest woodman's son. 
'1 
He stands preeminently high, 
With her the first of living men, 
And at his will her warriors fly 
To beard Secessia in his den. 
And not until the monster lay 
As docile as a crouching cur, 
Would he command those braves away, 
Urged on by each incentive spur. 
But ere his office shall expire, 
Or he its onerous tasks resign, 
May Slavery die, and War retire, 
And six and thirty States combine, 
And blend in one unbroken Union, 
Based on the equal rights of man, 
Where discontent or vain delusion 
Shall ne’er unsheath their swords again. 
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE CON¬ 
TRABANDS? 
Shall we arm them? Yes, arm them!. Give to 
each man 
A rifle, a musket, a cutlass or sword; 
Then on to the charge! let them war in the van, 
Where each may confront with his merciless 
lord, 
And purge from their race, in the eyes of the 
brave, 
The stigma and scorn now attending the slave. 
I would not have the wrath of the rebels to cease, 
Their hope to grow weak nor their courage to 
wane, 
Till the contrabands join in securing a peace, 
Whose glory shall vanish the last galling chain, 
And win for their race an undying respect 
In the land of their prayers, their tears and 
neglect. 
Is the war one for Freedom? Then why, tell me 
why, 
Should the wronged and oppressed be debarred 
from the fight? 
Does not reason suggest, it were noble to die 
In the act of supplanting a wrong for the 
right? 
Then lead to the charge! for the end is not far, 
When the contraband host are enrolled in the 
war. 
“LIBERTY OR DEATH/' 
Virginius, the Roman Father, 
With beating heart, though brave, 
Beheld his fair Virginia doomed, 
To be a tyrant s slave. 
Despair had gather’d on his brow, 
Commingled with regret; 
A gleam of hope ran through his soul, 
I may redeem her yet. 
Come hither, belov’d Virginia, 
Ere we forever part; 
He clasp’d her to his beating breast, 
Then stab’d her to the heart. 
Thus, did a Roman Father slay, 
The idol of his soul, 
To screen her from a tyrant’s lust, 
A tyrant’s foul control. 
Though this was done in days of yore, 
The act was truly brave; 
What value, pray, is life to man, 
If that man be a slave? 
Go and ask of Margaret Garner, 
Who’s now in prison bound, 
(No braver woman e’er hath trod, 
Columbia’s slave-cursed ground:) 
Why did she with a mother’s hand 
Deprive her child of breath? 
She’ll tell you, with a Roman’s smile. 
That slavery’s worse than death. 
O! that every bondman now, 
Through all that slave-cursed land, 
Had each a heart like Margaret’s, 
Their freedom to demand. 
Then the Jubilee year would come; 
On spire and dome you’d see 
Inscribed in blazing characters, 
That all mankind are free. 
Long live the name of Margaret, 
In every freeman’s breast; 
And when her days are numbered here, 
May she in heaven be blest! 
BELL'S POEMS. 
A HOLY MESSENGER. 
Dedicated to Rev. Thomas M. D. Ward. 
The voice of Macedonia 
From California o’er the seas, 
And yet, to help her, there was none; 
No, none that offered to appease 
Her anguish, and with words of cheer, 
A cordial bring for all her fear. 
At length that voice fell on thy heart, 
And yielding to its plaintive strain, 
I see thee with thy kindred part— 
Resolved to cross the dashing main, 
And plant life’s crimson banner, where 
Sin’s dark pollutions taint the air. 
Then all thy life, or short or long— 
Then all thy powers, small or great, 
To God, to whom they all belong, 
Anew thou didst them dedicate; 
And o’er the broad and trackless deep 
Came hither both to sow and reap. 
Thy coming found us poor indeed, 
Unsheltered from the blasts that blow,— 
No sacred Zion where in need, 
Earth’s sad and sorrowing ones might go; 
And leave this world of care and doubt, 
With all its carking fears without. 
Thou didst not come as many came, 
Alone to fill thy purse with gold, 
Thy mission and thy noble aim, 
God’s glorious Gospel to unfold, 
And through His aid, to seek and save 
The lost and wrecked on ruin’s wave. 
Hence, with thy cross of faith upreared, 
Thy book of promise widely spread; 
While godless thousands scoffed and jeered, 
Thou didst portray the life Christ led, 
And how he bore sin’s chastening rod 
To win the erring back to God. 
Though many scoffed, yet some gave heed; 
Though many scorned, yet some have prayed. 
And found in that dread hour of need 
Thy Christ, their refuge and their aid; 
Their friend, while passing through that vale 
Where all our mortal friendship fail. 
And thus thy labors have been crowned— 
Crowned with many a signal good; 
While error’s hosts have darkly frowned, 
Many have joined the angelhood; 
And in life’s morn, for each of them, 
A star shall deck thy diadem. 
Meanwhile thy toils have reared on high, 
In grand memorial of thy name, 
Our bethel, where, as years sweep by, 
Shall live the record of thy fame— 
The record of thy godly zeal, 
That all may see, and know, and feel. 
And now that duty calls thee hence, 
Once more to cross the briny wave, 
Once more to stand in our defense, 
Amidst the holy, loved and brave; 
Go, and may his presence be thy stay, 
Whom maddening waves and winds obey. 
SONS OF ERIN. 
Ye sons of Erin who have come 
To this fair land to make your home, 
Look back upon your native shore, 
Where lordling rule makes thousands poor, 
And tell me why ye stand arrayed 
With those who would your rights invade? 
With those who would extend a course 
Of human bondage, tenfold worse 
Than England’s Land Monopoly, 
All o’er this land of Liberty. 
Know ye not that with the class 
Known as the Democratic mass 
Stand your uncompromising foes, 
And source of all our country’s woes? 
Tyrants, whose avaricious lust, 
Would fain have ground you to the dust, 
Long ere time’s dial marked this hour, 
Had their best wishes been their power. 
Remember great O’Connell’s name! 
And sully not his world-wide fame 
By any glaring act of shame; 
Remember how he once returned 
To Southern planters moneys earned 
By the bondman ’neath the yoke, 
And all those burning words he spoke; 
And let your great example be 
His life and marked consistency. 
ELIZA HARRIS’ PARENTAL LOVE. 
When February’s chilling winds 
Swept through the forest glen, 
And nothing save the smoking hut 
Marked the abodes of men, 
I through my lattice chanced to peep; 
And far amid the storm 
A slender female shape advanced 
With something in her arms. 
An unexpected sight like this 
Won my attention o’er, 
And wistfully I stood till she 
Rapped lightly at the door. 
She entered bearing in her arms 
A little sportive boy, 
Whose jetty locks, though all disheveled, 
Revealed a face of joy. 
Can I be ferried o’er the stream? 
Sad news I’ve heard of late 
About one of my children/ sir, 
I’m fearful of his fate. 
She spoke this so imploringly 
That loath I felt to say, 
The perils of the ice-gorged stream 
I cannot brave today. 
At length I said, if possible 
Most freely I would go, 
The floating ice is so condensed 
The boat cannot pass through. 
’Twas evening, and the sun sunk fast 
Toward the western mound, 
And e’er an hour could have past 
Night’s gloom would spread around. 
She lay her babe upon the bed 
And threw her bonnet by, 
Then from the center of the soul 
Came one despairing sigh. 
The tramp of horses’ feet was heard 
Upon the frozen ground. 
She stood aghast, then seized her child 
And made a fearful bound. 
Tis he, ’tis he, she wildly cried, 
Oh! save my darling child; 
While towards the water’s edge she ran 
Like one far more than wild. 
She saw the tyrant pressing hard, 
Her Harry was his slave; 
She then resolved to cross the stream 
Or perish ’neath the wave. 
From slab to slab of floating ice 
She leaped amid its roar, 
Till witli her Harry in her arms 
She reached the other shore. 
While he who caused this fearful scene 
Stood speechless as a plank, 
And saw the object of his chase 
Born safely up the bank. 
She's free, and nobly has she won 
The boon by nature given. 
May she be blest while here on earth, 
And doubly blest in heaven. 
THE FIRST OF AUGUST. 
Hail! hail thou glorious first! 
Proud day of Liberty, 
Thy dawning wakes the burst 
Of India’s jubilee; 
And calls to mind that happy morn 
When Freedom’s thousand sons were born. 
That morn when o'er the main 
Bless’d Freedom’s angel flew, 
And rent each galling chain, 
And loud her tocsin blew; 
When hoary age became a boy, 
And every heart leaped up for joy. 
Hail! hail thou glorious day, 
We greet thy blest return, 
With speech and gladsome lay, 
And fervent hearts, that burn 
To join with those amid the sea, 
Whose songs and shouts are Liberty! 
Speed, Lord, the glorious day 
When o’er our native land 
Fond Liberty shall sway 
Her sceptre of command; 
And every yoke and galling chain, 
Shall vanish ’neath her peaceful reign. 
TRIBUTE TO REV. WILLIAM PAUL 
QUINN, 
Late Senior Bishop, African M. E. Church. 
Death is the common lot of all, 
Yet nothing do we so much dread; 
Nothing that doth our frames befall 
From which we shrink as from the dead. 
Though all familiar with the fact 
That death is everywhere unseen, 
Yet from his touch we stagger back 
And strive to thrust long years between. 
But why this weakness on our part? 
And why does nature thus recoil? 
And why are we so loath to part 
From this vain world of pain and toil? 
This always was a house of death, 
And e’er has been a vale of tears; 
Here sorrow mingles with our breath, 
And poisons life in all its years. 
And yet from death frail nature shrinks, 
And still the finite man complains, 
And e’en the spirit man, that thinks, 
Clings to his prison and his chains. 
And why? The vast beyond is dark 
And veiled in deepest mystery, 
And reason's lamp reveals no mark 
Decisive of our destiny. 
There is but one remedial course 
By which we may and can obtain 
From dread of death a full divorce, 
And evermore absolved remain. 
Implicit confidence imposed 
In Jesus, God’s anointed Son, 
Will fill the heart to doubt disposed 
With deathless joys on earth begun, 
For faith in Christ dispels the gloom, 
And hope extends her spotless sails 
And finds with God beyond the doom 
A heaven and life that never fails. 
This mortal shall immortal wear, 
Corruption incorruption take, 
And saints of God with Christ shall share 
The boundlessness of his estate. 
But why is this fair temple clad 
In these habiliments of woe? 
And why are all our faces sad, 
Bereft of their accustomed glow? 
And why those dirge tones from the choir? 
And why are all these people here? 
What strange and burdensome desire 
Has thus induced them to appear 
Where all doth seemingly partake 
Of some unusual widespread gloom, 
That to our awe-struck natures wake 
The sad reflections of the tomb? 
With all the dread solemnities 
Associated with that word, 
The severance of affinities, 
Life-loves and friendships long preferred. 
This spreading pall, these gloomy scenes, 
Those dirge tones falling on the ear, 
Are but the more impressive means 
Of telling us that death is here. 
Although no shrouded corpse is brought 
Within this sacred fane today, 
To demonstrate what death hath wrought 
Upon man’s frail impassioned clay; 
Yet, to our Zion, death has come, 
And ta’en away from our embrace 
One loved abroad and loved at home, 
The Father Bishop of our race. 
And hence, dear friends, we’ve come to pay 
A parting tribute of respect, 
And thus our humble offering lay 
Upon the shrine of God’s elect. 
Fain would we speak in terms of praise 
Of one whose life has been bestowed 
In countless efforts to upraise 
A people writhing ’neath a load. 
As Moses saw, in Egypt’s land, 
The hardships that his people bore, 
And rather chose with them to stand 
Than heir the wealth of Pharaoh’s store. 
So felt the valiant, youthful Quinn 
When he beheld oppression’s horde 
(Steeped to the very lips in sin) 
Defile the altars of the Lord. 
For Slavery’s Pharisaic hand 
Had closed the book of life and light, 
And all the churches of our land 
Had bowed submissive to his might. 
And there was neither court nor fane 
Where God’s lorn sons of ebon hue, 
Though ne’er so humble, could obtain 
A place of worship as their due. 
And Macedonia’s cry was heard 
On every breeze, and everywhere, 
“Oh, come and break to us the word 
Of life, and lead our hearts in prayer.” 
He rose, like the intrepid Paul, 
And in the vigor of his youth, 
Resolved, whatever might befall, 
To bear to these the words of truth. 
Although his purse was ill-supplied 
With means sufficient for the call, 
Yet, he on heavenly grace relied, 
And God, the Lord, arranged it all. 
God was his friend, his guard and guide, 
His refuge and his mighty tower, 
And well he knew He would provide 
For every need and trying hour; 
And hence he left all else behind, 
Save God and His abounding grace. 
And started forth to heal and bind 
The bruises of his injured race. 
Now, from the dread abyss of time, 
Call back the flight of three-score years 
And, lo! all clothed in grace sublime, 
A weird and beardless youth appears. 
He's tall, and for commanding mien, 
A finer mold is seldom seen; 
His brow is high, his locks are jet, 
His eyes are fierce, his lips are met. 
His words are rapid in their flow, 
Confined to neither high nor low, 
But of that modulated form 
Which always tempers to the storm. 
Where’er he moves he rears on high 
The ensign of his ministry, 
And thousands throng to hear his speech, 
And learn whereof he came to teach 
The matchless story of the cross, 
Compared to which all else is dross, 
Comprise the burden and refrain, 
And many hear and hear again. 
And wonder at his matchless zeal, 
His fervent prayer, his strong appeal, 
And as he pictures forth the doom 
Of sin, which kills beyond the tomb- 
Many are pricked e'en to the heart 
And, jailor-like, the cry doth start: 
"Sir, to be saved, what shall I do? 
For all these burning words are true. 
And I am wretched and undone. 
O, whither shall I fly to shun 
The wrath of an avenging God, 
Just retribution's chastening rod?" 
Pie points them to the crimson tide, 
And to a Savior crucified, 
And says to all: "Repent, believe, 
Forsake your sins and you shall live." 
And as he goes forth, here and there, 
New altars rise up unto prayer; 
Though rude and meagre, yet are they 
In all things equal to the day. 
And as the years move on apace 
He stands the center of a race 
Whose faces are upturned to God, 
Praying heaven to break the rod 
And overturn the powers of sin 
And let the jubilant year come in. 
Near three-score years on Zion's walls 
A faithful sentinel he stood, 
And all his sermons, prayers and calls 
Were mingled with atonino- blood. 
He was, in truth, a burning light, 
And sinners trembled in his sight; 
For nothing earthly could deter, 
Nor friends persuade him to defer, 
What duty urged him to perform 
In weal or woe, in calm or storm. 
But oh! how changed; his raven hair 
Is thin and bleached as white as snow, 
His face is furrowed deep with care, 
His frame is weak, his steps are slow. 
Thus bowed beneath the weight of years, 
He brings his cross and lays it down 
At Jesus’ feet ’midst angels’ cheers, 
And on his brow receives a crown— 
A crown of life, bestud with stars, 
The trophies of his conquest here 
Midst earth’s interminable wars, 
Where all the foes to life appear. 
He conquered in the Christian fight, 
He ran the Christian race and won, 
And in the realms of endless light 
Has heard the gladsome sound : “Well done. 
Well done, for faithful hast thou been 
O’er all things given to thy care; 
Heir of my Father’s house, come in, 
And all its blest provisions share.” 
Although our aged bishop’s gone, 
And we on earth shall meet no more, 
Yet heaven hath many a vale and lawn, 
And friendships that have gone before— 
Gone to the realms of holy love, 
Where all are known and all is fair. 
For in our Father’s house above 
There are no spirit strangers there. 
Though gone from earth he is not dead— 
The great and good they never die; 
But when their mortal forms they shed, 
In fadeless youth they bloom on high. 
O, could we pass beyond the doom, 
And range through fields, forever fair, 
Arrayed in heaven’s eternal bloom, 
We’d find our sainted bishop there. 
Then, O, my friends, rejoice to know, 
Where he has gone we all may go, 
And move through heaven as he doth now 
With life’s fair crown upon our brow. 
For heaven’s blest plans are ample quite 
For all whom mercy doth invite; 
And every son of Adam’s race 
The invitation may embrace. 
For in our Father’s house there’s room 
For all his children, all may come. 
And crowns there are for all to wear, 
And palms there are for all to bear, 
And robes there are of radiant hue; 
Go up and claim them as your due. 
Farewell, dear bishop, till the day 
When death shall roll the stone away, 
And this poor soul released shall fly 
To hail thee in the realms on high. 
TEIE UNION AND THE RIGHT. 
(A Campaign Song.) 
We’ve placed upon our banner, 
The banner of the free, 
Harrison and Morton, 
Success and victory. 
And they shall bear our standard 
Throughout the coming fight, 
And this shall be our watchword, 
The Union and the Right, 
The Union and the Right, 
Harrison and Morton, 
The Union and the Right, 
Brave sons of honored sires, 
Well known in days of old, 
And tried as in a furnace, 
And found as pure as gold; 
Tried ’mid the din of battle, 
Or in the halls of state, 
By whatsoever standard, 
The twain were truly great. 
And they shall bear our standard 
Throughout the coming fight, 
The Union, etc. 
Our coats we’ve doffed for battle, 
And don’t propose to yield 
Until the latest foeman 
Is banished from the field. 
With Harrison and Morton 
To lead our countless host, 
To rally is to conquer, 
With each man at his post. 
And they shall bear our standard 
Throughout the coming fight, 
The Union, etc. 
Go, bear the news to Grover, 
And tell him that the boys 
Are shouting loud for Harrison, 
Are making lots of noise; 
And will in next November, 
Unless they’re much deceived, 
Permit his arduous labors 
To be somewhat relieved, 
For Harrison and Morton 
Are leaders in the fight. 
And this shall be our watchword, 
The Union, etc. 
And tell him that his vetoes 
Don’t suit the boys in blue; 
As at the time of voting 
He’ll find it doubly true; 
For he who snubs a soldier 
Shall feel a soldier’s wrath, 
With many thorns and briars 
Strewn thickly in his path; 
For Harrison and Morton, etc. 
Take hence that foul bandanna, 
With all its filth and slime, 
And give us the starry stripes, 
Flag of our olden time; 
Then with our gallant leader, 
The son of Tippecanoe, 
We’ll show you in November 
What patriots can do. 
For Harrison and Morton 
Are leaders in this fight, 
And this shall be our watchword : 
The Union and the Right. 
SONG FOR THE FIRST OF AUGUST. 
With cheerful hearts we’ve come 
From many a happy home, 
Our friends to greet; 
And pass a social hour 
Beneath this leafy bower, 
Where many a shrub and flower 
In fragrance meet. 
We come to joy with those 
Whose gloomy night of woes 
Have past away, 
And render worthy meeds 
To men whose noble deeds 
First cast the genial seeds 
Of Liberty. 
Then let our heart’s best song 
In acclamations strong, 
Reach heaven’s height, 
In honor of that hour 
When Slavery’s massive tower 
Crumble beneath the power 
Of truth and right. 
This is proud Freedom’s day! 
Swell, swell the gladsome day, 
Till earth and sea 
Shall echo with the strain, 
Through Britain’s vast domain; 
No bondman clanks his chain, 
All men are free. 
God hasten on the time 
When Slavery’s blighting crime 
And curse shall end; 
When man may widely roam 
Beneath the arching dome, 
And find with man a home, 
In man a friend. 
DESCRIPTIVE VOYAGE FROM NEW YORK TO ASPINWALL. 
Farewell, for now my gallant bark, 
   Loosed from her mooring, quits the shore 
Amid a fog and mist as dark 
   As that which spread old Egypt o’er. 
On this black and fearful night, 
   She dare not venture out to sea 
Lest on some rock or reef she might, 
   At early dawn, all foundered be. 
Hence till the mist and fog had fled; 
   Until the morning rays had spread 
Pier genial rays o’er land and tide, 
   My anchored bark doth proudly ride. 
’Tis morn and now my goodly ship, 
   With spreading canvas all unfurled, 
Like frighted deer doth bound and skip; 
   Old Neptune’s waves doth proudly hurl, 
While smiles of peace and calm resign 
   Paints every cheek or decks the brow; 
And of the Hundreds none repine, 
   But all seems resignation now. 
A steady, brisk, increasing gale 
   Spreads to the compass all our sail 
And bears us o’er the trackless main 
   From friends we hope to meet again. 
Tis night and now, it forged in wrath 
   And on destruction’s errand sent, 
The mountain waves that sweep our path 
   Could scarcely be more violent; 
But while she reels thus to and fro 
   The sickest of the sick am I 
And from my system would I throw 
   It’s last contents, or even die. 
Oh, of all that’s known or heard 
   Of sickness in its varied form, 
The last of all to be preferred 
   Is sea sick-sickness in a storm. 
Too sick to live, nor can we tell 
   Why in this neither state we dwell. 
For life seems scarcely worth the breath 
   That severs our sad state from death. 
And were it not for superstition, 
   We’d claim some Jonah somewhere stored; 
And yet ’tis true our sad condition 
   Changed not till one leaped over board. 
Yes, on that night of winds and tide, 
   One poor unfortunate and unknown 
Leaped from our vessel’s wave-washed side 
   And found his coral bed alone. 
O! Thou eternal mystery, 
   Thou grand, sublime, though awful sea, 
Alas, how oft thy fury smothers 
   The last fond hope of wives and mothers. 
’Tis morn the fourth and calm’s the sea 
   As though some talesmanic wand 
Had quelled the waves inebriety 
   By virtue of the wielder’s hand; 
For e’er had bloomed the misty morn, 
   Fair Luna sweeping o’er the main 
Had caught the fierce winds in her horn, 
   And bound the mad waves with a chain. 
Then old Atlantic calmed his raid, 
   As though some shrewd Philistine maid 
Had won his heart and ta’en away 
   His bristling waves and angry spray— 
’Tis moonlight on the deep blue sea, 
   And, skimming o’er the curling wave, 
My gallant bark moves blithe and free 
   As mind could wish or heart could crave. 
Nor lays she for the sluggish breeze 
   That fain would seek a night’s repose. 
Impelled by steam she beats the seas, 
   With her huge arm thus on she goes. 
And bears me toward that sunny clime, 
   Where grows the orange and the lime 
And flowers of every varied hue 
   From lily white to violet blue. 
’Tis morn, the seventh and the last, 
   And here my Baltic voyage must end; 
Through calms and storms and death she’s past 
   To reach this hot and sultry clime; 
For Aspinwall is a sultry place, 
   Where noxious vapors taint the air, 
And peopled by a tribal race 
   Most thinly clad with little care; 
And yet the denizens you find 
   Residing here are wondrous kind, 
And versed in many a tender word 
   By which the heart to love is stirred. 
Yet Aspinwall’s a sultry place, 
   For here the sunshine and the rain 
Meet each other and embrace 
   As lovers do,—then part again. 
For, in the space of one brief hour, 
   The sun will shine and then a shower 
Of rain will fall so thick and fast, 
   You’d think the clouds would weep their last. 
But O, if in her gorgeous dress, 
   Nature in all her loveliness 
The world encomium should command, 
   ’Tis on this narrow frith of land; 
For rarer fruits and fairer flowers 
   Scarce ever bloomed in Eden bowers, 
Than bud and bloom and ripen here 
   Through all the seasons of the year. 
For there's no rose without a thorn, 
   Nor much of joy without regret; 
For where our brightest hopes are born, 
   Sad disappointments oft are met. 
Nor have we an exception found 
   In this bright land so seeming fair, 
For here while beauty paints the ground, 
   A foul miasma taints the air; 
And oft so direful in their sway 
   That hundreds perish in a day. 
O, Land of sunshine and of showers, 
   Of rarest fruits and fairest flowers, 
Adieu! Adieu, for at the quay 
A vessel waits to bear away, 
Not only me, but many a score 
That fain would leave thy fevered shore. 
PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE. 
A Red chief dwelling near a lake, 
Beneath a Western sky, 
Felt soon his hold on life must break, 
And he lay down and die— 
He called around his wigwam door 
His warriors brave and true 
And gave to each a tiny oar, 
Saying, “Paddle your own canoe,” 
For I your brave who taught the bow 
And how to poise the dart, 
And how the bearded shaft to throw 
With many a needful art, 
Am full of years and cannot stand 
As I were wont to do; 
I soon must try the spirit land 
So “Paddle your own canoe.” 
Then lowly bowed each warrior’s head, 
And a deep long sigh he drew, 
-And started forth with measured tread 
To paddle their own canoe. 
High rose the waves on either side, 
Loud screamed the wild sea mew; 
But naught could daunt their warrior pride, 
They paddled their own canoe— 
O’er rugged heights they onward sped, 
And mazy forests through, 
And whereso’er their duty led, 
They paddled their own canoe. 
And oft in fancy's bark they’d speed 
Back through the waters blue, 
And once again their chieftain heed 
Saying, “Paddle your own canoe." 
Should friends forsake, should fortune fail 
Or loved one’s prove untrue, 
Then nerve your heart and cburage take, 
And paddle your own canoe. 
For the world with many a snare is set 
For the honest and the true, 
And they alone escape the net 
Who paddle their own canoe. 
VALEDICTORY ON LEAVING SAN 
FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. 
There is no cord, however strong, 
That time will not its fibers rend, 
Nor weary road, however long, 
But constant march will find its end. 
As with the cord, and with the road, 
E'en so with all our friendships here; 
Howe’er so worthily bestowed. 
Our loves may be as fond and dear, 
We deem the object of our trust; 
There is a time, and come it must, 
An hour of parting on the wing, 
And friendship’s heart must feel the sting. 
For life is one continuous change; 
There’s nothing stable, nothing sure, 
Nothing in all our mortal range 
That we can grasp and feel secure. 
The rose will wither in its prime, 
The violet droop its head and die; 
The century oak, at touch of time 
Will prostrate fall and mouldering lie. 
And e’en the granite by the shore, 
Lashed by the mad waves evermore, 
Will waste away, grain after grain, 
Till nothing of the rock remain. 
And yet, with all these facts at hand, 
How friends, solicitous are we, 
Weaving with care the silken band 
As though ’twas for eternity. 
What pains we take to mold a friend, 
.To stamp our image on the heart; 
And e’er the anxious task we end, 
Stern fate, or duty, bids us part. 
Alas! how weather-like is life; 
Eternal sunshine is unknown. 
Our joys and sorrows room with strife, 
And we alternate, laugh and mourn. 
Alas! alas! how much we owe 
To that of which we little know. 
The circumstances of an hour! 
These, these are far beyond our power. 
And yet in these we widely roam, 
Or owe to them our lengthened stay; 
And few within this sacred dome, 
Who have not yielded to their sway. 
E’en ’gainst the teachings of their youth; 
Against the pledges of the soul; 
Against the urgencies of truth, 
How oft we’ve bowed to their control. 
Nor will time affect their claim, 
But all through life will wield the same 
Matchless power and mystic spell, 
Producing many a sad farewell. 
Farewell, oh land of my sojourn! 
And you, the many friends I’ve met; 
My wandering footsteps homeward turn, 
With joys commingled with regret. 
I joy in sweet, prospective bliss, 
Of meeting soon the loved and true, 
And sigh for friendships I shall miss 
In bidding this fair land adieu. 
But ocean waves, nor time nor place, 
Can e’er from memory’s page erase 
The kindly acts and friendly care 
Bestowed since first I landed here. 
I came a stranger to your land, 
A wanderer from a foreign shore, 
With neither card nor scrip in hand 
Your recognition to secure; 
But he who cares for finite dust, 
The wise, the infinite, the just, 
Has willed each humble heart a friend 
Where’er his wandering footsteps tend. 
And I have met upon your shore 
The willing hand and open door, 
And many a word of kindly cheer 
Has greeted my arrival here. 
Farewell! farewell! the hour has come! 
The ship that waits to bear me home 
Lies anchored in her berth at bay; 
And soon, as dashing through the foam, 
And peradventure through the storm, 
She’ll bear me on my homebound way. 
Yet, on and on till the land shall die, 
And nothing save the sea and sky 
Shall come within my vision's range; 
Not e'en a bird to rise or change 
E’en for a moment's space of time 
The all monotonous, sublime! 
Yet on, and on, with my trust in Him 
Who laid his hand on the ocean’s brim 
And said to the rolling waves, “Be still!” 
And the wind and waves obeyed His will; 
Then trustingly on o'er the restless tide, 
On to the land of my youthful pride! 
Then joyously on o'er the glorious earth, 
Till my feet shall stand on my homestead 
hearth. 
But should occasion e’er recall 
The memory of my presence here; 
If from your annual festive hall 
Is missed the shattered voice you hear; 
Know that that voice, if vocal, still 
Its humble mission to fulfil, 
Somewhere, in God’s great providence. 
Is trilling in the poor's defense. 
Farewell, farewell! my task is o'er; 
And if on earth I meet you never, 
Then, them upon that pearly shore, 
Where time cannot our friendships sever, 
Where fadeless blooms the tree of life, 
Where enters never care nor strife, 
There may I meet you, every one, 
Father, mother, daughter, son, 
Where never shall rise from the notes that swell 
The heartrending sighs of a sad farewell.

 The Southland's Charms 
 AND 
 Freedom's Magnitude. 
PREFACE. 
 In "An Idyl of the South" I have aimed to tell the 
 story of an Octoroon. 
 Her life discloses a type. 
 My readers will form their own conclusions of the 
 sociological conditions suggested by the narrative. It were 
 better to think over some things in silence than to discuss 
 them openly. 
 The story is true to the life. It strikes at the root of 
 certain conditions which have been thrust upon us by the 
 humiliating consequences of Slavery. 
 Some complications in the social order, obtaining in the 
 development of the South before the War, are exceed- 
 ingly interesting from our present viewpoint, instructed as 
 we are by the larger observations and experiences of a more 
 enlightened civilization. 
 I hope to deal with certain new phases of the subject in 
 a work which is to follow this volume. 
 The eventualities of Emancipation and Reconstruction 
 are upon us for consideration, and some deep and grave 
 matters cannot be thrust aside as trivial things. 
 The reckoninor must come. 
No nation can ever rise above the level of its virtues. 
 Love is always an interesting subject. Love is the 
 only Redeemer of intelligent being. Love, not Law, must 
 regulate the movements of all bodies in the moral universe. 
 The story of the Octoroon will have much to do with 
 this sweet and potential influence. 
 We shall find that love does not always exist between 
 equals only, but from the very beginning this chubby 
 autocrat of the affections has audaciously presented the 
 ''Sons of God" to the ''daughters of men." And history 
 is radiant with the fact that absolute Power has often shared 
 the throne with the helpless divinity which we call woman. 
 The story of the Octoroon will also show that true love 
 is ever exalted by the very helplessness of the object of its 
 regard ; yet it will not act under a base license, lest it be 
 consumed. 
 Under the established orders and customs of society. 
 marriage is not always possible, not always proper or per- 
 missible. What is even more, society may contemn, and 
 the law may positively prohibit marriage between different 
 peoples, but, wherever wedlock is not possible, true love is 
 an absolute barrier to any degradation of the sexes. 
 This is the strong point brought out in the story of the 
 Octoroon. 
 Divine Love Himself stooped to the sweet helplessness 
 that washed His feet with her tears and wiped them with 
 the locks which adorned her shoulders. 
 If woman would learn a secret greatly to her advantage, 
 let her study this lesson ; and if man would redeem the 
 world and conquor it unto himself, let him convince woman 
 that her very dependence upon him makes her to need no other protection than his love for her and his faith in her, 
 which render it impossible to doubt her purity. 
 The story of the Octoroon will show these things. 
 The story is written in verse because verse seems 
 better suited to the subject, and it is easier for me to 
 express my fancies in *'regular numbers." 
 To me the South is all a great poem. What bard of 
 hers will ever write for us a pastoral of ante-bellum days; 
 or the tragedy of the Civil War, with its climax of the 
 dying Confederacy; and Grant and Lee at Appomatox, 
 with the crowning sorrow of Lincoln's assassination? Who 
 will give us the epic of Emancipation, the farce-comedy of 
 Reconstruction, the romance of Agriculture, or the hymn of 
 her prosperity? 
 Who will sing the ''New Song" of the South? 
 With all her antecedents of slavery and all the darker 
 shadings of the ''Race Problem," I love the South. My 
 people should not speak ill of our home-land, because we 
 have had to suffer wrongs and hardships here. Would we 
 not have had such sufferings elsewhere? May we not look 
 for triumphs here? May we not be nearing the borders of 
 our desert-journey? 
 A race which has given the world so much of its cheer- 
 fulness, and made it so much better by its songs and its 
 prayers, should not despair in a land where the magnolia 
 and the cape jassemine reach the perfection of flower and 
 perfume, and the mocking-bird, wild and free, sings through 
 all the year.

AN IDYL OF THE SOUTH 
 PART I. 
 THE OCTOROON. 
 STANZA I 
 Hail ! land of the palmetto and the pine, 
 From Blue Ridge Mountain down to Mexic's sea : 
 Sweet with magnolia and cape jessamine, 
 And thrilled with song, — thou art the land for me ! 
 I envy not the proud old Florentine 
 The classic beauties of his Italy ; 
 Give me but here to have my glory dream, 
 'Mid fragrant woods and fields — by lake and stream. 
AN IDYL OF THE SOUTH. 
 Come with me then,— who have your leisure hours- 
 Where memory's path divides a fragrant shade ; 
 Here on the lap of old Acadian bowers, 
 Come, rest you where no vulgar sounds invade. 
 Come, for the air is fresh with sparkling showers, 
 And dark with curtains, of magnolia made ; 
 So from life's care awhile come sit apart, 
 And listen to a story of the heart. 
 3 
 I shall not sing to you a sounding lay 
 Of gods contending till the lurid air 
 Is hoarse with the loud fury of their fray; 
 Shall not recite the lofty deeds and rare,— 
 The glories which attend the heroes' way; 
 But I shall lead you where the walks are fair; 
 Where tufts of shade, and now and then a song. 
 Wait to delight us as we pass along. 
THE OCTOROON. 
 The truthful story which I here relate, 
 Must run on like the prattling of a rill; 
 On heights of pleasure we shall sometimes wait, 
 Through winding vales shall loiter, if we will; 
 And we shall find that not among the great, 
 An Eden may the lover's dream fulfil; 
 But lowly walks the fairest ends may bring, — 
 A lovely slave may even charm a king. 
 'Mong hills of sturdy oak, my native land. 
 Where roll the waters of the Tennessee, 
 And palmy groves on Tampa's sea-washed strand, 
 Are shrines of love forever dear to me. 
 And where the old Acadian mansions stand 
 Mid strange lagoons and by the dark Swanee, 
 I knew a Creole, tall and lustrous-eyed; 
 And in m.y heart I hold her still with pride. 
 There, in the shadow of the cypress wood, 
 Where brooding Silence showed its thankful face; 
 Where moss-draped trees like Druids praying stood; 
 I've seen this idol of a gentle race, 
 When, like a spirit of the Solitude, 
 A paragon of Southern pride and grace, 
 She there inhaled the breath of fragrant bowers — 
 The sweet extravagance of shrubs and flowers. 
 When joyous as a brook that in its flow 
 Descants of promise in a hopeful lay, 
 Which ever leads the hearing soul to know 
 That bliss awaits us in a coming day. 
 I've watched her, where the minstrel warblers go 
 Among dark boughs, all undisturbed and gay, 
 When floods of song their brilliant joys revealed, 
 And felt that beauty to their hearts appealed. 
 And I must tell you of this Octoroon, 
 This blue-eyed slave, what sounds like a romance: 
 Her master was a fair young man, and soon 
 The proudest soul that Love, in seeming chance, 
 Had led beneath the full round Southern moon, 
 To coax sweet eyes to give him glance for glance; 
 And with her happy speech and sparkling wit 
 His fair slave charmed his soul— and captured it 
 9 
 A lithe and shapely beauty; like a deer. 
 She looked in wistfulness, and from you went; 
 With silken shyness shrank as if in fear. 
 And kept the distance of the innocent. 
 But, when alone, she bolder would appear; 
 Then all her being into song was sent. 
 To bound in cascades— ripple, swirl and gleam, 
 A headlong torrent in a crystal stream. 
 10 
 Her name was Lena. She was but a child 
 In all save beauty ; but she was a slave. 
 In far Unyoro's wastes, Obokko's wild, 
 Or by the blue N'yanza's boatless wave. 
 Where hearts by worldly greed were undefiled, 
 'Mid Afric's groves some sweet ancestress gave 
 The strain of life which now still rushed along. 
 To warm her soul and break in tides of song. 
 II 
 White wonder of creation, in our clime, 
 'Mid vistas cool and in the dark recess. 
 She mused where Nature wrought the true sublime, 
 And wove a habit for wild loveliness. 
 There where, like sentinels at the gates of Time, 
 Old live-oaks stood in grim and sober dress; 
 She learned the stately mien and charming speech, 
 Which only our old Southland's scenes could teach. 
 12 
 Where Meditation found a leafy shrine, 
 And Vision wandered in a waste of bloom, 
 She touched her lips to Fancy's ruddy wine. 
 And knew the bliss of Pleasure's rare perfume. 
 Where zephyrs round her like sweet nuns did pine, 
 Who whispered prayers in some old cloister's gloom: 
 Superb in form, divinely sweet in face 
 She grew — the charm of her delightful race. 
 13 
 With her young master she had strolled the green 
 When Heaven was in a shining overflow; 
 Had watched the stars the sleepy boughs between, 
 When winds crept by, almost afraid to blow. 
 But not as wooers had they thus been seen, — 
 Not as mere lovers at the trysting, — no! 
 The gentle slave no friend had ever known 
 But her proud master, and she was all his own. 
 14 
 He was of manly beauty — brave and fair; 
 There was the Norman iron in his blood. 
 There was the Saxon in his sunny hair 
 That waved and tossed in an abandoned flood; 
 But Norman strength rose in his shoulders square; 
 And so, as manfully erect he stood, 
 Norse gods might read the likeness of their race , 
 In his proud bearing and patrician face. 
 15 
 A slave she was, but beatiful and dear! 
 Her ancestors had ridden with Hamilcar, 
 With heads of kings swung to their horses' gear, 
 Upon the one hand; while at Trafalgar, 
 When England's fleets made trembling Europe hear. 
 And flung the borders of her reign afar, 
 They, on the other had with Nelson stood — 
 Who, then, we ask, could boast of prouder blood.? 
 i6 
 No Cleopatra nor Semeramis; 
 No jewelled favorite of a Persian throne, 
 Could ever have the lily soul of this 
 Young slave, who through the old South walked alone, 
 'Mid fields of waving grain, and knew the bliss 
 Of wading where the clover was full blown; 
 And listening to the music of the boughs, 
 While on the meads she heard the lowing cows. 
 17 
 Slaves have been many — Roman, Persian, Greek, 
 And harem beauties — Indian, Hindoo, Turk, 
 With eyes whose luring depths could softly speak. 
 Of souls wherein consuming passions lurk; 
 With shapely forms, on soft divans antique; 
 Where lace clouds hung in dreams of handiwork; 
 Sweet sounds Eolian through soft labyrinths crept; 
 And fragrance breathed where dainty zephyrs slept. 
 These creatures of the languid Orient, — 
 Rare pearls of caste, in their voluptuous swoon 
 And gilded ease, by Eunuchs watched and pent. 
 And doomed to hear the lute's perpetual tune, 
 Were passion's toys — to lust an ornament; 
 But not such was our thrush-voiced Octoroon, - 
 The Southland beauty who was wont to hear 
 Faith's tender secrets whispered in her ear. 
 19 
 ''An honest man's the noblest work of" — No! 
 That threadbare old mistake Fll not repeat. 
 A lovely woman — do you not think so.? — 
 Is God's best work. That she is man's helpmeet, 
 The Bible says, and I will let it go; 
 And yet she crowns and makes his life complete. 
 Who would not shrive himself in her dear face. 
 And fmd his sinless Heaven in her embrace! 
 20 
 Young Maury loved his slave — she was his own; 
 A gift, for all he questioned, from the skies. 
 No other fortune had he ever known. 
 Like that which sparkled in her wild blue eyes. 
 Her seal-brown locks and cheeks like roses blown, 
 Were wealth to him that e'en the gods might prize. 
 And when her slender waist to him he drew, 
 The sum of every earthly bliss he knew. 
 21 
 They had grown up together,— he and she— 
 A world unto themselves. All else was bare, — , 
 A desert to them and an unknown sea. 
 Their lives were like the birds' lives— free and fair, 
 And flowed together like a melody. 
 They could not live apart. Ah! silly pair! 
 But since she was his slave, what need to say, 
 A swarm of troubles soon beset their way.? 
 22 
 Just in the dawn of blushing womanhood; 
 Her swan-neck glimpsed through shocks of wavy hair; 
 A hint of olives in her gentle blood, 
 Suggesting passion in a rosy lair; 
 This shapely Venus of the cabins stood, 
 In all but birth a princess, tall and fair; 
 And is it any wonder that this brave 
 And proud young master came to love his slave? 
 23 
 He was a handsome and a noble fellow, — 
 Her master was, and now the hour was late. 
 The moonlight in the mulberry leaves was mellow, 
 Or rather, silvery soft, and seemed to wait; — 
 The moon had smiled when he began to tell,— oh, 
 Well, I might, perhaps, as well not state 
 What this young Saxon told his Octoroon, 
 When they were looking at the happy moon. 
 24 
 The dark shades round with fire-fly swarms were blinking, 
 And in the stillness of the mulberry tree 
 There was suggestion, — to my way of thinking 
 The trees may listen and the stars can see, — 
 The leaves had breath, the stars were through them winking, 
 And shadows seemed to veiled spectators be; 
 When Lena, looking in her master's face, 
 With sinless trust leant in his strong embrace. 
 25 
 O'er her white brow the wistful moonbeams stole, 
 And, tangled in her tresses, seemed detained; 
 But soon, like fleeting fancies in the soul, 
 Were gone; — ah! could they only have remained. 
 And when night's minstrel bird began to troll. 
 And pour her song in torrents forth untrained, 
 To rill through boughs and float along the skies. 
 The slave girl sighed and raised her wondering eyes. 
 26 
 And Maury clasped her, waving like a spray; 
 He stroked her locks; he tossed them — let them fall; 
 And saw the scattered moonbeams flash away, 
 Like silver arrows from a golden wall. 
 And there were whispers then like elves at play, 
 And through the leaves the winds began to crawl; 
 When Lena listening, heard her heart's quick beat, 
 And startled, thought she heard approaching feet. 
 27 
 And am I doing violence to taste, 
 Or pride, or honor? Call it what ye will. 
 What of it? Why let beauty run to waste. 
 And hateful weeds Love's blissful Eden fill? 
 Or, why should manhood suffer heartless caste, 
 To rob the bosom of its passion-thrill? 
 Young Maury loved his slave, and he was free 
 From meddling tongues beneath the mulberry tree. 
 28 
 If it be shame to love a pretty woman, 
 Then shameful loving is a pretty thing. 
 And of all things the most divinely human 
 Is this: — Love purifies life's Fountain Spring; 
 And he who has not quaffed that fount is no man- 
 Vd rather be a lover than a king. 
 And then, preach as we will or may, we'll fmd 
 That Cupid, dear young god, is sometimes blind. 
 29 
 Fair Dixie Land, thy sons of old were brave. 
 And earth proclaims thy daughters passing fair; 
 Thy blood and ancient prestige I would save. 
 Since time atones, and kindly bids me spare; 
 But why despise a daughter, though a slave, 
 Who was as taintless as the mountain air.? 
 Why shun her, as a Magdalene within 
 Thy gates, when beauty was her only sin.? 
 30 
 As homeward with his maid young Maury went, 
 His father shortly met him in the way, 
 And asked abruptly — what such conduct meant; 
 But would not hear what Sheldon had to say. 
 His heart was fixed and on prompt action bent; 
 He threatened in his ire to bring dismay 
 To son and slave — ''to drive from home the pair' 
 But Sheldon smiled to see him " beat the air." 
 31 
 Love will not work by diagram or chart; 
 Will not be schooled by old Sobriety, — 
 Can not be reckoned as a ''polite art;" 
 Nor as a child of "good society" — 
 Not wholly so, — love rules or wrecks the heart. 
 Now Sheldon's father preached propriety; 
 For he was old enough to do such preaching, 
 But Sheldon was too young to heed the teaching. 
 32 
 Fair Morn's descent upon the ocean shore 
 To sprinkle rock and wave with pulverin 
 Of mystic gold; the sound of breakers o'er 
 The lone beach piling; the adjacent din 
 Of woods; the storm's cry and increasing roar 
 Of distant thunders, move the soul within: 
 But lovely woman beats earth, sky and ocean 
 In stirring manly souls with deep emotion. 
 33 
 And Maury could no more prevent his heart 
 From feeling than he could the tide prevent. 
 When Lena from her soul a song would start; 
 Or round him like an angel, brightly went. 
 The fine suggestions which he saw in art, 
 In her were strong with all that living meant. 
 And so his heart ran wild, and, without thought 
 Of consequences, in him now had wrought. 
 34 
 Infatuation. But it would not do. 
 ''A shame! " his father cried, and then looked grave. 
 '• The girl was good and pretty, that he knew; 
 But Sheldon must remember — was his slave." 
 Into a rage, the young man straightway flew; 
 Against ''Society'' began to rave; 
 Withdrew and walked alone or stood morose, 
 As if the world for him held only foes. 
 35 
 Refusing food, he scarcely spoke a word. 
 But he would talk with Lena when he could; 
 And from his room upstairs, he seldom stirred. 
 ''The truth was clear," his mother understood„ 
 " My boy will lose his mind," she oft was heard 
 To whisper. " Nay, don't cross him in his mood." 
 And then she'd say to Lena: "You may go 
 And tell your dear young master" so and so. 
 30 
 And Lena went, — to his dear arms she flew. 
 A gust of joy, — a thousand nothings said; 
 Heard all he told her, — told him all she knew, 
 And like a burst of sunshine round him played. 
 Ah! she was helpless, but her heart was true; 
 And woman's heart when true, with earth arrayed 
 Against her, conquers all, and ever will. 
 The gods are with a loving woman still. 
 37 
 Thus runs the story of an Indian bride: 
 'Mid virgin woods along the rolling James, 
 A sweet young savage spies a white man tied,— 
 Ah! sneer not now, sophisticated dames! 
 Loves him at sight and, flying to his side, 
 Her only plea, a woman's love proclaims. 
 And Powhattan, — for what else could he do?^ 
 Accepts her plea, and loves the captive, too. 
 38 
 Joy now finds wings, — the news spreads far and wide, 
 And festal wood-fires stream through spectral boughs: 
 For Pocahontas is a white man's bride, ^ 
 A virgin savage hears the white man's vows. 
 She is to be his wife, his country's pride. 
 Her people's cause his country shall espouse; 
 And while the»winding James shall roll along, 
 The forest glades repeat her bridal song. 
 39 
 How weirdly grand the tale has seemed to me, 
 Of Pocahontas and her lover, who 
 Perhaps sat on the trunk of some ©Id tree 
 And watched the evening star go blazing through 
 Dark tops beyond, and saw, as lovers see, 
 A nascent moon unrobing to the view; 
 While, as they watched, he told her how the night 
 Is earth's great shadow following its flight. 
 40 
 He may have told her how that shining star 
 Goes round and round forever and forever; 
 And that it is so far off^O, so far! 
 A bird could fly and reach it never, never. 
 Or told her what new moons, what full moons are. 
 And found himself repaid for his endeavor 
 When he looked in his dusky pupil's eyes, 
 Aglow with love and sparkling with surprise. 
 41 
 Perhaps he spoke of lands beyond the sea; 
 Of cities and great " wigwams " built of stone; 
 With walls as high as any forest tree; — 
 Said she one day should such a wigwam own. 
 And then, I ween, she nestled lovingly. 
 And felt his arm around her gently thrown; 
 And from that hour, true love has kept her shrines 
 Beneath the old Virginia oaks and pines. 
 42 
 Now Lena was the child of teeming farms; 
 The squaw-girl was a native of the wild. 
 The one was rich with thought's distinctive charms, — 
 The other simply Nature's untaught child. 
 The one held faith clasped in her glowing arms; 
 The other held a stranger's hand and smiled. 
 And Lena's cheeks with health's proud rose were tinted^ 
 While in the squaw-girl's ne'er a rose was hinted. 
 43 
 Great Randolph, genius of the acrid tongue. 
 Eccentric, proud, whose words in high debate, 
 Were wasps of fire that scorched and hit and stung 
 When he that hawk-voice pitched to irritate, 
 And haughty challenges were lightly flung; 
 The hounds and Negroes on his vast estate, 
 Fared better than the noble Senators, 
 Who dared to meet him in polemic wars'. 
 44 
 And Randolph claimed that blue blood — bluest blue — 
 And blood of Pocahontas in his veins 
 Their torrents wildly clashed and mingling threw. 
 And so, he stood aloof in pride's domains, 
 While love of country, — only love he knew, — 
 Was all that gave his life those nobler strains 
 Which charmed his great compeers, — their country's pride- 
 Made them his friends, and drew them to his side. 
 45 
 The *'Sage of Ashland" — earth's unrivalled Clay, 
 Lashed by his wit and withered by his scorn, 
 Sought the ignoble " code " to wipe away 
 The biting "insult, and though mighty-born, — 
 The Cicero of his historic day — 
 His life was thus of highest glory shorn, 
 Till kindlier age to him had reconciled 
 The proud descendant of Powhattan's child. 
 46 
 But to our story let us now return: 
 Young Maury grew more moody every day, 
 And his proud mother thought she could discern 
 His mind ''beginning, plainly, to give way." 
 But "Wait," his father urged; ''I'll have him learn 
 That I can check him in his childish play. 
 I'll sell the girl and straightway let her go; 
 But till she's gone, I will not let him know." 
 47 
 *'My way is clear. The affair I'll thus arrange: 
 I'll carry Lena with me up to town 
 Upon a visit. — This will not seem strange,— 
 And thence I'll hire Hanks to take her down 
 To Major Royall's. Then my son may change 
 His course or stop. And when he has outgrown 
 The whims and foibles of a vapid mind. 
 He'll laugh to think he once was color blind." 
 48 
 The mother shook her head and sadly smiled; 
 And said, *' I have not anything to say." 
 But vowed : "I never will be reconciled, 
 Will not agree to send the girl away. 
 She is my slave and nothing but a child ; 
 And she has done no crime ; say what we may." 
 And as she spoke, the mists came in her eyes 
 Like hints of rain which fill blue summer skies. 
 49 
 ''My boy," said she, '' I know has but one thought; 
 '' And that is to befriend a helpless girl. 
 And did he not do so, he surely ought. 
 She is as brightly pure as any pear! 
 Wave-hued, from deepest caves of ocean brought; 
 And Sheldon Maury is nor knave nor churl !"' 
 And brighter sparks from flint were never dashed,. 
 Than now from this proud lady's blue eyes flashed. 
 50 
 But — love his slave! Could such, a proud man do? 
 Should this with shame not hang a Maury's head? 
 Nay, loving arms which Lena fondly threw 
 Around her master's neck, while her eyes plead 
 With tender flame, moved him, and rightly, too. 
 For, did not Persia's Monarch love a maid 
 Who was a slave in Shushan, — crown her queen, — 
 The meek ancestress of the Nazarene? 
 51 
 And Moses, great law lord of Mount Sinai; 
 Found in a desert path of Midian 
 A dark-eyed Shepherdess, lute-voiced and shy, 
 With Jethro's flocks, her cheeks were olive tan^ 
 Tinged by the glare of an Egyptian sky, — 
 And claimed her for his bride, far worthier than 
 The titled beauties of the Memphian court, 
 Who led imperial rakes in royal sport. 
 52 
 And 'mong the flowers in Bethel's corners hid, 
 A sweet-faced mourner gleaned the scanty grain; 
 When lordly Boaz, noting what she did, 
 Called to the young men in his harvest train. 
 And, pointing, said: "To touch her I forbid." 
 But drop for her some handsful from the wain." 
 "Yea," cried the reapers, and were singing heard; — 
 But Boaz, he hung back to speak a word. 
 53 
 The flower of Moab, blushing at his feet 
 Among the sheaves, was sweet to look upon. 
 She sat and sang, and filled her lap with wheat; 
 She sang of Israel. The harvest sun 
 Was in her face, but once she glanced to meet 
 The eyes of Boaz and the work was done; 
 Her soul was in her lovely eyes disclosed. 
 And Boaz faced his sunrise, — he proposed! 
 54 
 How sweet to think that, if the golden grains 
 Of life's imperial harvests never fall 
 Upon our threshing floors, there still remains 
 A sheaf for gleaners, — that we, after all. 
 May follow, and behind the reapers' wains. 
 Take up love's scattered handfuls, though but small. 
 That Fortunatus, where he passes through, 
 Must still leave work for loving hands to do. 
 55 
 Before the world, I hold that none of these: 
 The Shushan slave, the Oreb shepherdess, 
 Nor Moab's gleaner, ever had the ease 
 Of carriage, grace of speech, the stateliness 
 Of step and pose, nor had the art to please 
 And charm with symphonies of form and dress, 
 Nor had such wond'rous eyes, such lovely mouth, 
 As had this blue-eyed daughter of the South! 
 56 
 Had priest or prophet ever heard her singing, 
 Or seen her, where the clover was in bloom, 
 Wading knee-deep, while larks were upward springing, 
 And winds could scarcely breathe for want of room- 
 Thus seen her from the dappled hillsides bringing 
 The cows home, in the sunset's golden gloom, 
 Our good old Bible would have had much more 
 Of love and romance mixed with sacred lore. 
 57 
 What man is there who would not dare defend 
 A life like this? Is doing so a sin? 
 Or who should blush to be known as her friend? 
 White wonder of creation, fashioned in 
 The moulds of loveliness; kings might contend 
 On martial fields a prize like her to win. 
 And yet, the cabin's hate and mansion's scorn, — 
 She suffered both, betwixt them being born. 
 58 
 The mating bird upon the freest wing 
 That ever cleft the woodland's joy-tuned air, 
 Should not be freer for her mate to sing, 
 Than woman should be, on her bosom fair — 
 Devotion's home, to press love's offering; 
 To pillow manly faith and shrine him there. 
 Thus pure and free, love born of God is real, 
 Is soul companioning its best ideal. 
 59 
 When genial Spring first hears the mating thrush, 
 Where waters gossip and the wild flowers throng. 
 Love rears her altar in the leafy bush. 
 And Nature chants the sweetest bridal-song. 
 When love is free, with madness in its rush. 
 Its very strength defends the heart from wrong. 
 Love, when untutored, walks a harmless way, 
 With feet, though bare, that never go astray. 
 60 
 The hedges may obscure the sweetest bloom, — 
 The orphan of the waste, — the lowly flower; 
 While in the garden, faint for want of room, 
 The splendid failure pines within her bower. 
 There is a wide republic of perfume, 
 In which the nameless waifs of sun and shower, 
 That scatter wildly through the fields and woods, 
 Make the divineness of the solitudes. 
 61 
 But marriage is Love's Heaven, none the less; 
 And ceremony is a happy thing. 
 And beautiful are all the offices 
 Of our religion. When fair virgins sing. 
 The organ peals, and symphonies of dress 
 And flowers before the altar stir, — which Spring 
 Has been despoiled of bloom to decorate, — 
 Then marriage truly 's a divine estate! 
 62 
 That is, if love be in it. If the heart 
 That throbs and trusts beneath its clouds of lace^ 
 Be innocent of the dissembler's art, 
 If there be inwardness in Love's embrace; 
 If on Life's voyage true lovers make the start, 
 And each soul's compass is the other's face; 
 Then there's a Wedding, that sweet union made. 
 Which '' none may sunder," as it hath been said. 
 63 
 But music, lace and flowers, with altar, priest 
 And prayers, have never made a wedding, — nay, 
 Nor ever will! I would not say the least 
 Against religion, — would not break away 
 From her restraints; nor have doubt in my breast 
 That there is good which comes to those who pray; 
 But it hath been since earth first saw the sun, — 
 No power but love can ever make twain one. 
 64 
 O, Earth, Sea, Stars and boundless realms of air! 
 What were ye all had not dear woman come 
 To make man put on clothes and trim his hair. 
 The wide world would have been without a home 
 In all its shades, and thistles of despair 
 Would have sprung up where naked feet must roam! 
 But woman came, thank Heaven! — Earth's noblest creature; 
 And woman's love lights every human feature. 
 65 
 Love! thou sweetest influence of the soul, — 
 First-born of Heaven and earth, — thou all-divine, 
 1 bless, I worship thee! Thou dost control 
 All thrones of Light, — all realms of song and shine; 
 And shouldst thou empty forth and send thy whole 
 Bright colonies from those high worlds of thine, 
 They all could not eclipse one loving woman. 
 In frailty so delightful, since so human. 
 66 
 At early morn the old plantation stirred, 
 And toil went humming in its usual way, 
 While heart-born shouts in all directions heard. 
 Were earnest signals of a busy day. 
 Then Maury's father with a friend conferred; 
 And calling up a house boy, turned to say. 
 With nimble speech and glibbest unconcern: 
 '• Bring out the wagon. Quick! Let's see you turn. 
 67 - 
 The patient blacks, — those children of the sun, 
 Were singing; in the distance you could hear 
 Their song-bursts as if angels had begun 
 To fill the clouds; now sang they loud and clear, 
 And now the low refrain would break and run 
 Beneath the deep'ning shadows far and near. 
 Throughout the cypress groves along the shore. 
 Where aspect weird the Southern landscape bore. 
 68 
 Ribbons of sunshine long and delicate, 
 Were spun out through the mosses on the trees; 
 And in the depths a spirit seemed to wait; 
 A breath of awe hung on the lazy breeze; 
 And as the wagon left the mansion gate 
 At speed, a deep suspense the girl's heart seized; 
 But there was naught explained, though much was said, 
 That round the truth through hidden meanings led. 
 69 
 Oh, Innocence, and must it ever be 
 That violence for thee in wait shall lie? 
 Since beauty is a snare, a net to thee. 
 Spread for thy feet, an exile must she die, 
 Whose crime is love? Oh, hath not Charity 
 A plea for her that will be heard on high? 
 Nay, Lena must depart, and can not know 
 What fate compels, nor why she thus must go. 
 70 
 The wagon reached the town. Hanks was on hand, — 
 He always was on hand when deeds like this 
 Were to be done. He had at his command, 
 The roads that to the mountains led, and his 
 Proud boast was that he ''could at all times land 
 His expeditions, and not go amiss, '^ 
 And, it must be confessed by all, that he 
 Made good his boast, and never lost a fee. 
 71 
 Toward distant hills now Hanks was soon away 
 With Lena; still she knew not where she went. 
 Her surly escort had no word to say; 
 But kept his ugly eyes before him bent, 
 While glances from their depths of cruel gray. 
 Such chills of fear through Lena^s being sent: 
 That she dared not risk one inquiring look; 
 But feigned good heart, though she with terror shook. 
 72 
 She even strove to force a pleasant smiie, 
 When Hanks once turned to touch her bloodless cheeks. 
 As rough as sea foam though his face the while, 
 The poor girl thought that she could see faint streaks 
 Of kindness showing from beneath the pile 
 Of human rubbish which this fact bespeaks; 
 The light of soul in woman's eyes expressed 
 Will conquer man,— will brutal force arrest. 
 73 
 \n striving to be gallant, Hanks was coarse; 
 He moved his hands as ''Bruin " moves his feet. 
 His whispers low but made his words more hoarse. 
 As waves sound harsher that in dark caves beat. 
 So burly an excrescence of uncouth force. 
 He still had heart, and Lena's accents sweet 
 Had touched him. She was gentle, proud, but pretty 
 And admiration stilled the voice of pity. 
 74 
 I've read of Daniel being with lions penned; 
 And I have heard the legend of a cage 
 Of wild beasts that would not a virgin rend, 
 Who was cast in; but, in this prosy age, 
 When wealth replaces angels as man's friend. 
 When gods and miracles have quit the stage, 
 It should be treasured in undying song. 
 That Hanks said: '' Lena, you've been treated wrong.' 
 75 
 And then he heid and stroked her trembling hand. 
 And patted it, upon his rugged knee. 
 The hours went by till Night had waved her wand 
 Of darkness o'er the world, and rock and tree 
 In darker forms, like giants, rose to stand 
 Along their way; but Lena's heart beat free; 
 And nestling near her keeper, kind but coarse. 
 She felt no terrors from whatever source. 
 76 
 But times were stormy on the old plantation. 
 Ill news on eager wings had spread uproar: 
 The Negroes raised a mighty lamentation, 
 And went about the outrage to deplore. 
 '^ Lena was sold! " Ah! now was tribulation, 
 And Grief began a rain of tears to pour. 
 The master watched the storm that he had made; 
 But trusted that it soon would be allayed. 
 77 
 The old men muttered prayers and went about, 
 Or stood dejected, heeding naught, nor speaking. 
 Old women sobbed and moaned and then shrieked out,— 
 Outspoken anguish kept their hearts from breaking. 
 But braver spirits here and there would shout 
 Their imprecations upon "all de sneaking 
 Ole niggah buyers dis side ob de Devil!" 
 But strange to say, poor souls, they spoke no evil 
 7^ 
 Of their *'ole Massa/' who had made the sale. 
 Well, such is life. We oft lose sight of cause, 
 And o'er effect set up a noisy wail; 
 Too oft oppose the gathering stream by laws; 
 When at the source wise actions should prevail. 
 But Lena's master made of proud stuff was; 
 He vowed — the act if wrong, was his own doing, — 
 His way was his, and of his own pursuing. 
 79 
 And night came on. Earth-jarring thunders roared 
 And rolled afar. Behind the inky banks 
 The sun had sunk in terror. Up, up soared 
 The scurrying clouds and spread like serried ranks 
 With murky banners flying, — swirled and poured 
 Through lurid arches, — while demoniac pranks 
 The vivid lightnings cut and onward came. 
 Stabbing the darkness with their spears of flame. 
 80 
 Young Maury's horse was saddled at the gate. 
 In vain the Negro servants with him plead; 
 His father called to him in vain to wait. 
 He waved all back and sternly shook his head. 
 '' This night be the black herald of the fate 
 Which waits him who opposes me," he said; 
 ''And but for age and blood, my sire, I'd wreak 
 Swift vengeance on your head — but vou are weak." 
 With tears, his mother stayed him in the door; 
 He kissed her, passed, and at a single bound, 
 Into his saddle sprang. ''By Heaven," he swore, 
 " I'll bring her back!" and wheeling short around. 
 His roweled heels against his horse he bore, 
 That forward sprang, and, flying, spurned the ground. 
 And through the dark, these words, impassioned, clear, 
 " I'll bring her back," fell on the listener's ear. 
 82 
 And on, right onward toward the hills he shot; 
 On, on, and on; till, miles and miles away. 
 He drew his reins upon an abrupt spot, 
 Where rocks and fallen trees around him lay. 
 And o'er him rose a cliff, — an inky blot 
 On outer darkness; when he heard the play 
 Of angry waters seething far below; 
 And, scorning danger, could no farther go. 
 83 
 He could not see ahead; would not retreat; 
 But gave his horse the reins and gently urged. 
 The horse reached down and smelt about his feet; 
 Snorted and wheeled and like a tempest surged. 
 But Maury grasped the reins and held his seat. 
 Until his curb-defying horse had forged 
 And plunged off in the darkness. Then a crash 
 Of thunder seemed the mountain tops to slash 
 84 
 Away, and pile the tumbling cliffs around. 
 The distant peaks in startled haste replied, 
 And peaks more distant still took up the sound; 
 Till darkness hushed, — in awful stillness sighed. 
 And throbs of terror shook the trembling ground. 
 '' Hold on thar, stranger," now a cotter cried; 
 Who in his doorway heard the horse dash by. 
 And Maury turned to see whence came the cry. 
 85 
 And to his joy he found an open door* 
 For man and beast the cotter soon found rest, — 
 And then he took his baby from the floor. 
 And tossed him high and held him on his breast. 
 And said: '' Now, stranger, we be mighty poor; 
 But you are welcome to our little nest; " 
 And then there was no heed to outside din,— 
 For only peace and sunshine reigned within. • 
 S6 
 The baby pulled his father's beard till drops 
 Stood in his eyes as big as morning dew. 
 The father tossed him almost to the tops 
 Of the low rafters, — still the baby crew. 
 ''Pull, pull," the mother cried, ''till papa stops." 
 And while their guest looked on, they never knew 
 That in his heart a wilder tempest beat 
 Than that which shook the mountain in its seat. 
 87 
 The morning came with not a cloud in view, 
 And Maury was again upon his way. 
 The birds were everywhere in brilliant hue. 
 And thrilled the forests through the livelong day 
 With hours of vain pursuit he weary grew. 
 To chagrin and conflicting fears a prey. 
 But Hanks with Lena, as the sun went down, 
 Had reached the outskirts of a country town. 
 They saw few people on the one quaint street 
 That straggled through the town from side to side; 
 And idlers lounged on here and there a seat, — 
 A bench or box, — and the new-comers eyed. 
 But soon they yawned and struggled to their feet, 
 And round the buggy stretched their necks and pryed. 
 But Lena turned away her modest face, 
 And drooping eyes, — a blushing rose of grace. 
 '' 1 know," one drawled, while all the others gaped; 
 '' ril bet a shuck that she's that feller's bride!" 
 Then he looked wise and all the others aped 
 His stupid looks and fell back satisfied. 
 But Lena through a gateway had escaped. 
 With Hanks in rugged chagrin at her side, — 
 And thence he up the graveled driveway led, 
 Where dark magnolias round their curtains spread. 
 90 
 An old slave in his doorway bowing stood, 
 A statue of the meek in ebony; 
 And at his side, an image of the good. 
 His dark old wife was peering out to see; 
 And when the strangers paused as if they would 
 Her cabin enter, struck with awe was she. 
 While her old partner, raising both hands, cried: 
 *'Good Lawdy Massa! who's dat at yo' side?" 
 91 
 ** Jes' look, ole 'oman, dats er ainjul sho'." 
 " Young Missus, whar'd you come from .? From de skies? 
 Hit pears to me Tze seen dat face befo'. 
 God bress dat lubly mouf and dem sweet eyes! 
 An' would you stop here at de ole man's doah.?" 
 And thus in his delight, mixed with surprise, 
 This sable patriarch of slavery days. 
 Would have expressed his uncouth, heartfelt praise, 
 92 
 Embarrassing with exclamations strange 
 And interjections meek, his gentle guest; 
 But Hanks withdrew his feelings from the range 
 Of these sweet motives in the old man's breast; 
 And spurning e'en a kind word to exchange, 
 The old spouse in the doorway thus addressed: 
 *'This here's your master's niggah house-gal, aunty; 
 She'll stop till after supper in your shanty." 
 93 
 ** 'Er niggah house-gal!' Wuz dat whut he said?" 
 The old man seemed to ask with wondering eyes; 
 And then he paused and slowly shook his head, 
 And muttered: ''You's done took me by surprise, 
 You sho iz, Massa; fur if I didn't dead 
 Sho think she wuz er lady! But I tries" — 
 Hanks kicked a dog that came about his legs; turned 
 And blurted out: ''Why don't you keep these durned/'- 
 94 
 But now the dog's howls drowned the voice of Hanks; 
 And Lena, frightened, sprang in at the door; 
 When swarms of pickaninnies, breaking ranks. 
 Round cabins flew. ''Get supper; say no more," 
 Hanks thundered. ''Thank you, Massa! Thank you! Thanks! 
 Obejunce to you; shorely, to be shore!" 
 The old slave cried: "De supper shall be got; 
 Be soonly, 'Liza, an' put on de pot." 
 95 
 Hanks "knew his route;" he had brought slaves before, 
 To Major Royall; so, to him he went, 
 Delivered him the message which he bore. 
 And got his fee and a fine compliment. 
 For Major Royall was "delighted more 
 Than tongue could tell;" since he had long been bent 
 On "owning that tall girl with big blue eyes. 
 Whom Maury's people seemed so much to prize." 
 96 
 Then Lena threw herself across the bed, 
 And vainly sought to find her needed rest. 
 She heard all that the good old people said, 
 And like a shadow hope went from her breast. 
 She heard, but, sadly moaning, shook her head, 
 And to her throbbing heart her clasped hands pressed. 
 And while the dead walls drank her bitter sighs, 
 The streams of anguish rolled down from her eyes. 
 97 
 But I shall not tell how she wept all night. 
 How grief no respite found in raining tears, 
 How, in the morn, the master passed in sight. 
 With surly looks that filled her soul with fears; 
 How her old friends had prayed in mournful plight, 
 And whispered words of comfort in her ears; 
 Nor how the pickaninnies hung about, 
 Their big white eyes with wonder bulging out. 
 98 
 I shall not say how long and late she heard 
 A fiddle snoring an old cabin tune; 
 A banjo's ''plunk, plunk, plunk," unskilled and weird; 
 And thumping heels that shuffled off ''Zip Coon;" 
 But night crept by and tardy morn appeared, 
 A brilliant dawning in a Southern June. 
 And that were better, for I could not bear 
 To tell of Lena's grief, — nor you to hear. 
 99 
 But day went by and on came sable eve, 
 With hints of slumber in her tranquil eyes. 
 And at her loom the sunset sat to weave 
 Gay edgings for the curtains of the skies. 
 And Lena's heart almost forgot to grieve. 
 As smiling Hesperus was seen to rise 
 Through woody tops — magnolias dark and pines — 
 And lead night's hosts from utmost Heaven's confines. 
 100 
 But in the shadows there was mystery — 
 A breath of mischief, and impending harm; 
 A whisper and an air of secrecy; 
 A sense of fear that hung about the farm; 
 A presence which one felt but could not see, 
 That startled Lena, — filled her with alarm; 
 Adn when she thought of home so far away, 
 Her poor heart sank, — she could not even pray. 
 lOI 
 Word from the ''great house " came — a master's call — 
 He wanted Lena, and she must obey. 
 ''He wanted to talk with her, — that was all," 
 The old slave said, and meekly led the way 
 Through wide grounds, up great steps and through a hall 
 To where the master's wont was most to stay 
 At night; a room with sideboard, cups and — well 
 You know the rest, and so I need not tell. 
 102 
 He filled a glass, held it before his eyes, 
 Then drank, and handed his old slave a drink; 
 Who took the glass and bowed beseechingly. 
 But durst not once of a refusal think. 
 But Lena did refuse, and with a sigh 
 Which showed her near revolt's abruptest brink. 
 And when her dark old friend had turned to go, 
 She, too, rose up. Then cried her master, *'No." 
 103 
 "I have a word with you, and you're to wait; 
 I must acquaint you with your proper station. 
 At Colonel Maury's, I right here may state. 
 You had your own way; but on this plantation 
 I rule, and every nigger must walk straight 
 Or I will bring him to the situation. 
 But, at the same time, you need have no fear, 
 If you will but obey me — do you hear?" 
 104 
 ''I don't indulge my niggers — never do; 
 I tell them what to do, and they must do it. 
 I leed them, clothe them, and I work them, too; 
 And if they disobey me, they must rue it. 
 But I shall have no need to chastise you; 
 Even to scold a pretty girl like you, 
 'Twould be a shame, much more to have to strike you! 
 ril tell you what, e'en now I really like you.'* 
 105 
 *' I did n't buy you for a common field hand; 
 I don't intend that you work out of doors; 
 But you're to keep house for me — understand? 
 Be in my room here, make my bed-^do chores, 
 And just obey me — be at my command. 
 And anything you want, it shall be yours; 
 And if you'll be good tempered you will find. 
 That Chester Royall can be all that's kind=" 
 1 06 
 *' Now, Maury is my friend; and when he praised you, 
 I promised him that I would treat you right — 
 That is, woa^d show the care that's always due 
 A girl who is obedient and polite. 
 He told me that his wife had strictly raised you. 
 And that you always had been very bright; 
 And I am glad that you have had good raising; 
 For that, of all things, most deserves our praising." 
 107 
 *' A man could love a girl like you; in fact, 
 I wouldn't hardly be ashamed to have 
 It said that I like you." And in the act 
 Of patting now the fair cheek of his slave, 
 He moved, but she avoided him with tact 
 As sweetly proper as 'twas truly brave; " 
 And faced him straight, when he, half smiling, said: 
 *'Tut, tut, you silly thing; are you afraid.?" 
 io8 
 She frowned. He was amazed — he could not speak. 
 A storm was brewing in his baffled mind; 
 The blood-like liquid flame rushed to his cheek, 
 And clouds of gath'ring wrath had made him blind. 
 He seized her hand and pressed, but he was weak. 
 And in his desperation would be kind; 
 And so he paused and hesitating stood; 
 But, at the bottom, fury filled his blood. 
 109 
 But words were lost, now aimed at Lena's ear; 
 Her master coaxed — she drew her hand away. 
 She heard him talking, yet she did not hear; 
 Her soul was loathing all he had to say. 
 The object of his craven heart was clear; 
 And, though she was his slave, she spurned him — yea! 
 She turned upon her heel as if to go; 
 But, with a husky growl, he muttered, "No." 
 no 
 Then Lena threw the shutters wide to look; 
 A moon, full-orbed, was rolling in mid-sky. 
 And with its dulcet tones a pebbly brook 
 Said strange, weird things as it meandered by. 
 A dark magnolia, near her leaning, shook 
 Its listening head, and night winds seemed to sigh. 
 As if they knew that someone was distressed. 
 Then Lena felt an arm around her pressed. 
111 
 She wheeled, then sprang, and threw the arm from her; 
 And from her splendid shoulders tossed her hair. 
 She turned upon him, pointing, spoke out: '' Sir, 
 Begone from me." Superb in her despair, 
 She stood so firmly that he feared to stir. 
 But now she reeled — she sank upon a chair — 
 And with her hands upon her downcast eyes. 
 With greatest effort she restrained her cries. 
 112 
 The " Major " moved to lift her from her seat; 
 She felt his touch that half an appeal meant; 
 She threw his hands off, bounded to her feet, 
 And through the doorway like an arrow went. 
 Ah! then her master's wrath was at ^' white heat." 
 To her receding ears this threat he sent: 
 *M'll make you know!" and followed where she flew, 
 Declarincr in his rage what he would do. 
 113 
 But on she went — on to the cabin sped. 
 The aged inmates met her at the door; 
 She brushed them by. ** Good Lawd!" the old man said. 
 And followed her across the creaking floor 
 To where she threw herself upon a bed; 
 When his old spouse began to thus deplore: 
 '* I knowed it, Andy, I'se don' tole you so; 
 Ole Massa's drunk — ef dat aint like him — sho!" 
 114 
 There Lena rested but a breathing spell; 
 Upon her closely came pursuing fate; 
 Her master's footsteps on the threshold fell, 
 And in his speech she heard hoarse anger grate. 
 The beast would seize his prey — she knew it well; 
 The instant was supreme — she must not wait — 
 She rose, she sprang, she faced him as before; 
 Threw him aside and darted from the door. 
 115 
 On, on she ran, — out in the night alone; 
 With broken accents of a hasty prayer; 
 A sob, a sigh, and then a bitter moan. 
 She uttered on the night's lamenting air. 
 But on, still on she went through fields unknown 
 To her, through woods and lanes, not caring where. 
 To flee brought her relief, for as she flew 
 The friendly darkness hid her form from view. 
 ii6 
 In her distress there was a constant flow 
 Of courage to the heart that else would break. 
 The darkling objects round her seemed to know, 
 And whisper something for a poor girl's sake. 
 Beset with dangers, thus compelled to go, 
 She knew not where, she dared all undertake. 
 No forms of ill that she might thenceforth find. 
 Could ever equal those she left behind. 
 117 
 She looked above, and upward soared her thought; 
 Through star-sown fields to myriad gates of light. 
 She looked before, and silent forms were wrought 
 By pine and hemlock on the walls of night. 
 Their very stillness was with meaning fraught,. 
 Mute witnesses they seemed of her sad plight- 
 But on she went, determined as a tide; 
 Nothing could daunt her; naught could turn aside. 
 118 
 ''Here, Missy! dis way, Missy! come along." 
 The speaker was old Andy, Lena's friend. 
 Who, like an apparition, there among 
 The shadows rose. At first fright served to lend 
 Wings to her speed; but, like a thrush's song, 
 The old man's words did with such coaxing blend, 
 That Lena's heart beat free — her fears were gone — 
 She grasped the offered hand and hurried on. 
 119 
 On, under hemlocks and magnolias dark. 
 They turned their flight which way a stream was brawl- 
 Across the fields they heard a watch-dog's bark [ing. 
 Betray their whispers on his quick ears falling. 
 And so, they durst not breathe a least remark 
 Till where the great trees rose, their vision walling, 
 They reached the stream, and, finding a canoe. 
 Were quickly gliding where dark willows grew. 
 120 
 Dark rolled the stream beneath great live-oak boughs, 
 With mosses hung like some old hermit's hair- 
 And here and there the dipping oar would rouse 
 A night bird up, to pierce the startled air 
 With its strange cry. Again the shores would drowse; 
 But coaxing w^ords revealed the old slave's care 
 For Lena, while he bravely pulled the oar, 
 Till he had landed on a chosen shore. 
 121 
 *'Here we must stop." He breathed, and opening wide 
 His patient eyes with satisfaction clear. 
 He stepped ashore with Lena at his side. 
 They paused, — the old man turned a list'ning ear. 
 While his dark features Lena closely eyed. 
 There was no sound of any danger near. 
 "He thinks Tse come to find and bring you back!" 
 Said Lena's guide, '' but he's clean off de track." 
 122 
 " I seed you when you flew on up the lane, 
 Jes' like er sperrit, and I kept in sight, 
 And so I said: ' Ole Massa'll not obtain 
 Ter seein' dat poah gal agin to-night.' " 
 But here the old man turned his face again; 
 And, grasping Lena's hand, pursued his flight; 
 Till in the shadow of a mighty wood. 
 Beneath a monarch tree they listening stood. 
 123 
 But they must part. Beneath the monarch tree, 
 With mosses hanging like a hermit's hair, 
 They listened till the old slave said: '' Now we 
 Must separate. I leave you in God's care." 
 And as the meek-faced dawn one now could see 
 Peep from the curtained east, to full and fair 
 Soon open into day, you might have spied 
 The old slave bowed, and Lena at his side. 
 124 
 And as they parted, in that dark old face, 
 Which had been thus upturned to Heaven in prayer, 
 There shone a light of satisfying grace. 
 That softened every furrow made by care. 
 But, day was breaking, — he must leave the place; 
 And Lena thence alone her way must fare. 
 ''God bress de chile!" — the parting words were said: 
 The one turned back, the other onward sped. 
 125 
 And as old Andy went, could you have seen 
 Him homeward through the woods at sunrise going. 
 You must have felt that angels, — which have been, 
 According to the scriptures, busy doing 
 Errands of mercy, Heav'n and earth between. 
 And schemes of evil-doers overthrowing. 
 Have not all quit, are not all of them white — 
 Triumphant goodness winged the old man's flight. 
 126 
 And looking up devoutly as he went — 
 (So the Apostles gazed from Judah's hill, 
 Whence their Redeemer had made His ascent 
 To Heaven) — he prayed: " De Lawd be with her still!" 
 To him it all divine occurrence meant. 
 And so, with secret joy, he ran on, till 
 He reached his cabin and his master met, 
 Who shouted: ''Andy, have n't you found her yet .?" 
 127 
 The old man grinned and bowed low with a groan, 
 Which told the fruitlessness of his pursuit 
 And his deep chagrin in a single tone — 
 Which meant: ''My greatest efforts bore no fruit!" 
 He said: " I dunno whar she iz. I'se done!" 
 And then he shook his head and stood as mute 
 As death and looked to see his master rave. 
 Ah! Who could read the thoughts of that old slave.? 
 128 
 Much I could here relate of what took place, 
 Of how dark clouds hung o'er the situation; 
 How *' Major " Royall flew into the face 
 Of everybody on his big plantation; 
 Of how he " cursed and swore " that he '* would chase 
 That ' Lady ' to the end of all creation." 
 But we must hasten onward, while we may. 
 And overtake the blue-eyed runaway. 
 129 
 She waited not; her only hope was plain — 
 A speedy flight. So she was quickly gone 
 Through forests dark — left all roads, in the main — 
 O'er shrub-crowned hills, and through the gorges lone. 
 She knew not where, but held her heart of pain. 
 And went, though not a ray of promise shone. 
 But fleeing was relief, and as she went 
 O'er her the roughest trees in mercy bent, 
 130 
 Earth hath one spot on which none may intrude, 
 And not invite the certain frowns of Heaven; 
 There loving hearts with light divine imbued, 
 Clasp erring ones, and there are sins forgiven. 
 That spot is home, however poor and rude— 
 The holiest shrine at which one may be shriven — 
 And Lena came upon this sacred spot. 
 Where Maury erst found shelter in a cot. 
 131 
 She entered, sore and wan — she could not speak. 
 The housewife took her hand and said: '' How do.?" 
 Long hours of ceaseless flight had made her weak; 
 And in her eyes the mists now dimmed the blue. 
 She sadly smiled, she bowed divinely meek; 
 And followed where her hostess tiptoed through 
 An inner doorway till she reached a bed. 
 Where Lena sank to rest her drooping head. 
 132 
 The woman knelt; her features were divine; 
 Clasped Lena's hands, though not a word she spoke. 
 Her kind eyes welcomed every feeble sign 
 Of strength that in the poor girl's cheeks awoke. 
 She looked on Lena with a face benign; 
 Caressed her pale brow with a tender stroke, 
 And softly whispered words of cheer, as she — 
 Lena — sank back and gasped: '' I'll soon be free!" 
 133 
 The cotters of the mountain hurried in — 
 All gazed, but no one knew the stranger's face; 
 Good women whispered how they saw that sin 
 Had in her pretty features made no trace. 
 Her eyes still showed how trustful they had been, 
 And in her cheek still blushed a rose of grace. 
 So words of comfort each one gently gave, 
 While bending kindly o'er the virgin slave. 
 134 
 There at her feet an old man kneeling prayed, 
 Till resignation lit her restful eyes, 
 As sunlight fills a still lake in the shade 
 That on the surface softly trembling lies, 
 Then settles till the depths are peaceful made. 
 Her cheeks were pale, but as when daylight dies 
 Out in the sky, it leaves a lingering glow, 
 So in her cheeks the dying flame was slow. 
 135 
 But now the stillness of this touching scene 
 Was broken by the sounds of flying feet. 
 Young Maury had arrived, who late had been 
 Urging his foam-flecked steed through dust and heat] 
 O'er barren hills and through the valleys green; 
 Till here directed to this wild retreat. 
 Where he at night had once been tempest bound, 
 The tender object of his search he found. 
 136 
 He knew the wife, who quickly did admit: 
 Then Lena's soul, that had already heard 
 The summons that would bid her spirit flit. 
 The moment of departure now deferred; 
 And while a glow of recognition lit 
 Her sad blue eyes, she rose, she gasped a word; 
 And as young Maury hastened to her side. 
 She clasped his hand, then sank back satisfied. 
 137 
 Triumphant Resignation on her brow 
 Still sat enthroned, and made Death's harvest mown 
 A golden joy. To those who watched her now 
 The Reaper's pathway was with flowers strown. 
 The golden grain indeed was lying low. 
 But in the stubble precious blooms had grown; 
 So there we leave young Maury with his dead; 
 Nor ask we further, what was done or said. 
 138 
 Here ends the act. We let the curtain fall; 
 Tread softly now where sleeps the blue-eyed maid. 
 We've seen the play, and running through it afl, 
 The thread of pathos which it must be said 
 Is true to life. This earth was far too small 
 For such a soul. But Maury, having made 
 Arrangements homa her body to convey. 
 With grief too deep for tears bore her away. 
 139 
 The day of reckoning came. With bearing fme 
 O'er Lena's corpse stood Sheldon, now of age. 
 And to his father said: ''Give me what's mine. 
 And I'll get out, and for myself engage 
 In business; but I'll never beg nor whine, 
 If I go empty handed. At no stage 
 In Life's uncertain game will I return; 
 I ask of Fortune naught but what I earn!" 
 140 
 *' To Lena Tve been partial. I have been 
 No master merely, but I've been her friend. 
 God is my judge, Tve known her not in sin. 
 And I'm proud of her; proud that to the end 
 I've dared to stand, with all the power within 
 My heart and arm, her honor to defend. 
 For her, my faithful playmate, pretty slave. 
 My love and friendship shall survive the grave!" 
 141 
 '* In childhood once I saw a mouser spring 
 Upon a poor canary in its cage. 
 I heard its tiny plea, saw desperate wing 
 Resist in vain the monster's cruel rage; 
 And I were guilty of a meaner thing. 
 Had harm befallen Lena's tender age — 
 And she my slave, I should, to say the least, 
 Now own myself a wretch — a human beast!" 
 142 
 His father answered: ** Son, you are a Maury; 
 We've suffered no dishonor at your hands. 
 I have not understood you, and I'm sorry; 
 Hence, I shall not now yield to your demands. 
 You're brave and true, now don't be in a hurry; 
 For there are other days, and he who stands 
 At parting of the ways, should calmly wait 
 Till Wisdom makes the path of duty straight " 
 143 
 " Before his eyes; and then he should proceed 
 With careful steps, reflecting as he goes, 
 Should coolly keep his judgment in the lead; 
 For streams fret most where rocks and shoals oppose, 
 And headstrong currents into danger speed. 
 No man is safe until he fully knows 
 That anger is an outlaw, and must be 
 Held in strong chains and bars perpetually." 
 144 
 '* Fortune, superior talents, circumstance. 
 Are all mere drift, upon a dizzy tide. 
 That whirl and bob in an unmeaning dance, 
 Yea, valor, breeding, and lineal pride, 
 Are all mere puppets, strung by aimless chance, 
 Unless man's sober judgment be his guide. 
 So here upon the strange mysterious brink 
 Which men call Death, my son, let's pause and think." 
 145 
 The mother smiled and gravely shook her head. 
 She knew her splendid boy — she knew his will. 
 And then with woman, love is never dead: 
 Love's treasured flowers survive the frosts which kill, 
 The past, to her, lies like a landscape spread, 
 Whose mellowed light beams but more charming still. 
 And though the years may change the gold to gray, 
 Still woman's heart's as young and warm as May. 
 146 
 And on that day no funeral bell was ringing, 
 But sloping in the sun, you saw the hills. 
 And pansied meadows where the larks were singing 
 Such medleys, heart-bursts, and such glorious trills- 
 It seemed that they from some high clime were bringing 
 New rend'rings of the theme of joy which thrills 
 All Nature, when the cortege slowly wound 
 Across the old farm to the burying ground. 
 147 
 The sinking sun across the western gap. 
 Had tarried to put up his golden bars; 
 And darkness took the valley on her lap. 
 And waited for the coming of the stars. 
 And mountain heights had now begun to wrap 
 Themselves in that repose which nothing mars; 
 That sense of resignation, which implies 
 A faith that fmds foundation in the skies. 
 No useless drapings of a funeral 
 Like shadows hung round Lena's resting place; 
 There was no mourning— no loud grief, nor pall- 
 But tender glories of day's ending race, 
 Did o'er earth like celestial curtains fall; 
 And Heav'n was lovely as a maiden's face; 
 While humble negroes sang a low refrain— 
 A burst of hope, with undertones of pain. 
 149 
 No priest was there to formal prayers recite; 
 To intonate his creeds with measured breath; 
 Nor aim with outreach of an earthly rite, 
 To put ajar the baffling gates of death 
 And grasp the mysteries of the Infinite; 
 But Faith, there whispered the sweet shibboleth 
 ''At Rest," while Love clasped Hope and looked before, 
 To joy-crowned summits of the evermore. 
 150 
 What if there be no dim cathedraPs aisle? 
 What if no deep-toned organ e'er be heard? 
 The soul can see its God in Nature smile, 
 And praise is loudest when we speak no word. 
 What if no sounding dome surmount the pile, 
 Which wealth to mock the humble poor hath reared? 
 Hope still sees temples in the golden mist, 
 With gates of light and spires of amethyst. 
 151 
 Yea, ** nor shall altars reared of wood and stone 
 Appear," said Jesus, ''only on yon height;" 
 *' Nor shall there to Jerusalem alone 
 Go worshipers; but such as in the light 
 Of truth and spirit, seek God, shall he own." 
 God sees man's heart, nor heeds his formal rite. 
 When day upon the flaming hills expires. 
 What need hath earth for man's poor altar fires! 
 152 
 My temple is the sky — my High-Priest God; 
 ''My hope and my salvation the Most High," 
 Whose altar is the sun and whose ephod 
 Is infinite Night's stellar harmony! 
 With Him, mind walks till now, as Enoch trod, 
 And still He talks in smoking Mount Sinai. 
 Yea, in the everlasting rocks we read 
 His law still written — His eternal creed. 
 153 
 Mind knows no death. Life is the ''first and last." 
 The falling leaf leaves its source living still; 
 The flower which withers in the autumn blast 
 Dies not, but thus escapes the winter's chill. 
 And will return, through changes strange and vast, 
 When summoned forth to range o'er vale and hill. 
 Shall mind which thus perceives Life's changes die.? 
 Hath only matter immortality? 
 154 
 Mind knows no death beyond a prolonged sleep, — 
 Suspended action — rest by Heaven designed. 
 The grave, the rest for all who toil and weep. 
 Could ne'er have been intended for the mind. 
 Then who shall dread to cross the rayless deep, 
 And reach the vast unknown, with joy to find 
 Existences here dimly understood — 
 Too fine to be perceived by ''flesh and blood.?" 
 155 
 And 'Mf one sleep, he doeth well," 'twas said; 
 Yea, for unreckoned will the ages be 
 That swing their long flight o'er the sleeper's head; 
 A day — a thousand years — eternity. 
 The same — no thought of time can e'er disturb the dead; 
 And when one shall have waked, new worlds to see, 
 He will have found, with joy and sweet relief. 
 That time unreckoned makes the cycles brief. 
 156 
 But, *Mf a man die, shall he live again?" 
 This baffling question comes from long ago. 
 Shall ashes only of Life's torch remain? 
 The mind cries out, and Nature answers, " No!" 
 Ye who have heard the prophesying rain. 
 And seen the flowery Resurrection glow: 
 Ye know of better things than eye hath seen; 
 Ye know sere Earth is Mother of the green. 
 157 
 The wild moose shivers in the north land's breath. 
 Where Huron's wave upbraids the fretful shore; 
 The marsh fowl far to southward wandereth 
 And calls her tribes to milder climes explore; 
 All Nature seems to sigh: '^ Remember death. 
 For all the living soon shall be no more." " 
 But mark how Faith sweeps on with tireless wing. 
 To find for e'en the fowl an endless spring. 
 158 
 Oh! Now my soul hath found the mystic strand, 
 Where life and death meet like the shore and sea; 
 The ebb and flow — the ever-shifting sand, 
 Are doubts and fears which oft encompass me; 
 But if I pause and let Faith take my hand, 
 Peace fills the darkest waves of mystery; 
 And I can hear it in the fathoms said: 
 *' Lo! I am with thee! Be thou not afraid." 
 159 
 Let scoffers mock, let unbelief deny — 
 Agnosticism stolidly ignore; 
 Let worldly wisdom proudly ask us, ''Why?" 
 And still the soul cries out for something more- 
 For something better than philosophy — 
 Still longs for higher joys and looks before; 
 And cannot rest — will ne'er contented be. 
 Till triumph over matter leaves mind free. 
 1 60 
 Then hail we all the spirits of the just, 
 With Lena we shall join them all. The mind 
 Now risen looks down on Life's unmeaning dust, 
 And soars to higher spheres — all unconfined; 
 To spheres of love and duty, hope and trust; 
 And leaves the sordid and corrupt behind. 
 The Virgin is the sign of vanquished night. 
 Her child is born — born of the soul — the Light. 
 161 
 Farewell! In grandeur sinks the closing day, 
 And on our vision slowly fades the light; 
 And bygone scenes, like shadows fall away. 
 To settle in the blank of coming night. 
 The Octoroon has passed, but not for aye; 
 To those who have the gift of inner sight. 
 The spirit of all nature prophesies 
 A home for love and beauty in the skies. 
Part II. 
 THE SOUTHLAND'S CHARMS 
 AND 
 FREEDOM'S MAGNITUDE 
PART II. 
 THE southland's CHARMS 
 AND FREEDOM'S MAGNITUDE 
 STANZA I 
 Far in a vale among the mountains blue, 
 Close by a stream where roving cattle stray, 
 Where grand old sylvans darkly crowd the view. 
 And towering summits brush the clouds away; 
 Down where the waters, wildly rushing through 
 The rocks, enchant the scene with song and spray, 
 There round my childhood home, a cabin rude. 
 Wild Nature taught me Freedom's magnitude. 
 There I have stood upon the precipice 
 That hovered awful space, and heard the leap 
 Of waters downward with a fearful hiss, 
 To thence rush onward in their angry sweep, 
 Like fiends contending in the fierce abyss; 
 And musing there in meditation deep, 
 I learned to reverence the Almighty Force, 
 Which rends the hills and shapes the water-course. 
 And there I've mused among the wood-haunts deep. 
 >- When Silence told her secrets in my ear; 
 When Echo startled from her midday sleep. 
 Would flee and mock, and flee and— disappear. 
 I've heard the harp-strings of the wild breeze give 
 Such music sweet as only poets hear; 
 While floods of bird-song filled the vibrant boughs 
 With meanings which no vulgar soul allows. 
 Here I have heard the all-consoling speech 
 Of mystery which fills the solitudes, 
 When leaves with velvet pleadings do beseech 
 The pensive winds to linger in the woods; 
 And here I've found the depths beyond my reach — 
 The depths of feeling o'er which Silence broods- 
 And out upon which, as upon a sea, 
 The Soul would venture to meet Deity. 
 5 
 Dear land of many a classic wood and stream, 
 The proud birthright of ancient families, 
 With mountains whose blue robes have been my dream. 
 In glorious compass ranged 'neath charming skies; 
 Thou art a fit retreat, I fondly deem. 
 For those romantic loves which brave men prize, 
 Which clothed a wigwam with historic grace. 
 And charmed the cabins of an injured race. 
 Hail, Native land! first-born of Freedom, hail! 
 Maintain the foremost rank of pow'r and pride! 
 Thy far-ranged mountains rich with wooded vale, 
 And classic waters rolled in crystal tide. 
 Adjure thee loftily now to prevail. 
 Oh! Let thy sons in New World light decide 
 To plant for aye on Freedom's glorious heights 
 The standard of triumphant equal rights. 
 Here Meditation found a leafy shrine. 
 And one could hear the thoughts of Diety 
 Breathed on the winds ; here oracles divine 
 Unrolled the secrets of green mystery. 
 And as the waters of a fair lake shine 
 Beneath the sun, rippling delightfully; 
 So floods of thought here waved before the soul, 
 In visions bright, to ripple, dance, and roll. 
 8 
 Here Beauty spread her rich and varied store 
 Of woods which, blent with strength of hills sublime. 
 Have made the virgin forests to explore. 
 The lasting charm of every age and clime. 
 'Twas no wild scene where aimless chance reigned o'er 
 The dateless lapses of unreckoned Time ; 
 But human skill had lent enough of aid 
 To vie with Nature's crowning art displayed. 
 A road beyond, and modest gateway led 
 Through wildering vistas to a dark recess. 
 Where interlaced with light the boughs o'er head 
 Like curtains hung, in wastes of loveliness. 
 And still beyond the farther landscape spread 
 Its ample fields in rich and varied dress, 
 Golden and green, in waving harmonies; 
 Wooing and wooed by Dixie's charming skies. 
 10 
 Oh, direful day that saw Rebellion's guns 
 On valiant Sumter opening from the land ; 
 That saw white-handed Chivalry's proud sons 
 Their country's standard trail with impious hand 
 Saw erring Carolina's ablest ones 
 Invoke red war on their palmetto strand ; 
 And, in their frenzy, send the challenge forth 
 That roused the legions of the loyal North. 
 II 
 The stars and stripes that in our standard fly, 
 Immortal symbols of the nation's might, 
 The splendor of night's orb-emblazoned sky, 
 The blue of day's eternal depths — the white 
 Of Heaven's peace and spotless purity. 
 And red of morn's defiance-streaming light, 
 Meant nothing which that madcap State would heed, 
 Which vowed to spread vile slavery or secede. 
 12 
 Time shall set right the wrongs which man has done, 
 And Justice in unerring judgment reign; 
 Though world-wrecks pile round an extinguished sun; 
 And star-dust swirl in ruin's lurid train! 
 The sins of man unchastened shall not run, 
 Despite the earth's best valor, wealth, and brain; 
 Behold, God's angel came in war's dread form. 
 With all the fury of a tropic storm! 
 13 
 I stood where the contending armies bled — 
 A hundred thousand men on either side. 
 The past returned. Around me rose the dead. 
 The brazen bugles rang out far and wide ; 
 The clouds of thund'rous battle round me spread 
 O'er lurid fields, where mighty chiefs did ride, 
 And ranks of serried steel swung into sight. 
 Flashing afar — an army in its might. 
 14 
 And there was silence in the pulsing air, 
 While in the noon sun fluttered banners gay — 
 A lull that breathed the courage of despair; 
 A hush which meant a pause in which to pray, 
 There youths whose lives had never known a care 
 Confronted veterans with locks of aged gray; 
 Before the cool glare of the veteran, 
 The blue-eyed youth stood dauntless, man to man. 
 15 
 O'er green fields, each upon his chosen steed. 
 The grouped commanders watched the lines swing by- 
 But those grim heroes had no thought to heed 
 The landscape's beauty waving on the eye. 
 Ah, loveliness availeth naught indeed, 
 When Saxon valor hears the battle-cry! 
 And mountains rising in cerulean skies. 
 Can then no more avert the warrior's eyes. 
 16 
 With sunny spirit and with knightly dash, 
 The brave young legions rode up from the South, 
 And loyal hosts as brave, if not so rash, 
 Stood to receive them at the cannon's mouth. 
 All nerves were steeled to wait the thunder-crash 
 Of opening battle. Sire and beardless youth, 
 Earth's ties forgetting, raised the battle's yell 
 And charged right through the storm of shot and shell. 
 17 
 Wide o'er the field as far as eye could see, 
 The waves of angry steel came surging on. 
 Ten thousand chosen sons of chivalry, 
 Late bivouaced at the tomb of Washington, 
 But now sent forward by the high-souled Lee, 
 And led by Pickett, Valor's proudest son. 
 Came sweeping in a hurricane of flame 
 Death-girdled, up the glorious heights of fame! 
 i8 
 Ah, what a splendid show of valor there! 
 Lee's fearless cordons in the vale of death, 
 With Pickett mute and glorious in despair. 
 Unflinching in the battle's withering breath. 
 All hail to Pickett, gentle, brave and fair; 
 No prouder sword than his e'er leapt from sheath. 
 And who would not uncovered bow the head, 
 Where fell the young and gallant Armistead.? 
 19 
 Oh, when shall History's muse e'er fitly write 
 The charge of Pickett's ragged legions grand. 
 That faced the guns of Cemetery height? 
 What muse shall ever, with inspired hand. 
 Sing how the great North, in her loyal might. 
 Hurled back invading Slavery from her land; 
 And from her freedom-tented summits saw 
 Secession's broken strength reel backward and withdraw.? 
 20 
 'Tis Lee's retreat; all hail his columns brave. 
 With colors full and fair they march abreast; 
 Rolled back like a tremendous ocean wave, 
 Their strength unbroken, though so sore distressed. 
 Oh, are not soldiers who can thus behave. 
 Well worthy of a more sublime behest? 
 Proud in defeat, superb in battle line; 
 Base though their cause their valor is divine! 
 21 
 Hail! Fair-souled Lee, the last and mightiest 
 Of Southland sons to reach Fame's zenith height; 
 He sheds a crowning glory on the rest 
 Who with him faced the great North in her might. 
 The stainless Bayard of the South, the best, 
 The first and brilliantest of all the bright 
 Enduring stars that did the North's hosts meet. 
 He shone with purest lustre in defeat. 
 LolC. 
 22 
 And when he to the man of gentle heart — 
 The one Field Marshal of the Western world, 
 His opposite, and yet his counterpart, 
 Illustrious Grant, whose standard ne'er was furled 
 In known defeat, who '* moved on" from the start 
 And hurled his legions as a C^sar hurled — 
 When Lee surrendered to his Northern peer. 
 War's fortunes rounded a complete career. 
 23 
 One Grant — and there can be no more ; one Lee, 
 And war's exhausted glories have an end ; 
 One people, white and black, thenceforward free ; 
 One glorious flag for heroes to defend ; 
 And one proud task ours thence shall ever be : 
 To trace the path for all lands in the trend 
 Of New World progress, and to thence make way 
 For Freedom throughout all the world for aye! 
 24 
 And hail we all. The men who followed Lee 
 Were brave, but best of all— AMERICAN. 
 So, let them heirs of glory ever be, 
 With those who followed Grant and Sheridan. 
 And that the sable bondman now is free, 
 And battle-tried; hail him, too, fellow man. 
 No gentler nature ever warmed a breast; 
 And he in valor's equal to the best. 
 25 
 Let stars of rank for all our heroes shine; 
 A valiant land should hail them all with pride. 
 Where deeds of valor thrilled the shell-raked line. 
 The Negro stood with Saxon side by side, 
 And face to face, Yea, where it was divine 
 To die for country, there the Negro died. 
 So let there be an end forever hence 
 To that race-hate which sickens common sense. 
 26 
 The war is ended; like receding waves, 
 Its force subsiding leaves a peaceful shore. 
 Hushed is the singing of the mournful slaves; 
 And in our sunny walks we meet no more 
 These patient sufferers— sights which no one craves. 
 And now, hope-beaming Hesperus leads o'er 
 A wide horizon our new world-emprise. 
 With still new regions opening on our eyes. 
 27 
 Roll on! Historic James, thy classic song 
 Shall ever thrill the proud hearts of the free; 
 For, 'mid the virgin woods thy shores along, 
 Our patriot-sires first heard the lullaby 
 Of Freedom, and from Henry's fiery tongue 
 First caught the watch-cry: '' Give me liberty, 
 Or give me death!" — when startled Europe heard 
 That forest Tribune challenge George the Third. 
 28 
 Roll! Shenandoah, thine eternal song 
 Roll onward to the all-forgetting sea, 
 And bear away the Southland's darkest wrong. 
 Oh, storied stream, may it forever be 
 That Plenty's hosts in peace thy shores shall throng, 
 And celebrate the triumphs of the free; 
 While Grant and Lee, illustrious peers, stand forth 
 Exemplar-Saxons of the South and North. 
 29 
 Thy wont is on the foremost front to lead. 
 On the audacious verge thy wont to stay; 
 My native land! — The voice of Progress heed! 
 Arise! and call thy sons to lead the way. 
 Thy sister nations have in might decreed 
 To forge ahead and leave thee if they may; 
 But thy past glories are a heritage. 
 Commanding that thou still must lead thy age. 
 30 
 Oh! how Tve loved our old South solitudes! 
 Where classic waters mused in listless rhyme, 
 And warbling gladness filled the stately woods! 
 But now I long to see this matchless clime 
 Adjust its life to the vicissitudes 
 Of sane endeavor; — long to see the time 
 When we shall learn that toil excels our dreams, 
 That mills make better music than the streams! 
 31 
 Two Saxon worlds clasp hands — the Old and New; 
 And now their coming great alliance throws 
 Its shadow, in which tyrants, quaking, view 
 Their thrones unsafe, and Freedom's combined foes 
 Stand trembling, while world-vast emprises brew, 
 And Saxon unity takes root and grows; 
 This unity, world-power and world-emprise, 
 The eagle and the lion symbolize. 
 32 
 Yea, where the mountains of the future rise 
 And opportunity finds glorious scope, 
 Wealth points the way for lofty enterprise 
 And labor views the beacon-star of Hope! 
 Industry's morn is blazing in the skies, 
 And Freedom calls her sons no more to grope. 
 But in the mastery of Brotherhood, 
 To scale the heights of greatest human good. 
 33 
 From time when Morn to strew Atlantic sands 
 With liquid pearls, trips from her amber gates^ 
 Till Evening holds a rainbow in her hands, 
 And at the doorway of the Rockies waits; 
 From North Lakes far, and from the harvest lands 
 Of the Dakotas to the Sunny States; 
 From woods and fields, from rivers and vast mines, 
 Now Freedom calls us to cast off the lines 
 34 
 And sail forth with the ship and breast the sea. 
 On all our hills with banners of green corn, 
 The bugling air calls out to rouse the free. 
 In all our vales love's busy hands adorn 
 The homes that are the goal of Liberty; 
 And robust plenty winds his jocund horn 
 For pleasure's throngs to meet him in the shade, 
 Where songful boughs have his pavilions made. 
 35 
 Free labor still our country's hope remains, — 
 In this our largest manhood shall be grown; 
 The spirit of vast woods and vaster plains, — 
 Canyons and geysers of the Yellowstone; 
 Alaskan summits, where bald winter reigns, 
 And rests on base of gold his icy throne, — 
 These all are prophecies of what shall be. 
 When Freedom's sons shall leave their brothers free. 
 36 
 Then we shall heed no more the dreamer's lute, 
 But join the thunderous march of industry; 
 The mountain gorge shall be no longer mute, 
 But toil shall start the haunts of Revery; 
 And from vast mines down many a headlong chute, 
 The burdened car in iron harness fly, 
 Filling the ancient seats of Solitude 
 With throb and thrill of Labor's Masterhood. 
 37 
 Our Heav'n-blest land will thenceforth be the great; 
 The Blue Ridge Mountains, those fair infant heights, 
 The charm and glory of a proud old State, 
 Will then have comprehended human rights; 
 And to the past, the obsolete, relate — 
 To moonlight trystings, dreams and starry nights — 
 No longer, but to high imperial dower. 
 Broad civilization: wealth, expansion, power. 
 Here roll our streams with freedom in the wave, 
 And birdsong tunes the freedom of the air; 
 Here manhood fills the goblet of the brave, 
 And Beauty's cheeks with ruddy life are fair. 
 Here larger spheres of life lead one to crave 
 No boon which all his fellows may not share; 
 And one looks forward to a grander day 
 For mankind, opening in true Freedom's sway. 
 39 
 But lingering still, the light of olden days 
 Falls softly on the slopes of mem'ry yet; 
 And I am looking through the gentle haze 
 On scenes gone by, which I can ne'er forget. 
 And though in our New World's imposing phase 
 The great ambitions round me chafe and fret. 
 Still turning to the quiet past I fmd 
 Old scenes surviving which delight the mind. 
 40 
 Oh, happy days when wealth strove to create 
 Those homely joys which man now little knows: 
 When hounds and horns found patrons in the great, 
 And stirred to lofty emulation those 
 Who held the foremost rank in Church and State, 
 Who highest in profound achievements rose; 
 When Beauty even threw her loving heart 
 Into the chase and took a brilliant part. 
 41 
 A slender-waisted Venus of the chase. 
 For whom one's admiration knew no bounds; 
 A tall athletic paragon of grace, 
 She sat her gallant steed and rode to hounds. 
 The blood of heroes glowing in her face, 
 Through clam'rous woods and over open grounds; 
 The horn blast sending thrills through all her veins 
 She swept before and held the fearless reins. 
 42 
 Oh! that the golden light of olden days, 
 In all but slavery, might return once more! 
 Oh! for the fearless manhood which essays 
 To champion all the virtues of the poor, 
 Which scorns to imitate the vulgar ways 
 Of upstart fortune. How one must deplore 
 The painful symptoms of decaying taste, 
 When chivalry is dead or run to waste. 
 43 
 I know familiar faces on the walls 
 Of time may look down from the long ago. 
 On which the light too strong at present falls. 
 Revealing what we should not care to know. 
 But still the lessons which a look recalls. 
 Through golden mists of time will softly glow; 
 And what were painful else, 'tis ever true, 
 Will, down the vistas, form a pleasing view. 
 44 
 Oh, for a harp to wake and fitly sing 
 The homely pleasures which I used to know- 
 That some sweet spirit of the past might bring 
 To me the forms I've loved in years ago; 
 For memory's light doth still around me fling 
 Their images as hearth-fires shadows throw. 
 And thus I linger as we pass along 
 With just a note of sadness in my song. 
 45 
 Thus I can hear the slave-songs homeward turning,— 
 Those Soul-felt lays that left no trace of care, 
 But somehow told us that the heart was yearning 
 For better worlds, where man to man is fair. 
 And candles through the whispering twilight burning. 
 Still shed their gleams of welcome on the air; 
 And I can feel with nameless throb and thrill. 
 The big round world beginning to be still. 
 46 
 Now there's a lull; — earth's great heart resting beats, 
 And in the drowsy leaves just out of reach, 
 A tree-frog prophesying rain, entreats 
 Dull night to hear; while with contentious speech 
 Her old dispute the katydid repeats; 
 A night owl yonder starts her witch-like screech, 
 And in the brindled shadow of the hill. 
 Behind the corn field, hark! — a whippoorwill. 
 47 
 And I can see forms round the Summer fire 
 Content with earth's scant bounties for the poor 
 Can hear gay talk and laughter rising higher; 
 And see my ''old black mammy" in the door. 
 Can hear the tune: ''Virginny nebber tire," 
 See Pickanninies dancing on the floor; 
 Till song breaks out and blossoms on the air, 
 And mirth has put to flight the heels of Care. 
 48 
 There never was a Delphian priestess' song, 
 Nor hymn of gods, nor laureled victor's lay. 
 To move my heart like sounds when } was young — 
 Those sounds of rest which closed the happy day. 
 No oracle could ever have a tongue 
 That in my ears such mystic hints could say, 
 As I have heard by whisp'ring maples said. 
 When in the dusk a slave his banjo played. 
 49 
 Grand though the strides of New World enterprise, 
 Though with success our vast industries hum. 
 The proud old South must still turn her blue eyes 
 On scenes gone by until at times there come 
 The mists of sadness in them. Sunny skies. 
 And landscapes that are the perennial sum 
 Of flow'r and fruit, are not for her complete. 
 While one is absent whom no more she'll meet. 
 50 
 Her proud old Negro of religious mind, 
 The ebon patriarch of sunny eld, 
 The personage most noted of his kind. 
 The one in gentlest memory ever held, 
 In patient servitude no more she'll find. 
 His day is past. His children have rebelled, 
 Alas! repudiated slavery days, 
 And through the schools have learned the new-found ways. 
 51 
 And yet for him the South will ever morn; 
 His virtues and his foibles will enshrine 
 In song and story. Like a lover lorn, 
 In beauty peerless and in faith divine, 
 And by her splendid valor well upborne; 
 In her proud heart, still, still the South will pine 
 For him who once her life such flavor gave — 
 The pompous, kindly, faithful, old-time slave! 
 52 
 He watched the cradle of white innocence, 
 And feeble age's drooping head sustained; 
 Rejoiced when day without a cloud commenced, 
 But, in the storm, unmurmuring still remained. 
 He loved his master; held his confidence. 
 Esteem and love in turn, and honor gained. 
 His taste was e'er consulted and his tact 
 Employed — he was his master's lord, in fact. 
 53 
 But he is gone! His passing brings a sigh. 
 And thou. Old South, superbly fine and fair! 
 Thou, old White Lady, of a reign gone by, 
 With threads of silver in thy sunny hair. 
 And in thy gaze the blue of Summer sky. 
 While breath of roses steals upon the air; 
 Thou, too, dost pass! — thy skirts of silken pride 
 Trail by, alas! through halls of mem'ry wide. 
 54 
 And there are voices in the golden gloom, 
 Where in the shadows forms of loved ones meet. 
 The air is prodigal of rich perfume — 
 The breath of shrubs and honeysuckles sweet, 
 While down the hall that leaves a vacant room, 
 I hear the brisk sounds of departing feet; 
 And I must pause, and say, ere fades the light: 
 Thou old White Lady of the past— good night! 
 55 
 But let them go! '' Old Glory " waves on high. 
 The war is over, and the slaves are free, 
 The Blue Ridge Mountains look into the sky, 
 And peaks of Otter look into the sea. 
 Proud heights, from which, when Randolph rapturously 
 Beheld the Heav'ns with sunrise blushing, he 
 Declared that thence he must in God believe — 
 Th-e Cause which mind must in such works perceive. 
 56 
 Farewell, alas! my native land adored! 
 IVe sung thy praises in a faithful strain; 
 But westward life's imperial tides have poured, 
 Eddying in towns, and sweeping on again, 
 While braver hearts have in their strength ignored 
 The old South limitations which remain. 
 And I must leave the land which gave me birth, 
 Or pine, an alien, on my native hearth. 
 57 
 Hail! Morn upon the mountains! Orient queen! 
 Awakening Earth rejoices in thy reign! 
 A world of fruited hill and meadows green, 
 With waving seas of corn and bearded grain. 
 Far spread, invests with plenty's glorious sheen 
 The path of empire o'er the western plain; 
 And mind, enlarged by areas vast and heights 
 Sublime, perceives the scope of Human Rights. 
 58 
 Hail! Sovran Rockies! Sent'nels of the sun! 
 The course of empire, in the race sublime 
 Of world-endeavor, at the East begun, 
 With thee shall end; and from the gates of Time 
 Earth shall no more behold such races run! 
 Snow-mantled sea-guards! Bulwarks of our clime, 
 The standard of triumphant Equal Rights, 
 Forever fly from thy unconquered heights! 
 59 
 Peaks dipped in Heaven, and far-flung bounds of space; 
 Stupendous canyons, earthquake-riven and wrought. 
 That are the seams of age in Nature's face — 
 The wrinkles in which we may read God's thought; 
 And crags piled high — stairways on which we trace 
 God's footprints — these have all sublimely taught 
 That Freedom in her strongholds is secure; 
 That God shall reign and Human Rights endure. 
 60 
 Hail! Rockies, hail! fit for Jehovah's seat! 
 Mid thy pavilions of the curtained mist. 
 While the Pacific couches at thy feet, 
 Rise thou for aye the tyrant to resist! 
 Rise thou, till Freedom calls her sons to meet, 
 And, crowned with gold and robed in amethyst^ 
 She welcomes all the earth to fill her train. 
 Join her triumphant march and share her reign. 
 61 
 Hail! Rockies, thunder-tongued, hold thou the watch 
 Of Freedom from thy parapets on high! 
 The footsteps of the rosy morning catch, 
 And hold the dying glories of the sky; 
 For in sublimity thou hast no match. 
 Thou threshold watchers of Eternity! 
 Rise in the way of Freedom's every foe — 
 Rise thou for aye, O Sovran of the snow! 
 .62 
 On thy dread summits which to Heav'n doth soar 
 I pause where thunders sleep, and, gazing through 
 The depths that lead beyond and evermore, 
 I rest till heights in grandeur piled imbue 
 The Soul with praises fitly to adore 
 The Awful One whose power alone could do 
 The works, O wondrous Rockies, thou didst see. 
 Ere trembling day came forth or man could be! 
 63 
 Here, crag-watched round, the Soul hath found a shrine^ 
 And, in white robes. Thought walks with Deity! 
 Here lips of awe speak oracles divine 
 'Mid listening heights of immortality; 
 And Heav'ns eternal watch-lights here shall shine 
 High in the temple dome of Liberty, 
 While ages marshal in their silent flight. 
 Earth's millions in defense of Truth and Right. 
 64 
 1 had a dream: Columbia the Great, 
 The Arbitress of Nations had prevailed. 
 From Europe trains crossed bridge-spanned Behrings's Strait 
 And ships through Panama from South Seas sailed. 
 Through atmospheric tubes the mail and freight 
 Skimmed hill and dale and loftiest mountains scaled; 
 Threading the richest cities, on they went, 
 And in a few hours crossed the continent. 
 65 
 I saw our fleets guarding a hundred seas, 
 All with unshotted guns ride proudly home; 
 I saw the hosts that watch our liberties 
 By land afar from bloodless conquest come. 
 And shouts of welcome then rose on the breeze, 
 With bells and whistles in uproarous hum; 
 And Peace's multitudes went singing, streaming 
 Through leagues of bunting, and of standards gleaming 
 66 
 And not a home, a mansion or a hut 
 In all the land, but heard the call that day. 
 From plainsman's ranch and miner's cabin shut 
 In forest depths and mountain far away, 
 The sons of Freedom came, and cities put 
 Their millions forth to swell the concourse gay. 
 It was a jubilee of joy and tears: 
 Columbia had reigned a thousand years! 
 67 
 The Sphinx of Race Hate looked into the past. 
 Unheeded as the cheering throngs went by , 
 In thund'rous unison, a concourse vast, 
 Proclaimed the triumphing of Liberty. 
 The walls of Wrong had gone down at the blast 
 Of Truth's oncoming trumpets; Earth and Sky 
 Attesting the inexorable plan. 
 That all men shall arise in raising man. 
 68 
 And then I saw that Toil need not sweat blood; 
 But be reduced to healthful exercise. 
 Yet mankind had sufficiency of food, 
 That, barring avarice, all had full supplies 
 For mind and body. Then I understood — 
 The State-fixed bounds for corporate Enterprise, 
 Adjusting all disputes 'twixt Capital 
 And Labor fairly — Law deciding all. 
 69 
 I saw the children cared for by the State, 
 As well as by their parents— that, indeed, 
 The nation held first claim in all the great 
 Concerns of health and training — man's first need. 
 I saw that man must rule and regulate 
 His home by love, and never by a creed: 
 That health, intelligence, Morality, 
 Saved in the child, safeguarded Liberty. 
 70 
 And so, no children roamed the streets at will, 
 In hungry shoals to swarm the streams of Time; 
 But wise apprenticeships restrained them till 
 They had escaped the snares of early crime, 
 And reached safe heights of industry and skill; 
 And there was not allowed a wedding chime 
 When there was presence of a known disease. 
 Hence, no divorces, no adulteries. 
 71 
 I saw a city in the setting sun, 
 Superb and vast, that crowned a noble height; 
 It was the city of the Yellowstone. 
 In New World greatness, from its ancient site 
 Removed — the future's Washington. 
 And guarded round, in its unconquered might, 
 By leagues of fortress, was a populace 
 Unnumbered, drawn from ev'ry human race. 
 72 
 And then I stood within a stately hall; 
 Ten thousand brilliant dancers thronged the floor; 
 'Twas at the Nation's great Inaugural, 
 And there were guests from home and foreign shore — 
 Statesmen and epauleted warriors tall, 
 Churchmen of note, and far-famed men of lore, 
 All in the sunny light of woman's love, 
 With airs of valor, like the gods, they move. 
 73 
 On swept the throngs, in eddies whirled and flowed 
 Through flow'ry aisles and flag-hung corridors; 
 On, on, while Fortune's trophies flashed and glowed 
 'Neath lamps that on the tessellated floors 
 Poured floods of light; and strangers proudly strode 
 Among admiring groups — the guests of our fair shores- 
 While hid in labyrinths of shrubs and flowers, 
 Enchanting strains beguiled the fleeting hours. 
 74 
 There from the South I saw the blue-eyed blonde, 
 And from the North the Junoesque brunette; 
 From Hawaii the olive maiden fond, 
 The dainty Cuban with her eyes of jet — 
 And Octoroon whose beauty was beyond 
 Description, in a swirl of glory met. 
 Through mazy depths of flow'rs and lace to stream- 
 A symphony of lovely forms — My Dream.

MOSES:
A STORY OF THE NILE
THE PARTING.—CHAPTER I.
MOSES.
Kind and gracious princess, more than friend,
I've come to thank thee for thy goodness,
And to breathe into thy generous ears
My last and sad farewell. I go to join
The fortunes of my race, and to put aside
All other bright advantages, save
The approval of my conscience and the meed
Of rightly doing.
PRINCESS.
What means, my son, this strange election?
What wild chimera floats across thy mind?
What sudden impulse moves thy soul? Thou who
Hast only trod the court of kings, why seek
Instead the paths of labor? Thou, whose limbs
Have known no other garb than that which well
Befits our kingly state, why rather choose
The badge of servitude and toil?
MOSES.
Let me tell thee, gracious princess; 'tis no
Sudden freak nor impulse wild that moves my mind.
I feel an earnest purpose binding all
My soul unto a strong resolve, which bids
Me put aside all other ends and aims,
Until the hour shall come when God—the God
Our fathers loved and worshipped—shall break our chains,
And lead our willing feet to freedom.
PRINCESS.
Listen to me, Moses: thou art young,
And the warm blood of youth flushes thy veins
Like generous wine; thou wearest thy manhood
Like a crown; but what king e'er cast
His diadem in the dust, to be trampled
Down by every careless foot? Thou hast
Bright dreams and glowing hopes; could’st thou not live
Them out as well beneath the radiance
Of our throne as in the shadow of those
Bondage-darkened huts?
MOSES.
Within those darkened huts my mother plies her tasks,
My father bends to unrequited toil;
And bitter tears moisten the bread my brethren eat.
And when I gaze upon their cruel wrongs
The very purple on my limbs seems drenched
With blood, the warm blood of my own kindred race;
And then thy richest viands pall upon my taste,
And discord jars in every tone of song.
I cannot live in pleasure while they faint
In pain.
PRINCESS.
How like a dream the past floats bạck: it seems
But yesterday when I lay tossing upon
My couch of pain, a torpor creeping through
Each nerve, a fever coursing through my veins.
And there I lay, dreaming of lilies fair,
Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all
The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life
Its glow and flush; and thus day after day
Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn,
The breath of lilies, fainting on the air,
Floated into my room, and then I longed once more
To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face
Of a familiar friend, whose absence long
Had made a mournful void within the heart.
I summoned to my side my maids, and bade
Them place my sandals on my feet, and lead
Me to the Nile, where I might bathe my weary
Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather
Healing from the sacred stream.
I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found
New tides of vigor coursing through my veins.
Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves
And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet
Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw
A little wicker-basket hidden among
The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called
My maidens and said, “Nillias and Osiria
Bring me that little ark which floats beside
The stream.” They ran and brought me a precious burden.
'Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed
With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child;
His little hand amid his clustering curls,
And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek.
He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand
To meet the welcome of the mother's kiss,
When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back
With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment
Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother's
Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept.
Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved
That I would brave my father's wrath and save
The child; but while I stood gazing upon
His wondrous beauty, I saw beside
A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me
With an eager, questioning look, and drawing
Near, she timidly said, “shall I call a nurse?”
I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her 
Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose
Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing
With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe
Within her arms and said, “Nurse this child for me;"
And the babe nestled there like one at home,
While o'er the dimples of his face rippled
The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well
Content to leave him in her care; and well
Did she perform her part. When many days had
Passed she brought the child unto the palace;
And one morning, while I sat toying with
His curls and listening to the prattle of his
Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately,
Saw me bending o’er the child and said,
“Charmain, whose child is this? who of my lords
Calls himself father to this goodly child?
He surely must be a happy man.”
          Then I said, “Father, he is mine. He is a
Hebrew child that I have saved from death." He
Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder
Had stung him, and said, "Charmian, take that
Child hence. How darest thou bring a member
Of that mean and servile race within my doors?
Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose
Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.
Then kneeling at his feet, and catching
Hold of his royal robes, I said, “Not so,
Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched
Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled
The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has
Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy
Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has
A claim upon thy mercy.”
                                                  “Charmian," he said,
“I have decreed that every man child of that
Hated race shall die. The oracles have said
The pyramids shall wane before their shadow,
And from them a star shall rise whose light shall
Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why
I root them from the land; their strength is weakness
To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they
Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian,
Give me up the child, and let him die.”
Then clasping the child closer to my heart,
I said, "the pathway to his life is through my own;
Around that life I throw my heart, a wall
Of living, loving clay.” Dark as the thunder
Clouds of distant lands became my father's brow,
And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings
Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager
Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come
Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted
Tenderness, and he said, “Charmian, arise,
Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother
Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath
Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light
Of my home; the star that faded out too
Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life
To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake,
Not thine, I'll spare the child.” And thus I saved
Thee twice-once from the angry sword and once
From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art
Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such
I claim thee now. I've nursed no other child
Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other
Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now,
With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love.
There was a painful silence, a silence
So hushed and still that you might have almost
Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick.
Throbbing of the other's heart: for Moses,
He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent
With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed
Her full heart into her lips; but there was
Firmness in the young man's choice, and he beat back
The opposition of her lips with the calm
Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak.
MOSES.
Gracious lady, thou remembrest well
The Hebrew nurse to whom thou gavest thy foundling.
That woman was my mother; from her lips I
Learned the grand traditions of our race that float,
With all their weird and solemn beauty, around
Our wrecked and blighted fortunes. How oft!
With kindling eye and glowing cheek, forgetful
Of the present pain, she would lead us through
The distant past: the past, hallowed by deeds
Of holy faith and lofty sacrifice.
How she would tell us of Abraham,
The father of our race, that he dwelt in Ur;
Of the Chaldees, and when the Chaldean king
Had called him to his sacrifice, that he
Had turned from his dumb idols to the living
God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race,
Led by his faith in God alone; and she would
Tell us,—(we were three,) my brother Aaron,
The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse,
And I, her last, her loved and precious child;
She would tell us that one day our father
Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer
Up in sacrifice the only son of his
Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father's
Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith,
But he resolved to give his son to God
As a burnt offering upon Moriah's mount;
That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning
Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand
Harps, he heard a voice bidding him stay his hand,
And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold
Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through
Its fearful test. And then she would tell us
Of a promise, handed down from sire to son,
That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped,
Would break our chains, and bring to us a great
Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace
Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds
Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets;
And then she would lift her eyes unto the far
Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs
Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within
That promised land; and now I feel the hour
Draws near which brings deliverance to our race.
PRINCESS.
These are but the dreams of thy young fancy;
I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard
Of men who have waded through slaughter
To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles
Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men
Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads
That lay between them and a throne; but I
Never heard of men resigning ease for toil,
The splendor of a palace for the squalor
Of a hut, and casting down a diadem
To wear a servile badge.
                                        Sadly she gazed
Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty
Faith and high resolves—the dark prophetic eyes
Which seemed to look beyond the present pain
Unto the future greatness of his race.
As she stood before him in the warm
Loveliness of her ripened womanhood,
Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire,
And the bright tropical blood sent its quick
Flushes o’er the olive of her cheek, on which
Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood.
Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows
O'er her face as she stood slowly crushing
With unconscious hand the golden tassels
Of her crimson robe. She had known life only
By its brightness, and could not comprehend
The grandeur of the young man's choice; but she
Felt her admiration glow before the earnest
Faith that tore their lives apart and led him
To another destiny. She had hoped to see
The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred
Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat
The throne of the proud Pharaoh's; but now her
Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang
Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted,
She to brood in silence o'er her pain, and he
To take his mission from the hands of God
And lead his captive race to freedom.
With silent lips but aching heart she bowed
Her queenly head and let him pass, and he
Went forth to share the fortune of his race,
Esteeming that as better far than pleasures
Bought by sin and gilded o'er with vice.
And he had chosen well, for on his brow
God poured the chrism of a holy work.
And thus anointed he has stood a bright
Ensample through the changing centuries of time.
CHAPTER II.
It was a great change from the splendor, light
And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts
Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage.
                                                     As he passed
Into the outer courts of that proud palace,
He paused a moment just to gaze upon
The scenes 'mid which his early life had passed—
The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,
The fountains tossing on the air their silver spray,—
The statues breathing music soft and low
To greet the first faint flushes of the morn,—
The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur
From their stony beds—the sphynxes gaunt and grim,
With unsolved riddles on their lips—and all
The bright creation's painters art and sculptors
Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth,
And dance, and revelry, and song had chased
With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours.
He was leaving all; but no regrets came
Like a shadow o'er his mind, for he had felt
The quickening of a higher life, as if his
Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth;
And yet there was a tender light in those
Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes
Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous
Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled
On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe,
And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty
Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on
Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes,
And gorgeous temples faded from his sight,
And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view.
There he saw the women of his race kneading
Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham
Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw
The increasing pallor on his sisters cheek,
The deepening shadows on his mother's brow,
The restless light that glowed in Aaron's eye,
As if a hidden fire were smouldering
In his brain; and bending o'er his mother
In a tender, loving way, he said, “Mother,
I've come to share the fortunes of my race,—
To dwell within these lowly huts,—to wear
The badge of servitude and toil, and eat
The bitter bread of penury and pain.”
A sudden light beamed from his mother's eye,
And she said, “How's this, my son? but yesterday
Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen,
Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun
But dared not enter, only they had heard
That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst
Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed
Thy knee to Egypt's vain and heathen worship;
Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst
Be engrafted in Pharaoh's regal line,
And be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
When thy father Amram heard the cruel news
He bowed his head upon his staff and wept.
But I had stronger faith than that. By faith
I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh
Were searching 'mid our quivering heart strings,
Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove
The rushes of thine ark and laid thee 'mid
The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw
The answer to that faith when Pharaoh's daughter
Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child
For her; and by that faith sustained, I heard
As idle words the cruel news that stabbed
Thy father like a sword.”
“The Hebrews did not hear aright; last week
There was a great day in On, from Esoan’s gate
Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords
And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled;
The temple of the sun was opened. Isis
And Osiris were unveiled before the people;
Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers;
Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air;
The sacrifice was smoking on the altar;
The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables
Of the sun: the music rose in lofty swells,
Then sank in cadences so soft and low
Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture.
The priests of On were there, with sacred palms
Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their
Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting
In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear
Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear
Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On
Drew near to lay their hands upon my head
And bid me swear, ‘Now, by Osiris, judge
Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us
All,' that henceforth I'd forswear my kindred,
Tribe and race; would have no other gods
Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted
Into Pharaoh's royal line, and be called
The son of Pharaoh's daughter. Then, mother
Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat
Beside thee, my lips apart with childish
Wonder, my eager eyes uplifted to thy
Glowing face, and my young soul gathering
Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard
Thee tell the grand traditions of our race,
The blessed hopes and glorious promises
That weave their golden threads among the sombre
Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid
The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again
I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant
Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom
The promise came that in his seed should all
The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac,
Blessing with disappointed lips his first born son,
From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob,
With his warm affections and his devious ways,
Flying berore the wrath of Esau; how he
Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams
A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God's
Angels did descend, and waking, with a solemn
Awe o'ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, 'How
Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I
Knew it not.' Of Joseph, once a mighty prince
Within this land, who shrank in holy horror
From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin;
Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride
Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race,
And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord
He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made
His brethren swear that they would make his grave
Among the patriarchs of his line, because
Machpelah's cave, where Abraham bowed before
The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay
His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his
Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid
The princely dead of Egypt.
          Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met
Our father Jacob on his way, thy words
Came back as messengers of light to guide
My steps, and I refused to be called the son
Of Pharaoh's daughter. I saw the priests of On
Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping
O'er the princess' face, while Pharaoh's brow grew
Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I
Endured, as seeing him who hides his face
Behind the brightness of his glory.
And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt
To cast my lot among the people of my race.”
FLIGHT INTO MIDIAN.—CHAPTER III.
The love of Moses for his race soon found
A stern expression. Pharaoh was building
A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud,
He scrupled not at means to gain his ends.
When he feared the growing power of Israel
He stained his hands in children's blood, and held
A carnival of death in Goshen; but now
He wished to hand his name and memory
Down unto the distant ages, and instead
Of lading that memory with the precious
Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he
Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold
Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold
And hard, and heartless as himself.
                                                  And Israel was
The fated race to whom the cruel tasks
Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong
And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime,
Came to the ear of Moses, and he said,
These reports are ever harrowing my soul;
I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh's
Officers exact their labors, and see
If these things be so—if they smite the feeble
At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils
Beyond their strength–if neither age nor sex
Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods."
And Moses went to see his brethren.
                                                  'Twas eventide,
And the laborers were wending their way
Unto their lowly huts. 'Twas a sad sight,—
The young girls walked without the bounding steps
Of youth, with faces prematurely old,
As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises
Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish
Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say,
We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we've bent unto
Our burdens until our shoulders fit them,
And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude
And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast
In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes,
Which seemed to say, to day we bide our time,
And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only
Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press
Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh;
They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride
And insolence, watching the laborers
Sadly wending their way from toil to rest.
And Moses' heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly
Musing, he sought a path that led him
From the busy haunts of men. But even there
The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard
A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words,
And, looking back, he saw an officer
Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand
An aged man. Then Moses' wrath o'erflowed
His lips, and every nerve did tremble
With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he
Cried unto the smiter, “Stay thy hand; seest thou
That aged man? His head is whiter than our
Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy
Bidding because thy cruel tasks have drained
Away their strength.” The Egyptain raised his eyes
With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute
His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His
Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he
Waved a menace with his hand, saying, “back
To thy task base slave, nor dare resist the will
Of Pharaoh.” Then Moses' wrath o'erleaped the bounds
Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled
The smiter to the earth, and Israel had
One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness
Chase the flushes from the Egyptian's face,
The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance,
And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs ;
And when he knew that he was dead, he hid
Him in the sand and left him to his rest.
                                                  Another day Moses walked
Abroad, and saw two brethren striving
For mastery; and then his heart grew full
Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers
Of a common wrong: should not their wrongs more
Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division,
Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, “ye
Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?”
But they threw back his words in angry tones
And asked if he had come to judge them, and would
Mete to them the fate of the Egyptian?
Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep
His secret, that his life no more was safe
In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts
Of Arabia and became a shepherd
For the priest of Midian.
CHAPTER IV.
                    Men grow strong in action, but in solitude
Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away
The bridge on which he has walked in safety
To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat
To Pharaoh's throne, and did choose the calling
Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became
A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid
The solitudes and wilds of Midian, where he
Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith
In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe
And race. Years stole o'er him, but they took
No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight
Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face
Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire
That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened
To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart
Was just as faithful to his race as when he had
Stood in Pharaoh's courts and bade farewell
Unto his daughter.
There was a look of patient waiting on his face,
A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted
Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face,
The wings of some great destiny o'ershadowing
All his life with strange and solemn glory.
But the hour came when he must pass from thought
To action,—when the hope of many years
Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel's
Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus:
One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw
A fertile spot skirted by desert sands,—
A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip
The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks;
And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire
Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame
Sent up its jets and sprays of purest light,
And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled,
Was just as green and fresh as if the breath
Of early spring were kissing every leaf.
Then Moses said I'll turn aside to see
This sight, and as he turned he heard a voice
Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he
Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head
Upon his staff and spread his mantle о'er
His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty
Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot,
By Horeb's mount, his shrinking hands received
The burden of his God, which bade him go
To Egypt's guilty king, and bid him let
The oppressed go free.
                                                  Commissioned thus
He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought
The tents of Jethro, and said "I pray thee
Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;
And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought
To throw himself across the purpose of his soul.
Yet there was a tender parting in that home;
There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips,
And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro
And his daughters stood within the light of that and gave
Clean morn, and gave to Moses and his wife
And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells.
For he had been a son and brother in that home
Since first with manly courtesy he had filled
The empty pails of Reuel's daughters, and found
A shelter 'neath his tent when flying from
The wrath of Pharaoh.
                                                  They journeyed on,
Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back
With tender love upon the home she had left,
With all its precious memories crowding round
Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking
His path across the desert, longing once more
To see the long-lost faces of his distant home,
The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their
Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon
His youthful head their parting blessing. They
Journeyed on till morning's flush and noonday
Splendor glided into the softened, mellowed
Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep’ning
On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual
Crowned, arose before him; and there he met
His brother Aaron, sent by God to be
His spokesman and to bear him company
To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting.
They talked of home and friends until the lighter
Ripple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed:
And then they talked of Israel's bondage,
And the great deliverance about to dawn
Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses
Told him of the burning bush, and how the message
Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus
They talked until the risen moon had veiled
The mount in soft and silvery light; and then
They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed
From sleep, pursued their way until they reached
The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders
Of their race, and told them of the message
Of their Father's God. Then eager lips caught up
The words of hope and passed the joyful “news
Around, and all the people bowed their heads
And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness
To God.”
                                                  That same day
Moses sought an audience with the king. He found
Him on his throne surrounded by the princes
Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage
At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip
And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew's God
Then asked in cold and scornful tones, “Has
Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt
For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt
I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has
Overflowed her banks and filled the land
With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto
Their God, then crept in want and sorrow
To their graves. Surely Mizraim's God is strong
And Israel's is weak; then wherefore should
I heed his voice, or at his bidding break
A single yoke?” Thus reasoned that proud king,
And turned a deafened ear unto the words
Of Moses and bis brother, and yet he felt
Strangely awed before their presence, because
They stood as men who felt the grandeur
Of their mission, and thought not of themselves,
But of their message.
CHAPTER V.
On the next day Pharaoh called a council
Of his mighty men, and before them laid
The message of the brethren: then Amorphel,
Keeper of the palace and nearest lord
Unto the king, arose, and bending low
Before the throne, craved leave to speak a word.
Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man,
With oily lips well versed in flattery
And courtly speech, a supple reed ready
To bend before his royal master's lightest
Breath—Pharaoh's willing tool. He said
“Gracious king, thou has been too lenient
With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they
Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle
And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now
If thou would'st have these people dwell in peace,
Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto
Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added
Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition
And revolt.”
Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh's court,
Arose. He was an aged man, whose white
And heavy beard hung low upon his breast,
Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye,
And on his face a proud and evil look.
He had been a servant to the former king,
And wore his signet ring upon his hand.
He said, “I know this Moses well. Fourscore
Years ago Princess Charmian found him
By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did
Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all
The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood
Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood
Within his veins, would rather be a servant
Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand,
He thrust aside the honors of our dear
Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth,
But for his daughter's sake he let the trespass
Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian
In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life;
But be fled, it is said, unto the deserts
Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest
Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks
And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race
To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition
And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee,
That these men shall gather their own straw
And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.”
And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his
Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh
Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshen—
That the laborers should gather their own straw,
And yet they should not ʼminish of their tale of bricks.
                                     'Twas a sad day in Goshen;
The king's degree hung like a gloomy pall
Around their homes. The people fainted 'neath
Their added tasks, then cried unto the king,
That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed
A taunt into their ears and said, “ye are
Idle, and your minds are filled with vain
And foolish thoughts; get you into your tasks,
And ye shall not ʼminish of your tale of bricks."
                              And then they turned their eyes
Reproachfully on Moses and his brother,
And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders.
'Tis an old story now, but then 'twas new
Unto the brethren,—how God's anointed ones
Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn
To lines of living light; how hands that bring
Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel
Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth
Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows
Now bright beneath the aureola of God,
Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth.
                              There was hope for Israel,
But they did not see the golden fringes
Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold,
Grey sky, and fainted 'neath the cheerless gloom.
Moses sought again the presence of the king:
And Pharaoh's brow grew dark with wrath,
And rising up in angry haste, he said,
Defiantly, "If thy God be great, show
Us some sign or token of his power.”
Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor,
And it trembled with a sign of life;
The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing
Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green,
And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful
Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth
From Moses' side, lay coiled and panting
At the monarch's feet. With wonder open-eyed
The king gazed on the changed rod, then called
For his magicians—wily men, well versed
In sinful lore—and bade them do the same.
And they, leagued with the powers of night, did
Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses'
Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss
and angry gulp, he swallowed the living things
That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses
Show that Israel's God had greater power
Than those dark sons of night.
                                        But not by this alone
Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed
Their waters; every fountain, well and pool
Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst,
Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts.
And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life;
Millions of frogs swarmed from the stream—they clogged
The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred
Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh's bed, and hopped
Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his
Ovens and his pans.
Then came another plague, of loathsome vermin;
They were gray and creeping things, that made
Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre
Spots—things so loathsome in the land they did
Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest
Dared to lift his hand to any god with one
Of these upon him. And then the sky grew
Dark, as if a cloud were passing o'er its
Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o'er
The city, and the land was swarmed with flies.
The murrain laid their cattle low; the hail
Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts,
With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops,
And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire
Had scorched it through,
                                                  Then angry blains
And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man
And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron
Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light
Divided day from morn, nor told the passage
Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat
In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a
burden
On the air,—a darkness one might almost gather
In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came
The last dread plague—the death of the first born.
                                                  'Twas midnight,
And a startling shriek rose from each palace,
Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes
Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense
Of dread, as if the mystic angels wing
Had chilled the very air with horror.
Death! Death! was everywhere—in every home
A corpse–in every heart a bitter woe.
There were anxious fingerings for the pulse
That ne'er would throb again, and eager listenings
For some sound of life—a hurrying to and fro—
Then burning kisses on the cold lips
Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells,
And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks,
And deep and heavy groans throughout the length
And breadth of Egypt. 'Twas the last dread plague,
But it had snapped in twain the chains on which
The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed;
Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste
From out the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed
To see them gather up their flocks and herds,
And household goods, and leave the land; because they felt
That death stood at their doors as long as Israel
Lingered there; and they went forth in haste,
To tread the paths of freedom.
CHAPTER VI.
But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning
From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt's wail
Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had
Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed
Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped
Near Baalzephn.
Then Pharaoh said, “the wilderness will hem them in,
The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front,
And with my chariots and my warlike men
I'll bring them back, or mete them out their graves."
                                    Then Pharaoh's officers arose
And gathered up the armies of the king,
And made his chariots ready for pursuit.
With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun,
In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold,
Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him
Rode his mighty men, their banners floating
On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering
In the morning light; and Israel saw,
With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their
Track: then women wept in hopeless terror;
Children hid their faces in their mothers' robes,
And strong, men bowed 'their 'heads in agony and dread;
And then a bitter, angry murmur rose,—
"Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast
Brought us here to die?”
'Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow
With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts
Be strong and they should his salvation see.
"Stand still," said Moses to the fearful throng
Whose hearts were fainting in the wild,“ Stand still."
Ah, that was Moses' word, but higher and greater
Came God's watchword for the hour, and not for that
Alone, but all the coming hours of time.
"Speak ye unto the people and bid them
Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters
And smite them with thy rod.” And Moses smote
The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps,
Then lay as calm and still as lips that just
Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea
Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted
Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people's
Way was God's own wondrous masonry;
The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild
Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt's
Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light
To Israel's path. Madly rushed the hosts
Of Pharaoh upon the people's track, when
The solemn truth broke on them—that God
For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror
Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, “let
Us flee,” they cried, “from Israel, for their God
Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side."
They had trusted in their chariots, but now
That hope was vain; God had loosened every
Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each
Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still
With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered
And the thunder roared and muttered on the air,
And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered
O'er their heads, for the waves began to tremble
And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose
A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread,
A gurgling sound of horror, as "the waves
Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking
Out their place again,"and the flower and pride
Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea
Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark
Upon the shore, and the song of Israel's
Triumph was the requiem of their foes.
Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs
And down the valleys, o'er the dark and restless
Sea, rose the people's shout of triumph, going
Up in praise to God, and the very air
Seemed joyous, for the choral song of millions
Throbbed upon its viewless wings.
Then another song of triumph rose in accents
Soft and clear; “'twas the voice of Moses' sister
Rising in the tide of song. The warm blood
Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins;
The roses of her girlhood were flushing
On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor
Of long departed days, for time itself seemed
Pausing, and she lived the past again; again
The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream,
A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay;
The tender tide of rapture swept o'er her soul again
She had felt when Pharaoh's daughter had claimed
Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy
Above her rescued son. Then again she saw
Him choosing "’twixt Israel's pain and sorrow
And Egypt's pomp and pride." But now he stood
Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud
She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women
In music, dance and song, as they shouted out
Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains. 
MIRIAM'S SONG
A wail in the palace, a wail in the hut,
          The midnight is shivering with dread,
And Egypt wakes up with a shriek and a sob
          To mourn for her first-born and dead.
In the morning glad voices greeted the light,
          As the Nile with its splendor was flushed;
At midnight silence had melted their tones,
          And their music forever is hushed.
In the morning the princes of palace and court
          To the heir of the kingdom bowed down;
'Tis midnight, pallid and stark in his shroud
          He dreams not of kingdom or crown.
As a monument blasted and blighted by God,
          Through the ages proud Pharaoh shall stand,
All seamed with the vengeance and scarred with the wrath
          That leaped from God's terrible hand.
CHAPTER VII.
They journeyed on from Zuphim's sea until
They reached the sacred mount and heard the solemn
Decalogue. The mount was robed in blackness,—
Heavy and deep the shadows lay; the thunder
Crashed and roared upon the air; the lightning
Leaped from crag to crag; God's fearful splendor
Flowed around, and Sinai quaked and shuddered
To its base, and there did God proclaim
Unto their listening ears, the great, the grand,
The central and the primal truth of all
The universe—the unity of God.
                                         Only one God,—
This truth received into the world's great life,
Not as an idle dream nor speculative thing,
But as a living, vitalizing thought,
Should bind us closer to our God and link us
With our fellow man, the brothers and co-heirs
With Christ, the elder brother of our race.
Before this truth let every blade of war
Grow dull, and slavery, cowering at the light,
Skulk from the homes of men; instead
Of war bring peace and freedom, love and joy,
And light for man, instead of bondage, whips
And chains. Only one God! the strongest hands
Should help the weak who bend before the blasts
Of life, because if God is only one
Then we are the children of his mighty hand,
And when we best serve man, we also serve
Our God. Let haughty rulers learn that men
Of humblest birth and lowliest lot have
Rights as sacred and divine as theirs, and they
Who fence in leagues of earth by bonds and claims
And title deeds, forgetting land and water,
Air and light are God's own gifts and heritage
For man—who throw their selfish lives between
God's sunshine and the shivering poor—
Have never learned the wondrous depth, nor scaled
The glorious height of this great central truth,
Around which clusters all the holiest faiths
Of earth. The thunder died upon the air,
The lightning ceased its livid play, the smoke
And darkness died away in clouds, as soft
And fair as summer wreaths that lie around
The setting sun, and Sinai stood a bare
And rugged thing among the sacred scenes
Of earth.
CHAPTER VIII.
It was a weary thing to bear the burden
Of that restless and rebellious race. With
Sinai's thunders almost crashing in their ears,
They made a golden calf, and in the desert
Spread an idol's feast, and sung the merry songs
They had heard when Mizraim's songs bowed down before
Their vain and heathen gods; and thus for many years
Did Moses bear the evil manners of his race—
Their angry murmurs, fierce regrets and strange
Forgetfulness of God. Born slaves, they did not love
The freedom of the wild more than their pots of flesh.
And pleasant savory things once gathered
From the gardens of the Nile.
If slavery only laid its weight of chains
Upon the weary, aching limbs, e'en then
It were a curse; but when it frets through nerve
And flesh and eats into the weary soul,
Oh then it is a thing for every human
Heart to loathe, and this was Israel's fate,
For when the chains were shaken from their limbs,
They failed to strike the impress from their souls.
While he who'd basked beneath the radiance
Of a throne, ne'er turned regretful eyes upon
The past, nor sighed to grasp again the pleasures
Once resigned; but the saddest trial was
To see the light and joy fade from their faces
When the faithless spies spread through their camp
Their ill report; and when the people wept
In hopeless unbelief and turned their faces
Egyptward, and asked a captain from their bands
To lead them back where they might bind anew
Their broken chains, when God arose and shut
The gates of promise on their lives, and left
Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia's desert sands.
But though they slumbered in the wild, they died
With broader freedom on their lips, and for their
Little ones did God reserve the heritage
So rudely thrust aside.
THE DEATH OF MOSES.—CHAPTER X.
His work was done; his blessing lay
Like precious ointment on his people's head,
And God's great peace was resting on his soul.
His life had been a lengthened sacrifice,
A thing of deep devotion to his race,
Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt's gild
And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand
And held them with a firm and constant grasp.
But now his work was done; his charge was laid
In Joshua's hand, and men of younger blood
Were destined to possess the land and pass
Through Jordan to the other side. He too
Had hoped to enter there—to tread the soil
Made sacred by the memories of his
Kindred dead, and rest till life's calm close beneath
The sheltering vines and stately palms of that
Fair land; that hope had colored all his life's
Young dreams and sent its mellowed flushes o'er
His later years; but God's decree was otherwise.
And so he bowed his meekened soul in calm
Submission to the word, which bade him climb
To Nebo's highest peak, and view the pleasant land
From Jordan's swells unto the calmer ripples
Of the tideless sea, then die with all its
Loveliness in sight.
As he passed from Moab's grassy vale to climb
The rugged mount, the people stood in mournful groups,
Some, with quivering lips and tearful eyes,
Reaching out unconscious hands, as if to stay
His steps and keep him ever at their side, while
Others gazed with reverent awe upon
The calm and solemn beauty on his aged brow,
The look of loving trust and lofty faith
Still beaming from an eye that neither care
Nor time had dimmed. As he passed upward, tender
Blessings, earnest prayers and sad farewells rose
On each wave of air, then died in one sweet
Murmur of regretful love; and Moses stood
Alone on Nebo's mount.
                                                       Alone! not one
Of all that mighty throng who had trod with him
In triumph through the parted food was there.
Aaron had died in Hor, with son and brother
By his side; and Miriam too was gone.
But kindred hands had made her grave, and Kadesh
Held her dust. But he was all alone; nor wife
Nor child was there to clasp in death his hand,
And bind around their bleeding hearts the precious
Parting words. And yet he was not all alone,
For God's great presence flowed around his path
And stayed him in that solemn hour.
          He stood upon the highest peak of Nebo,
And saw the Jordan chafing through its gorges,
Its banks made bright by scarlet blooms
And purple blossoms. The placid lakes
And emerald meadows, the snowy crest
Of distant mountains, the ancient rocks
That dripped with honey, the hills all bathed
In light and beauty; the shady groves
And peaceful vistas, the vines opprest
With purple riches, the fig trees fruit-crowned
Green and golden, the pomegranates with crimson
Blushes, the olives with their darker clusters,
Rose before him like a vision, full of beauty
And delight. Gazed he on the lovely landscape
Till it faded from his view, and the wing
Of death's sweet angel hovered o'er the mountain's
Crest, and he heard his garments rustle through
The watches of the night.
                                   Then another, fairer, vision
Broke upon his longing gaze; 'twas the land
Of crystal fountains, love and beauty, joy
And light, for the pearly gates flew open,
And his ransomed soul went in. And when morning
O'er the mountain fringed each crag and peak with light,
Cold and lifeless lay the leader. God had touched
His eyes with slumber, giving his beloved sleep.
                    Oh never on that mountain
                    Was seen a lovelier sight
                    Than the troupe of fair young angels
                    That gathered 'round the dead.
                    With gentle hands they bore bim,
                    That bright and shining train,
                    From Nebo's lonely mountain
                    To sleep in Moab's vale.
                    But they sung no mornful dirges,
                    No solemn requiems said,
                    And the soft wave of their pinions
                    Made music as they trod.
                    But no one heard them passing,
                    None saw their chosen grave;
                    It was the angels secret
                    Where Moses should be laid.
                    And when the grave was finished,
                    They trod with golden sandals
                    Above the sacred spot,
                    And the brightest, fairest flowers
                    Sprang up beneath their tread.
                    Nor broken turf, nor hillock
                    Did e'er reveal that grave,
                    And truthful lips have never said
                    We know where he is laid.
THE MISSION OF THE FLOWERS.
          In a lovely garden, filled with fair and blooming flowers, stood a beautiful rose tree. It was the centre of attraction, and won the admiration of every eye; its beauteous flowers were sought to adorn the bridal wreath and deck the funeral bier. It was a thing of joy and beauty, and its earth mission was a blessing. Kind hands plucked its flowers to gladden the chamber of sickness and adorn the prisoner's lonely cell. Young girls wore them ʼmid their clustering curls, and grave brows relaxed when they gazed upon their wondrous beauty. Now the rose was very kind and generous hearted, and, seeing how much joy she dispensed, wished that every flower could only be a rose, and like herself have the privilege of giving joy to the children of men; and while she thus mused, a bright and lovely spirit approached her and said, “I know thy wishes and will grant thy desires. Thou shalt have power to change every flower in the garden to thine own likeness. When the soft winds come wooing thy fairest buds and flowers, thou shalt breathe gently on thy sister plants, and beneath thy influence they shall change to beautiful roses.” The rose tree bowed her head in silent gratitude to the gentle being who had granted her this wondrous power. All night the stars bent over her from their holy homes above, but she scarcely heeded their vigils. The gentle dews nestled in her arms and kissed the cheeks of her daughters; but she hardly noticed them;—she was waiting for the soft airs to awaken and seek her charming abode. At length the gentle airs greeted her, and she hailed them with a joyous welcome, and then commenced her work of change. The first object that met her vision was a tulip superbly arrayed in scarlet and gold. When she was aware of the intention of her neighbor, her cheeks flamed with anger, her eyes flashed indignantly, and she haughtily refused to change her proud robes for the garb the rose tree had prepared for her; but she could not resist the spell that was upon her, and she passively permitted the garments of the rose to enfold her yielding limbs. The verbenas saw the change that had fallen upon the tulip and dreading that a similar fate awaited them, crept closely to the ground, and, while tears gathered in their eyes, they felt a change pass through their sensitive frames, and instead of gentle verbenas they were blushing roses. She breathed upon the sleepy poppies; a deeper slumber fell upon their senses, and when they awoke, they too had changed to bright and beautiful roses. The heliotrope read her fate in the lot of her sisters, and, bowing her fair head in silent sorrow, gracefully submitted to her unwelcome destiny. The violets, whose mission was to herald the approach of spring, were averse to losing their identity. “Surely," said they, we have a mission as well as the rose;" but with heavy hearts they saw themselves changed like their sister plants. The snow drop drew around her robes of virgin white; she would not willingly exchange them for the most brilliant attire that ever decked a flower's form; to her they were the emblems of purity and innocence; but the rose tree breathed upon her, and with a bitter sob she reluctantly consented to the change. The dahlias lifted their heads proudly and defiantly; they dreaded the change, but scorned submission; they loved the fading year, and wished to spread around his dying couch their brightest, fairest flowers; but vainly they struggled, the doom was upon them, and they could not escape. A modest lily that grew near the rose tree shrank instinctively from her; but it was in vain, and with tearful eyes and trembling limbs she yielded, while a quiver of agony convulsed her frame. The marygolds sighed submissively and made no remonstrance. The garden pinks grew careless, and submitted without a murmur, while other flowers, less fragrant or less fair, paled with sorrow or reddened with anger; but the spell of the rose tree was upon them, and every flower was changed by her power, and that once beautiful garden was overrun with roses; it had become a perfect wilderness of roses; the garden had changed, but that variety which had lent it so much beauty was gone, and men grew tired of roses, for they were everywhere. The smallest violet peeping faintly from its bed would have been welcome, the humblest primrose would have been hailed with delight,—even a dandelion would have been a harbinger of joy; and when the rose saw that the children of men were dissatisfied with the change she had made, her heart grew sad within her, and she wished the power had never been given her to change her sister plants to roses, and tears came into her eyes as she mused, when suddenly a rough wind shook her drooping form, and she opened her eyes and found that she had only been dreaming. But an important lesson had been taught; she had learned to respect the individuality of her sister flowers, and began to see that they, as well as herself, had their own missions,—some to gladden the eye with their loveliness and thrill the soul with delight; some to transmit fragrance to the air; others to breathe a refining influence upon the world; some had power to lull the aching brow and soothe the weary heart and brain into forgetfulness; and of those whose mission she did not understand, she wisely concluded there must be some object in their creation, and resolved to be true to her own earth-mission, and lay her fairest buds and flowers upon the altars of love and truth.
 THE RAGGED STOCKING. 
 Do you see this ragged stocking, 
    Here a rent and there a hole? 
 Each thread of this little stocking 
    Is woven around my soul. 
 Do you wish to hear my story? 
   Excuse me, the tears will start. 
 For the sight of this ragged stocking 
   Stirs the fountains of my heart. 
 You say that my home is happy ; 
   To me 'tis earth's fairest place, 
 But its sunshine, peace and gladness 
   Back to this stocking I trace. 
 I was once a wretched drunkard ; 
   Ah! you start and say not so ; 
 But the dreadful depths I've sounded, 
   And I speak of what I know. 
 I was wild and very reckless 
   When I stood on manhood's brink, 
 And, joining with pleasure-seekers 
   Learned to revel and drink. 
 Strong drink is a raging demon, 
   In his hands are shame and woe ; 
 He mocketh the strength of the mighty
   And bringeth the strong man low. 
  
 The light of my home was darkened 
   By the shadow of my sin; 
 And want and woe unbarr'd the door, 
   And suffering entered in. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
 The streets were full one Cin-istmas eve, 
   And alive with girls and boys, 
 Merrily looking through window-panes 
   At bright and beautiful toys. 
 And throngs of parents came to buy 
   The gifts that children prize, 
 And homeward trudged with happy hearts, 
   The love-light in their eyes. 
 I thought of my little Charley 
   At home in his lowly bed, 
 With the shadows around his life, 
   And in shame I bowed my head. 
 I entered my home a sober man,
   My heart by remorse was wrung, 
 And there in the chimney corner, 
   This little stocking was hung. 
 Faded and worn as you see it ; 
   To me 'tis a precious thing. 
 And I never gaze upon it 
   But unbidden tears will spring. 
 I began to search my pockets, 
   But scarcely a dime was there; 
 But scanty as was the pittance, 
   This stocking received its share. 
 For a longing seized upon me 
   To gladden the heart of my boy. 
 And I bought him some cakes and candy, 
   And added a simple toy. 
 Then I knelt by this little stocking 
   And sobbed out an earnest prayer, 
 And arose with strength to wrestle 
   And break from the tempter's snare. 
 And this faded, worn-out stocking, 
   So pitiful once to see, 
 Became the wedge that broke my chain, 
   And a blessing brought to me. 
 Do you marvel then I prize it? 
   When each darn and seam and liole 
 Is linked with my soul's deliverance 
   From the bondage of the bowl ? 
 And to night my wife will tell you. 
   Though I've houses, gold and land, 
 He holds no treasure more precious 
   Than this stocking in my hand. 
THE FATAL PLEDGE. 
 "Pledge me with wine/' the maiden cried, 
    Her tones were gay and light ; 
 "From others you have turned aside, 
   I claim your pledge to-night." 
 The blood rushed to the young man's cheek 
   Then left it deadly pale; 
 Beneath the witchery of her smile 
   He felt his courage fail. 
 For many years he'd been a slave 
   To the enchanting bowl, 
 Until he grasped with eager hands 
   The reins of self-control ; 
 And struggled with his hated thrall, 
   Until he rent his chain, 
 And strove to stand erect and free, 
   And be a man again. 
 When others came with tempting words 
   He coldly turned aside. 
 But she who held the sparkling cup 
   Was his affianced bride ; 
 And like a vision of delight. 
   Bright, beautiful and fair, 
 With thoughtless words she wove for him 
   The meshes of despair. 
  
 From jeweled hands he took the cup, 
   Nor heard the serpent's hiss ; 
 Nor saw beneath its ruby glow 
   The deadly adder's hiss. 
 Like waves that madly, wildly dash, 
   When dykes are overthrown. 
 The barriers of his soul gave way, 
   Each life with wrecks was strewn. 
 And she who might have reached her hand 
   To succor and to save, 
 Soon wept in hopeless agony 
   Above a drunkard's grave. 
 And bore through life with bleeding heart 
   Remembrance of that night, 
 When she had urged the tempted man 
   With wine to make his plight. 
CHRIST'S ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM. 
 He had plunged into our sorrows, 
    And our sin had pierced his heart, 
 As before him loomed death's shadow, 
   And he knew he must depart. 
 But they hailed him as a victor 
   As he into Salem came, 
 And the very children shouted 
   Loud hosannas to his name. 
 Bat he knew behind that triumph, 
   Rising gladly to the sky, 
 Soon would come the cries of malice: 
   Crucify him! Crucify! 
 Onward rode the blessed Saviour, 
    Conscious of the coming strife 
 Soon to break in storms of hatred 
   Round his dear, devoted life. 
 Ghastly in its fearful anguish 
   Rose the cross before his eyes, 
 But he saw the joy beyond it, 
   And did all the shame despise. 
 Joy to see the cry of scorning 
   Through the ages ever bright, 
 And the cross of shame transfigured 
   To a throne of love and lioht. 
 Joy to know his soul's deep travail 
   Should not he a thing in vain, 
 And that joy and peace sliould blossom 
   From his agonizing pain. 
 THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS. 
 It was done, the deed of horror ; 
   Christ had died upon the cross. 
 And within an upper chamber 
   The disciples mourned their loss. 
 Peter's eyes were full of anguish, 
   Thinking sadly of the trial 
 When his boasted self-reliance 
   Ended in his Lord's deniaL 
 Disappointment, deep and heavy. 
   Shrouded every heart with gloom, 
 As the hopes so fondly cherished 
    Died around the garden tomb. 
   
 And they thought with shame and sorrow 
   How they fled in that dark hour, 
 When they saw tlieir Lord and Master 
   In the clutch of Roman power. 
 We had hoped, they sadly uttered, 
   He would over Israel reign, 
 But to-day he lies sepulchred. 
   And our cherished hopes are vain. 
 In the humble home of Mary 
   Slowly waned the hours away, 
 Till she rose to seek the garden 
   And the place where Jesus lay. 
 Not the cross with all its anguish 
   Could her loving heart restrain, 
 But the tomb she sought was empty, 
   And her heart o'erflowed with pain. 
 To embalm my Lord and Master 
   To this garden I have strayed. 
 But, behold, I miss his body. 
   And I know not where he's laid. 
 Then a wave of strange emotion 
   Swept her soul, as angels said, 
 "Wherefore do ye seek the living 
   'Mid the chambers of the dead? " 
 Unperceived, her Lord stood by her, 
   Silent witness of her grief, 
 Bearing on his lips the tidings 
   Sure to bring a glad relief 
 But her tear-dimmed eyes were holden 
   When she heard the Master speak ; 
 Til ought she, only 'tis the gardener 
   Asking whom her soul did seek. 
 Then a sudden flush of gladness 
   O'er her grief- worn features spread; 
 When she knew the voice of Jesus 
   All her bitter anguish fled. 
Forth she reached hands in rapture. 
  Touch me not, the Saviour said ; 
Take the message to my brethren, 
  I have risen from the dead. 
 Take them words of joy and comfort, 
    Which will all their mourning end; 
 To their Father and my Father, 
   Tell them that I will ascend. 
 "Brethren, I have seen the Master: 
   He is risen from the dead." 
 But like words of idle meaning 
   Seemed the glorious words she said. 
 Soon they saw the revelation 
   Which would bid their mourning cease; 
 Christ, the risen, stood before them 
   Breathing words of love and peace. 
 Timid men were changed to heroes, 
   Weakness turned to wondrous might. 
 And the cross became their standard, 
   Luminous with love and light. 
 From that lonely upper chamber, 
   Holding up the rugged cross, 
 With a glad and bold surrender 
   They encountered shame and loss. 
 In these days of doubt and error, 
   In the conflict for the right, 
 May our hearts be ever strengthened 
   By the resurrection's might. 
 SIMON'S COUNTRYMEN. 
 They took away his seamless robe, 
    With thorns they crowned his head, 
 As harshly, fiercely cried his foes : 
   "Barabbas in his stead." 
 The friends he loved unto the end, 
   Who shared his daily bread, 
 Before the storms of wrath and hate 
   Forsook their Lord and fled. 
 To rescue men from death and sin 
   He knew the awful cost. 
 As wearily he bent beneath 
   The burden of the cross. 
 When Pilate had decreed his fate. 
   And Jews withheld their aid, 
 Then Simon, the Cyrenean, came : 
   On him the cross was laid. 
 Not his to smite with cruel scorn, 
   Nor mock the dying one, 
 Thiit helpful man came from the land 
   Kissed by the ardent sun — 
 The land within whose slieltering arms 
   The infant Jesus lay 
 When Herod vainly bared his sword 
   And sought the child to slay. 
 Amid the calendar of saints 
   We Simon's name may trace. 
 On history's page thro' every age 
   He bears an honored place. 
 He little knew that cross would change 
   Unto a throne of light; 
 The crown of thorns upon Christ's brow 
   Would be forever bright. 
 Beneath the shadow of that cross 
   Brave men wdth outstretched hands 
 Have told the wondrous tale of love 
   In distant heathen lands. 
 And yet within our favored land. 
  Where Christian churclies rise, 
 The dark-browed sons of Africa 
   Are hated and despised. 
 Can they who speak of Christ as King, 
   And glory in his name, 
 Forget that Simon's countiymen 
   Still bear a cross of shame? 
 Can they forget the cruel scorn 
   Men shower on a race 
 AVho treat the hues their Father gives 
   As emblems of disgrace? 
 Will they erect to God their fanes 
   And Christ with honor crown, 
 And then with cruel weights of pain 
   The African press down ? 
 Oh, Christians, when we faint and bleed 
   In this our native land, 
 Reach out to us when peeled, opprest, 
   A kindly helping hand, 
 And bear aloft that sacred cross, 
   Bright from the distant years. 
 And say for Christ's and Simon's sake, 
   We'll wipe away your tears. 
 For years of sorrow, toil and pain 
   We'll bring you love and light, 
 And in the name of Christ our Lord 
   We'll make your pathway bright. 
That seamless robe shall yet enfold 
  The children of the sun, 
Till rich and poor and bond and free 
   In Christ shall all be one. 
 And for his sake from pride and scorn 
   Our spirits shall be free, 
 Till through our souls shall sound the words 
    He did it unto me. 
 DELIVERANCE. 
 Rise up! rise up! Oh Israel, 
   Let a spotless lamb be slain; 
 The angel of death will o'er you bend 
   And rend your galling chain. 
 Sprinkle its blood upon the posts 
   And lintels of your door ; 
 When the angel sees the crimson spots 
   Unharmed he will pass you o'er. 
 Gather your flocks and herds to-night, 
 Your children by  our side : 
 A leader from Arabia comes 
 To be your friend and guide. 
 With girded loins and sandlcd feet 
   Await the hour of dread, 
 When Mizraim shall wildly mourn 
   Her first-born and her dead. 
 The sons of Abraham no more 
    Shall crouch 'neath Pliaroah's hand, 
 Trembling with agony and dread, 
   He'll thrust you from the land. 
 And ye shall hold in unborn years 
   A feast to mark this day, 
 When joyfully the fathers rose 
   And cast their chains away. 
 When crimson tints of morning flush 
   The golden gates of day, 
 Or gorgeous hue of even melt 
   In sombre shades away, 
 Then ye shall to your children teach 
   The meaning of this feast. 
 How from the proud oppressor's hand 
    Their fathers were released, 
 And ye shall hold through distant years 
   This feast with glad accord, 
 And children's children yet shall learn 
   To love and trust the Lord. 
 Ages have passed since Israel trod 
   In triumph through the sea, 
 And yet they hold in memory's urn 
   Their first great jubilee. 
 When Moses led the ransomed hosts, 
   And Miriam's song arose. 
 While ruin closed around the path 
   Of their pursuing foes. 
 Shall Israel thro' long varied years 
   These memories cherish yet, 
And we who lately stood redeemed 
   Our broken chains forget? 
 Should we forget the wondrous change 
   That to our people came, 
 When justice rose and sternly plead 
   Our cause with sword and flame ? 
 And led us through the storms of war 
   To freedom's fairer shore, 
 When slavery sank beneath a flood 
   Whose waves were human gore. 
 Oh, youth and maidens of the land, 
   Rise up with one accord, 
 And in the name of Christ go forth 
   To battle for the Lord. 
 Go forth, but not in crimson fields. 
   With fratricidal strife, 
 But in the name of Christ go forth 
   For freedom, love and life. 
 Go forth to follow in his steps, 
   Who came not to destro}''. 
 Till wastes shall blossom as the rose, 
   And deserts sing for joy. 
 SIMON'S FEAST. 
 He is coming, she said, to Simon's feast. 
   The prophet of Galilee, 
 Though multitudes around him throng 
   In longing his face to see. 
 He enters the home as Simon's guest, 
   But he gives no welcome kiss ; 
 He brings no water to bathe his feet — 
   Why is Simon so remiss ? 
 The prophet's face is bright with love, 
   And mercy beams from his eye ; 
 He pities the poor, the lame and blind, 
   An outcast, I will draw nigh. 
 If a prophet, he will surely know 
   The guilt of my darkened years ; 
 With broken heart I'll seek his face, 
   And bathe his feet with my tears. 
 No holy rabbi lays his hand 
   In blessing on my head ; 
 No loving voice floats o'er the path, 
   The downward path I tread. 
 Unto the Master's side she pressed, 
   A penitent, frail and fair, 
 Rained on his feet a flood of tears. 
   And then wiped them with her hair. 
  
 Over the face of Simon swept 
    An air of puzzled surprise ; 
 Can my guest a holy prophet be, 
   And not this woman despise? 
 Christ saw the thoughts that Simon's heart 
   Had written upon his face, 
 Kindly turned to the sinful one 
   In her sorrow and disgrace. 
 Where Simon only saw the stains, 
   Where sin and shame were rife, 
 Christ looked beneath and saw the germs 
   Of a fair, outflowering life. 
 Like one who breaks a galling chain, 
   And sets a prisoner free, 
 He rent her fetters with the words, 
   ''Thy sins are forgiven thee." 
 God be praised for the gracious words 
   Which came through that woman's touch 
 That souls redeemed thro' God's dear Son 
   May learn to love him so much ; 
 That souls once red with guilt and crime 
   May their crimson stains outgrow ; 
 The scarlet spots upon their lives 
   Become whiter than driven snow.

 A BOOK OF POEMS, DEDICATED TO THE 
 LOVERS OF AMERICAN IDEALS 
 RICHARD E. S. TOOMEY 
 OF TENNESSEE' 
 Lt. Late 8th U. S. V. Infantry 
 WASHINGTON

 MCMI 
 Copyright, 1901, by The Neale Publishing Company. 
With gracious acknowledgment to that soul, who 
has both encouraged and inspired my zeal, 
I respectfully dedicate this volume to 
All True Americans. 
 Richard E. S. Toomey. 
Preface. 
 In compliance with requests, oft repeated by many, I 
 have made from my writings in verse the selections contained 
 in this volume for the perusal of those who love Liberty, 
 Justice, Truth and Beauty. 
 I claim for them no special merit save what may be 
 accorded because they emanate from a heart imbued with 
 love of Race, of Country, of God. 
 I have not aimed to measure my lines by the rule of any 
 of the multifarious schools of poetry, but have written as 
 moved. If the works of any of the poets have influenced 
 my mode more than others, they are those of Gray, whom 
 we wish had written more; of Scott, who wrote untrammelled 
 by the ready-made laws for poetic utterance; of Dunbar, 
 whose pathos and humor wrings unconscious tears from the 
 heart or fills the soul with spontaneous laughter. 
 Richard B. S. Toomey. 
Introduction. 
 In saying a word for the accompanying verses, I am 
 hampered by the fact that I have, myself, but a small public, 
 and in this case can appeal only to a part of it. 
 So much attention has lately been paid to poetic gym- 
 nastics and dialectic jingles, that there has seemed little 
 space in which to give ear to the sober and sound matter 
 such as is found in this book. 
 But after all it is the poet's business to speak in the 
 midst of din and tell the message that he has for the world. 
 This, Lieutenant Toomey has done melodiously and clear, 
 and those who love strong, manly ideas vigorously expressed 
 will pause and listen to this soldier singer. 
 Paul, Laurence Dunbar.

 ODE TO COLUMBIA. 
 Our nation is formed of varied races. 
 To believe this, look into the faces 
 Of those who our waters and lands traverse; 
 Whom, though unlike, our institutions nurse. 
 Of all governments there is none better 
 Than that which shows in spirit and letter 
 The great idea of man's close relation — 
 That kin all are, though of different nation. 
 Our populace grows; and from every clime 
 Come those to whom Columbia seems sublime. 
 And so, too, she is. Would you discover 
 What it is that makes her people love her? 
 'T is that when she is conscious of just blame 
 Such knowledge emblushes her brow with shame. 
 Soon she begins to seek proper measure 
 To clear her name, for that is her treasure. 
When she became conscious what direful plight 
 She was plunged into by slavery's night, 
 She quick the shackles of slavery broke, 
 Made bondmen citizens, when conscience woke. 
 When cruelties severe vexed these freemen, 
 She saw and came to their relief again; 
 Swift to relieve them from that oppression, 
 A new amendment is their possession. 
 From the memorable day when whe was born, 
 Her life has been varied, prosperous, forlorn; 
 But since she arrived at years mature 
 Her people have been blessed each } r ear the more, 
 Though to the oppressed at times it would seem 
 That no ray of justice would on them beam; 
 Yet it has e'er happened in darkest days, 
 Columbia's face gleamed with effulgent rays — 
 Shined away conditions which produced gloom, 
 Bade hope come forth from despondency's tomb. 
 When general panics have wrought great fear, 
 All business crushed with financial despair, 
 Columbia has arisen in her might, 
 Brought order from chaos, set all things right. 
 When recalcitrant children broke her laws, 
 And her face was slapped by secession's paws, 
 Justly indignant, she doth them chastise. 
 Thus made ashamed, they obedient rise 
Then, as they see that Columbia's plan 
 Is to deal full justice to every man,  
 They gradually their conceits forego, 
 And now the spirit of patriots show. 
 Hence, when Columbia had taken a stand 
 To wrest our neighbors from oppression's hand, 
 Troops from the North, a Wheeler from the South, 
 With Negro soldiers faced the cannon's mouth. 
 Thus it has e'er been from Columbia's birth, 
 Since her noble form first adorned the earth, — 
 Her children far distant, with thoughts diverse, 
 With habits unlike, intolerance terse, 
 Fly quick to her standard whene'er her needs 
 Show the want of a son's or hero's deeds: 
 To die, if they're required; such is their wont 
 To uphold her honor, avenge her affront. 
 But never in all Columbia's life 
 Has she been active in fomenting strife; 
 Unlike other lands is our method here, 
 We keep no large armies from year to year; 
 But when other nations trample our laws 
 Each son volunteers, enarms, marches, draws; 
 Nor, like some, do we here throw conscripts' pall 
 Over city, hamlet, cottage and hall. 
 Such plan we deem does not valor adorn; 
 Best service is of love, not of law born. 
 Now that Columbia stretches helpful hands 
 To the poor, the needy of other lands, 
Though her proffers are met as e'er the case 
 When a stronger would help a weaker race; 
 Viewed with suspicion her intents aspersed, 
 Her love called weakness, her efforts traversed; 
 This, too, not by those lone whom she would raise, 
 But those from whom her efforts should draw praise. 
 What shall she do; shall she give up the lands 
 Won by her brave sons and placed in her hands? 
 Shall she turn, wolf-like, from duty away, 
 As the craven beast slinks, at dawn of day? 
 Out, poltroon! away! Give your words no breath 
 Such seducer merits a traitor's death. 
 Your words not only Columbia offend, 
 But comfort and aid to enemies lend. 
 Shall Columbia, in this progressive age, 
 Sole, be inactive, on the world's great stage? 
 Forbid it, freemen! Forfend it, heaven! 
 Let liberty's spirit act as leaven 
 With these people new to its great blessing. 
 Cease, croaker, your country's will distressing! 
 Admit some honest in their position: 
 "That we ought not assume such condition 
 As these rebel colonies must entail," 
 "That our best efforts will most surely fail" 
 Let some change "Presumptious resolution, 
 Unwarranted by our Constitution," 
 Some "We destroy the doctrine of Monroe, 
 And therefore our policy should forego." 
Let us attempt to set their doubts at rest, 
 Show that who bless others, themselves are blessed. 
 "No more benefit is ever received 
 By who accepts than who performs the deed." 
 Such example in our country's early life 
 May be seen in the deed of John Rolfe's wife; 
 Or, if an example on larger scale, 
 Take the emancipation — oft- told tale. 
 L,et all remember, who liberty love, 
 That it emanates from the God above; 
 Hence it can not be " mewed up " in our clime 
 And will be offered the oppressed through all time. 
 Think ye not that Columbia is sinning, 
 But her great destiny is beginning 
 To show to the people of all the world 
 That liberty's banner must be unfurled, 
 Must greet the morn on every mountain top, 
 Be planted in each valley, yet not stop 
 Till the many islands of the seas 
 Have floated it, triumphant, to the breeze. 
 Columbia, when prepared for war or peace, 
 Keep faithful to thy cause and never cease 
 Till the course thou seek thou full attain. 
 Waiting thy orders, we, a host remain; 
 No royal system does our land detone, 
 Every man's free, his destiny's his own, 
 And who, Columbia grand, would not applaud 
 Thy land, in which there's vassal none or lord. 
Here every one stands on a level plain, 
 The lowest, highest honors here may gain;
 Part of our people hold not this idea,
 Such thoughts are for other than thetn, they fear,
 Surrounded by injustice, dangers fell,
 Which, if Columbia notes, they can not tell,
 Since at times it seems that she would ignore
 The distressful signs sent up by the poor —
 Poor in rights, safety, liberty and life,
 Yet quick to lend their aid when she's in strife.
 Look with me, sufferers, to history past,
 See you're not the worst treated nor the last.
 Races have risen through trials more severe,
 By work, faith, fortitude, hence persevere:
 Continue, then, the course wherein you've wrought,
 Remember our fathers, though enslaved, fought
 Earnest in each cause which engaged the land:
 Let us their course maintain with equal hand.
 If, like Achilles, we should hold away,
 Would this the progress of events delay?
 No, my brother; let no such inane rage
 Your plans, thoughts, actions, writings, words engage.
 As is our land's, I read the future dim,
 So our condition, should she sink or swim;
 The nation's life forever is entwined
 Not more close round Caucasian than our kind.
 Thoughtless zealot! Stay not these dusky sons
 From Columbia's ships or bearing her guns;
  
Because — alas, 't is true — we've not received 
 What is our due nor from hate's work relieved. 
 These cruelties to her sons I'd not condone, 
 The nation for its crimes must full atone. 
 There is a universal law which pays, 
 In kind, him who pain on his fellow lays. 
 And when, I ask, did principle descend, 
 Its eternal, rigid precepts amend, 
 Or ever change its fixed, immobile laws, 
 To prove or justify the wicked's cause. 
 You who know the course of the human race, 
 Who its each phase of progress well can trace, 
 Tell, did justice ever divert its blow 
 When aimed at dastards fell, though tardy? No! 
 If this principle be true, as I state, 
 How, Columbia, canst thou evade such fate 
 As falls on who permit, as who do wrong; 
 Pays back in like kind, though deferring long? 
 O, sons of liberty, you only can 
 Avoid such fate by adopting this plan: 
 Let each lowliest son in safety strive, 
 Give to each and all equal chance to thrive, 
 Let one class of laws affect all alike; 
 These will at the root of our evils strike. 
 Can we dare highest excellence crave, 
 While the people exist part free, part slave? 
Futile cravings, such heights we can not reach 
 L,est we practice what our institutes teach. 
 And why should our destiny be withstood, 
 While millions desire their country's good? 
 Let leaders of thought and press of power 
 Speak for justice — begin this very hour 
 To call attention to our nation's crimes, 
 Such as wrecked governments in former times. 
 Thus get the conscience of Columbia awake, 
 Effective measures at once will she take 
 To berid herself of such cause for shame; 
 Aforetimes when roused she has done the same. 
 She has risen to the demands of each age, 
 Shall crimes 'gainst her poor still blot history's page? 
 Wake, Columbia! See what thou hast achieved! 
 Thou roused, soon will the sufferer be relieved; 
 Nor has the eagle flown more swift than thou. 
 Known to every land is thy power now. 
 Thou burst the tyrant's bonds in days of yore 
 And bow to Monarch's rule, no, nevermore; 
 Thy crude estate thou'st worthily enhanced, 
 Until the world stands awe-struck and entranced; 
 Thou'st threaded thy land with wire, iron and steel 
 Until all parts the other's pulses feel; 
 Thy waters teem with healthful, active life, 
 Thy marts with varied interests are rife; 
 Thy people now know as never before 
 Thy power and will to protect thy shore. 
Since thy power is great, O Columbia grand, 
 Stretch, O stretch justly thine empowered hand, 
 Lift from the oppressed the burdens they bear, 
 Do not thou the fate of fallen nations share! 
 Do this, thou'It find thy destiny assured 
 And heaven's blessing on thy pathway poured. 
 Thus being dressed in garb of highest virtue 
 Know thou mayest the millenium nurture; 
 If Nature's laws merge in the spirit world, 
 Christ's banner, here, may by thee be unfurled. 
 A HERO AND A LESSON. 
 "For foreign cruise "his orders read; 
 That instant all his sails were spread. 
 He stays not to some favor wait — 
 His sole desire to serve the State. 
 The lesson taught by this example 
 Excellent is, and worthy sample 
 For those who would serve the nation 
 To follow close, with emulation. 
In order all his ships he keeps; 
 On post of duty never sleeps; 
 Alert, observant, everywhere — 
 His nation's honor is his care. 
 Seest thou not such habit's merit? 
 Know that who succeeds must wear it. 
 Thine energies then, active, keen, 
 Devote to affairs which on thee lean. 
 With field-glass oft he sweeps the sea, 
 Swift to fill what his orders be; 
 These haste his course, direct his stay — 
 No trifling wastes his time away. 
 Whene'er thou under orders art, 
 Fulfill them; let no pleasure thwart 
 The achievement of a designed aim; 
 Play on duty, thou marriest shame. 
 Thus coursing true, he takes his way, 
 Anchors at length in China's bay; 
 His country knows his movements all — 
 Should need require he's within call. 
 Hold thou likewise, straight on thy course, 
 Whate'er the allurements be which cross 
 Thy path. Then thy path duly known, 
 Later thou 'It find with flowers strewn. 
Modest, yet brave, he seeks no cause 
 To rouse his countrymen's applause; 
 He makes no play to place his name 
 Upon his nation's roll of fame. 
 On the other hand, through life thou 'It find 
 Who strive for fame are not the kind 
 Who fame attain. Obscure they die — 
 They've posed through life, a living lie. 
 But when the States to conflict rise, 
 His earnest prayer ascends the skies: 
 " Let Thou," asks he of Him above, 
 "My deeds sustain the land I love. "
 Seest thou, then, if great thy desire 
 To find aid for ambition's fire, 
 Thou bow to Him who is the source 
 Of power; then is blessed thy course. 
 The Armada once Great Britain awed; 
 Nelson its icy pride soon thawed; 
 At Paul Jones' name the foeman quakes; 
 Perry's victory adorns the Lakes. 
 The many deeds 'twixt North and South 
 Let us pass by with silent mouth. 
 This awful conflict thousands slew; 
 The Gray were brave as were the Blue. 
Why by much pricking o'er and o'er 
 Should wounds be made a running sore? 
 Let's bury in oblivion's grave 
 All difference; both sides were brave. 
 Read the lines of song or story — 
 Whate'er speaks of naval glory. 
 History, tradition — all, I hold 
 Of no such victory ever told 
 As that which on the side of right 
 Was won by Dewey in the fight, 
 When, on that famous first of May, 
 He sunk Spain's fleet in Luzon Bay. 
 Around the world his vict'ry rings; 
 America his praises sing — 
 Nor does all this his conduct swerve, 
 Inflate his head, excite his nerve. 
 But calm and modest as of } r ore 
 He turns toward his native shore. 
 For his coming Columbia waits 
 Full wide to open all her gates. 
 Then parting from her custom staid, 
 Cries "Great encomium must be paid 
 To him who for my honor fought; 
 For sure, none e'er such vict'ry wrought. 1 
When great deeds the historians state; 
 When sire to son these deeds relate, 
 They tell of him of greatest fame, 
 And say "George Dewey is his name. "
 All honor to him whose great deed 
 Arouses every patriot's meed 
 Of praise! Now let fame gladly place 
 Dewey's name highest in honor's space! 
 [Inasmuch as a number— few though it be— of our people are advancing 
 the very foolish and wholly impracticable policy of " Self-effacement " as 
 a means of bettering our condition in this our country, I have written 
 the following with the desire to dislodge from their minds this ill-con- 
 ceived idea.] 
 SELF-EFFACEMENT. 
 People;, in metamorphic state 
 Of growth, ever received the hate 
 Of some, 'midst whom their lives were thrown 
 But through it they have thriven, grown. 
 Of course they sought, as may be seen, 
 To blunt the edge of trials, keen; 
 Seldom courage did they e'er lack, 
 And never thought of turning back. 
 But now a strange thing do we see, 
 Some of our folks, O, sad to me, 
Instead of progress these would place — 
 What? — "Self-effacement" for the race. 
 "Effacement!" A peculiar word! 
 Its meaning have you ever heard, 
 And how it's sought to be applied 
 By people who would have it tried 
 As panacea for such ills, 
 As all our aspiration kills? 
 This word we are talking about 
 Means a most complete wiping out: 
 Condition which, as you may see, 
 It is impossible to be. 
 The lightest creature, deed or word, 
 Has weight, is through all cosmos heard. 
 Such things, then, as can not be traced 
 By us, don't say they are effaced. 
 Are the worms effaced when they die 
 Giving birth to the butterfly? 
 The grain that's of the species corn, 
 Can it deny that such it's born? 
 Though it receive the North-wind's blight, 
 And shrivel up as in affright, 
 Shamed by its fate, theu strive with pain 
 To change into some diff'rent grain, 
 It will remain, though ill to see, 
 Just what it was designed to be. 
 For some purpose were all things made, 
 Since earth's foundations first were laid, 
From microcosm or atom small 
 To the mountain so grand and tall; 
 From the minutest germ that's rife, 
 To man, who dignifies all life. 
 All do some purpose good fulfill, 
 Responsive to "Infinite Will." 
 Nothing that's known to Nature's laws 
 Is swallowed in oblivion's jaws; 
 If good or ill, it pays its cost, 
 But nothing in God's plan is lost. 
 Our zealous friends but seek a way 
 Our persecutions to allay, 
 But sure must find some better plan 
 Than this: "That we are less than man." 
 If men we are — and this I claim — 
 We must be men in more than name, 
 And must aspire with honest heart 
 In men's affairs to take a part. 
 Should we our " manhood's rights " forego, 
 Without strong protest, we would show 
 Ourselves unworthy of the boon 
 For which men fought; that all too soon 
 Were we by Providence set free, 
 Permitted citizens to be: 
 In short, would prove it useless blood 
 Which poured for us a mighty flood. 
 Then ought we ourselves to "Efface "
 From politics? Ah, no, my race! 
For sure, in what this word implies, 
 Therein our strength or weakness lies. 
 Then hold it, not as something light, 
 But guard it as a " sacred right," 
 The "right" by which our will's expressed. 
 The "right " by which our land is blessed 
 Is that of " suffrage," so well planned 
 For all, by " Founders of our land." 
 Though we be of lowly station, 
 Did we not help make the nation? 
 Do we not have its good at heart? 
 Are we not an integral part? 
 If it is true, as we are told, 
 That "Each link makes the chain to hold," 
 Then we are bound to fill our place, 
 Which we can not if we " Efface. "
 Should " Self-effacement" move the race 
 To show that we deserve no place 
 Among progressive men, who live 
 By all the means which our times give, 
 Suited but for destruction's paw, 
 Would we be, by that fixed, just law 
 Which makes the bees drive from their hive 
 The drone, not "fitted to survive." 
 The same thought which makes us to know 
 "Who would be free must strike the blow, "
 Tells us our " rights," by reason curbed, 
 We must retain, though sore disturbed. 
The races through all the ages 
 We learn from history's pages. 
 Whose fame was known o'er all the earth,. 
 Whose deeds were of the greatest worth, 
 In trouble's crucible were burned 
 Before their excellence was earned. 
 Not one that ever climbed the height, 
 The deed accomplished in a night. 
 Just as the gold is tried by fire, 
 Purged of alloy, valued higher, 
 So will the hardships which are ours 
 But develop nobler powers. 
 As does the thresher cleanse the wheat, 
 And friction produce useful heat, 
 So will our trials in this land 
 Bring us forth men of better brand. 
 Do not, as cowards, seek to fly; 
 Our rights, maintain them, though we die. 
 If, fear-stricken, some weaklings yield, 
 And craven-like slink from the field, 
 Swift let them go, nor them lament, 
 But stand our ground and be content; 
 Though long the trials, dark the night, 
 Wrong must be conquered by the right. 
 Why all our progress now retrace, 
 Ourselves from public life "Efface"? 
 Deliver us from such advice 
 As would find peace at any price, 
And full quiescent, bear our wrongs. 
 Ah! Sing me not such servile songs! 
 Mark well this truth! On sea or land 
 Naught is achieved by a weak hand. 
 The men whose deeds have blessed their race 
 Have dared look trouble in the face; 
 Then with such plans as wisdom taught, 
 Have blessings for their people wrought. 
 Let all who give such poor advice 
 Try it themselves, then in a trice, 
 As proxy for the entire race, 
 We might, with ease, ourselves " Efface." 
 A THANKSGIVING DAY SUGGESTION. 
 When Washington first proclaimed the day, 
 Trouble touched the land every way. 
 With those who prayed, there Pompey bowed, 
 Nor fear nor war his spirit cowed. 
 As each Thanksgiving day rolled around 
 'Mid ills or joys, it ever found 
 The man, his family on their knees, 
 With prayer and praise their God to please. 
Long years afterwards his son, a slave, 
 With soul devout, with aspect grave, 
 Prayed: " I tank de Lawd for Marser's life, 
 Dat he doan' sell me from ma wife! 
 "Yet, Lawd, if on dis bressed day 
 Ma pra'r doan' cross Dine own dwine way, 
 An' he in 'cordin' wif Dy plan, 
 Gib, O gib freedom to de Ian'! "
 And thus through all the passing years, 
 Through humble joys, or misery's tears, 
 These slaves devout did praise and pray, 
 Seeking God's blessing, in His way. 
 God, in His way, an answer sends, 
 And with men's war-like spirit blends 
 The high spirit of liberty 
 Which sets the nation's bondsmen free. 
 Now upon Thanksgiving day 
 Do Pompey's children kneel to pray; 
 Or seek His aid 'mid grievous wrongs, 
 Or praise His name with freedom's songs? 
 Ah, me! Ah, me! much do I fear 
 The Negro youth bows not in prayer! 
 Know you not you need His aid 
 Who freemen of your foresires made? 
Let all the race to God be bowed; 
 Beg Him dispel the awful cloud 
 Of hate which gathers o'er our head 
 Let it not ills, but blessings shed! 
 ALLEGORY. 
 THE BATTLE OF MANILA — THE FIRST OF MAY. 
 As Though moved by some high behest, 
 Its country's glory e'er its quest, 
 An eagle bold its wings unfurled, 
 Betook itself to view the world. 
 With easy grace, unruffled mien, 
 Its royal pinions oft were seen 
 As though each recess it would probe 
 In every quarter of the globe. 
 From basking in the western sun, 
 The South Sea isles it looked upon; 
 Passed by the land which cradled art, 
 O'er seas through which the simoons dart; 
 Came to the lands that nourish teas, 
 And hovered 'mid the China seas. 
 In equal days, from eastern lands 
 A vulture soars, its crest expands; 
And as it snuffs the salty breeze 
 It scents, from far across the seas, 
 The nauseous odors of a feast 
 By human misery increased. 
 This rancid feast, in times afore, 
 Had satisfied the rapacious maw 
 Of this ill-omened, filthy bird. 
 The putrid odor quickly stirred, 
 Within this ill-starred fowl, its taste, 
 And with unseemly, lustful haste, 
 It plumed its great ungainly wings — 
 No pity at the prospect stings. 
 It spurns the shore, directs its course, 
 And hastens o'er the watery bourse 
 To where were happening direful scenes - 
 The islands of the Philippines. 
 Near China's land now restful stays 
 The western bird of royal ways; 
 A neutral, frigid air it feels, 
 But through its frame just feeling steals; 
 Responding quick to China's pleas, 
 It straightway flies to other seas. 
 As nearing Isle Luzon, the fair, 
 There's borne upon the ambient air 
 Most direful signs of misery. 
 To Manila it turns to see 
The cause; beholds the natives poor 
 Grasped in a vulture's cruel claw 
 Which, dank, as from some gory flood, 
 Is reeking, red, with human blood. 
 The spirit which we know so well, 
 Roused as by a magic spell, 
 Filled to the full the feathered king — 
 New impulse lent unto its wing. 
 The vulture, struck with sudden dread, 
 Beholds close hovering o'er its head 
 The king of birds, of which it heard, 
 Yet ne'er before believed a word; 
 But though abashed, it sought to face 
 (With the audacity of its race) 
 With cruel mien, yet faulty mind, 
 The royal king of all its kind. 
 The eagle clasped the bird, gore-filled; 
 Such terror through its frame distilled, 
 That from it soon its meal is torn, 
 Of wings and beak it soon is shorn. 
 These, quick as do the lightning's glance, 
 Are scattered o'er the broad expanse. 
 As from the shore the oppressed gaze 
 (Their eyes aglow with glad amaze) 
 And view the conflict from afar, 
 As meteor or a fallen star, 
They see their vampire sink in blood, 
 The eagle blaze out like a god. 
 From beneath capacious wings 
 A banner to the breeze it flings. 
 Lengthwise show the alternate bars, 
 While at its top are seen the stars; 
 Above the erstwhile battle's roar 
 The royal bird is seen to soar 
 And gaze, with bold and dauntless eyes, 
 Full in the face of eastern skies. 
 Hark! Strikes the ear a thrilling sound 
 Which fills with gladness all around, 
 As from its throat there comes a cry 
 That joy evokes in every eye; 
 The cry sounds forth the immortal name 
 Born this day to undying fame: 
 Dewey! Dewey!! Dewey!!! Dewey!!! 
 TO THE SHADE OF DOUGLASS. 
 O, grand old man, of massive brow; 
 O, Douglass, how we miss thee now! 
 Thy words, like trumpet notes so clear, 
 Were wont to ope the deafened ear. 
As in the lists, the knights of old, 
 With weapon keen and forefront bold, 
 Stood ready to defend their cause, 
 As custom was with feudal laws; 
 So, with bold heart, conviction strong, 
 Thou fought and battled 'gainst the wrong; 
 Thy weighty cause 'mid thousands plead, 
 When human rights lay bleeding, dead. 
 Thy lance-like wit, thy thought profound, 
 Thy words, wherein truth did abound, 
 Made scales fall from bedarkened eyes, 
 The corpse of human rights to rise. 
 Thy days, thy years, how useful spent, 
 Since first to Freedom's clime thou went; 
 Thy life, devoted to thy race, 
 Plowed manly furrows on thy face. 
 Thy work, long ere thy spirit fled, 
 Had bleached pure white thy noble head; 
 A rev' rent mark to crown thy worth— 
 Of him, grown great from slavish birth! 
 So great, so noble was thy life, 
 Thy powers grown full strong through strife, 
 That none, whoe'er thy brow did scan, 
 Dared say aught else, than " Here's a Man." 
The thought, thou was't a man thyself, 
 Satest not; nor moved by fear nor pelf, 
 Thou sought for each man of thy race 
 On manhood's plain, his rightful place. 
 Who would to us judgment extend, 
 Thou badest, whether foe or friend, 
 "Judge not, from great heights climbed by some, 
 But by the depths from which we come! "
 Thou urged thy race its darkness shift 
 By sturdy labor and by thrift; 
 Thou showedst to it, its friends, its foes, 
 That in whom high ambition glows 
 No depth so deep but he will dive, 
 No heights, but where he may arrive; 
 Thus prove what others do, he can; — 
 So demonstrate himself a man. 
 Thy words, undying, with us live; 
 Thy precepts, inspiration give; 
 Thy earnest claim, " Negroes are men," 
 We still hold true as thou held then. 
 Some of this race which thou didst love, 
 For which with Titan effort strove, 
 Seek Progress by such devious ways 
 As have brought us on " Evil days." 
Oh, thou departed spirit, great, 
 If still familiar with its state 
 And hath influence in affairs, 
 See its sore needs and hear our prayers! 
 The need is, men or man who may 
 Meet the requirements of to-day, — 
 Command respect from every race, 
 Yet clog not our advancement's pace. 
 Oh, let thy wisdom's mantle fall 
 Upon some few if not on all, 
 That these may, then, true leaders be, — 
 Take up the work laid down by thee! 
 This do, and then again shall rise, 
 Like incense to the bending skies, — 
 The just spirit, humane intent, 
 Which once imbued the Government. 
 Oh, may the race for which thou wrought 
 Cling fast to what thy precepts taught, — 
 Inspire its children with the same, 
 And hold thee, Douglass, dear to fame! 
A MEMORY. 
 Pensive and silent 
 I oped the door, 
 And crossed with head bent 
 The library floor. 
 When, sudden, I struck, 
 With careless hand, 
 A book. Slow, I pluck 
 It from its stand. 
 I opened the book; 
 Within it lay 
 A flower which took 
 My breath away. 
 So quick did it cause 
 My heart to glow, 
 Setting, without pause, 
 My blood aflow, 
 That, swift as lightning, 
 Changed is the scene; — 
 Now am I ling' ring 
 In meadows green. 
 And with me is one, 
 Ah, misery sore! 
 Whom I wooed and won; 
 She lives no more. 
My thoughts quick cover 
 Those halcyon days, 
 O'er them all hover 
 Her tender ways. 
 Artless, yet graceful, 
 Blithesome, yet pure, 
 Whole-souled and thoughtful 
 Was my " Gwynore." 
 As the oasis, 
 In deserts, stands, 
 So is that brief bliss 
 'Mid my life's sands. 
 A THOUGHT SUGGESTED. 
 O maiden in whose bright brown eyes 
 A joyous, happy spirit lies; 
 O maiden crowned with midnight hair 
 That's oft caressed by envied air; 
 O maid with figure pliant, graceful, 
 To which thy gowns cling, dream-like, tasteful 
 O maiden whose queen-like motions 
 Rouse the mind to lofty notions — 
 Shed upon all a joyous cheer 
 And vivify the atmosphere; 
Know' st thou, when kindred spirits meet, 
 Though long unknown, they rush to greet 
 Each other as old friends; anew 
 They link for aye in friendship true? 
 Thus met, such souls with feelings deep 
 Form ties which each will ever keep 
 Through the whole life. In after years, 
 'Mid fleeting joys or cruel tears, 
 If they be near or far apart, 
 Each is shrined in the other's heart. 
 ANXIOUS, YET CONFIDING. 
 Has the parched land wanted refreshing dew? 
 Would the starving man take the crumbs, though 
 few? 
 Do men lost at midnight watch for the sun? 
 Is the soldier anxious till vict'ry 's won? 
 Does the dove, so lonesome, moan for its mate? 
 Is the lost child's mother keen for its prate? 
 Does the true maid wait her lover's return? 
 Do travelers belated go where lights burn? 
 All these, united, could not full express 
 The anxious desire, which brings me distress; 
 But together with this, an instinct true, 
 Shows you anxious for me, as I for you. 
TO WORK. 
 [To Capt. Newton Ferree, Chief of N. C. and C. Division, Register's 
 Office, Treasury Department, Washington, D. C] 
 Another year! And now to work! 
 Will any clerk his duty shirk? 
 On this point, friend, you need not fear, 
 For we have few shirkers here. 
 As some machine with well-oiled grooves 
 Runs silent, swift, so our work moves, 
 Directed by as fine a mind 
 As is possessed by all his kind. 
 Newton Ferree, sir, is the chief! 
 Would you believe it? 'Tis past belief, 
 That never with harsh, ungentle word, 
 Through all the year is his voice heard. 
 With firm, exact, yet kindly air, 
 His attitude to all is fair; 
 And should some one make mistake, 
 Such genial measures does he take 
 To rectify whatever's wrong, 
 By the correction they grow strong 
 To do whatever is required. 
 No better chief could be desired! 
NATURE AND FRIENDSHIP. 
 The silver moonbeams, struggling through the trees, 
 Pierce them, and cast o'er us waving shadows; 
 From the near river comes soft, cooling breeze, 
 Fragrant with sweet odor from the meadows. 
 Silent, enwrapt, enchanted by the scene, 
 Our feelings to portray, no words are found; 
 The hills, the fields, the woods so darkly green 
 L,end charms which beautify the scene around. 
 O, scene! Inspirer of the noblest thought, 
 Such as, expressed, do show our natures kin, 
 Where, friendship's bands more close 'round us are 
 brought, 
 When each speaks out the thoughts fast held within. 
 Such friends as find their nature in accord 
 Their thoughts to each with fullest freedom vent; 
 They heed not, most, what mere words may afford — 
 On fathoming the soul is each intent. 
 When thus engaged, time has for them no place; 
 Elysium's here; aught else is from them hurled; 
 Their converse is ambrosia to the taste; 
 Thus satisfied, they lose sight of the world. 
 Truths, smooth or rough, deflecting not their course, 
 Without reserve from friend by friend are heard; 
These purify, as wheat is purged of dross. 
 What more wholesome than the true, glowing 
 word? 
 What blessings are such mirrors to the soul, 
 Where, by us, may be seen our good or ill; 
 Such friendships make our shriveled nature whole, 
 And better fit us each his place to fill. 
 Amid the scenes of Nature, oft we find, 
 Drawn from our soul's deep-recess, all that's best; 
 When roused and drawn by Nature is the mind, 
 We, yielding to its influence, much are blessed. 
 Let friends who strive to bless each others' life 
 Leave, at times, the mart, — press the rustic sod; 
 There, together, from bustle and from strife 
 They grow more near to each, more close to God. 
 DISAPPOINTED. 
 I thought my highest hopes to realize, 
 As the great world, spread out before my eyes. 
 I earnestly entered life's mazy ways; 
 Desire for human good filled all my days. 
 But slowly and with pain I came to see 
 I had achieved naught, and old age finds me — 
 Disappointed! 
I loved, and well, a maid in early days. 
 Charmed was I, — enchanted by her sweet ways; 
 I thought that surely fate would make us one; 
 That knowing her, my life was but begun. 
 She proved untrue, who all my life did fill; 
 I found myself — the misery ' Lingers still ' — 
 Disappointed! 
 I thought among the Christian folks to go 
 (Since they're reputed happiest here below), 
 And see if, where contentment should abound, 
 A balm for my sore heart might there be found. 
 I sadly leave — (where charity should flow, 
 Like fierce wolves, each on each, the most do glow) — 
 Disappointed! 
 I next turn to the minister of God, — 
 The sacred mouth-piece for high heaven's Lord, 
 With hopes that from his well-inspired word 
 A thought to balm my wounds might there be heard. 
 I soon depart — for from the time he 'rose 
 He talked much, not of Christ, but his own woes) — 
 Disappointed! 
 Wandering, aimless, my feet led where they would, 
 Filled with such thoughts as did the heart no good. 
 I sudden stopped; for a sound struck my ear 
 As of a a voice, earnest, lifted in prayer: 
"Don bine's all woun's" — And, quick my heart 
 seems light; 
 To be longer — I see I have no right — 
 Disappointed! 
 From the night, when that earnest, broken prayer 
 Fell unexpected, soothing on my ear, 
 I have sought and found the path the Master trod, 
 Which leads from disappointments up to God. 
 There comes a time — this thought enthuses me — 
 When the Christ will not suffer me to be 
 Disappointed. 
 "SO I AM WEAK." 
 "So I am weak!" 
 Is the swift flowing river, deep and strong, 
 Its course unswerving, as it moves along 
 To bury itself in the ocean's deep, 
 Where alone it ceases its rapid sweep, 
 To be charged with weakness, because it seeks 
 That great heart, which, alone, rest to it speaks? 
 "So I am weak!"
 Is the volcanic lava, hurled from its rest, 
 Which falls again, molten, upon earth's breast; 
 Or the light spark, which will not be restrained 
 Till its element, ether, it has gained; 
 Must these be called weaklings, and sole because 
 They are moved, controlled by superior laws? 
 "So I am weak!" 
 Is the lark weak, which seeking, hears its mate, 
 Led by its trilling, wings swift to it, straight; 
 Or the sea, which lifts its face to the moon; 
 Or the flower whose sun sinks all too soon; — 
 If what controls them they seek or obey, 
 Must they be called weak? With such thoughts, 
 away! 
 "So I am weak!"
 Knowing the cause, would you charge me thus wrong? 
 The lion to all but its mate is strong. 
 If my soul be merged in — absorbed by you, 
 Discerns its mate, which instinctive it knew. 
 When thus moved, at times, your presence I seek, 
 Obeying love's laws, should I be deemed weak? 
 "So I am weak! " 
 Such weakness the world has ever obeyed; 
 Its resistless course no power has stayed; 
 It has caused to blossom the desert drear; 
 Has moved many men to a great career. 
 This master, so gentle, all hearts has schooled; 
 Though I be called weak, by it am I ruled. 
WELCOME TO CHRISTIAN WARRIORS. 
 The ancient writers many tales relate 
 Of Olympic Jove, how he sat in state, 
 Issuing decrees with an awful nod; 
 Such were the mythic concepts of a God! 
 They tell of how this God and brothers chased 
 From heaven their sire; themselves in his stead placed. 
 They portra}' how the giant Titanic race 
 Would make themselves gods and Jove displace, 
 And how the gods fled heaven in dire alarm, 
 Seeking, in varied shapes, safety from harm. 
 Another class of writers next we find, 
 Who speak about a God of different kind; 
 One, in essence, Spirit, of intent pure, 
 Whom heaven all and nature glad adore. 
 These, too, write of a time when heaven was rife 
 With discord; when Apollyon brought on strife, 
 Assuming it weak power which ruled in love, 
 Till God that power moved and him from heaven drove. 
 Next was heaven assailed, when men, much deranged, 
 Built Babel; presumptuous, their tongue was changed. 
 Another era dawns, when, not by storm, 
 Hosts, led by Him who assumed human form, 
 Shall the heavens ascend and conquerors be — 
 Walk the golden streets, tread the glassy sea, 
Wave victorious palms, worship heaven's L,ord 
 And strike their harps of gold to Him adored. 
 These hosts are gathering on terrestrial plain, 
 Fitting themselves, celestial heights to gain. 
 Filled with a hope which they would have all share 
 They bid others " Come" — call them to draw near 
 And listen to the stories which they tell 
 Of their great leader " Who doeth all things well," 
 Full conscious if His virtues be made known 
 All people will Him as their leader own. 
 Moved by this idea, they gather in clans, 
 Discuss the way, the how, adopt varied plans. 
 Though the plans may differ the end to reach, 
 All the same truth tell, the same story teach. 
 Thus we gather here for that purpose grand, 
 A greater than which engages not the land; 
 Which purpose contemplates gathering the world 
 Around Emanuel's standard, long unfurled, 
 Under which who fights will sustain no loss, 
 For it displays our leader's sign — the cross. 
 That cross which stood on Calvary's mount, 
 Which pierced the earth and oped salvation's fount, 
 Which by His enemies in scorn was raised, 
 Yet by the whole world destined to be praised. 
 Our victory will be won; the battle o'er 
 When sin shall be disarmed — can fight no more; 
 When this is accomplished, then at Christ's name 
 "Every knee shall bow," all hearts beat the same. 
This must be brought about by earnest work, 
 Hence none must loiter, none his duty shirk, 
 Nor fear the darts which oft are at us hurled, 
 But march in faith — our conquest is the world; 
 Let courage fill your hearts, comrades in arms, 
 Brave, faithful, true; drawn by our leader's charms, 
 Determined by His ensign to stand fast 
 And fight the fight of faith until at last 
 The devil and his host shall all be bound, 
 And "Victory "the trump of God shall sound 
 As we, triumphant, tread the happy shore 
 Where Christ our Great Leader reigns evermore. 
 MUTATION. 
 An acorn fell upon the earth, 
 Unnoted by what gave it birth; 
 On it there fell the rain, the snow, 
 And pressed it far the turf below. 
 But in its shell a life-like germ 
 Bade it "Awake; take root; stand firm 
 This done, it rears a stately form 
 Which stands and battles with the storm. 
 The vapor, drawn high by the sun, 
 The ether's bosom floats upon; 
It looks down, sees the drooping grain, 
 Revives it in the form of rain. 
 Its use is o'er, so it would seem — 
 But lo, it forms the purling stream, 
 Rushes on with ceaseless motion, 
 And helps swell the mighty ocean. 
 14 Build not thy house upon the sand, 
 For on it nothing safe can stand! " 
 This thought would all sand's worth decry 
 And doom it useless, aye, to lie; 
 But of these grains the mountains are; 
 As glass they pierce the skies afar; 
 Through them we other worlds descry, 
 And sweep at will the azure sky. 
 Look at the history of man, 
 And all his changeful progress scan. 
 From primal stage he makes his way, 
 And turns night to electric day. 
 He ploughs the ocean with his mind, 
 His will outstrips the rushing wind, 
 He starts dead objects into life — 
 The busy world with change is rife. 
 Fair Greece, far-famed, to pieces goes, 
 A robber band to greatness grows; 
 That Roman race which ruled the world 
 Is from its high pedestal hurled — 
The high brought low, the low raised high, 
 What was held true we now deny. 
 Such constant change does time afford 
 As man grows more like unto God. 
 We chain the lightning, bind the steam, 
 We sterilize where microbes teem, 
 We trace the wind, forecast the gale, 
 Cause rocks to tell a liquid tale; 
 At will, a motion or a word 
 A thousand miles is seen or heard; 
 Anon, we will with angels vie. 
 We mount the air! We sail! We fly! 
 With age the world is growing wise — 
 No thinker e'er this truth denies — 
 And as it grows no man or race 
 Can tell what men shall fill their place; 
 Hence all should shape their actions so 
 That "The Unborn "might proudly know 
 The seed which their foresires have sown 
 Leaves naught for them to grieve, atone. 
 CHANGELESS. 
 Though heaven is with turmoil rife 
 When proud Appollyon brings on strife; 
 Though rebel hosts from thence are thrown 
 By Him, whose rule they will not own; 
Though thus cast out, 't is not in hate 
 They are hurled from their high estate; 
 Though they from Him themselves estrange, 
 The love of God it doth not change. 
 When wicked men pollute the skies, 
 Making their sins for incense rise; 
 When all the world is gone astray, 
 And no gift on God's altar lay; 
 When humankind all lust for blood, 
 And thus bring the o'erwhelming flood; 
 Though sunk is vale and mountain range, 
 The love of God it doth not change. 
 When from the ark the rescued came 
 (With fowl and wild beast, now grown tame), 
 Give thanks that they are saved from wrath, 
 And seek to know God's will, his path; 
 When, with the " tower on the plain," 
 Men seek high heaven thus to gain; 
 Though foiled are they by tongue-like mange, 
 The love of God it doth not change. 
 When o'er the earth the nations grew 
 Great numbers from archaic few, 
 Progressing then from state to state, 
 From simple folks becoming great; 
 When war and carnage sweep the earth, 
 Bringing dread pestilence and dearth; 
Though men suffer in town and grange, 
 The love of God it doth not change. 
 Though races press each other down 
 Till life seems but an angry frown, 
 Though each of ills must have its taste, 
 These will to better things give place; 
 So, from a slave, there Joseph stood, 
 To do his starving family good; 
 Though hate men do for love exchange, 
 The love of God it doth not change. 
 When the globe, by earthquake shaken, 
 On its face new looks has taken, 
 Or mountains high are cast down low, 
 And on some mound their heights bestow; 
 When mid-day sun swift takes its flight, 
 And plunges all the world in night, 
 God's laws they fill and none derange; 
 The love of God it doth not change. 
 Then why should man, of God a part, 
 Iyike Him in mind, of conscious heart, 
 Be unlike Him amid life's throng, 
 Where constant struggles right with wrong? 
 Why not the heart, strong, fixed with love, 
 Be steadfast, like to His above? 
 Be with this truth no longer strange; 
 The love of God it doth not change! 
THINGS INSIGNIFICANT. 
 A lion strong held in his claws, 
 Ready to crunch with massive jaws, 
 A small mouse which could scarce be seen; 
 Though tiny, yet its teeth were keen. 
 Said the mouse: " O, lion, do be kind; 
 vSpare my life and I will try to find 
 Some way to repay your kindness, 
 And may serve you when in distress." 
 The lion great, the mouse so small, 
 This plea did but for laughter call. 
 The king, amused, roars out, " Ha, ha|! " 
 His thunder-like mirth sounded far. 
 The lion, sudden, thought he would 
 Give it life and see if it could 
 Be faithful and serve him some day. 
 Thus freed, mousie scampered away. 
 Near where the lion made his den 
 A trap was set by wily men, 
 Who entangled him in a net. 
 Naught could he do but fume and fret. 
 vSoon a mouse, while quick going by, 
 The ensnared lion did espy. 
 It was the mouse whose life he gave; 
 It stops and seeks its friend to save. 
 Now gnawing swift, with all its strength, 
 It makes the ropes give way at length. 
The lion rose, shook himself free, 
 And thanked the mouse on bended knee. 
 Thus the valueless little thing 
 Did service for the beasts' great king. 
 The story which this tale would tell 
 Is one that all should digest well. 
 However humble, hence, the wight, 
 Treat him well if his heart be right; 
 He may some good turn for you serve, 
 With honest heart and fearless nerve. 
 An acorn planted by a child, 
 Playing with joyous glee, though wild, 
 Yet would not crush it with his tread, 
 May spread cool shade o'er his gray head. 
 Stop not waters that may issue 
 Slowly from some rocky tissue, 
 For its trickling in time of drouth 
 May bring relief to some parched mouth. 
 Quench not what soul may be inspired 
 By careless interest as though tired, 
 For that soul which you would thus treat 
 The world in time may rush to greet. 
 Know the good we do while living 
 Consists not in money giving: 
 A kindly smile, a look, a word, 
 May rouse what else might ne'er be stirred. 
UNITY OF LIFE AND HOPE. 
 Every rustling wind that bestirs the air, 
 Every bright ray that shoots down from the sun, 
 Is laden with misery and despair, — 
 Or so each seems to the despondent one. 
 When erstwhile hopes are crushed at one fell blow, 
 Then blackest shadows on the vista spread. 
 Let not the untried assume to know 
 Such feelings — they are are known but by the dead! 
 For with the death of hope, life takes its way! 
 The one doth scorn the other to outlive; 
 For, equal-born, close-bound, twin sisters, they 
 Seldom woes, but equal blessings, give. 
 When hope is, ruthless, torn from out the soul, 
 And leaves beside its mate an aching void, 
 Life beats its wings to go, no longer whole, 
 Free from the prison where it is but cloyed. 
 Full natural is this. When hope is dead, 
 Extracted is the vital spark from life; 
 Then, hopeless, life doth helpless bow its head, 
 Despairing, wing its way from earthly strife! 
HEEDLESS. 
 The people moved careless and gay 
 During the days when Noah wrought; 
 All heedless went their downward way, 
 Nor would be, by his preaching, taught. 
 So when the skies grew overcast 
 They helpless in wonderment sate. 
 Frenzied, they would redeem the past, 
 But their effort came, ah, too late! 
 The suitors in Ulysses' hall, 
 With lustful riot, strife and song, 
 All heedless of high honor's call 
 They recked not him who wandered long; 
 So pending doom its victim seeks 
 And soon in wrath upon them fell; 
 While laughter's tears bedewed their cheeks, 
 Swift is each soul launched into hell. 
 Belshazzar and his feasting horde 
 The sacred things of God pollute, 
 All heedless of the prophet's word 
 And what their actions constitute. 
 Hence, soon among the bestial kind 
 The king, self-lauded, ruminates; 
 Oblivious manhood shrouds a mind 
 Unmindful of what God dictates. 
These three examples serve to show 
 To all who have what they should prize, 
 That by some process, swift or slow, 
 They lose what's viewed with careless eyes. 
 L,et people who possess the boon 
 Of liberty heed this advice; 
 Close guard it morning, night and noon, 
 "Eternal vigilance" is its price. 
 Who regard not this precept true, 
 All heedless of the great safeguard, 
 Will live their negligence to rue — 
 By their own acts their race retard. 
 Then why, O men, do ye neglect 
 To watch with careful zeal your right? 
 Verbose freedom gets no respect — 
 Your liberty must yield to might. 
 By heed the world might have been saved, 
 Belshazzar 'scaped his bestial state, 
 The suitors secured what they craved, 
 But in each case heed came too late. 
 Then ye whose rights are now at stake, 
 Whose liberty near wears the pall, 
 From your lethargic sleep awake — 
 Respond ye to the Council's call! 
  
THEE! 
 Though lightnings flash and thunders roll, 
 Shaking the earth from pole to pole, 
 As if all nature warred in wrath, 
 Yet would I turn not from the path 
 Which led to thee. 
 Though dread pestilence crowd the air 
 And paint on each face horror, fear, 
 And though "Pale Death "holds sway supreme, 
 I'd pass them by, as though a dream, 
 To get to thee. 
 Though dire conditions, stern, severe, 
 Should, far, our lives succeed to tear, 
 Aye, should all these and more conspire, 
 I'd break through them or human ire 
 And come to thee. 
 But now with anxious heart I wait, 
 From early hour until late. 
 The sky with clouds grows overcast, 
 It rains; sighing, I leave at last, 
 And think of thee. 
 I think of thee, and why not this, 
 Since thoughts of thee alone are bliss; 
 Yes, dear, thou art my life, my all; 
 Without thee glad would be Death's call. 
 I live for thee. 
But why should this thought intervene, 
 When life is joy, all nature green? 
 Yes, sweet, some day we'll happy be, 
 And I — this thought gives joy to me — 
 Will live with thee. 
 OUR LAST TRIBUNE. 
 Respectfully dedicated to Hon. George H. White, ex-M. C. 
 As stood Rienzi, the last hope of Rome, 
 Thund'ring 'gainst the ills which engulfed his home, 
 Telling with zeal and force the sad story 
 Of his loved land, of its faded glory; 
 So with earnest mien, with embronzed face, 
 Speaks out this man for millions of his race. 
 Wrapped is the hall in silence, chained each sense, 
 Save that of hearing, which, alert, intense, 
 Paints on each face a look expectant, keen; 
 A listening atmosphere pervades the scene. 
 The hall, a work of art, historic, grand, 
 Where what is done may curse or bless the land, 
 Lends to the scene a dignity profound, 
 Which overhangs, envelops all around. 
 As the dead calm before a storm prevails, 
 When still stands the ship, listless hang the sails, 
Anxious for the wind that some power gives, 
 Which wakes the ship to move as though she lives, 
 So the people listened, stilled by some spell, 
 To our Last Tribune pronounce his farewell. 
 Have you seen, ever, from Canadian shore 
 The mighty falls where rushing waters pour, 
 Where, from seething depths, misty rainbows rise, 
 And stood enthralled with fixed, entranced eyes? 
 So hung the throng upon his every word, 
 Naught but his thrilling tones could there be heard. 
 His manly form dilated with his theme, 
 With crystal thought his words, refulgent, teem. 
 The foeman's armor his keen wit attacks, 
 His logic shows what his opponent lacks; 
 He speaks not of his country's many laws, 
 Nor yet speaks he to gain his friends' applause. 
 For four long years his people has he served 
 And gained their full trust — this his course deserved. 
 During this time he battled with the strong 
 To uphold the right, to defeat the wrong. 
 On matters of great import to the state 
 He sat in council, helped to legislate; 
 But now — Ah, now the wicked have prevailed, 
 The ground whereon he stood have they assailed. 
As did those demons who blew up the Maine, 
 So these their undermining purpose gain. 
 Hence, not again for years, lest time relent, 
 Will Negro men their people represent. 
 With thoughts of this fact sweeping o'er the mind, 
 Keen to hear his speech all ears are inclined. 
 He gives a brief descant upon "The Bill " 
 Which all the farmers' needs professed to fill, 
 Then aptly turns he, with consummate art, 
 To Human Rights, held dearest to his heart. 
 Great thoughts, grand words from his deep chest arise, 
 The greatness of his cause flashed from his eyes. 
 Gestures few, but decorous graced the whole, 
 As he, "The Race's Defense," poured out his soul; 
 Poured out his soul, but not in servile tears, 
 Deplores the times, but not with cringing fears, 
 Portrays the deeds, the work his race has wrought, 
 Tells how their freedom, how their rights were bought, 
 Shows how they strive to lift oppression's weight, 
 How, " Phoenix-like,"they rise, though crushed by 
 fate: 
 He prophesies, and well, "Some future day 
 Will find my race on manhood's plain to stay." 
 Demosthenes, who thundered 'gainst the foe, 
 Nor Cicero, who all things seemed to know, 
Nor the great Webster, speaking at his best, 
 Nor Clay nor Calhoun, who our language blessed, 
 E'er spoke with more effect or greater force 
 Than our Tribune in this his last discourse. 
 Full oft the unconscious tear bedews the cheek, 
 Full oft, to him, our assent would we speak. 
 As does the mammoth forest bend to earth, 
 And bowing thus, proclaim iEolus' worth, 
 As does the frigid earth burst forth in flower, 
 And thus yield homage, due, to Phoebus' power, 
 So does the throng pay tribute to that speech 
 Which Human Rights 'twixt man and man would 
 teach. 
 As does good seed, by faithful sower cast, 
 Bring forth rich harvests, though his life be past, 
 So will his words, nursed in Columbia's breast, 
 Evoke deeds to relieve the sore distressed. 
 Though of Congressional honors he be shorn, 
 Long may his life the civil sphere adorn; 
 Long may his counsel mark, direct the way, 
 Through which his race may find " The brighter 
 day." 
THE AMERICAN NEGRO. 
 Was Webster and was Whittier wrong 
 When one in speech and one in song 
 Told brave deeds by the Negro done 
 Or his qualities dwelt upon? 
 Phyllis Wheatley, Afric's daughter, 
 Trained by the good soul who bought her, 
 Was nobly praised by Washington 
 When her work he had looked upon. 
 Banneker, who, we understand, 
 The first time-piece makes in the land, 
 The " Dixie Line," with others lays, 
 From Jefferson evoked great praise. 
 At Valley Forge or Bunker Hill, 
 Where Liberty's hopes all hearts thrill, 
 On land or sea or on the lakes, 
 A warrior's place the Negro takes. 
 In after years, 'mid fire and smoke, 
 Where cruel, belching cannon spoke, 
 He bears his part nor shuns the fray, 
 Though " Hell incarnate" bars the way. 
 Inspired by freedom, firm he gripes 
 His gun, defends the " Stars and Stripes " 
 Yet while he fights his brother keeps 
 Guard while his foeman's family sleeps. 
His trust in neither case betrays, 
Himself in each a man displays, 
 When from false tongues this thought did roll 
 "The Negro is without a soul." 
 He shows this lie to be untrue 
 By doing just what others do. 
 'T was said: "With freedom he will die,  
 He can't survive or with us vie." 
 Instead, ten millions have we grown, 
 And this a fallacy have shown. 
 "The Negro will deteriorate 
 And soon return to savage state."
 So did our foes most sanguine tell; 
 Facts old and new such thoughts dispel 
 From the state where freedom found us, 
 From the mental night which bound us. 
 Three millions whence ignorance frowned 
 Have now the light of knowledge found. 
 These Negroes, thought to be but fools, 
 Have grasped the prize in varied schools. 
 Some shove the plane or ply the forge, 
 The railroads lay through mountain gorge. 
 In each field where we are allowed 
 Our work dispels the adverse cloud. 
We know the strength of every race 
 Grows from the workman's steady pace; 
 Yet some fill pulpits or plead law, 
 Or pains from beracked bodies draw. 
 A few aspire to higher arts, 
 And Dunbar's verses touch all hearts; 
 Still some would show to human eyes 
 Their soul, and Tanner wins the prize. 
 Touched by such art as moved the Greek, 
 Lewis near makes the stone to speak. 
 Forgetful of the centuries past, 
 Some expect us to rise too fast. 
 Not from the heights attained by some, 
 But " By the depths whence we have come," 
 Justly compare our worst and best; 
 Thus judged, we shrink not from the test. 
 We know we share that wondrous love 
 Which emanates from God above; 
 At noble thoughts our soul-bells chime, 
 With them our beating pulse keeps time. 
 The nation's weal we have at heart, 
 In all her conflicts play our part, 
 And never has the traitor's stain 
 On the brow of a black man lain. 
Though so evident our progress, 
 Our foes on these things lay no stress, 
 Notwithstanding what we have shown, 
 The like of which was never known. 
 Still in our land such men are found 
 As in whom evil thoughts abound, 
 Who say, "That under each black skin, 
 When scratched, a savage lurks within." 
 Yet, in spite of such aspersions, 
 Such unfounded, false assertions, 
 We form a part of the Nation; 
 Are also heirs of salvation. 
 No part could we have in Christ's plan, 
 Lacking what constitutes a man. 
 When the Creator made man whole 
 He breathed himself into his soul. 
 Hence shape, nor hair, nor tint of skin 
 Distorts or mars the soul within; 
 Therefore, it is as men we try 
 To acquire what is useful, high. 
 Discarding not such humbler art 
 As will strength to the race impart, 
 But would develop hand, as soul, 
 Thus be an entire man and whole. 
In order thus to grow, thriving, 
 Let us not keep oft reviving 
 The ills which we have undergone, 
 Nor hope by "others to be borne." 
 Follow not the hot-head leaders 
 Who, like leeches, are but bleeders; 
 They rant and howl and " saw the air," 
 Making our trials more hard to bear. 
 Make friends of neighbors, with them work 
 This does not mean to cringe or smirk. 
 In all business fill well your place, 
 Such things alone will lift the race. 
 Let none fear that we shall invade 
 Against their social barricade, 
 Nor think we seek to dominate 
 Folks unwilling in any state. 
 All we ask is that we may draw 
 Free breath of "Liberty and law T , "
 Have equal chance in life's great race, 
 Fill, as Americans, our place. 
 My countrymen, be fair and just, 
 Betray ye not the "Founder's " trust 
 That all may, who our banner see, 
 Know it floats o'er "The brave and free"! 
THE DYING YEAR. 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 Thy days, hours and minutes, flying, 
 As though beyond the ether's height, 
 Where heaven's glory dispels night, 
 Or to infernal shades below, 
 From us in haste thou'dst gladly go. 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying 
 (Think me not officious, prying); 
 But why, Old Year, as if in fright, 
 Shouldst thou seek to evade our sight? 
 Thy life is open; all may read 
 What thou hast suffered, what thy deed. 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 But why this deep and woeful sighing, 
 As if with grief thy heart were broken? 
 May not the cause to me be spoken? 
 Is thy heart now racked with pain 
 Because thy life seems spent in vain? 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 Go not as though sad, descrying 
 With heavy and despondent mien, 
 Shores where thy foresires all are seen; 
 Faithful thou'st been, fear not thy fate, 
 Let "duty done" thy heart elate. 
Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 Thy passing hours men's souls are trying. 
 Thou'st served them well — early and late 
 Shown them a higher, better state; 
 Thou hast against all vices frowned 
 And Virtue's brow with laurel crowned. 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 Send thou forth glad sounds, not crying, 
 For much good in thy time thou'st wrought, 
 Relief to many souls thou'st brought. 
 In thy decline, let this impart 
 Strength to thy frame, joy to thy heart. 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 Justly on thy past relying, 
 Thou goest now with stately tread 
 To be soon numbered with the dead. 
 All bow to thee with homage due 
 For the life thou'st lived, noble, true. 
 Old Year, thou art swiftly dying; 
 Thy end nears, there 's no denying. 
 My heart is full, — I drop a tear, — 
 For much I loved thee, dear Old Year; 
 Thy noble deeds will hist'ry swell: 
 Old Year, farewell! Old Year, farewell! 
SOUTHERN CHIVALRY. 
 Chivalry becomes but an empty sound 
 Whenever in language to Southern bound. 
 Ah, that a people should degenerate so 
 That their foresires' spirits would shame to know! 
 There was a time when this land, at its best, 
 Had men who obeyed Chivalry's behest; 
 Their manners, though proud, were wholesome, 
 refined, 
 Though they held slaves, they were brave, gentle, 
 kind. 
 So well was their chivalrous spirit known, 
 For their system of life it did much atone. 
 Since those days, when in the Southland were born 
 Men who chivalry as their country adorn, 
 A race of giant pigmies is grown instead, 
 With strange thoughts of Chivalry in their head. 
 Now look with me at some of the matters 
 Which send their chivalry to rags and tatters. 
 Claiming their women's good virtue to shield, 
 With guns, dogs and ropes they swift go afield. 
 A figure ahead, roused by the noise, 
 Iooks back. Affrighted at dogs, men and boys, 
 Instinctive, he seeks to get out their way. 
 The last fatal act he performs for aye! 
The movement excites, rouses, draws the crowd, 
 The welkin now rings with oaths quick and loud. 
 Soon they catch and bring the poor man to the ground 
 All panting, frightened and bleeding. He's bound 
 Hand and foot with ropes cruel men provide; 
 Hate blinds judgment, soon to a tree he's tied. 
 Knowing well his doom, he shouts out, distressed. 
 Southern Chivalry cries out, " He's confessed!" 
 Confessed to what? He undeserved his fate 
 They soon find, but the knowledge comes too late. 
 When some patriot this crime would reprove, 
 Kach murderer his alibi can prove. 
 A Negro speaks his mind on what's amiss, 
 He's hounded down by mobs and lynched for this. 
 One does a murder, 'nother steals a pin, 
 One falls against some man and barks his shin; 
 Quick, Southern Chivalry is up in arms, 
 The atmosphere is rife with dire alarms. 
 Though courts are open and for justice stand, 
 These men must be tried by Chivalry's hand. 
 Soon, poor men, strung up to a near-by tree, 
 Untried, not found guilty, there die all three. 
 If later a sign of life is discerned, 
 Chivalry waxes furious; they're burned. 
O, Southland! O, Southland! Why be thus blamed? 
 O, land of my birth, of thee I'm ashamed. 
 What blessing canst thou expect to obtain, 
 If continued, such crimes thy 'scutcheon stain? 
 Know that such crimes two-edged swords surely are, 
 Thy children embrute, their characters mar. 
 O stop them! O stop them! Swift in their course 
 Let law be obeyed and courts thy resource; 
 Thus rid this reproach for aye from thy name, 
 That the South may shine with untarnished fame. 
 FRIENDSHIP. 
 Poets have sung of love's great power 
 From morning unto evening hour, 
 Have sung of hate, black as the night, 
 Whose very atmosphere breeds blight. 
 Love to its object fain would cling, 
 Hate its object to hades fling. 
 Both are emotions of the soul, 
 One we abhor and one extol. 
 I care not for absorbing love, 
 Save that which draws the thoughts above. 
 From too great love or hate for aye 
 May kind Providence pass me by. 
But friendship true, I e'er aver, 
 Though uo great passion it doth stir, 
 Is of far more use to mankind 
 Than what inflates or dwarfs the mind. 
 For do you know I deem, by far, 
 More strong than other feelings are, 
 The fast tie with which friendships bind 
 Man to man with constant mind. 
 Such friendships, hence, I cultivate — 
 In their possession feel elate. 
 The friend whose heartbeats keen I feel 
 I'd bind to me with bands of steel. 
 Whene'er such mutual friendship's broken, 
 There need be no expressed token; 
 For kindred spirits soon will know 
 If aught 's amiss — it's ordained so. 
 PROGRESSION'S APPEAL. 
 When to Columbia's virgin shore 
 Adventurous souls from England came, 
 The Puritans, brave hearts, came o'er 
 Where spirits quenched might burn and flame. 
 These pioneers, so hardy-souled, 
 Through ills of wood and Indian brave, 
 With hearts determined, zealous, bold, 
 Accomplished what their spirits crave. 
 Atlantic's shore soon teemed with life, 
 Crude governments protection gave. 
 These earnest souls, inured to strife, 
 Could ill brook deeds which marked them "Slave.' 
 Then gathering in "Confederate band, "
 Oppression's insults gave the cause, 
 For mutual aid they take a stand 
 'Gainst England's many unjust laws. 
 With blood, these patriots bought release, 
 Then, high-resolved, seek home once more, 
 Engage again in arts of peace; 
 Their hearts elate, the conflict o'er. 
 Now taught by "Times" the need of strength, 
 Drawn closer by that zealous band 
 Whose guidance led through war's drear length, 
 They form a nation, stable, grand. 
 Generous meed their plans adorn, 
 The State, well built, moves on amain; 
 But in its midst a system's born 
 To wring Columbia's heart with pain. 
 This system, grown like vampire dread, 
 Now seeks from fair Columbia's heart 
 The blood once rich, no longer red — 
 Makes wrath which rends the land apart. 
Thus reft apart, " Grirn-visaged war " 
 Inspires all hearts to martial strife; 
 The conflict hangs at equal par 
 Till erstwhile slaves lay down their life. 
 Some power thundered in their soul: 
 "|Who would be free must strike the blow! "
 Sweet liberty their tongues extol, 
 Its influence makes their prowess grow. 
 Such deeds of valor are performed 
 By those whose manhood is at stake, 
 In routing foes or strongholds stormed 
 That Union reigns from Gulf to Lake. 
 From discord's ashes now, the land 
 For conquest new, fresh impulse takes; 
 The North and South march hand in hand 
 To music new industry makes. 
 On purposes of peace intent 
 The calm serenity is broke, 
 Our neighbors near, by misery bent, 
 Pray us relief from Spanish yoke. 
 Straightway our brave sons fly to arms 
 (Wrought up by Spain's inhuman wrongs), 
 From desk, from bench, from towns, from farms, 
 And misery turn to joy and songs. 
 New deeds of glory now are ours; 
 At Luzon's shore, on Cuba's isle, 
 oth Black and White help show our powers 
 By army and by navy wile. 
 As was the case in early days, 
 There Attucks 'mong the first to fall; 
 So where Death, Bagley's daring stays, 
 Lies Tunnell pierced by Spanish ball. 
 Where Santiago stands in view, 
 When men, like leaves, on San Juan fell, 
 The Negro troops, brave, loyal, true, 
 Fought on through what seemed ' 'Ambushed hell." 
 Our victories on every field 
 Bring Spain's defeat, her fightings cease; 
 Where she her cruel power did wield 
 Columbia rules and all is peace. 
 By deeds great strength we've shown without; 
 Let's turn our minds to ills within: 
 Put lynchings, heinous crimes, to rout 
 With righteous indignation's din. 
 Let press and pulpit lead the van, 
 These cancerous crimes to extirpate, 
 And sentiment will find some plan 
 To purge the land, enhance the state. 
 O land which our affections claim, 
 Whose aims "The Fathers "well defined, 
 Let justice deal with all, the same, 
 Accomplish thou what God designed. 
Columbia grand, adorned with might, 
 Shall not our banner stainless stream? 
 My countrymen, dare do the right, 
 Let law and order reign supreme! 
 A CHANGE OF MIND. 
 Take off that shirt! "the overseer said, 
 The bull-whip twirling over Henry's head. 
 The slave obeyed him at unwilling pace; 
 Rage, disgust, excitement, convulsed his face. 
 He was a fine, strong man of negro race, 
 No better man than he on all the place; 
 His master and family liked him well — 
 Quaint stories did he to the children tell. 
 An overseer from New England came, 
 Since which time his life had not been the same, 
 For this new man'seenied to take great delight 
 In bull-whipping Henry with all his might. 
 Henry, who stammered, said to the oldest boy, 
 For whom he had made many a childish toy: 
 " Wh-wh-what f-f-for d-d-de n-n-new b-b-boss 
 b-b-beat s-s-so m-m-uch on m-m-me? 
 I d-d-doan d-d-do n-n-nawthin' wr-wr-ong, as 
 • y-y-you k-k-kin s-s-see." 
  
This fact, long unknown, raised the young lad's ire; 
 His young face flushed, his eyes flashed angry fire. 
 "Henry, if that mongrel beats you again 
 Fasten yourselves up like pigs in a pen, 
 Then wallop him within an inch of life — 
 I'll say a word to pa about the strife." 
 Young master's plan Henry thought he would try, 
 And in his room laid nails and hammer by. 
 So, now, when he had taken off his shirt, 
 He quickly picked two long nails from out the dirt, 
 The hammer, too; and then he crossed the floor, 
 Where first he nailed the window, next the door. 
 What is that for? " the overseer cried, 
 Tremblingly looking from slave to cowhide. 
 Says Henry: "I t-t-ell y-y-you w-w-what ise er- 
 er-bout — D-d-dat s-s-so y-y-you an' s-s-sos I, k-k-kaint g-g-git out!" 
 "Open that door!" cried the overseer, pale, 
 His bull-whip dropping; and he swift set sail 
 When stammering Henry opened up the way, 
 Nor again was Henry whipped from that day.

 My Brother GARLAND, 
 THIS BOOK IS (without HIS PERMISSION) 
 BY THE AUTHOR, 
 WHO OWES MORE THAN HE CAN EVER ACKNOWLEDGE 
 OR FORGET 
 To His Brotherly Kindness. 
INTRODUCTION. 
 I hereby present to the public, this little volume of poems entitled "Eclioes of Spring." In it I have endeavored to comply with the special request of the readers, of my firstling,  "Morning Songs, " by deviating here and there with a love ballad, or a humorous selection, in my little volume. I hope this will prove satisfactory to my readers. 
 THE AUTHOR. 
Eohoes of Spring. 
 A MORNING SCENE, 
 Did you ever wake at morning, 
 When the sun is shining bright; 
 Look upon the great horizon, 
 And behold a wondrous sight? 
 *Tis a picture men's been trying, 
 Centuries on centuries past; 
 No — no tongue can e'er describe it, 
 Nor no brush complete the task. 
 'Tis a picture far more greater. 
 Than an artist ever drew ; 
 Azure sky and golden sunshine- 
 Grass with diamond-jeweleddew. 
 Oft the old bards hath attempted, 
 And the Mnse with sighs and tears, 
 Turned away too deep for utterance, 
 Lost to whisper in their ears. 
 And the artistes together, 
 Gaze with rapturous eyes so long; 
 One desires to paint the picture, 
 One desires to sing the song. 
 But the hand of great Jehovah, 
 Paints the scene that meets man's^ye. 
 Mingled with gold tinted sunlight, 
 And the azure in the sky. 
 So man gaze at early morning, 
 With perplexing puzzled frown; 
 And his mind lacks understanding, 
 As the golden sun goes down. 
 TO HELEN. 
 Oh rtelen! thou art passing fair, 
 With locks of sable hue; 
 So glossy is thv curly hair, 
 Surpass thy beauty few. 
 Thy smile is like a rainbow tint 
 That lights the sky above; 
 Deep in my heart hast Cupid sent, 
 A shaft, dipped deep with love. 
 I look upon thy dark brown face. 
 Thy laughing eyes I see; 
 Could I with gifted power but trace, 
 Thy love in store for me! 
 Oh Helen! thou art passing fair, 
 Thuu oft hast heard me sigh; 
 From wou tided love in deep dispair. 
 Of thee, heard no reply. 
 Turn not with modest smiles away, 
 Thou little timid dove; 
 But list unto my plea this day, 
 And hear my song of love. 
 A SERENADE. 
 Come, open the window, 
 My sweet dusky maid! 
 And list to my singing, 
 A love serenade! 
 A love serenade! J 
 There's music and love, 
 Afloat in the air, 
 'Tis all on account, 
 Of a damsel so fair; 
 A damsel so fair. 
 My harp is in tune, 
 And my hand is in plight, 
 But my love-sick heart, 
 Is a burden to night, 
 A burden to night. 
 Oh! list to my ditty, 
 'My beautiful Grace, 
 And show me once more, 
 A smile on thy face, 
 A smile on thy face. 
 And oh! what a blessing, 
 Of joy it would be, 
 If some day you'd open, 
 Your heart unto me, 
 Your heart unto me. 
 I'd sini^ like the song-birds, 
 'Mong blossoms of June, 
 A ballad of love 
 To a livelier tune, 
 A livelier tune. 
 BYGONE DAYS. 
 Looking far baf:k to my child-hood's day, 
 As the river of time drifts by, 
 When my infant hands, found nothing 
 but play, 
 A tear-drop oft rise to my eye. 
 And I say, **Oh time, thou art drifting^ 
 so fast! 
 My bark down the stream swiftly glide, 
 For short, short, it seems though long 
 it has been ; 
 Since my bark was first launched in the tide.' 
 And since my afloat down the river of time. 
 My days all commingled have been; 
 The sun has shone down, a light from his 
 crown, 
 And the storm-winds have fallen with rain. 
 And the lightning hath flashed, 
 And the thunder hath roared, 
 Like a hungry lion in lair; 
 And the white sails out-spread of my bark 
 over head, 
 Hath yielded her wings to the air. 
 To music and song, my bark drifts along, 
 Her banners afloat on the j^^e; 
 I oft list the cry, of the curlews in sky, 
 While fast drift my bark do.vn the vale. 
 When the weather is fair^and balmy the air, 
 A sweet breath arise on the breeze- 
 From flowers in bloom, a wholesome perfume, 
 And bright is the hue of the leaves. 
 So short is my stay! by night and by day, 
 I leave rapturous scenes far behind ; 
 While my bark rides the wave, like a war- 
 rior brave, 
 With banners afloat on the wind. 
 So I yield to my fate, with composure I 'U 
 wait, 
 View each scene that my bark drifts me by; 
 So fast down the tide, in my bark I will ride, 
 To that Land where our tears shall be dried. 
 TALE OF THE WIND. 
 Wind upon thy reckless travel, 
 Blowing rubbish to and fro, 
 Bearins^ dust, and sand, and gravel 
 Whence thou come and where thou go? 
 Oft I've heard tliee on thy pinions, 
 Like the mighty thunder's roar; 
 Saw huge trees 'neath thy dominions 
 Fall to earth, exist no more. 
 Thou dost reign upon the mountain, 
 On the ocean vast and deep; 
 Cools the brooklet, cools the fountain, 
 Fans the wild flowers in their sleep. 
 Pause awhile, kind wind, and tell me, 
 From what source thou comest, oh where? 
 In my song I'll e'er commend thee, 
 Oh, thou Monarch of the Air! 
 And the wind in martial measure, 
 Howling fiercely with a gale. 
 Thrilled my soul with fearful pleasure. 
 As he sang to me, this tale. 
 The Tale. 
 By unknown ways I come to man, 
 On crystal wings I fly ; ; 
 I make a tour through all the land. 
 And through the cloudy sky. 
 Still, still, I hold my secret dear, 
 O' er which men marvel so. 
 For whence I come, and what I am, 
 No mortal man shall know. 
 Sometimes with zephyrs soft and calm, 
 sometimes with breezes warm; 
 Sometimes midst fragrance from the balm, 
 Sometimes a raging storm. 
 Still, still, I hold the secret dear. 
 O'er which men marvel so, 
 For whence I come, and what I am. 
 No mortal man shall know. 
 Oft I ascend the loftiest height. 
 And scale tlie rocky steep; 
 Where soars the eagle far from sight, 
 Where dwells the mountain sheep. 
 Still, still, I hold my secret dear, 
 O'er which men marvel so. 
 For whence I come, and what lam. 
 No mortal man shall knov/. 
 My mighty wings, are wondrous strong, 
 I frequent every spot; 
 Earth's fi;i;iting throng, has heard me long, 
 Yet no man sees nie not. 
 Still, still, I hold my secret dear. 
 O'er which men marvel so. 
 For whence I come, and what I am. 
 No mortal man shall know. 
 Forever on my crystal winp : 
 Through bygone years I've flown; 
 Beyond the birth of earthly things, 
 And ev' ry man I' ve known. 
 Still, still, I hold the secret dear. 
 O'er which men marvel so, 
 For whence I come, and what I am. 
 No mortal man shall know, 
 r ve fanned the infant's curly locks, 
 Oft kissed tlie maidens fair. 
 And far among the cavern rocks, 
 Have sought the hermit there. 
 Still, still, I hold my secret dear, 
 O'er which men marvel so. 
 For whence I come, and what I am, 
 No mortal man shall know. 
 The battles fought in many a clime, 
 I've witnessed ev' ry tray; 
 Midst clanking swords and martial chime, 
 I've cleared the smoke away. 
 Still, still, I hold my secret dear. 
 O'er which men marvel so. 
 For whence I come, and what I am, 
 No mortal man shall know. 
 So zealous youth record my song, 
 While zephyrs jj^ently blow ; 
 Methink thou hast detained me long. 
 On journey I must go. 
 Yet, still, I hold the secret dear. 
 O'er which men marvel so, 
 For whence I come, and what I am, 
 No mortal man sliall know. 
 YES. 
 There is a little simple word, 
 You've ofltimes heard it spoken; 
 Our deepest thou^^hts, this word has stined. 
 Has healed tlie hearts once broken. 
 It sometimes comes with dreadful pain. 
 Sometimes with happiness, 
 What! must I tell it you again? 
 That little word is y-e-s. 
 TWILIGHT HOUR. 
 I sat me down at twilight, 
 When the even sun was low, 
 And his rays still bright, 
 Cast a golden light, 
 As the day was dying slow. 
 All things seemed weary and silent, 
 Save where the beetle flew, 
 And the dreary wind, 
 With a sad, sad din, 
 Bid the dying day adieu. 
 I gazed on tlie buds and leaflets, 
 All coated with sweet summer dew. 
 And the bjight golden west. 
 Brought a sigii to my breast, 
 And the thoughts of a dear one I knew. 
 *?or many an eve 'mong blossom and leaves, 
 In the sweet happy moments of bliss, 
 When the west sun was low, 
 'And the zephyrs did blow. 
 In the calm hour of twilight like thU, 
 We had gazed on the sun at the dosing of day, 
 At we sat in the bowers ot June, 
 la a restful repose, 
 Jlidst flower and rose; 
 Alas! came her twilight Coo soon. 
 Like a bud, when its calyx half oped to the wind 
 Is plucked ere it bursts in full bloom, 
 Mixed with blossoms and .vine. 
 Then with garlands entwine, 
 And helplessly yields to its doom. 
 So the angel of death saw it fit through 
 his power, 
 And he plied his sickle and dart; 
 * Mong the choice buds he plucked, 
 To mix with rare flower, 
 Was a treasure esteemed in my heart. 
 And oft in the even oi twilight, 
 when the scenes draw on like this, 
 My thoughts drift above. 
 To a dear one I love, 
 Far away to the sweet Land of Bliss. 
 LOVE'S PASSION. 
 When love is centered in the breast, 
 And o'er tiie soul doth reign, 
 'Tis hard to break the union's tie. 
 And sever links in twain. 
 'Tis hard to turn away from one, 
 On whom our minds doth rest. 
 And seal the doors of secret love. 
 By reason's stern request. 
 And when we break the bond of love, 
 It leaves a heart felt sore; 
 A lasting plague is severed love, 
 Of anguish and of woe. 
 THE MAIDEN *S SONG. 
 I had a dream of my love last night, 
 When the moon was low and the stars shone bright 
 I saw as it seemed, a halo of white; 
 Encircled a swart damsel fair. 
 Her voice was so clear and sweet did she sing, 
 Her fingers danced over each golden string, 
 As she sane: to the time of Capid's brigiit dart. 
 And each note seemed to pierce through my 
 heart. 
 But I knew not the song that she sang. 
 Her teeth were as v/hite as the snovv flakes tliat 
 fall; 
 Her delicate form was graceful and tall; 
 Her vesture was purple and curled was her hair, 
 So sweet was her music that echoed in air; 
 But I knew not the song that she sang. 
 Though she stood in the disiani:e, plain my eyes 
 could behold, 
 Her jewels of sapphire, of rubies, and gold; 
 So gently and sweet did her tender voice flow; 
 Her music was sweet, and her music was low. 
 But I knew not the song that slie sang. 
 She sang with that ease and melodious grace, 
 BelonjT^ing to none but our Ethiope race; 
 And hev dark eyes shone bright, 
 Wuh a sweet, cahn, delight, 
 But I kiiev not the song that she sang. 
 I asked for the song, at the sweet, closing strain, 
 She smiled with a bow and sang it again, 
 So sweet and so soothing her love-song did sound 
 And sweeter the notes reechoeci around ; 
 But I knew not the song that she sang. 
 I looked on the beauty her form did embrace. 
 That angelic smile, on her fair swarthy face; 
 Enamored, I asked for her heart and her hand, 
 Embarassed, she fled to a far away land. 
 But I knew not the song that she sang. 
 A MEMORIAL. 
 Rest, oh rest in peaceful slumber! 
 'Neath the sod and moiddring clay; 
 Thou art with death's chosen people; 
 In his charge you 've passed away 
 Three score ten, and more thy summers, 
 Tiiou hast labored not in vain; 
 Thou hast wrought the task assigned thee 
 ''Sow, and thou slialt reap again." 
 And thy spirit crossed the river, 
 When the even sun was low; 
 When old Jordan's tide was calmest; 
 And the storm-winds cease to blow. 
 In that harbor, safely landed. 
 On the shore of Beulah Land, 
 White-robed angels all around thee, 
 Reaching for the pilgrim's hand. 
 While the harp rings out with anthems, 
 And the choir, a migiity throng. 
 Joins in unison, the music, 
 As they sing a blissful song. 
 And the Saviour comes to greet thee, 
 And His son He proudly own; 
 Saying *'Well done faithful servant, 
 Welcome to my Father's throne." 
 So we'll bid each friend and kindred, 
 Dry their weeping, tearful, eyes; 
 And rejoice that he's in heaven, 
 In that Land beyond the skies. 
 Should our lives be three score summers. 
 May we leave a name like this; 
 Then, we'll wear a cown, in G^ory, 
 In the land of Heavenly Bliss. 
 AN ODE TO IRELAND. 
 WRITTEN BY REQUEST. 
 A song to old Ireland, tho' simple and silly, 
 I'll sing to the shamrock, I'll sing of the lily, 
 I'll sing- of her sons and her daughters the 
 while — 
 The lords and the peasants, of Emerald Isle. 
 Were I but enchanted, I *d rise in the air, 
 And warble a ditty, beyond all compare; 
 Of her warriors tried, who wielded the sword, 
 In that fu-rce bloody battle, of Old Yellow 
 Ford. 
 In Shannon's sweet waters, I'd glide in my 
 bark, 
 And chant you a ditty, of Dublin and Cork; 
 Her chieftains, who headed her men on the 
 fiekl, 
 T'ne valiant O'Donnels, and dauntless O' Neils. 
 I'd sing of her bards, but weak is my tongue, 
 My voice is too faint, and my harp is unstrung 
 To sing such a measure, to give them just due, 
 'Twould be such a ballad, the world never 
 knew. 
 So I '11 sing of old Erin, a ballad of praise, 
 Her shamrocks and lilies, her upland and 
 braes ; 
 A toast and a ballad, to that Isle 'cross the 
 sea; 
 Long life to her peasants, and lords of 
 degree. 
 SANTA CLAUS' SLEIGH RIDE. 
 DEDICATED TO MY LITTLE NIECES AND NEPHEWS. 
 'Twas late in tlie month of Decetnber, 
 And all things were merry and gay; 
 When Santa Claus came from his dwelling 
 of fame, 
 And took up the reins in his sleigh. 
 Ere he seated, he sounded his bugle, 
 In a tone that was cheering and clear; 
 He then cried out, with a merry old shout, 
 To his three score span of deer. 
 Then away with a loud, merry, clatter, 
 His bells echoed loud on the wind; 
 And he and his sleigh, were soon far away, 
 While his mansion lay far, far, behind. 
 His reindeer were active and nimble, 
 Tlicy bounded in haste through the snow ; 
 For short was the night, to take such a flight. 
 To millions of liomes, don't you know. 
 His stay v^as short in each dwelling. 
 Where the little ones slept in their beds, 
 And leaving some toys, for the girls and 
 the boys. 
 He 'gan mounted roofs overhead. 
 In some climes the snow had not fallen, 
 Then what did Old Santa Claus do? 
 Why — he yelled to his deer, in a voice shrill 
 and clear; 
 They mounted the air, and they ficjw. 
 And long *fore it dawned Christmas morning, 
 He had made his journey complete; 
 From his three score deer, he took all tlic 
 gear, 
 And piled them, a heap at his feet. 
 His good wife then gave him a bumper, 
 Of claret, all sparkling and strong. 
 And she sang him a health, and she 
 wished him wealth; 
 That his life might be happy and long. 
 All weary from hasty exertion, 
 And a long, long, ride in his sleigh. 
 When the bright dawn did peep, he was 
 sound, sound asleep. 
 And that's how he spent Cliristmas day. 
 EULOGY ON THE FARM. 
 WRITTEN FOR THE FaRMER's INSTITUTE OF 
 Blue Ash Ohio. 
 Could I but sing to you in rhyme, 
 Like old bards learned and lioary ; 
 My notes would echo on the wind, 
 And tell a stirring story. 
 With sweetest song, of music strong, 
 With notes of graceful measure, 
 I'd bear the rhythm to along, 
 And sing it in my leisure. 
 'Twould be about the many farms. 
 Within our native county; 
 When spring renews her vernal charms, 
 And dawns the harvest bounty. 
 When zephyrs blow, where brooklets flow, 
 Through meads 'mong grasses tender, 
 Where bright the modest violets grow. 
 And blooms with nature's splendor. 
 When orchard trees are filled with bloom, 
 And all the air perfuming, 
 What charms bedecks tlie farmer's home. 
 While each task lie's resuming. 
 With ceaseless moil, he turns the soil, 
 And furrows throw together; 
 He lends his brawny hands to toil, 
 And welcomes summer weather. 
 He works with valorous strengtii each day, 
 Though oft at night he's weary; 
 His manly heart beats proud and gay, 
 Through midnight hours so dreary. 
 His matiy fields abundance yields, 
 From corn, wheat- fields, to meadow, 
 Eiach fleeting hour, a new growth steals, 
 From night to noon-tide's shadow. 
 His' cattle 'mong the wood-land hills. 
 And fields of rank green clover, 
 Sip^ water from the flowing rills, 
 Where minnows love to hover. 
 { cannot sing like bards of old, 
 With music sweet and tender, 
 Yet in my feeble song, though bold, 
 The girls and boys remember. 
 Beauty and grace bedeck the face, 
 Of ail the farmer maidens; 
 And n)any a kindly deeds retrace, 
 i^Iei hands, with beauty laden. 
 Concealed behind life's curtains drawn, 
 Oft honored fame lies waiting. 
 For woman- hoods* and man-hoods* dawn, 
 With valorous deeds relating. 
 Now don't disdain my closing strain. 
 There's naught like country living; 
 I fain would sing of courting swains. 
 And annual bounties given. 
 For 'tis the farm with boys and girls, 
 And fruitful crops a growing. 
 That constitutes our living world. 
 With health and plenty flowing. 
 May God bestow a helping hand, 
 To all an ample bounty; 
 With blessings on the farmer's land, 
 And on our dear old county. 
 WHAT IS LOVE? 
 What is Love? now who can tell? 
 Hast thou e'er possessed the spell? 
 If thou hast, thou know' st full well; 
 In thy heart a germ doth dwell, 
 That no power can e' er expell. 
 That is Love. 
 And the soul ofttimes doth seem, 
 Lulled with blissful happy dream; 
 Then with fear ' tis roused again. 
 Mingled with sad tears and pain. 
 That is Love. 
 Still there's something left untold, 
 Could my languid tongue express, 
 But the mystery don't unfold; 
 *Tis the power true Love possess. ^ 
 What is Love? 
 GOOD-NIGHT 
 The sun sinks low into the west; 
 The weary toilers hies for rest; 
 The birds have sheltered in their nest. 
 Good-nifjht! jj;ood-night. 
 The hour is calm, the zephyrs still; 
 I hear the sinjjing whip-poor-will; 
 Her music echoes *mong the hilL 
 Good night! good-night. 
 A throng of beetles fill the air; 
 The fireflies' lamp a brilliant glare; 
 From whence they've flown I know not 
 where. 
 Good-night! good-night. 
 And gazing on this scene I trow, 
 At niglit fall when the sun is low. 
 The breeze so calm and gently blow 
 Good-night! good-night. 
 As darkness veils the nightly hour, 
 Faint grows the dying daylight's power, 
 And close the calyx of the flower. 
 Good-night! good-night. 
 Deep in my lieart a small voice say, 
 A doom shall fail thee as this day, 
 And all tiiy friends shall to thee say, 
 , Good-night! good -night. 
 A CHRISTMAS CAROL 
 In the fields of Judea nt:ar Bethlehem town, 
 While shepherds did watch their flocks 
 on the green, 
 Behold, from the heavens an angel came down. 
 And a bright gleaming star appeared on 
 on tlie scene. 
 *'Fear not!" said the angel, glad tidings I bring 
 And the glories trom heaven in splendor 
 shown down ; 
 *'In the city of David, this day comes a king; 
 He lies in a manger at Bethlehem town." 
 Then a heavenly host with harps in their hand 
 Surrounded that angel, a heavenly 
 sight; 
 Singing-* 'glory to God and good will to men." 
 Then ascended in air and was lost from 
 the sight, 
 Then the shepherds arose and deserted 
 their fold ; 
 Went forth to that city and Jesus they found 
 They knelt down and praised him, and so 
 we are told, 
 From thence they departed, and noised it 
 around. 
 Yes, His name has been noised from thence 
 to this day, 
 As we wake from our blumber on bright 
 Christmas morn. 
 The church bell are chiming, our pulses beat gay; 
 Earth's mortals rejoices that Jesus is born. 
 THE ROSE. 
 I looked upon tlie blooming rose, 
 Beheld her beauty rare; 
 I breathed her effervesence sweet, 
 That filled the balmy air. 
 Her petals clung like jewels strung, 
 On some great monarch's crown; 
 The west winds blew; her petals fell, 
 Like snow upon the s^round. 
 I marveled wliy so pure a flower. 
 All jjlorious To the eye; 
 Possessed with charms and blooming prime, 
 Should drop her leaves and die. 
 A gentle zephyr fanned my brow. 
 And roused a feeling strange; 
 Plain 1 could see, why it should be. 
 All living things must change. 
 A LOVE SONG. 
 The veil of night has come between, 
 The cfolden sun and I; 
 Sweet love to me has intervened, 
 I know not how, nor why. 
 And every balmy breeze that blow, 
 The rustling leaves above; 
 Like harmonizing music flow, 
 And whisper sighs of love. 
 I've ofttimes launched in land of dreams, 
 Through realms of thorns and flowers; 
 But love still lights my weary way, 
 Through sad and happy hours. 
 Now list my song, my lady love, 
 While each note clear doth swell; 
 Each note vibrates a promise true,, 
 I ask thee. Is it well? 
 BEYOND THE TOMB. 
 Back from the tomb, departed friend! 
 Back from yon heavenly clime! 
 Back from thy toilsome journey's end! 
 Back, on the wings of time! 
 Retrace old Jordan's delus^e tide, 
 Through misty vales between! 
 Come gently to this mortal's side, 
 And solve a nation's dream! 
 Man's eyes are seiiled from God's domain, 
 He knows not what's to come; 
 Knows not his morrow's lost or gain, 
 His senses, naught but dumb. 
 The silent tomb unseals man's eyes. 
 His soul seeks realms unseen; 
 Up where the many Mansions rise, 
 Hid by yon azure screen. 
 Could but the humblest minded soul, 
 Retrace Death's misty glen; 
 To hear the hidden wonders told, 
 Would throng earth's wisest men. 
 And list' ning to that wondrous tale, 
 Man's boastful pride would tame; 
 And all his foolish myths would quail! 
 He'd hide his face with shame. 
 Back from the tomb, departed friend ? 
 Back from the Realms of Light! 
 Reveal life's mystic tie to men, 
 Bring wisdom, lore, and might! 
 MISS SUSIE'S SOCIAL. 
 Did you hear about the social 
 That took place at Susie Greenes*? 
 That's so, you were off at college; 
 Well — you missed one swell old sce«e. 
 I was there, and sakes 'o Goodness! 
 What a swell old time we had; 
 Odor steaming from the kitchen, 
 *Nough to drive the hungry mad^ 
 And a mighty crowd of people. 
 Came a flocking through the door; 
 Dressed in finest silks and satins, 
 Gals I never saw before. 
 Brown skin gals with yellah fellahs, 
 Yellah gals, with brown skin boys, 
 All a smiling and contented; 
 For the social they enjoyed. 
 Lucy Brooks and Sally Carter, 
 *Poii my word were looking fioe, 
you can't pick out two ladies, 
 That can take away their prime. 
 They 're the finest gaU I reckon, 
 Ca!i be found for miles around; 
 Lucy came with Levy Johnson, 
 Sally came with Ely Brown, 
 Brown, he work^s for Doctor Collyer 
 Bein^ both about a size, 
 All the Doctor's cast off clothing, 
 Falls to l)im a captured prize. 
 With Miss Sally hanging to him, 
 I can see that couple yet; 
 She a handsome yellah lady, 
 He so stately, black as jet. 
 Close behind, came Levy Johnson, 
 And his face a loo kin' light; 
 Lucy Brooks was hangin' to him. 
 She was any thing but white. 
 Susie Greene? — I'd nigh forgot her, 
 Dressed to death, and lookin* gran\ 
 HugjJin', kissin' all the ladies, 
 Speakin' sweet to every man. 
 If I'd try to tell all 'bout it, 
 Several hours I'm sure 'twould take; 
 So I'll shorten up the story, 
 And now tell who won the cake 
 After pavin' pa vns with kisses, 
 Playin' ev' ry sort 'o game. 
 Aunt Matildii— Susie's mother, 
 Smilin', in the parlor came. 
 In her hand she held a waiter, 
 With a cake of 'normous size; 
 Coated o'er with blood red icin*. 
 That attracted all the eyes. 
 *'Now," She said, "young men an' ladies. 
 Git together two an' two! 
 An' the couple walks the fines'. 
 This big cake belongs to you." 
 Such a scramblin' then for partners, 
 And the couples formed in line, 
 Were led off by big Jim Lucus, 
 Puttin', on such monkey shines. 
 Walkiu' knock kneed, vvalkin' jubah, 
 VValkin' cripple, walkin' sprung, 
 And his big cane filled with ribbons. 
 To the lively music swung. 
 Arthur Broctks and Sophie Woodson, 
 Struttin' to the music's sound. 
 Made a most dehghtful figure; 
 Following Jim around an' round. 
 Lucy Brooks an' Sally Carter, 
 With their partners was n' t slow 
 And they walked so light and graceful, 
 Turnin', smilln', bovvin' low. 
 So between these three fine couples. 
 There arose a mighty test; 
 And it puzzled all them judges, 
 Hard to tell who walked the best. 
 But I bMieve 'twas Levy Johnson, 
 He and Lucy won the prize; 
 Big Man! cut that cake wide open, 
 Boastin* of its monstrous size. 
 Soon we had a joke upon them, 
 When Miss Carter made it known, 
 That the cake with blood red icin', 
 Was a great big Co' n-Bread-Pone. 
 After the big laugli was over. 
 We all parted from tiiat spree; 
 What you say? it must been uiidnight. 
 It was almost half past ihree. 
 MIDWINTER'S REFLECTION. 
 Oil for one ray of summer-sun, 
 To li^ht the cloudy sky; 
 With scorching heat and golden rays, 
 That shone upon those bygone days, 
 Wlien birds were singing nigh. 
 'T would ban is! f ice and snow away, 
 And paint a vcjal scene; 
 The little brooks would ripple 'long. 
 The red t)ird would renew her song, 
 'Twould turn tliose lulls to green. 
 The violets that's sleeping now, 
 Far down bent-atli the snow, 
 Would soon in modesty conceal, 
 For fear their beauty might reveal, 
 Some harm to th ;m I trow. 
 And all the wood that's sad and sear. 
 With spectral arms outspread, 
 Would don their cloaks of sparkling green. 
 The summer-dew would tint the sheen, 
 With beauty over head. 
 The wood-land hills all robed with flowars, 
 That threw a sweet perfume, 
 It brings a yearning to my mind, 
 To leave drear wintry scenes behind. 
 And walk *mong flowers of June. 
 The while I sit me by the fire, 
 Within my country home, 
 Kast falls the white, the silent snow, 
 And fierce the searching wind doth blow, 
 Defies my feet to roam. 
 Oh! for one ray of summer sun, 
 Though winter has its charms, 
 I'd gladly lay them all aside. 
 To breast the balmy summer* s tide. 
 With zephyrs soft and calm. 
 A REQUEST. 
 Effie, sweet Effie, the bright sunny day 
 has vanished ; 
 For low sinks the sun: 
 And I feel dear love, like a wandering 
 dove; 
 In search of a lost, lost, one. 
 And now dearest lady, to cheer ma along, 
 I ask thee one favor; just sing me a song! 
 Oh! sing me a song. 
 Oh, sing me a ditty, that's soothing 
 and pretty! 
 A song with its cadence, so mild and 
 serene. 
 And float thy sweet notes, on the wings 
 of the even! 
 Effie, dear Effie my sweet, sable, queen: 
 And now dearest lady, to cheer me along, 
 I ask thee one favor, just sing me a song! 
 Oh, sing me a song! 
 Oh, warble the song in a tender compassion^ 
 With notes like the mock bird, that 
 sings in the spring, 
 And shape out the words in a love-ditty 
 fashion. 
 And let them each chord to a harp's golden 
 string! 
 And now my dear lady, to cheer me along, 
 I ask thee one favor; just sing me a song! 
 Oh, sing me a song! 
 'Tis only thy sungs that can lull me to 
 rest, 
 That can soothe the strong passion of 
 love in my breast, 
 And drift my bark to a faraway shore. 
 Where ferns and sweet roses bloom 
 over and o* er: 
 That's why dearest lady, I* ve begged thee 
 so long. 
 To pledge me a favor^ by singing a song. 
 A DESERTED HOMESTEAD. 
 Far down in tlie land of old Dixie, 
 Where cane-brake and cotton-fields grow, 
 I saw there, a large plantation; 
 Which flourished long years ago: 
 The cabins, they were deserted, 
 Tlie fences, all tumbled down. 
 All things about me were silent, 
 The slaves had deserted, and gone. 
 As I looked at those rude built cabins. 
 On that sad deserted spot, 
 I thought of my old forefathers, 
 And there humble, bitter, lot: 
 I gazed at the large old homestead, 
 On her vine clad ruined walls; 
 It roused within a strange feeling, 
 Like the sight of some dead man's pall. 
 While I passed through the broken down 
 portals, 
 And entered the large, spacious, halls, 
 The old doors squeaked on their hinges. 
 And saffron stained were the walls: 
 Far up in the dreary old attic, 
 As the winds of autumn did moan, 
 I thought I could hear a pleading voice. 
 Like a bondmaid's helpless groan. 
 As I entered tiie large old parlor, 
 Once flourished with soulhorn grace, 
 Where oft sat the rich old planter. 
 In wealtli by that large fireplace, 
 I saw no trace of existe:ice, . 
 Where mortals lately liad been; 
 The drifting of time had banished her prime. 
 And now, shone the wages of sin. 
 For the power of t!;at wicked old planter 
 Who once bound my fathers in chain, 
 Had been quelled by the hand of Jehovah ; 
 Been severed and broken in twain: 
 In tiiat fierce battle fought at old Shiloh, 
 By death-sh')ts from Northern guns. 
 There fell four bodies all mangled; 
 It was the old planter and sons; 
 They have yielded to dust in tlie 
 churchyard, 
 The mother and daughter lies there; 
 And the broken down house all deserted. 
 Is now standing silent and bare. 
 The swallow had built in the chimneys, 
 The wren had built in the wall, 
 Through tangled vines and tall grasses, 
 The venomous serpent crawls: 
 The fields in which grew the white cotton, 
 Where the poor black slaves used to hoe. 
 Long since ihey have turned lo a fallow; 
 There the birch and the cotton - wood gro'w : 
 *Twas the Lord who tore down that dwellings 
 And checked that old planter's reign; 
 Each slave, He unyoked from their bondage; 
 And bad them to shake off their chain. 
 How could I look on with compassion, 
 And mourn o'er the planter's .lost, 
 *Twas a just return for his vile, vile,decds; 
 And his life-blood and wealth paid* 
 the cost: 
 And leaving the scenes far behind me, 
 I returned from that dreary old place, 
 Whose grandure and splendor had faded, 
 The pages of wealth all erased. 
 MY LADY LOVE. 
 Of all the winsome damsels, that my eyes 
 have ever seen, 
 There is one, for whom my breast heaves 
 constant sighs; 
 She is a handsome lady, she is to me a queen; 
 And I of Cupid- begged his noose to catch 
 the prize. 
 To me she is so comely, the fairest maid 
 around, 
 Yes- her voice is like the curlews of the 
 spring; 
 Her ebon locks are curly, her cheeks are 
 olive brown, 
 And her songs of music charm me when 
 she sings. 
 The smiles that ever lingers, upon her win- 
 some face. 
 Reflects like glit'ring rain-bow tints around; 
 My heart oft leaps with gladness, when through 
 that smile I trace, 
 A love concealed, by hidden blushes bound. 
 Her laugh, I can't describe it, 'tis far beyond 
 compare; 
 But it sounds like rippling waters I have 
 heard ; 
 Or the flow of some sweet cadence, on the 
 tranquil even air; 
 Mingled with the gentle warble of a bird. 
 Although there're many a damsel, I find 
 them all amiss; 
 Compared with her my lady love, Irene; 
 There is none whose smile possess me, with 
 that sweet angelic bliss: 
 There is none, for she's my chosen queen 
 THE BACHELOR* S SOLILOQY. 
 I care not, said the bachelor old, 
 I've made no vows to hold me; 
 I simply tote my hard earned gold, 
 And have no wife to scold me. 
 Tve lived a placid life for years, 
 Sunshine and gloom commingle; 
 My cares are small, my wants are few; 
 No one to please when single! 
 No chaps to worry me through life, 
 With walks my heart to tingle; 
 I have no wife nor fam'ly strife. 
 Thank God that I am single! 
 THE SELF-SAME WAY. 
 Oh, the journey of life, is a journey of strife, 
 Through darken and bright sunny day; 
 But after each rain, comes sunshine again, 
 And I'm living the self-same way. 
 Tm blessed with good health, but not with 
 much wealth; 
 Yet I'm happy, ves happy as they. 
 Who travel around with wealth and renown; 
 By living the self-same way. 
 There is nothing appear to be new each year, 
 I reap the same meadows of hay, 
 I seek the same plain, to gather my grain, 
 And Vm living the self-same way. 
 A cross thus to bear, with a burden of care. 
 My Saviour's sweet voice to obey. 
 Through joys and through tears, from year 
 unto year, 
 r m living the self-same way. 
 NIGHT. I 
 Night on her sable pinions, 
 Came down at close uf day: ' 
 She took her flight, 
 Through the gray twilight, 
 And banished the sun away. 
 Arrayed in her dark sable garments. 
 With her jet black curling hair. 
 She paused by the brook. 
 And a draught she took, 
 While a coolness filled the air. 
 She lay her hand on the reaper. 
 Who had tilled and sowed and reaped. 
 And bade him to lay, 
 From the toils of the day, 
 In a restful slumber, to sleep. 
 And going cross meadow and valley. 
 And seeing things quiet and still, 
 She paused by the rocks, 
 And summoned the fox; 
 And cried to the wild whip-poor-wiiL 
 The wild fox responded to the suratnoa^ 
 Which came by that of the spright^ 
 And off in the dew, 
 Through the meadow he flew^ 
 And was lost in the gloom of the night- 
 The whip-poor-will came from her hidiag 
 Among the fallows and trees; 
 She warbled and sang. 
 Till her sweet song rang^ 
 Like music aBoat on the bfeexe. 
 Then night drew the dark sable curtain, 
 >Which parted the light from the day; 
 That the sun shmiild not maf, 
 She lit up each star, * 
 With a gleam from the white milky-way. 
 All robed in her dark spectral garment. 
 Dripping with cold midnight-dew. 
 She sate in repose. 
 Till day-light arose; 
 Then away from the sun-light she flew. 
 DOWN MURRAY'S HALL 
 Been out all night and I jes* got back; 
 I Jes' got back from a country ball, 
 You ought o' been there to see it all;' 
 J ohn Lee fiddled an' Jim Cross called; 
 An' we had one time down Murray's hall, 
 Way down the river road. 
 The hall was lit up with four big lights, 
 With four big lights that shone like day; 
 The whole house seemed as cheerful as May; 
 For laughter an' frolic, had all the sway: 
 Some joined the dance an' some joined th' play 
 At the great big ball down Murray's hall. 
 Way do.vn the river road. 
 There came a crowd from the West Fork side; 
 From the West Fork side north the river road. 
 And old uncle Isa;?c, to the crowd that rode, 
 Muttered an* growled how he lost on his load, 
 He hauled with his mules o'er' the river road; 
 For a nickle a head, down Murray's hall, 
 Where John Lee fiddled an' Jim Crc^ss called. 
 Way down the river roa(!. 
 Aunt Jane Hunter came 'cross the field. 
 Came cross the field with her daughters, three, 
 Jes* *like thrrir mammy, but younger you see. 
 Modest an' pretty as pretty can be; 
 A lump clogged my throat when they bowed 
 to me, 
 At the great big ball down Murray's hall, 
 Where Jolin Lee fiddled an* Jim Cross called, 
 Way down the river road. 
 How many daui^hters? there *re only three, 
 There 're only three and they all were there; 
 Miss Alice the oldest, then comes Miss Marie, 
 She's one shade brighter than Alice you see; 
 Miss Polly's the darkest^ but has the best hair^ 
 They all were down at Murray's hall, 
 Where John Lee fiddled an* Jim Cross called. 
 Way d'>vvn the river road. 
 Miss Polly, the youngest had on a waist, 
 Ot changeable silk, that glittered like gold; 
 Her long black hair was twisted an' rolled. 
 Her form was as straight as a straight May pole 
 Was belle of the ball at Murray's hall. 
 Where John Lee fiddled an' Jim Cross called, 
 Way down the river load. 
 Miss Marie was dressed up to taste, 
 Dressed up to taste an* a Jookin* gran*; 
 Had straightened her hair, an* powdered her 
 face; 
 Had on snow-white-slippers, had buckled 
 her waist, 
 Until its circumference was scarcely a span; 
 And she was Some Punks at Murray's hall, 
 Where John Lee fiddled an' Jim Cross called. 
 Way down the river road. 
 Miss Alice was dressed in a lavender gown, 
 A lavender gown artistically 'ranged 
 With ribbons an' laces an' pink chiffon ; 
 A golden bracelet she had on. 
 Where dangled the liearts of suitors she won, 
 Who came a foot down Murray's hall, 
 Where John Lee tiddled an' Jim Cross called, 
 Way down the river road. 
 An' little Sam Tucker was fixed up swell. 
 Was fixed up swell with that swallow-tail; 
 He toted the cape of Alvina Wells, 
 And she is coubidered the village belle; 
 Her dress was covered all over with veil, 
 She walked full three feet a head of her trail, 
 That followed her down to Murray's hall, 
 Where John Lee fiddled an' Jim Cross called. 
 Way d(»wn the river lo^d. 
 Abe Lincoln Jones, had a Jim-Swingcr on, 
 A long Jim-Swinger, that hung 'low his knees; 
 The skirts of this garment did soar on the 
 wind, 
 Like the windy March weather shakes a sheet 
 on a line, 
 An' his feet jarred the dus' from the chinks 
 in the wall, 
 Ashe led off the dance down Murray's halt^ -;* 
 Where Jolin Lee fiddled an* Jim Cross called, ,\i 
 Way down the river road. ,^7 
 And John Lee fiddled a jocular air, 
 A jocular ai^r, an' he fiddled it ri)(ht; 
 And that old time fiiddle did mo;4n an* groan, n'- 
 It woke up the sinews an' limbered the bone»; 
 Them black folks an' yeliah folks danced 
 that night! 
 That hall fair shook, and quivered the lights, ,( 
 At the great big ball down Murray's hall, 
 Where Jolui Le fiddled an* Jim Cross called. 
 Way d'wii the river road. 
 That yeliah Jim Cross stood up on a stool , 
 Stood up on a stool with his back to the wall; 
 His loud doleful yoice rang out through the 
 hall, 
 With— *'Swinp: yo' pavvtnas!" ''Balance all!" 
 "Forward two!" "And forward fo'!" 
 You would laughed at the capers cut on that 
 floo'. 
 If you were down to Murray's hall, 
 Where John Lee fiddled an* Jim Cross catted, 
 Way down the river road. 
 The church folks tlvere were more than a few, 
 Were more than a few down Murray's hall, 
 They played more g^ames than I ever knew;' 
 They chose their pawtnas two an* two, 
 Played — *'Run Johnnie Willow wind the ball! 
 Still John L-ee fiddled an' Jim Cross called. 
 In the oppef; end ot' Murray's hall. 
 Way dow'n the' riv^r road. 
 I hear the sweet voice of Miss Polly yet,' 
 Ol Miss Polly Hunter who led the play songs; 
 lospite of the ficjdle her voice pierced the din. 
 Like a fife pierce the. corpsvvhen the drummers 
 begin; ■ 
 An* loud rang the voicts in Murray's old hall. 
 Where John Lee fiddled an' Jim Cross called, 
 ' Way down the river road. 
 But I'm sleepy now an* I mus' go on, 
 I mils' go on for I'na tired an* sore; 
 Mv shoes' too tight an' I danced all night, 
 My eyc-lids are heavy, I don't feel right, 
 I was dcnvii at the bail an' saw it all, 
 Heatd Jolin Lee fiddle saw Jim Cross call, 
 I'll be 'round to morrow an' tell you more. 
 A CONGRATULATION. 
 Whut brunjj you from Fauginyah?

 I'm gled to see you Moses.

 How dem women fry sweet co'n; 
 b'^u you see I know all 'bout it; 
 Right dali I was bred an' bo'n ; 
 Knows all 'bout dat greasy co'n-bread, 
 Like a wedge, in size an' weight. 
 When you touch it wid yo' fingas. 
 It will crumble in yb' plate. 
 Dem delicious sody-biscuits, 
 Was de bes'. you evah eat ; 
 An* dat good oi* home-cured -bacon. 
 An' dem hams is hard to beat; 
 In all de homes you tarried 
 In ev' ry neighborhood, 
 You found de young fo'kes clever, 
 An* de ol* fo'kes kin' an' good. 
 You nevah seed sich clevah fo'kes.

 Few fo'kes know de Sutton family, 
 An' their standin' jes' like me, 
 Mark de words I'm 'bout to tell you! 
 You done married Quality. 
 THE MYSTERIES. 
 There is music afloiit on the zephyrs, 
 Th t tlu! harper uovcr liath played; 
 The Muse holds niMciy a lyric, 
 That no bard t^vcr liath made. 
 There lay 'ufatli our feet, precious treasures, 
 Had mail hot tlie wisdom, he'd find; 
 Atr^ysteriis lay at his fmiyers, 
 But the dtp'h is too dt ep for his mind. 
 The mounts have unscaleble summits, 
 Where mortal never doth roam; 
 Where the wijd birds build in the rocks of 
 the hill, 
 And the grey eagle finds her a home. 
 There are isles in the mighty ocean, 
 So tar, far away from main land; 
 There are fishes that swim in her waters. 
 Unknown, and unheard of by man. 
 Yes, the myst'ry of life is a marvel; 
 And man has never been told, 
 Of the tie that binds life's existence, 
 Or the veil that hems in the soul. 
 So wc 're groping in search of something, 
 Something we never will find, 
 Till wc Change to a spirit immortal^ 
 And dwell in a faraway clime. 
 SPRING. 
 Spring come? again, with budded tree§, 
 With singins: birds, and honey bees;. , ., 
 She fans my brow with balmy breeze^ 
 Sweet gentle Spring! . , 
 She's robed in bright^ and, sparkling .,„,^^^ 
 With wreathes Of floWers fair to be seen.; 
 'Tis well to dwell berieath this queen, 
 I love thee Spring! 
 A LOVERS* PLEA. 
 I have heard the song birds singing, 
 I have heard the curlews call; 
 I have heard sweet charming music. 
 On mine ears it gently fall. 
 I have heard the robin-red-breast, 
 And the cooing of the dove, 
 V ve been charmed by inspiration. 
 Now my heart doth melt with love. 
 Yes, the curlew's call reminds me, 
 Of a voire, full well I know; 
 And the balmy zephyrs blowing. 
 Drift my thoughts to long ago. 
 And the rippling brook reminds me. 
 Of her laughter all the while; 
 And the bright and golden sun light, 
 Of her sweet angelic smile. 
 It is love that now possess me. 
 And my heart for one doth yearn ; 
 I have loved thee true dear Helen, 
 Dost thou love me in return? 
 A SONG TO ETHIOPIA. 
 I wiil sing of Ethiopia, my own rejected race 
 Of her noble sons and daughterS^^/'''' ''\ 
 That Caucasia will not trace. "'*'' -•' 
 J(in in the chorus brethrenf ^"" 
 Your voice is tuned for song, 
 Unit(! each voice together. 
 And sing it loud and long. 
 So long we' ve been rejected f 
 For since Queen Sheba's reign, 
 We've fell from wealth to servants; 
 Have worn the bondage chain. 
 Unfurl your hidden banners, 
 In freedom's name for right! 
 And show to foes our colors, 
 And sing with all your might! 
 Sing out with bold defiance, 
 Sing of Ethiope's bitter lot! 
 Of Caucasia's deeds ignoble, 
 That the flood of time can't blot. 
 Gird on your armor brethren ! 
 God lends a hand this day; 
 To all who cry for justice. 
 He'll remember in the fray. 
 Let the blast of freedom's trumpet 
 Ring reverberating sound, 
 Till each foe 'gainst Ethiopia, 
 Falls exhausted to the ground. 
 Bold We'll sing of Ethiopia, 
 Let it come from every mouth, 
 Till It fill wood-land and mountain; 
 Through the North and through 
 the South. 
 A LIVING GOD. 
 I know there is a living God, 
 Who reigns supreme on high; 
 Who shaped each path where mortals trod, 
 And paints the azure sky. 
 The lilies of the furtile fields. 
 Which glorifies the land. 
 With raiments bright, sweet odor yields 
 Beneath His great command. 
 His powerful hand illumes the sun, 
 With glittering rays of light; 
 He fixed the countless stars, each one, 
 To twinkle through the night. 
 In gorgeous splendor pure and bright, 
 He decorate the trees; 
 He shapes the wind, obscure from sight, 
 Afld fills the mighty seas. 
 He holds the life of mortal man, 
 Through days of bliss and pain ; 
 And fits us with an inner soul, 
 That we might live again. 
 He plants the mighty forest trees, 
 Which crowns the wood-land hill; 
 By His command the waters flow, 
 Through many a thousand rill. 
 The sparrow finds her simple wants, 
 The needy finds their bread ; 
 Earth's humblest creatures ne'er 
 should daunt. 
 He sees that all are fed. 
 I know there is a living God! 
 Or whence these wonders come; 
 The birth of time, the fleeting breath, 
 The orbs that fill yon dome? 
 E*en the benighted heathen man, 
 Has found a sacred shrine; 
 And seeing wonders of God's hand, 
 Seeks for a life divine. 
 A STRANGE VISION. 
 I had a vision m the calm of night, 
 When all the air was filled with stillness round; 
 Me thought, my soul had broke her earthly thrall, 
 And stood and gazed upon the dungeon, 
 Once in misery dwelt. 
 She did not take her flight to foreign lands 
 at once, 
 But lingered there about the corpse unseen, 
 By all the friends who stood around. 
 With tokens of respect for one no more; 
 Their tearful weeping eyes, 
 Paid tribute to the dead. 
 Then turned my soul from the drear dungeon 
 gates, 
 And journeyed pass a thousand different worlds; 
 Looked neither left nor right, but journeyed on 
 Until she reached a river, vast and wide. 
 She paused upon the stormy banks and gazed 
 beyond, 
 Beheld ten thousand seraphim in air, 
 Who sang aloud sweet anthems, 
 In an unknown tongue, that chorded 
 With a thousand harps of gold. 
 Prone was my soul to joiii that iieavenly throng, 
 But feared to venture, tor the billows roiled, 
 And seemed thus to defy her journey o' er, 
 Until a mighty trumpet pierced the air, 
 And calmed the angry billows !>f the tide. 
 So loud and sweet the music pierced my ears. 
 With chants of welcome, anthems loud and strong 
 My soul 'rose in the air as if on wings. 
 And took her flight to reach the other side. 
 But ere she reached the other side I woke; 
 And found about me stillness of the night; 
 Around my couch was darkness all I saw, 
 I wept — because the vision was not true. 
 A PROPOSAL. 
 Miss Sally, stop yo* fooling 
 An' hush dat geeglin', do! 
 Say honey, don't you luv' me, 
 De same as I luv' you? 
 Dis is a serious moment!

 FRITZ MOHLER'S DREAM. 
 It was a cold and wintry night, 
 The snow fell thick and fast; 
 All living creatures far and near, 
 Had sheltered from the blast. 
 Bill VVickmann's bar was crowded ; 
 With loafers boisrous loud ; 
 Scott Johnson, with his banjo. 
 Made music for the crowd. 
 *'Kum poys uii' have vun thrink on me!' 
 Bill Wickmanci shouted loud; 
 Scott Johnson dropped his banjo. 
 And elbowed through the crowd. 
 The black man sang a health he did, 
 The white fo'kes stood around ; 
 He knocked a fancy step or twa. 
 Then quaffed the brandy down« 
 Scarce had the crowd retreated, 
 To card and billiard game, 
 In came a large old German, 
 Fritz Mohler was his name. 
 A queer, old-looking, fellow, 
 His head was large and round; 
 His shoulders stooped, his curled hair gray; 
 His voice a husky sound. 
 He paused to gaze upon the crowd. 
 At Johnson, who was singing 
 An old time, lively banjo-song. 
 Droll rhymes and music ringing. 
 He sang about the Polly VVogg, y- 
 The Snake, and tera pin's, habbit; 
 The June-bug, possum, and the coon. 
 The big-eyed, stub-tailed, rabbit. 
 Sang something, 'bout old uncle Gabe, 
 Who 'stonished the plantation, 
 *'VVith pisin vipa's up his sleeves," 
 And other conjurations. 
 Sang something 'bout the crow and crane. 
 And how he went a kitin,' 
 ' *Wid his ole maustah's span of mules. 
 Way down tlie road to Bright' n." 
 Fritz gazed upon that colored man, 
 No mirth was in his look 
 Until his song had reached the end; 
 With laughter Mohler shook. 
 **Vell poys, let's take a thrink con dot, 
 Dot means fo* vun un all/' 
 The bottles clanked and each man drank, 
 But Scott refused the call. 
 *'Vell Chonson, call you vunceagin; 
 Coom up un haf a clas o* jin! 
 Vot make you in dot corner stand? 
 You, look yest like a dempcrence man. 
 Be not ashame Got made you plack, 
 Coom valk right quick tis vay! 
 Dot should n't make your spirit lack, 
 All men be mate of clay. 
 A vite cow's milk, be vite you know; 
 A plack cow's milk, be yest like snow. 
 A plack man's principal 's the same, 
 If he ches thri to keep his name." 
 Then Johnson took a **pony," 
 And sang a toast along; 
 Fritz Mohler o'er his lager-beer, 
 Sang loud a German Song. 
 The men all boozed and jolly, 
 The blazing fire agleam, 
 **Coom poys!" old Mohler shouted; 
 '*I vish to del mine thream!" 
 THE DREAM 
 *'Me thream last Tu'stay night you know, 
 Dot night de ground vas vite mit snow. 
 Each star vas bright, the vin dit plo; 
 Dot vas a funny thream! 
 Me til ream ven I vas in mine bet, 
 Me heard a noisy foot step tret, 
 Mine hair stood straight upon my het; 
 Dot Vas a funny thream T 
 Me knew it vas a thief you pet, 
 But vas too fraid to catch him, yet 
 I tiptoed out mine house an* set ; 
 Und all tis vas a thream. 
 He valked S'> easy like a mouse. 
 He mate right for mineshicken house; 
 He pushed dot door, he made vun souse; 
 Dot vas a funny thream! 
 Und ten me yelled out pretty quick. 
 Me threw at him, tis hick*ry stick, 
 Und ten at me he fired a brick 
 Dot vas a funny thream. 
 He looked yest like Scott Chonson here, 
 Far ten he vas upon me near, 
 Und ten me yelled mit dreadful fear; 
 Dot vas a funny thream. 
 He stole from me tree shickens vite; 
 He turnt an ran mit all his might; 
 Over te fence an' 'cross te lawn ; 
 I voke fen day vas shining bright, 
 Und found tree of mine shickens gone. 
 Scott Johnson 'rose with fury; 
 And shouted, * 'Look ah heah! 
 You say I stole dem chickens, sah. 
 You got to make dat clear! 
 All night you've flung yo' hints about, 
 An' now ole man you jes' look out! 
 Dis sortah talk will nevah do, 
 Or I will ''pick a crow" wif you; 
 I did n't steal yo* chickens! 
 **Me did n't say you stole tern Scott, 
 Vot fah you got at me so hot? 
 A thream be sometimes vat its not, 
 Dot vas a funny thream! 
 I missed mine shickens, dot vas true, 
 I saw a plack man yest like you, 
 I voke an vas tree shickens out, 
 Un dot is all I know about; 
 Dot vas a funny thream! 
 So Chonson, dot vud make you clear, 
 So let us haf a clas of peer! 
 Me pleve tis getin' late me fear, 
 Dot only vas a thream! 
 And so these two men drank again. 
 But neither sang a song; 
 Old Fritz still believe his dream is right; 
 And Scott still swear 'twas wrong.

  Two little boots all rough an' wo',
      Two little boots!
  Law, I 's kissed 'em times befo',
      Dese little boots!
  Seems de toes a-peepin' thoo
  Dis hyeah hole an' sayin' "Boo!"
  Evah time dey looks at you--
      Dese little boots.
  Membah de time he put 'em on,
      Dese little boots;
  Riz an' called fu' 'em by dawn,
      Dese little boots;
  Den he tromped de livelong day,
  Laffin' in his happy way,
  Evaht'ing he had to say,
      "My little boots!"
  Kickin' de san' de whole day long,
      Dem little boots;
  Good de cobblah made 'em strong,
     Dem little boots!
  Rocks was fu' dat baby's use,
  I'on had to stan' abuse
  W'en you tu'ned dese champeens loose,
      Dese little boots!
  Ust to make de ol' cat cry,
      Dese little boots;
  Den you walked it mighty high,
      Proud little boots!
  Ahms akimbo, stan'in' wide,
  Eyes a-sayin' "Dis is pride!"
  Den de manny-baby stride!
      You little boots.
  Somehow, you don' seem so gay,
      Po' little boots,
  Sence yo' ownah went erway,
      Po' little boots!
  Yo' bright tops don' look so red,
  Dese brass tips is dull an' dead;
  "Goo'-by," whut de baby said;
      Deah little boots!
  Ain't you kin' o' sad yo'se'f,
      You little boots?
  Dis is all his mammy 's lef',
      Two little boots.
  Sence huh baby gone an' died.
  Heav'n itse'f hit seem to hide
  Des a little bit inside
      Two little boots.
TO THE ROAD
  Cool is the wind, for the summer is waning,
      Who 's for the road?
  Sun-flecked and soft, where the dead leaves are raining,
      Who 's for the road?
  Knapsack and alpenstock press hand and shoulder,
  Prick of the brier and roll of the boulder;
  This be your lot till the season grow older;
      Who 's for the road?
  Up and away in the hush of the morning,
      Who 's for the road?
  Vagabond he, all conventions a-scorning,
      Who 's for the road?
  Music of warblers so merrily singing,
  Draughts from the rill from the roadside up-springing,
  Nectar of grapes from the vines lowly swinging,
      These on the road.
  Now every house is a hut or a hovel,
      Come to the road:
  Mankind and moles in the dark love to grovel,
      But to the road.
  Throw off the loads that are bending you double;
  Love is for life, only labor is trouble;
  Truce to the town, whose best gift is a bubble:
      Come to the road!
A SPRING WOOING
  Come on walkin' wid me, Lucy; 't ain't no time to mope erroun'
    Wen de sunshine 's shoutin' glory in de sky,
  An' de little Johnny-Jump-Ups 's jes' a-springin' f'om de groun',
    Den a-lookin' roun' to ax each othah w'y.
  Don' you hyeah dem cows a-mooin'? Dat 's dey howdy to de spring;
    Ain' dey lookin' most oncommon satisfied?
  Hit 's enough to mek a body want to spread dey mouf an' sing
    Jes' to see de critters all so spa'klin'-eyed.
  W'y dat squir'l dat jes' run past us, ef I did n' know his tricks,
    I could swaih he 'd got 'uligion jes' to-day;
  An' dem liza'ds slippin' back an' fofe ermong de stones an' sticks
    Is a-wigglin' 'cause dey feel so awful gay.
  Oh, I see yo' eyes a-shinin' dough you try to mek me b'lieve
    Dat you ain' so monst'ous happy 'cause you come;
  But I tell you dis hyeah weathah meks it moughty ha'd to 'ceive
    Ef a body's soul ain' blin' an' deef an' dumb.
  Robin whistlin' ovah yandah ez he buil' his little nes';
    Whut you reckon dat he sayin' to his mate?
  He's a-sayin' dat he love huh in de wo'ds she know de bes',
    An' she lookin' moughty pleased at whut he state.
  Now, Miss Lucy, dat ah robin sholy got his sheer o' sense,

  So I t'ink ef you 'll ixcuse me, fu' I do' mean no erfence,

  I 's a-buil'in' o' my cabin, an' I 's vines erbove de do'
    Fu' to kin' o' gin it sheltah f'om de sun;
  Gwine to have a little kitchen wid a reg'lar wooden flo',
    An' dey 'll be a back verandy w'en hit 's done.
  I 's a-waitin' fu' you, Lucy, tek de 'zample o' de birds,
    Dat 's a-lovin' an' a-matin' evahwhaih.
  I cain' tell you dat I loves you in de robin's music wo'ds,
    But my cabin 's talkin' fu' me ovah thaih!
JOGGIN' ERLONG
  De da'kest hour, dey allus say,
  Is des' befo' de dawn,
  But it's moughty ha'd a-waitin'
  W'ere de night goes frownin' on;
  An' it's moughty ha'd a-hopin'
  W'en de clouds is big an' black,
  An' all de t'ings you 's waited fu'
  Has failed, er gone to wrack--
  But des' keep on a-joggin' wid a little bit o' song,
  De mo'n is allus brightah w'en de night's been long.
  Dey 's lots o' knocks you 's got to tek
  Befo' yo' journey 's done,
  An' dey 's times w'en you 'll be wishin'
  Dat de weary race was run;
  W'en you want to give up tryin'
  An' des' float erpon de wave,
  W'en you don't feel no mo' sorrer
  Ez you t'ink erbout de grave--
  Den, des' keep on a-joggin' wid a little bit o' song,
  De mo'n is allus brightah w'en de night's been long.
  De whup-lash sting a good deal mo'
  De back hit 's knowed befo',
  An' de burden 's allus heavies'
  Whaih hits weight has made a so';
  Dey is times w'en tribulation
  Seems to git de uppah han'
  An' to whip de weary trav'lah
  'Twell he ain't got stren'th to stan'--
  But des' keep on a-joggin' wid a little bit o' song,
  De mo'n is allus brightah w'en de night's been long.
IN MAY
  Oh to have you in May,
    To talk with you under the trees,
  Dreaming throughout the day,
    Drinking the wine-like breeze,
  Oh it were sweet to think
    That May should be ours again,
  Hoping it not, I shrink,
    Out of the sight of men.
  May brings the flowers to bloom,
    It brings the green leaves to the tree,
  And the fatally sweet perfume,
    Of what you once were to me.
DREAMS
  What dreams we have and how they fly
  Like rosy clouds across the sky;
    Of wealth, of fame, of sure success,
    Of love that comes to cheer and bless;
  And how they wither, how they fade,
  The waning wealth, the jilting jade--
    The fame that for a moment gleams,
    Then flies forever,--dreams, ah--dreams!
  O burning doubt and long regret,
  O tears with which our eyes are wet,
    Heart-throbs, heart-aches, the glut of pain,
    The somber cloud, the bitter rain,
  You were not of those dreams--ah! well,
  Your full fruition who can tell?
    Wealth, fame, and love, ah! love that beams
    Upon our souls, all dreams--ah! dreams.
THE TRYST
  De night creep down erlong de lan',
    De shadders rise an' shake,
  De frog is sta'tin' up his ban',
    De cricket is awake;
  My wo'k is mos' nigh done, Celes',
    To-night I won't be late,
  I 's hu'yin' thoo my level bes',
    Wait fu' me by de gate.
  De mockin'-bird 'll sen' his glee
    A-thrillin' thoo and thoo,
  I know dat ol' magnolia-tree
    Is smellin' des' fu' you;
  De jessamine erside de road
    Is bloomin' rich an' white,
  My hea't 's a-th'obbin' 'cause it knowed
    You 'd wait fu' me to-night.
  Hit 's lonesome, ain't it, stan'in' thaih
    Wid no one nigh to talk?
  But ain't dey whispahs in de aih
    Erlong de gyahden walk?
  Don't somep'n kin' o' call my name,
    An' say "he love you bes'"?
  Hit 's true, I wants to say de same,
    So wait fu' me, Celes'.
  Sing somep'n fu' to pass de time,
    Outsing de mockin'-bird,
  You got de music an' de rhyme,
    You beat him wid de word.
  I 's comin' now, my wo'k is done,
    De hour has come fu' res',
  I wants to fly, but only run--
    Wait fu' me, deah Celes'.

THE DOVE
  Out of the sunshine and out of the heat,
  Out of the dust of the grimy street,
  A song fluttered down in the form of a dove,
  And it bore me a message, the one word--Love!
  Ah, I was toiling, and oh, I was sad:
  I had forgotten the way to be glad.
  Now, smiles for my sadness and for my toil, rest
  Since the dove fluttered down to its home in my breast!
A WARM DAY IN WINTER
  "Sunshine on de medders,
    Greenness on de way;
  Dat 's de blessed reason
    I sing all de day."
  Look hyeah! Whut you axin'?
    Whut meks me so merry?
  'Spect to see me sighin'
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary?
  'Long de stake an' rider
    Seen a robin set;
  W'y hit 'mence a-thawin',
    Groun' is monst'ous wet.
  Den you stan' dah wond'rin',
    Lookin' skeert an' stary;
  I's a right to caper
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary.
  Missis gone a-drivin',
    Mastah gone to shoot;
  Ev'ry da'ky lazin'
    In de sun to boot.
  Qua'tah 's moughty pleasant,
    Hangin' 'roun' my Mary;
  Cou'tin' boun' to prospah
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary.
  Cidah look so pu'ty
    Po'in' f'om de jug--
  Don' you see it's happy?

  Now's de time fu' people
    Fu' to try an' bury
  All dey grief an' sorrer,
    W'en hit's wa'm in Febawary.
SNOWIN'
  Dey is snow upon de meddahs, dey is snow upon de hill,
  An' de little branch's watahs is all glistenin' an' still;
  De win' goes roun' de cabin lak a sperrit wan'erin' 'roun'.
  An' de chillen shakes an' shivahs as dey listen to de soun'.
  Dey is hick'ry in de fiahplace, whah de blaze is risin' high,
  But de heat it meks ain't wa'min' up de gray clouds in de sky.
  Now an' den I des peep outside, den I hurries to de do',
  Lawd a mussy on my body, how I wish it would n't snow!
  I kin stan' de hottes' summah, I kin stan' de wettes' fall,
  I kin stan' de chilly springtime in de ploughland, but dat's all;
  Fu' de ve'y hottes' fiah nevah tells my skin a t'ing,
  W'en de snow commence a-flyin', an' de win' begin to sing.
  Dey is plenty wood erroun' us, an' I chop an' tote it in,
  But de t'oughts dat I 's a t'inkin' while I 's wo'kin' is a sin.
  I kin keep f'om downright swahin' all de time I 's on de go,
  But my hea't is full o' cuss-wo'ds w'en I's trampin' thoo de snow.
  What you say, you Lishy Davis, dat you see a possum's tracks?
  Look hyeah, boy, you stop yo' foolin', bring ol' Spot, an' bring de ax.
  Is I col'? Go way, now, Mandy, what you t'ink I's made of?--sho,
  W'y dis win' is des ez gentle, an' dis ain't no kin' o' snow.
  Dis hyeah weathah 's des ez healthy ez de wa'mest summah days.
  All you chillen step up lively, pile on wood an' keep a blaze.
  What's de use o' gittin' skeery case dey 's snow upon de groun'?
  Huh-uh, I 's a reg'lar snowbird ef dey 's any possum 'roun'.
  Go on, Spot, don' be so foolish; don' you see de signs o' feet.
  What you howlin' fu? Keep still, suh, cose de col' is putty sweet;
  But we goin' out on bus'ness, an' hit 's bus'ness o' de kin'
  Dat mus' put a dog an' dahky in a happy frame o' min'.
  Yes, you 's col'; I know it, Spotty, but you des stay close to me,
  An' I 'll mek you hot ez cotton w'en we strikes de happy tree.
  No, I don' lak wintah weathah, an' I 'd wush 't uz allus June,
  Ef it was n't fu' de trackin' o' de possum an' de coon.
KEEP A SONG UP ON DE WAY
  Oh, de clouds is mighty heavy
  An' de rain is mighty thick;
   Keep a song up on de way.
  An' de waters is a rumblin'
  On de boulders in de crick,
    Keep a song up on de way.
  Fu' a bird ercross de road
  Is a-singin' lak he knowed
  Dat we people did n't daih
  Fu' to try de rainy aih
    Wid a song up on de way.
  What's de use o' gittin' mopy,
  Case de weather ain' de bes'!
    Keep a song up on de way.
  W'en de rain is fallin' ha'des',
  Dey 's de longes' times to res'
    Keep a song up on de way.
  Dough de plough 's a-stan'in' still
  Dey 'll be watah fu' de mill,
  Rain mus' come ez well ez sun
  'Fo' de weathah's wo'k is done,
    Keep a song up on de way.
  W'y hit's nice to hyeah de showahs
  Fallin' down ermong de trees:
    Keep a song up on de way.
  Ef de birds don' bothah 'bout it,
  But go singin' lak dey please,
    Keep a song up on de way.
  You don' s'pose I's gwine to see
  Dem ah fowls do mo' dan me?
  No, suh, I 'll des chase dis frown,
  An' aldough de rain fall down,
    Keep a song up on de way.
THE TURNING OF THE BABIES IN THE BED
  Woman's sho' a cur'ous critter, an' dey ain't no doubtin' dat.
  She's a mess o' funny capahs f'om huh slippahs to huh hat.
  Ef you tries to un'erstan' huh, an' you fails, des' up an' say:
  "D' ain't a bit o' use to try to un'erstan' a woman's way."
  I don' mean to be complainin', but I 's jes' a-settin' down
  Some o' my own obserwations, w'en I cas' my eye eroun'.
  Ef you ax me fu' to prove it, I ken do it mighty fine,
  Fu' dey ain't no bettah 'zample den dis ve'y wife o' mine.
  In de ve'y hea't o' midnight, w'en I 's sleepin' good an' soun',
  I kin hyeah a so't o' rustlin' an' somebody movin' 'roun'.
  An' I say, "Lize, whut you doin'?" But she frown an' shek huh haid,
  "Heish yo' mouf, I's only tu'nin' of de chillun in de bed.
  "Don' you know a chile gits restless, layin' all de night one way?
  An' you' got to kind o' 'range him sev'al times befo' de day?
  So de little necks won't worry, an' de little backs won't break;
  Don' you t'ink case chillun 's chillun dey hain't got no pain an' ache."
  So she shakes 'em, an' she twists 'em, an' she tu'ns 'em 'roun' erbout,
  'Twell I don' see how de chillun evah keeps f'om hollahin' out.
  Den she lif's 'em up head down'ards, so's dey won't git livahgrown,
  But dey snoozes des' ez peaceful ez a liza'd on a stone.
  W'en hit's mos' nigh time fu' wakin' on de dawn o' jedgment day,
  Seems lak I kin hyeah ol' Gab'iel lay his trumpet down an' say,
  "Who dat walkin' 'roun' so easy, down on earf ermong de dead?"--
  'T will be Lizy up a-tu'nin' of de chillun in de bed.
THE DANCE
  Heel and toe, heel and toe,
   That is the song we sing;
  Turn to your partner and curtsey low,
   Balance and forward and swing.
  Corners are draughty and meadows are white,
  This is the game for a winter's night.
  Hands around, hands around,
    Trip it, and not too slow;
  Clear is the fiddle and sweet its sound,
    Keep the girls' cheeks aglow.
  Still let your movements be dainty and light,
  This is the game for a winter's night.
  Back to back, back to back,
    Turn to your place again;
  Never let lightness nor nimbleness lack,
    Either in maidens or men.
  Time hasteth ever, beware of its flight,
  Oh, what a game for a winter's night!
  Slower now, slower now,
    Softer the music sighs;
  Look, there are beads on your partner's brow
    Though there be light in her eyes.
  Lead her away and her grace requite,
  So goes the game on a winter's night.
SOLILOQUY OF A TURKEY
  Dey 's a so't o' threatenin' feelin' in de blowin' of de breeze,
    An' I 's feelin' kin' o' squeamish in de night;
  I 's a-walkin' 'roun' a-lookin' at de diffunt style o' trees,
    An' a-measurin' dey thickness an' dey height.
  Fu' dey 's somep'n mighty 'spicious in de looks de da'kies give,
    Ez dey pass me an' my fambly on de groun,'
  So it 'curs to me dat lakly, ef I caihs to try an' live,
    It concehns me fu' to 'mence to look erroun'.
  Dey's a cu'ious kin' o' shivah runnin' up an' down my back,
    An' I feel my feddahs rufflin' all de day,
  An' my laigs commence to trimble evah blessid step I mek;
    W'en I sees a ax, I tu'ns my head away.
  Folks is go'gin' me wid goodies, an' dey 's treatin' me wid caih,
    An' I 's fat in spite of all dat I kin do.
  I 's mistrus'ful of de kin'ness dat's erroun' me evahwhaih,
    Fu' it 's jes' too good, an' frequent, to be true.
  Snow 's a-fallin' on de medders, all erroun' me now is white,
    But I 's still kep' on a-roostin' on de fence;
  Isham comes an' feels my breas'bone, an' he hefted me las' night,
    An' he 's gone erroun' a-grinnin' evah sence.
  'T ain't de snow dat meks me shivah; 't ain't de col' dat meks me
       shake;
    'T ain't de wintah-time itse'f dat's 'fectin' me;
  But I t'ink de time is comin', an' I 'd bettah mek a break,
    Fu' to set wid Mistah Possum in his tree.
  Wen you hyeah de da'kies singin', an' de quahtahs all is gay,
    'T ain't de time fu' birds lak me to be 'erroun';
  Wen de hick'ry chip is flyin', an' de log 's been ca'ied erway,
    Den hit's dang'ous to be roostin' nigh he groun'.
  Grin on, Isham! Sing on, da'kies! But I flop my wings an' go
    Fu' de sheltah of de ve'y highest tree,
  Fu' dey 's too much close ertention--an' dey's too much fallin' snow--
    An' it's too nigh Chris'mus mo'nin' now fu' me.
FISHING
  Wen I git up in de mo'nin' an' de clouds is big an' black,
  Dey's a kin' o' wa'nin' shivah goes a-scootin' down my back;
  Den I says to my ol' ooman ez I watches down de lane,
  "Don't you so't o' reckon, Lizy, dat we gwine to have some rain?"
  "Go on, man," my Lizy answah, "you cain't fool me, not a bit,
  I don't see no rain a-comin', ef you's wishin' fu' it, quit;
  Case de mo' you t'ink erbout it, an de mo' you pray an' wish,
  W'y de rain stay 'way de longah, spechul ef you wants to fish."
  But I see huh pat de skillet, an' I see huh cas' huh eye
  Wid a kin' o' anxious motion to'ds de da'kness in de sky;
  An' I knows whut she 's a-t'inkin', dough she tries so ha'd to hide.
  She 's a-sayin', "Would n't catfish now tas'e monst'ous bully, fried?"
  Den de clouds git black an' blackah, an' de thundah 'mence to roll,
  An' de rain, it 'mence a-fallin'. Oh, I's happy, bless my soul!
  Ez I look at dat ol' skillet, an' I 'magine I kin see
  Jes' a slew o' new-ketched catfish sizzlin' daih fu' huh an' me.
  'T ain't no use to go a-ploughin', fu' de groun' 'll be too wet,
  So I puts out fu' de big house at a moughty pace, you bet,
  An' ol' mastah say, "Well, Lishy, ef you t'ink hit 's gwine to rain,
  Go on fishin', hit 's de weathah, an' I 'low we cain't complain."
  Talk erbout a dahky walkin' wid his haid up in de aih!
  Have to feel mine evah minute to be sho' I got it daih;
  En' de win' is cuttin' capahs an' a-lashin' thoo de trees,
  But de rain keeps on a-singin' blessed songs, lak "Tek yo' ease."
  Wid my pole erpon my shouldah an' my wo'm can in my han',
  I kin feel de fish a-waitin' w'en I strikes de rivah's san';
  Nevah min', you ho'ny scoun'els, need n' swim erroun' an' grin,
  I 'll be grinnin' in a minute w'en I 'mence to haul you in.
  W'en de fish begin to nibble, an' de co'k begin to jump,
  I 's erfeahed dat dey 'll quit bitin', case dey hyeah my hea't go "thump,"
  'Twell de co'k go way down undah, an' I raise a awful shout,
  Ez a big ol' yallah belly comes a gallivantin' out.
  Need n't wriggle, Mistah Catfish, case I got you jes' de same,
  You been eatin', I 'll be eatin', an' we needah ain't to blame.
  But you need n't feel so lonesome fu' I 's th'owin' out to see
  Ef dey ain't some of yo' comrades fu' to keep you company.
  Spo't, dis fishin'! now you talkin', w'y dey ain't no kin' to beat;
  I don' keer ef I is soakin', laigs, an' back, an' naik, an' feet,
  It 's de spo't I 's lookin' aftah. Hit 's de pleasure an' de fun,
  Dough I knows dat Lizy 's waitin' wid de skillet w'en I's done.
A PLANTATION PORTRAIT
  Hain't you see my Mandy Lou,
    Is it true?
  Whaih you been f'om day to day,
    Whaih, I say?
  Dat you say you nevah seen
    Dis hyeah queen
  Walkin' roun' f'om fiel' to street

  Slendah ez a saplin' tree;

  Straight an' graceful, 'dout a limb,
    Sweet an' slim.
  Browner den de frush's wing,
    An' she sing
  Lak he mek his wa'ble ring
    In de spring;
  But she sholy beat de frush,
    Hyeah me, hush:
  Wen she sing, huh teef kin show
    White ez snow.
  Eyes ez big an' roun' an' bright
    Ez de light
  Whut de moon gives in de prime
    Harvest time.
  An' huh haih a woolly skein,
    Black an' plain.
  Hol's you wid a natchul twis'
    Close to bliss.
  Tendah han's dat mek yo' own
    Feel lak stone;
  Easy steppin', blessid feet,
    Small an' sweet.
  Hain't you seen my Mandy Lou,
    Is it true?
  Look at huh befo' she's gone,
    Den pass on!
A LITTLE CHRISTMAS BASKET
  De win' is hollahin' "Daih you" to de shuttahs an' de fiah,
    De snow's a-sayin' "Got you" to de groun',
  Fu' de wintah weathah 's come widout a-askin' ouah desiah,
    An' he 's laughin' in his sleeve at whut he foun';
  Fu' dey ain't nobody ready wid dey fuel er dey food,
    An' de money bag look timid lak, fu' sho',
  So we want ouah Chrismus sermon, but we 'd lak it ef you could
    Leave a little Chrismus basket at de do'.
  Wha 's de use o' tellin' chillen 'bout a Santy er a Nick,
    An' de sto'ies dat a body allus tol'?
  When de harf is gray wid ashes an' you has n't got a stick
    Fu' to warm dem when dey little toes is col'?
  Wha 's de use o' preachin' 'ligion to a man dat's sta'ved to def,
    An' a-tellin' him de Mastah will pu'vide?
  Ef you want to tech his feelin's, save yo' sermons an' yo' bref,
    Tek a little Chrismus basket by yo' side.
  'T ain't de time to open Bibles an' to lock yo' cellah do',
    'T ain't de time to talk o' bein' good to men;
  Ef you want to preach a sermon ez you nevah preached befo',
    Preach dat sermon wid a shoat er wid er hen;
  Bein' good is heap sight bettah den a-dallyin' wid sin,
    An' dey ain't nobody roun' dat knows it mo',
  But I t'ink dat 'ligion 's sweeter w'en it kind o' mixes in
    Wid a little Chrismus basket at de do'.
THE VALSE
  When to sweet music my lady is dancing
    My heart to mild frenzy her beauty inspires.
  Into my face are her brown eyes a-glancing,
    And swift my whole frame thrills with tremulous fires.
  Dance, lady, dance, for the moments are fleeting,
    Pause not to place yon refractory curl;
  Life is for love and the night is for sweeting;
    Dreamily, joyously, circle and whirl.
  Oh, how those viols are throbbing and pleading;
    A prayer is scarce needed in sound of their strain.
  Surely and lightly as round you are speeding,
    You turn to confusion my heart and my brain.
  Dance, lady, dance to the viol's soft calling,
    Skip it and trip it as light as the air;
  Dance, for the moments like rose leaves are falling,
    Strikes, now, the clock from its place on the stair.
  Now sinks the melody lower and lower,
    The weary musicians scarce seeming to play.
  Ah, love, your steps now are slower and slower,
    The smile on your face is more sad and less gay.
  Dance, lady, dance to the brink of our parting,
    My heart and your step must not fail to be light.
  Dance! Just a turn--tho' the tear-drop be starting.
    Ah--now it is done--so--my lady, good-night!
REPONSE
  When Phyllis sighs and from her eyes
  The light dies out; my soul replies
  With misery of deep-drawn breath,
  E'en as it were at war with death.
  When Phyllis smiles, her glance beguiles
  My heart through love-lit woodland aisles,
  And through the silence high and clear,
  A wooing warbler's song I hear.
  But if she frown, despair comes down,
  I put me on my sack-cloth gown;
  So frown not, Phyllis, lest I die,
  But look on me with smile or sigh.
MY SWEET BROWN GAL
  W'en de clouds is hangin' heavy in de sky,
  An' de win's 's a-taihin' moughty vig'rous by,
  I don' go a-sighin' all erlong de way;

  Let de rain go splashin', let de thundah raih,
  Dey 's a happy sheltah, an' I 's goin' daih.

  But I 's got de comp'ny o' my sweet brown gal.

  Sweetah den a bluebird flutterin' erroun',
  W'en he sees de steamin' o' de new ploughed groun'.
  Den I hugs huh closah, closah to my breas'.
  Need n't sing, my da'lin', tek you' hones' res'.
  Does I mean Malindy, Mandy, Lize er Sal?
  No, I means my fiddle-dat's my sweet brown gal!
SPRING FEVER
  Grass commence a-comin'

  Evah bird dat whistles

  Cain't sleep in de mo'nin',

  Bluebird an' de robin,

  Bluebird sass de robin,
    Robin sass him back,
  Den de bluebird scol' him
    'Twell his face is black.
  Would n' min' de quoilin'

  'Cept it wakes me early,
    Case hit 's done in song.
  Anybody wo'kin'
    Wants to sleep ez late
  Ez de folks 'll 'low him,

  Mastah, he's a-scol'in',

SONG
  Wintah, summah, snow er shine,
    Hit's all de same to me,
  Ef only I kin call you mine,
    An' keep you by my knee.
  Ha'dship, frolic, grief er caih,
    Content by night an' day,
  Ef only I kin see you whaih
    You wait beside de way.
  Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,
    My soul will still be free,
  Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs
    You walk de worl' wid me.
  Bird-song, breeze-wail, chune er moan,
    What puny t'ings dey 'll be,
  Ef w'en I 's seemin' all erlone,
    I knows yo' hea't 's wid me.
THE COLORED BAND
  Wen de colo'ed ban' comes ma'chin' down de street,
  Don't you people stan' daih starin'; lif yo' feet!
    Ain't dey playin'? Hip, hooray!
    Stir yo' stumps an' cleah de way,
  Fu' de music dat dey mekin' can't be beat.
  Oh, de major man's a-swingin' of his stick,
  An' de pickaninnies crowdin' roun' him thick;
    In his go'geous uniform,
    He 's de lightnin' of de sto'm,
  An' de little clouds erroun' look mighty slick.
  You kin hyeah a fine perfo'mance w'en de white ban's serenade,
    An' dey play dey high-toned music mighty sweet,
  But hit 's Sousa played in ragtime, an' hit 's Rastus on Parade,
    Wen de colo'ed ban' comes ma'chin' down de street.
  Wen de colo'ed ban' comes ma'chin' down de street
  You kin hyeah de ladies all erroun' repeat:
    "Ain't dey handsome? Ain't dey gran'?
    Ain't dey splendid? Goodness, lan'!
  Wy dey's pu'fect f'om dey fo'heads to dey feet!"
  An' sich steppin' to de music down de line,
  'T ain't de music by itself dat meks it fine,
    Hit's de walkin', step by step,
    An' de keepin' time wid "Hep,"
  Dat it mek a common ditty soun' divine.
  Oh, de white ban' play hits music, an' hit 's mighty good to hyeah,
  An' it sometimes leaves a ticklin' in yo' feet;
  But de hea't goes into bus'ness fu' to he'p erlong de eah,
    Wen de colo'ed ban' goes ma'chin' down de street.
TO A VIOLET FOUND ON ALL SAINTS' DAY
  Belated wanderer of the ways of spring,
    Lost in the chill of grim November rain,
  Would I could read the message that you bring
    And find in it the antidote for pain.
  Does some sad spirit out beyond the day,
    Far looking to the hours forever dead,
  Send you a tender offering to lay
    Upon the grave of us, the living dead?
  Or does some brighter spirit, unforlorn,
    Send you, my little sister of the wood,
  To say to some one on a cloudful morn,
    "Life lives through death, my brother, all is good?"
  With meditative hearts the others go
    The memory of their dead to dress anew.
  But, sister mine, bide here that I may know,
    Life grows, through death, as beautiful as you.
INSPIRATION
  At the golden gate of song
  Stood I, knocking all day long,
  But the Angel, calm and cold,
  Still refused and bade me, "Hold."
  Then a breath of soft perfume,
  Then a light within the gloom;
  Thou, Love, camest to my side,
  And the gates flew open wide.
  Long I dwelt in this domain,
  Knew no sorrow, grief, or pain;
  Now you bid me forth and free,
  Will you shut these gates on me?
MY LADY OF CASTLE GRAND
  Gray is the palace where she dwells,
    Grimly the poplars stand
  There by the window where she sits,
    My Lady of Castle Grand.
  There does she bide the livelong day,
    Grim as the poplars are,
  Ever her gaze goes reaching out,
    Steady, but vague and far.
  Bright burn the fires in the castle hall,
    Brightly the fire-dogs stand;
  But cold is the body and cold the heart
    Of my Lady of Castle Grand.
  Blue are the veins in her lily-white hands,
    Blue are the veins in her brow;
  Thin is the line of her blue drawn lips,
    Who would be haughty now?
  Pale is the face at the window-pane,
    Pale as the pearl on her breast,
  "Roderick, love, wilt come again?
    Fares he to east or west?"
  The shepherd pipes to the shepherdess,
    The bird to his mate in the tree,
  And ever she sighs as she hears their song,
    "Nobody sings for me."
  The scullery maids have swains enow
    Who lead them the way of love,
  But lonely and loveless their mistress sits
    At her window up above.
  Loveless and lonely she waits and waits,
    The saddest in all the land;
  Ah, cruel and lasting is love-blind pride,
    My Lady of Castle Grand.
DRIZZLE
  Hit 's been drizzlin' an' been sprinklin',
    Kin' o' techy all day long.
  I ain't wet enough fu' toddy,
    I 's too damp to raise a song,
  An' de case have set me t'inkin',
    Dat dey 's folk des lak de rain,
  Dat goes drizzlin' w'en dey's talkin',
    An' won't speak out flat an' plain.
  Ain't you nevah set an' listened
    At a body 'splain his min'?
  W'en de t'oughts dey keep on drappin'
    Was n't big enough to fin'?
  Dem 's whut I call drizzlin' people,
    Othahs call 'em mealy mouf,
  But de fust name hits me bettah,
    Case dey nevah tech a drouf.
  Dey kin talk from hyeah to yandah,
    An' f'om yandah hyeah ergain,
  An' dey don' mek no mo' 'pression,
    Den dis powd'ry kin' o' rain.
  En yo' min' is dry ez cindahs,
    Er a piece o' kindlin' wood,
  'T ain't no use a-talkin' to 'em,
    Fu' dey drizzle ain't no good.
  Gimme folks dat speak out nachul,
    Whut 'll say des whut dey mean,
  Whut don't set dey wo'ds so skimpy
    Dat you got to guess between.
  I want talk des' lak de showahs
    Whut kin wash de dust erway,
  Not dat sprinklin' convusation,
    Dat des drizzle all de day.
DE CRITTERS' DANCE
  Ain't nobody nevah tol' you not a wo'd a-tall,
  'Bout de time dat all de critters gin dey fancy ball?
  Some folks tell it in a sto'y, some folks sing de rhyme,
  'Peahs to me you ought to hyeahed it, case hit 's ol' ez time.
  Well, de critters all was p'osp'ous, now would be de chance
  Fu' to tease ol' Pa'son Hedgehog, givin' of a dance;
  Case, you know, de critters' preachah was de stric'est kin',
  An' he nevah made no 'lowance fu' de frisky min'.
  So dey sont dey inbitations, Raccoon writ 'em all,
  "Dis hyeah note is to inbite you to de Fancy Ball;
  Come erlong an' bring yo' ladies, bring yo' chillun too,
  Put on all yo' bibs an' tuckahs, show whut you kin do."
  W'en de night come, dey all gathahed in a place dey knowed,
  Fu' enough erway f'om people, nigh enough de road,
  All de critters had ersponded, Hop-Toad up to Baih,
  An' I 's hyeah to tell you, Pa'son Hedgehog too, was daih.
  Well, dey talked an' made dey 'bejunce, des lak critters do,
  An' dey walked an' p'omenaded 'roun' an' thoo an' thoo;
  Jealous ol' Mis' Fox, she whispah, "See Mis' Wildcat daih,
  Ain't hit scan'lous, huh a-comin' wid huh shouldahs baih?"
  Ol' man T'utle was n't honin' fu' no dancin' tricks,
  So he stayed by ol' Mis' Tu'tle, talkin' politics;
  Den de ban' hit 'mence a-playin' critters all to place,
  Fou' ercross an' fou' stan' sideways, smilin' face to face.
  'Fessah Frog, he play de co'net, Cricket play de fife,
  Slews o' Grasshoppahs a-fiddlin' lak to save dey life;
  Mistah Crow, 'he call de figgers, settin' in a tree,
  Huh, uh! how dose critters sasshayed was a sight to see.
  Mistah Possom swing Mis' Rabbit up an' down de flo',
  Ol' man Baih, he ain't so nimble, an' it mek him blow;
  Raccoon dancin' wid Mis' Squ'il squeeze huh little han',
  She say, "Oh, now ain't you awful, quit it, goodness lan'!"
  Pa'son Hedgehog groanin' awful at his converts' shines,
  'Dough he peepin' thoo his fingahs at dem movin' lines,
  'Twell he cain't set still no longah w'en de fiddles sing,
  Up he jump, an' bless you, honey, cut de pigeon-wing.
  Well, de critters lak to fainted jes' wid dey su'prise.
  Sistah Fox, she vowed she was n't gwine to b'lieve huh eyes;
  But dey could n't be no 'sputin' 'bout it any mo':
  Pa'son Hedgehog was a-cape'in' all erroun' de flo.'
  Den dey all jes' capahed scan'lous case dey did n't doubt,
  Dat dey still could go to meetin'; who could tu'n 'em out?
  So wid dancin' an' uligion, dey was in de fol',
  Fu' a-dancin' wid de Pa'son couldn't hu't de soul.
WHEN DEY 'LISTED COLORED SOLDIERS
  Dey was talkin' in de cabin, dey was talkin' in de hall;
  But I listened kin' o' keerless, not a-t'inkin' 'bout it all;
  An' on Sunday, too, I noticed, dey was whisp'rin' mighty much,
  Stan'in' all erroun' de roadside w'en dey let us out o' chu'ch.
  But I did n't t'ink erbout it 'twell de middle of de week,
  An' my 'Lias come to see me, an' somehow he could n't speak.
  Den I seed all in a minute whut he 'd come to see me for;--
  Dey had 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias gwine to wah.
  Oh, I hugged him, an' I kissed him, an' I baiged him not to go;
  But he tol' me dat his conscience, hit was callin' to him so,
  An' he could n't baih to lingah w'en he had a chanst to fight
  For de freedom dey had gin him an' de glory of de right.
  So he kissed me, an' he lef me, w'en I 'd p'omised to be true;
  An' dey put a knapsack on him, an' a coat all colo'ed blue.
  So I gin him pap's ol' Bible f'om de bottom of de draw',--
  W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
  But I t'ought of all de weary miles dat he would have to tramp,
  An' I could n't be contented w'en dey tuk him to de camp.
  W'y my hea't nigh broke wid grievin' 'twell I seed him on de street;
  Den I felt lak I could go an' th'ow my body at his feet.
  For his buttons was a-shinin', an' his face was shinin', too,
  An' he looked so strong an' mighty in his coat o' sojer blue,
  Dat I hollahed, "Step up, manny," dough my th'oat was so' an' raw,--
  W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
  Ol' Mis' cried w'en mastah lef huh, young Miss mou'ned huh brothah Ned,
  An' I did n't know dey feelin's is de ve'y wo'ds dey said
  W'en I tol' 'em I was so'y. Dey had done gin up dey all;
  But dey only seemed mo' proudah dat dey men had hyeahed de call.
  Bofe my mastahs went in gray suits, an' I loved de Yankee blue,
  But I t'ought dat I could sorrer for de losin' of 'em too;
  But I could n't, for I did n't know de ha'f o' whut I saw,
  'Twell dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
  Mastah Jack come home all sickly; he was broke for life, dey said;
  An' dey lef my po' young mastah some'r's on de roadside,--dead.
  W'en de women cried an' mou'ned 'em, I could feel it thoo an' thoo,
  For I had a loved un fightin' in de way o' dangah, too.
  Den dey tol' me dey had laid him some'r's way down souf to res',
  Wid de flag dat he had fit for shinin' daih acrost his breas'.
  Well, I cried, but den I reckon dat 's whut Gawd had called him for,
  W'en dey 'listed colo'ed sojers an' my 'Lias went to wah.
LINCOLN
  Hurt was the nation with a mighty wound,
  And all her ways were filled with clam'rous sound.
  Wailed loud the South with unremitting grief,
  And wept the North that could not find relief.
  Then madness joined its harshest tone to strife:
  A minor note swelled in the song of life.
  'Till, stirring with the love that filled his breast,
  But still, unflinching at the right's behest,
  Grave Lincoln came, strong handed, from afar,
  The mighty Homer of the lyre of war.
  'T was he who bade the raging tempest cease,
  Wrenched from his harp the harmony of peace,
  Muted the strings, that made the discord,--Wrong,
  And gave his spirit up in thund'rous song.
  Oh mighty Master of the mighty lyre,
  Earth heard and trembled at thy strains of fire:
  Earth learned of thee what Heav'n already knew,
  And wrote thee down among her treasured few.
ENCOURAGEMENT
  Who dat knockin' at de do'?

THE BOOGAH MAN
  W'en de evenin' shadders
    Come a-glidin' down,
  Fallin' black an' heavy
    Ovah hill an' town,
  Ef you listen keerful,
    Keerful ez you kin,
  So 's you boun' to notice
    Des a drappin' pin;
  Den you 'll hyeah a funny

  Den de rain kin pattah
    Win' blow lak a fan,
  But you need n' bothah

THE WRAITH
  Ah me, it is cold and chill
    And the fire sobs low in the grate,
  While the wind rides by on the hill,
    And the logs crack sharp with hate.
  And she, she is cold and sad
    As ever the sinful are,
  But deep in my heart I am glad
    For my wound and the coming scar.
  Oh, ever the wind rides by
    And ever the raindrops grieve;
  But a voice like a woman's sigh
    Says, "Do you believe, believe?"
  Ah, you were warm and sweet,
    Sweet as the May days be;
  Down did I fall at your feet,
    Why did you hearken to me?
  Oh, the logs they crack and whine,
    And the water drops from the eaves;
  But it is not rain but brine
    Where my dead darling grieves.
  And a wraith sits by my side,
    A spectre grim and dark;
  Are you gazing here open-eyed
    Out to the lifeless dark?
  But ever the wind rides on,
    And we sit close within;
  Out of the face of the dawn,
    I and my darling,--sin.
SILENCE
  'T is better to sit here beside the sea,
    Here on the spray-kissed beach,
  In silence, that between such friends as we
    Is full of deepest speech.
WHIP-POOR-WILL AND KATY-DID
  Slow de night 's a-fallin',
  An' I hyeah de callin,

A GRIEVANCE
  Wen de snow 's a-fallin'
    An' de win' is col'.
  Mammy 'mence a-callin',
    Den she 'mence to scol',
  "Lucius Lishy Brackett,
    Don't you go out do's,
  Button up yo' jacket,
    Les'n you 'll git froze."
  I sit at de windah
    Lookin' at de groun',
  Nuffin nigh to hindah,
    Mammy ain' erroun';
  Wish 't she would n' mek me
    Set down in dis chaih;
  Pshaw, it would n't tek me
    Long to git some aih.
  So I jump down nimble
    Ez a boy kin be,
  Dough I 's all a-trimble
    Feahed some one 'll see;
  Bet in a half a minute
    I fly out de do'
  An' I 's knee-deep in it,
    Dat dah blessed snow.
  Den I hyeah a pattah
    Come acrost de flo'.
  Den dey comes a clattah
    At de cabin do';
  An' my mammy holler
    Spoilin' all my joy,
  "Come in f'om dat waller,
    Don't I see you, boy?"
  Wen de snow 's a-sievin'
    Down ez sof ez meal,
  Whut 's de use o' livin'
    'Cept you got de feel
  Of de stuff dat's fallin'
    'Roun' an' white an' damp,
  'Dout some one a-callin',
    "Come in hyeah, you scamp!"
DINAH KNEADING DOUGH
  I have seen full many a sight
  Born of day or drawn by night:
  Sunlight on a silver stream,
  Golden lilies all a-dream,
  Lofty mountains, bold and proud,
  Veiled beneath the lacelike cloud;
  But no lovely sight I know
  Equals Dinah kneading dough.
  Brown arms buried elbow-deep
  Their domestic rhythm keep,
  As with steady sweep they go
  Through the gently yielding dough.
  Maids may vaunt their finer charms--
  Naught to me like Dinah's arms;
  Girls may draw, or paint, or sew--
  I love Dinah kneading dough.
  Eyes of jet and teeth of pearl,
  Hair, some say, too tight a-curl;
  But the dainty maid I deem
  Very near perfection's dream.
  Swift she works, and only flings
  Me a glance--the least of things.
  And I wonder, does she know
  That my heart is in the dough?
TO A CAPTIOUS CRITIC
  Dear critic, who my lightness so deplores,
  Would I might study to be prince of bores,
  Right wisely would I rule that dull estate--
  But, sir, I may not, till you abdicate.
DAT OL' MARE O' MINE
  Want to trade me, do you, mistah? Oh, well, now, I reckon not,
  W'y you could n't buy my Sukey fu' a thousan' on de spot.
      Dat ol' mare o' mine?
  Yes, huh coat ah long an' shaggy, an' she ain't no shakes to see;
  Dat's a ring-bone, yes, you right, suh, an' she got a on'ry knee,
  But dey ain't no use in talkin', she de only hoss fu' me,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Co'se, I knows dat Suke 's contra'y, an' she moughty ap' to vex;
  But you got to mek erlowance fu' de nature of huh sex;
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Ef you pull her on de lef han'; she plum 'termined to go right,
  A cannon could n't skeer huh, but she boun' to tek a fright
  At a piece o' common paper, or anyt'ing whut's white,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Wen my eyes commence to fail me, dough, I trus'es to huh sight,
  An' she 'll tote me safe an' hones' on de ve'y da'kes' night,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  Ef I whup huh, she jes' switch huh tail, an' settle to a walk,
  Ef I whup huh mo', she shek huh haid, an' lak ez not, she balk.
  But huh sense ain't no ways lackin', she do evah t'ing but talk,
      Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  But she gentle ez a lady w'en she know huh beau kin see.
  An' she sholy got mo' gumption any day den you or me,
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  She's a leetle slow a-goin,' an' she moughty ha'd to sta't,
  But we 's gittin' ol' togathah, an' she 's closah to my hea't,
  An' I does n't reckon, mistah, dat she 'd sca'cely keer to pa't;
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  W'y I knows de time dat cidah 's kin' o' muddled up my haid,
  Ef it had n't been fu' Sukey hyeah, I reckon I 'd been daid;
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  But she got me in de middle o' de road an' tuk me home,
  An' she would n't let me wandah, ner she would n't let me roam,
  Dat's de kin' o' hoss to tie to w'en you 's seed de cidah's foam,
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
  You kin talk erbout yo' heaven, you kin talk erbout yo' hell,
  Dey is people, dey is hosses, den dey's cattle, den dey's--well--
    Dat ol' mare o' mine;
  She de beatenes' t'ing dat evah struck de medders o' de town,
  An' aldough huh haid ain't fittin' fu' to waih no golden crown,
  D' ain't a blessed way fu' Petah fu' to tu'n my Sukey down,
    Dat ol' mare o' mine.
IN THE MORNING
  'Lias! 'Lias! Bless de Lawd!
  Don' you know de day's erbroad?
  Ef you don' git up, you scamp,
  Dey 'll be trouble in dis camp.
  T'ink I gwine to let you sleep
  W'ile I meks yo' boa'd an' keep?
  Dat's a putty howdy-do--
  Don' you hyeah me, 'Lias--you?

  But you go de mo'nin' thoo
  Bu'nin' up de daylight too?
  'Lias, don' you hyeah me call?
  No use tu'nin' to'ds de wall;

  Don' you hyeah me w'en I speak?
  Dis hyeah clock done struck off six--

  Oh, you down, suh; huh, you down--
  Look hyeah, don' you daih to frown.
  Ma'ch yo'se'f an' wash yo' face,
  Don' you splattah all de place;

  Tek dat comb ah' fix yo' haid--
  Looks jes' lak a feddah baid.
  Look hyeah, boy, I let you see
  You sha' n't roll yo' eyes at me.
  Come hyeah; bring me dat ah strap!
  Boy, I'll whup you 'twell you drap;
  You done felt yo'se'f too strong,
  An' you sholy got me wrong.
  Set down at dat table thaih;
  Jes' you whimpah ef you daih!
  Evah mo'nin' on dis place,
  Seem lak I mus' lose my grace.
  Fol' yo' han's an' bow yo' haid--
  Wait ontwell de blessin' 's said;
  "Lawd, have mussy on ouah souls--"
  (Don' you daih to tech dem rolls--)
  "Bless de food we gwine to eat--"
  (You set still-I _see_ yo' feet;
  You jes' try dat trick agin!)
  "Gin us peace an' joy. Amen!"
THE POET
  He sang of life, serenely sweet,
    With, now and then, a deeper note.
    From some high peak, nigh yet remote,
  He voiced the world's absorbing beat.
  He sang of love when earth was young,
    And Love, itself, was in his lays.
    But ah, the world, it turned to praise
  A jingle in a broken tongue.
A FLORIDA NIGHT
  Win' a-blowin' gentle so de san' lay low,
    San' a little heavy f'om de rain,
  All de pa'ms a-wavin' an' a-weavin' slow,
    Sighin' lak a sinnah-soul in pain.
  Alligator grinnin' by de ol' lagoon,
  Mockin'-bird a-singin' to be big full moon.
  'Skeeter go a-skimmin' to his fightin' chune
    (Lizy Ann's a-waitin' in de lane!).
  Moccasin a-sleepin' in de cyprus swamp;
   Need n't wake de gent'man, not fu' me.
  Mule, you need n't wake him w'en you switch an' stomp,
    Fightin' off a 'skeeter er a flea.
  Florida is lovely, she's de fines' lan'
  Evah seed de sunlight f'om de Mastah's han',
  'Ceptin' fu' de varmints an' huh fleas an' san'
    An' de nights w'en Lizy Ann ain' free.
  Moon 's a-kinder shaddered on de melon patch;
    No one ain't a-watchin' ez I go.
  Climbin' of de fence so 's not to click de latch
    Meks my gittin' in a little slow.
  Watermelon smilin' as it say, "I' s free;"
  Alligator boomin', but I let him be,
  Florida, oh, Florida 's de lan' fu' me--
    (Lizy Ann a-singin' sweet an' low).
DIFFERENCES
  My neighbor lives on the hill,
    And I in the valley dwell,
  My neighbor must look down on me,
    Must I look up?--ah, well,
  My neighbor lives on the hill,
    And I in the valley dwell.
  My neighbor reads, and prays,
    And I--I laugh, God wot,
  And sing like a bird when the grass is green
    In my small garden plot;
  But ah, he reads and prays,
    And I--I laugh, God wot.
  His face is a book of woe,
    And mine is a song of glee;
  A slave he is to the great "They say,"
    But I--I am bold and free;
  No wonder he smacks of woe,
    And I have the tang of glee.
  My neighbor thinks me a fool,
    "The same to yourself," say I;
  "Why take your books and take your prayers,
    Give me the open sky;"
  My neighbor thinks me a fool,
    "The same to yourself," say I.
LONG AGO

A PLANTATION MELODY
  De trees is bendin' in de sto'm,
  De rain done hid de mountain's fo'm,
    I 's 'lone an' in distress.
  But listen, dah 's a voice I hyeah,
    A-sayin' to me, loud an' cleah,
  "Lay low in de wildaness."
  De lightnin' flash, de bough sway low,
  My po' sick hea't is trimblin' so,
    It hu'ts my very breas'.
  But him dat give de lightnin' powah
  Jes' bids me in de tryin' howah
    "Lay low in de wildaness."
  O brothah, w'en de tempes' beat,
  An' w'en yo' weary head an' feet
    Can't fin' no place to res',
  Jes' 'membah dat de Mastah 's nigh,
  An' putty soon you 'll hyeah de cry,
    "Lay low in de wildaness."
  O sistah, w'en de rain come down,
  An' all yo' hopes is 'bout to drown,
    Don't trus' de Mastah less.
  He smilin' w'en you t'ink he frown,
  He ain' gwine let yo' soul sink down--
    Lay low in de wildaness.
A SPIRITUAL
  De 'cession's stahted on de gospel way,
    De Capting is a-drawin' nigh:
  Bettah stop a-foolin' an' a-try to pray;
    Lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
  Oh, sinnah mou'nin' in de dusty road,

  Oh, orphans a-weepin' lak de widder do,
    An' I wish you 'd tell me why:
  De Mastah is a mammy an' a pappy too;
    Lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
  Oh, Moses sot de sarpint in de wildahness
    W'en de chillun had commenced to die:
  Some 'efused to look, but hit cuohed de res';
    Lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
  Bow down, bow 'way down, Bow down,
  But lif' up yo' haid w'en de King go by!
THE MEMORY OF MARTHA
  Out in de night a sad bird moans,
    An', oh, but hit 's moughty lonely;
  Times I kin sing, but mos' I groans,
    Fu' oh, but hit 's moughty lonely!
  Is you sleepin' well dis evenin', Marfy, deah?
  W'en I calls you fom de cabin, kin you hyeah?
    'T ain't de same ol' place to me,
    Nuffin' 's lak hit used to be,
  W'en I knowed dat you was allus some'ers near.
  Down by de road de shadders grows,
    An', oh, but hit's moughty lonely;
  Seem lak de ve'y moonlight knows,
    An', oh, but hit's moughty lonely!
  Does you know, I's cryin' fu' you, oh, my wife?
  Does you know dey ain't no joy no mo' in life?
    An' my only t'ought is dis,
    Dat I's honin' fu' de bliss
  Fu' to quit dis groun' o' worriment an' strife.
  Dah on de baid my banjo lays,
    An', oh, but hit's moughty lonely;
  Can't even sta't a chune o' praise,
    An', oh, but hit's moughty lonely!
  Oh, hit's moughty slow a-waitin' hyeah below.
  Is you watchin' fu' me, Marfy, at de do'?
    Ef you is, in spite o' sin,

  Wen dey sees yo' face a-shinin', den dey'll know.
W'EN I GITS HOME
  It's moughty tiahsome layin' 'roun'
  Dis sorrer-laden earfly groun',
  An' oftentimes I thinks, thinks I,
  'T would be a sweet t'ing des to die,
      An' go 'long home.
  Home whaih de frien's I loved 'll say,
  "We've waited fu' you many a day,
  Come hyeah an' res' yo'se'f, an' know
  You's done wid sorrer an' wid woe,
      Now you's at home."
  W'en I gits home some blessid day,
  I 'lows to th'ow my caihs erway,
  An' up an' down de shinin' street,
  Go singin' sof' an' low an' sweet,
      W'en I gits home.
  I wish de day was neah at han',

"HOWDY, HONEY, HOWDY!"
  Do' a-stan'in' on a jar, fiah a-shinin' thoo,
  Ol' folks drowsin' 'roun' de place, wide awake is Lou,
  W'en I tap, she answeh, an' I see huh 'mence to grin,

  Now's de time, ef evah, ef I's gwine to try an' win,

  No use playin' on de aidge, trimblin' on de brink,
  Wen a body love a gal, tell huh whut he t'ink;
  W'en huh hea't is open fu' de love you gwine to gin,
  Pull yo'se'f togethah, suh, an' step right in.
  Sweetes' imbitation dat a body evah hyeahed,

  At de gate o' heaven w'en de storm o' life is pas',
  'Spec' I 'll be a-stan'in', 'twell de Mastah say at las',
  "Hyeah he stan' all weary, but he winned his fight wid sin.
  Howdy, honey, howdy, won't you step right in?"
THE UNSUNG HEROES
  A song for the unsung heroes who rose in the country's need,
  When the life of the land was threatened by the slaver's cruel greed,
  For the men who came from the cornfield, who came from the plough and
            the flail,
  Who rallied round when they heard the sound of the mighty man of the
            rail.
  They laid them down in the valleys, they laid them down in the wood,
  And the world looked on at the work they did, and whispered, "It is good."
  They fought their way on the hillside, they fought their way in the glen,
  And God looked down on their sinews brown, and said, "I have made them
            men."
  They went to the blue lines gladly, and the blue lines took them in,
  And the men who saw their muskets' fire thought not of their dusky skin.
  The gray lines rose and melted beneath their scathing showers,
  And they said, "'T is true, they have force to do, these old slave boys
            of ours."
  Ah, Wagner saw their glory, and Pillow knew their blood,
  That poured on a nation's altar, a sacrificial flood.
  Port Hudson heard their war-cry that smote its smoke-filled air,
  And the old free fires of their savage sires again were kindled there.
  They laid them down where the rivers the greening valleys gem.
  And the song of the thund'rous cannon was their sole requiem,
  And the great smoke wreath that mingled its hue with the dusky cloud,
  Was the flag that furled o'er a saddened world, and the sheet that made
            their shroud.
  Oh, Mighty God of the Battles Who held them in Thy hand,
  Who gave them strength through the whole day's length, to fight for their
            native land,
  They are lying dead on the hillsides, they are lying dead on the plain,
  And we have not fire to smite the lyre and sing them one brief strain.
  Give, Thou, some seer the power to sing them in their might,
  The men who feared the master's whip, but did not fear the fight;
  That he may tell of their virtues as minstrels did of old,
  Till the pride of face and the hate of race grow obsolete and cold.
  A song for the unsung heroes who stood the awful test,
  When the humblest host that the land could boast went forth to meet the
            best;
  A song for the unsung heroes who fell on the bloody sod,
  Who fought their way from night to day and struggled up to God.
THE POOL
  By the pool that I see in my dreams, dear love,
    I have sat with you time and again;
  And listened beneath the dank leaves, dear love,
    To the sibilant sound of the rain.
  And the pool, it is silvery bright, dear love,
    And as pure as the heart of a maid,
  As sparkling and dimpling, it darkles and shines
    In the depths of the heart of the glade.
  But, oh, I 've a wish in my soul, dear love,
    (The wish of a dreamer, it seems,)
  That I might wash free of my sins, dear love,
    In the pool that I see in my dreams.

    It gwine keep on saggin' low.
DIRGE FOR A SOLDIER
  In the east the morning comes,
  Hear the rollin' of the drums
      On the hill.
  But the heart that beat as they beat
  In the battle's raging day heat
      Lieth still.
  Unto him the night has come,
  Though they roll the morning drum.
  What is in the bugle's blast?
  It is: "Victory at last!
      Now for rest."
  But, my comrades, come behold him,
  Where our colors now enfold him,
      And his breast
  Bares no more to meet the blade,
  But lies covered in the shade.
  What a stir there is to-day!
  They are laying him away
      Where he fell.
  There the flag goes draped before him;
  Now they pile the grave sod o'er him
      With a knell.
  And he answers to his name
  In the higher ranks of fame.
  There's a woman left to mourn
  For the child that she has borne
      In travail.
  But her heart beats high and higher,
  With the patriot mother's fire,
      At the tale.
  She has borne and lost a son,
  But her work and his are done.
  Fling the flag out, let it wave;
  They 're returning from the grave--
      "Double quick!"
  And the cymbals now are crashing,
  Bright his comrades' eyes are flashing
      From the thick
  Battle-ranks which knew him brave,
  No tears for a hero's grave.
  In the east the morning comes,
  Hear the rattle of the drums
      Far away.
  Now no time for grief's pursuing,
  Other work is for the doing,
      Here to-day.
  He is sleeping, let him rest
  With the flag across his breast.

LOVE'S CASTLE
  Key and bar, key and bar,
    Iron bolt and chain!
  And what will you do when the King comes
    To enter his domain?
  Turn key and lift bar,
    Loose, oh, bolt and chain!
  Open the door and let him in,
    And then lock up again.
  But, oh, heart, and woe, heart,
    Why do you ache so sore?
  Never a moment's peace have you
    Since Love hath passed the door.
  Turn key and lift bar,
   And loose bolt and chain;
  But Love took in his esquire, Grief,
   And there they both remain.
MORNING SONG OF LOVE
  Darling, my darling, my heart is on the wing,
    It flies to thee this morning like a bird,
  Like happy birds in springtime my spirits soar and sing,
   The same sweet song thine ears have often heard.
  The sun is in my window, the shadow on the lea,
    The wind is moving in the branches green,
  And all my life, my darling, is turning unto thee,
    And kneeling at thy feet, my own, my queen.
  The golden bells are ringing across the distant hill,
    Their merry peals come to me soft and clear,
  But in my heart's deep chapel all incense-filled and still
    A sweeter bell is sounding for thee, dear.
  The bell of love invites thee to come and seek the shrine
    Whose altar is erected unto thee,
  The offerings, the sacrifice, the prayers, the chants are thine,
    And I, my love, thy humble priest will be.
ON A CLEAN BOOK
TO F. N.
  Like sea-washed sand upon the shore,
    So fine and clean the tale,
  So clear and bright I almost see,
    The flashing of a sail.
  The tang of salt is in its veins,
    The freshness of the spray
  God give you love and lore and strength,
    To give us such alway.
TO THE EASTERN SHORE
  I 's feelin' kin' o' lonesome in my little room to-night,
    An' my min 's done los' de minutes an' de miles,

BALLADE
  By Mystic's banks I held my dream.
    (I held my fishing rod as well,)
  The vision was of dace and bream,
    A fruitless vision, sooth to tell.
    But round about the sylvan dell
  Were other sweet Arcadian shrines,
    Gone now, is all the rural spell,
  Arcadia has trolley lines.
  Oh, once loved, sluggish, darkling stream,
    For me no more, thy waters swell,
  Thy music now the engines' scream,
    Thy fragrance now the factory's smell;
    Too near for me the clanging bell;
  A false light in the water shines
    While Solitude lists to her knell,--
  Arcadia has trolley lines.
  Thy wooded lanes with shade and gleam
    Where bloomed the fragrant asphodel,
  Now bleak commercially teem
    With signs "To Let," "To Buy," "To Sell."
    And Commerce holds them fierce and fell;
  With vulgar sport she now combines
    Sweet Nature's piping voice to quell.
  Arcadia has trolley lines.
L'ENVOI.
  Oh, awful Power whose works repel
    The marvel of the earth's designs,--
  I 'll hie me otherwhere to dwell,
    Arcadia has trolley lines.
SPEAKIN' AT DE COU'T-HOUSE
  Dey been speakin' at de cou't-house,
    An' laws-a-massy me,
  'T was de beatness kin' o' doin's
    Dat evah I did see.
  Of cose I had to be dah
    In de middle o' de crowd,
  An' I hallohed wid de othahs,
    Wen de speakah riz and bowed.
  I was kind o' disapp'inted
    At de smallness of de man,
  Case I 'd allus pictered great folks
    On a mo' expansive plan;
  But I t'ought I could respect him
    An' tek in de wo'ds he said,
  Fu' dey sho was somp'n knowin'
    In de bald spot on his haid.
  But hit did seem so't o' funny
    Aftah waitin' fu' a week
  Dat de people kep' on shoutin'
    So de man des could n't speak;
  De ho'ns dey blared a little,
    Den dey let loose on de drums,--.
  Some one toll me dey was playin'
    "See de conkerin' hero comes."
  "Well," says I, "you all is white folks,
    But you 's sutny actin' queer,
  What's de use of heroes comin'
    Ef dey cain't talk w'en dey's here?"
  Aftah while dey let him open,
    An' dat man he waded in,
  An' he fit de wahs all ovah
    Winnin' victeries lak sin.
  Wen he come down to de present,
    Den he made de feathahs fly.
  He des waded in on money,
    An' he played de ta'iff high.
  An' he said de colah question,
    Hit was ovah, solved, an' done,
  Dat de dahky was his brothah,
    Evah blessed mothah's son.
  Well he settled all de trouble
    Dat's been pesterin' de lan',
  Den he set down mid de cheerin'
    An' de playin' of de ban'.
  I was feelin' moughty happy
    'Twell I hyeahed somebody speak,
  "Well, dat's his side of de bus'ness,
    But you wait for Jones nex' week."
BLACK SAMSON OF BRANDYWINE
   "In the fight at Brandywine, Black Samson, a giant negro armed with
   a scythe, sweeps his way through the red ranks...." C. M. Skinner's
   "_Myths and Legends of Our Own Land_."
  Gray are the pages of record,
    Dim are the volumes of eld;
  Else had old Delaware told us
    More that her history held.
  Told us with pride in the story,
    Honest and noble and fine,
  More of the tale of my hero,
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
  Sing of your chiefs and your nobles,
    Saxon and Celt and Gaul,
  Breath of mine ever shall join you,
    Highly I honor them all.
  Give to them all of their glory,
    But for this noble of mine,
  Lend him a tithe of your tribute,
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
  There in the heat of the battle,
    There in the stir of the fight,
  Loomed he, an ebony giant,
    Black as the pinions of night.
  Swinging his scythe like a mower
    Over a field of grain,
  Needless the care of the gleaners,
    Where he had passed amain.
  Straight through the human harvest,
    Cutting a bloody swath,
  Woe to you, soldier of Briton!
    Death is abroad in his path.
  Flee from the scythe of the reaper,
    Flee while the moment is thine,
  None may with safety withstand him,
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
  Was he a freeman or bondman?
    Was he a man or a thing?
  What does it matter? His brav'ry
    Renders him royal--a king.
  If he was only a chattel,
    Honor the ransom may pay
  Of the royal, the loyal black giant
    Who fought for his country that day.
  Noble and bright is the story,
    Worthy the touch of the lyre,
  Sculptor or poet should find it
    Full of the stuff to inspire.
  Beat it in brass and in copper,
    Tell it in storied line,
  So that the world may remember
    Black Samson of Brandywine.
THE LOOKING-GLASS
  Dinah stan' befo' de glass,
    Lookin' moughty neat,
  An' huh purty shadder sass
    At huh haid an' feet.
  While she sasshay 'roun' an' bow,

  An' de lookin'-glass, I 'low,

  All she do, de glass it see,

  Seems to me, hit ought to be
    Drappin' on de flo'.
  She go w'en huh time git slack,
  Kissin' han's an' smilin' back,
  Lawsy, how my lips go smack,
    Watchin' at de do'.
  Wisht I was huh lookin'-glass,
    Wen she kissed huh han';
  Does you t'ink I 'd let it pass,
    Settin' on de stan'?
  No; I'd des' fall down an' break,
  Kin' o' glad 't uz fu' huh sake;
  But de diffunce, dat whut make
    Lookin'-glass an' man.
A MISTY DAY
  Heart of my heart, the day is chill,
  The mist hangs low o'er the wooded hill,
  The soft white mist and the heavy cloud
  The sun and the face of heaven shroud.
  The birds are thick in the dripping trees,
  That drop their pearls to the beggar breeze;
  No songs are rife where songs are wont,
  Each singer crouches in his haunt.
  Heart of my heart, the day is chill,
  Whene'er thy loving voice is still,
  The cloud and mist hide the sky from me,
  Whene'er thy face I cannot see.
  My thoughts fly back from the chill without,
  My mind in the storm drops doubt on doubt,
  No songs arise. Without thee, love,
  My soul sinks down like a frightened dove.
LI'L' GAL
  Oh, de weathah it is balmy an' de breeze is sighin' low.
          Li'l' gal,
  An' de mockin' bird is singin' in de locus' by de do',
          Li'l' gal;
  Dere 's a hummin' an' a bummin' in de lan' f'om eas' to wes',
  I 's a-sighin' fu' you, honey, an' I nevah know no res'.
  Fu' dey 's lots o' trouble brewin' an' a-stewin' in my breas',
          Li'l' gal.
  Whut 's de mattah wid de weathah, whut's de mattah wid de breeze,
          Li'l' gal?
  Whut 's de mattah wid de locus' dat 's a-singin' in de trees,
          Li'l' gal?
  W'y dey knows dey ladies love 'em, an' dey knows dey love 'em true,
  An' dey love 'em back, I reckon, des' lak I 's a-lovin' you;
  Dat 's de reason dey 's a-weavin' an' a-sighin', thoo an' thoo,
          Li'l' gal.
  Don't you let no da'ky fool you 'cause de clo'es he waihs is fine,
          Li'l' gal.
  Dey 's a hones' hea't a-beatin' unnerneaf dese rags o' mine,
          Li'l' gal.
  Cose dey ain' no use in mockin' whut de birds an' weathah do,
  But I 's so'y I cain't 'spress it w'en I knows I loves you true,
  Dat 's de reason I 's a-sighin' an' a-singin now fu' you,
          Li'l' gal.
DOUGLASS
  Ah, Douglass, we have fall'n on evil days,
    Such days as thou, not even thou didst know,
    When thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago
  Saw, salient, at the cross of devious ways,
  And all the country heard thee with amaze.
    Not ended then, the passionate ebb and flow,
    The awful tide that battled to and fro;
  We ride amid a tempest of dispraise.
  Now, when the waves of swift dissension swarm,
    And Honor, the strong pilot, lieth stark,
  Oh, for thy voice high-sounding o'er the storm,
    For thy strong arm to guide the shivering bark,
  The blast-defying power of thy form,
    To give us comfort through the lonely dark.
WHEN SAM'L SINGS
  Hyeah dat singin' in de medders
    Whaih de folks is mekin' hay?
  Wo'k is pretty middlin' heavy
    Fu' a man to be so gay.
  You kin tell dey 's somep'n special
    F'om de canter o' de song;
  Somep'n sholy pleasin' Sam'l,
    W'en he singin' all day long.
  Hyeahd him wa'blin' 'way dis mo'nin'
    'Fo' 't was light enough to see.
  Seem lak music in de evenin'
    Allus good enough fu' me.
  But dat man commenced to hollah
    'Fo' he 'd even washed his face;
  Would you b'lieve, de scan'lous rascal
    Woke de birds erroun' de place?
  Sam'l took a trip a-Sad'day;
    Dressed hisse'f in all he had,
  Tuk a cane an' went a-strollin',
    Lookin' mighty pleased an' glad.
  Some folks don' know whut de mattah,
    But I do, you bet yo' life;
  Sam'l smilin' an' a-singin'
    'Case he been to see his wife.
  She live on de fu' plantation,
    Twenty miles erway er so;
  But huh man is mighty happy
    Wen he git de chanst to go.
  Walkin' allus ain' de nices'--
    Mo'nin' fin's him on de way--
  But he allus comes back smilin',
    Lak his pleasure was his pay.
  Den he do a heap o' talkin',
    Do' he mos'ly kin' o' still,
  But de wo'ds, dey gits to runnin'
    Lak de watah fu' a mill.
  "Whut 's de use o' havin' trouble,
    Whut 's de use o' havin' strife?"
  Dat 's de way dis Sam'l preaches
    W'en he been to see his wife.
  An' I reckon I git jealous,
    Fu' I laff an' joke an' sco'n,
  An' I say, "Oh, go on, Sam'l,
    Des go on, an' blow yo' ho'n."
  But I know dis comin' Sad'day,
    Dey 'll be brighter days in life;
  An' I 'll be ez glad ez Sam'l
    W'en I go to see my wife.
BOOKER T. WASHINGTON
  The word is writ that he who runs may read.
  What is the passing breath of earthly fame?
  But to snatch glory from the hands of blame--
  That is to be, to live, to strive indeed.
  A poor Virginia cabin gave the seed,
  And from its dark and lowly door there came
  A peer of princes in the world's acclaim,
  A master spirit for the nation's need.
  Strong, silent, purposeful beyond his kind,
    The mark of rugged force on brow and lip,
  Straight on he goes, nor turns to look behind
    Where hot the hounds come baying at his hip;
  With one idea foremost in his mind,
    Like the keen prow of some on-forging ship.
THE MONK'S WALK
  In this sombre garden close
  What has come and passed, who knows?
  What red passion, what white pain
  Haunted this dim walk in vain?
  Underneath the ivied wall,
  Where the silent shadows fall,
  Lies the pathway chill and damp
  Where the world-quit dreamers tramp.
  Just across, where sunlight burns,
  Smiling at the mourning ferns,
  Stand the roses, side by side,
  Nodding in their useless pride.
  Ferns and roses, who shall say
  What you witness day by day?
  Covert smile or dropping eye,
  As the monks go pacing by.
  Has the novice come to-day
  Here beneath the wall to pray?
  Has the young monk, lately chidden,
  Sung his lyric, sweet, forbidden?
  Tell me, roses, did you note
  That pale father's throbbing throat?
  Did you hear him murmur, "Love!"
  As he kissed a faded glove?
  Mourning ferns, pray tell me why
  Shook you with that passing sigh?
  Is it that you chanced to spy
  Something in the Abbot's eye?
  Here no dream, nor thought of sin,
  Where no worlding enters in;
  Here no longing, no desire,
  Heat nor flame of earthly fire.
  Branches waving green above,
  Whisper naught of life nor love;
  Softened winds that seem a breath,
  Perfumed, bring no fear of death.
  Is it living thus to live?
  Has life nothing more to give?
  Ah, no more of smile or sigh--
  Life, the world, and love, good-bye.
  Gray, and passionless, and dim,
  Echoing of the solemn hymn,
  Lies the walk, 'twixt fern and rose,
  Here within the garden close.
LOVE-SONG
  If Death should claim me for her own to-day,
    And softly I should falter from your side,
  Oh, tell me, loved one, would my memory stay,
    And would my image in your heart abide?
  Or should I be as some forgotten dream,
    That lives its little space, then fades entire?
  Should Time send o'er you its relentless stream,
    To cool your heart, and quench for aye love's fire?
  I would not for the world, love, give you pain,
    Or ever compass what would cause you grief;
  And, oh, how well I know that tears are vain!
    But love is sweet, my dear, and life is brief;
  So if some day before you I should go
    Beyond the sound and sight of song and sea,
  'T would give my spirit stronger wings to know
    That you remembered still and wept for me.
SLOW THROUGH THE DARK
  Slow moves the pageant of a climbing race;
    Their footsteps drag far, far below the height,
    And, unprevailing by their utmost might,
  Seem faltering downward from each hard won place.
  No strange, swift-sprung exception we; we trace
    A devious way thro' dim, uncertain light,--
    Our hope, through the long vistaed years, a sight
  Of that our Captain's soul sees face to face.
    Who, faithless, faltering that the road is steep,
  Now raiseth up his drear insistent cry?
    Who stoppeth here to spend a while in sleep
  Or curseth that the storm obscures the sky?
    Heed not the darkness round you, dull and deep;
  The clouds grow thickest when the summit's nigh.
THE MURDERED LOVER
  Say a mass for my soul's repose, my brother,
    Say a mass for my soul's repose, I need it,
  Lovingly lived we, the sons of one mother,
    Mine was the sin, but I pray you not heed it.
  Dark were her eyes as the sloe and they called me,
    Called me with voice independent of breath.
  God! how my heart beat; her beauty appalled me,
    Dazed me, and drew to the sea-brink of death.
  Lithe was her form like a willow. She beckoned,
    What could I do save to follow and follow,
  Nothing of right or result could be reckoned;
    Life without her was unworthy and hollow.
  Ay, but I wronged thee, my brother, my brother;
    Ah, but I loved her, thy beautiful wife.
  Shade of our father, and soul of our mother,
    Have I not paid for my love with my life?
  Dark was the night when, revengeful, I met you,
    Deep in the heart of a desolate land.
  Warm was the life-blood which angrily wet you
    Sharp was the knife that I felt from your hand.
  Wept you, oh, wept you, alone by the river,
    When my stark carcass you secretly sank.
  Ha, now I see that you tremble and shiver;
    'T was but my spirit that passed when you shrank!
  Weep not, oh, weep not, 't is over, 't is over;
    Stir the dark weeds with the turn of the tide;
  Go, thou hast sent me forth, ever a rover,
    Rest and the sweet realm of heaven denied.
  Say a mass for my soul's repose, my brother,
    Say a mass for my soul, I need it.
  Sin of mine was it, and sin of no other,
    Mine was it all, but I pray you not heed it.
PHILOSOPHY
  I been t'inkin' 'bout de preachah; whut he said de othah night,
    'Bout hit bein' people's dooty, fu' to keep dey faces bright;
  How one ought to live so pleasant dat ouah tempah never riles,
    Meetin' evahbody roun' us wid ouah very nicest smiles.
  Dat 's all right, I ain't a-sputin' not a t'ing dat soun's lak fac',
    But you don't ketch folks a-grinnin' wid a misery in de back;
  An' you don't fin' dem a-smilin' w'en dey 's hongry ez kin be,
    Leastways, dat 's how human natur' allus seems to 'pear to me.
  We is mos' all putty likely fu' to have our little cares,
    An' I think we 'se doin' fus' rate w'en we jes' go long and bears,
  Widout breakin' up ouah faces in a sickly so't o' grin,
    W'en we knows dat in ouah innards we is p'intly mad ez sin.
  Oh dey 's times fu' bein' pleasant an' fu' goin' smilin' roun',
    'Cause I don't believe in people allus totin' roun' a frown,
  But it's easy 'nough to titter w'en de stew is smokin' hot,
    But hit's mighty ha'd to giggle w'en dey's nuffin' in de pot.
A PREFERENCE
  Mastah drink his ol' Made'a,
    Missy drink huh sherry wine,
  Ovahseah lak his whiskey,
    But dat othah drink is mine,
      Des' 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  Wen you git a steamin' hoe-cake
    On de table, go way, man!
  'D ain but one t'ing to go wid it,
    'Sides de gravy in de pan,
      Dat 's 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  W'en hit 's 'possum dat you eatin',
    'Simmon beer is moughty sweet;
  But fu' evahday consumin'
    'D ain't no mo'tal way to beat
      Des' 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  W'y de bees is allus busy,
    An' ain' got no time to was'?
  Hit's beca'se dey knows de honey
    Dey 's a makin', gwine to tas'
      Lak 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah.
  Oh, hit 's moughty mil' an' soothin',
    An' hit don' go to yo' haid;
  Dat 's de reason I 's a-backin'
    Up de othah wo'ds I said,
      "Des 'lasses an' watah, 'lasses an' watah."
THE DEBT
  This is the debt I pay
  Just for one riotous day,
  Years of regret and grief,
  Sorrow without relief.
  Pay it I will to the end--
  Until the grave, my friend,
  Gives me a true release--
  Gives me the clasp of peace.
  Slight was the thing I bought,
  Small was the debt I thought,
  Poor was the loan at best--
  God! but the interest!
ON THE DEDICATION OF DOROTHY HALL
TUSKEGEE, ALA., APRIL 22, 1901.
  Not to the midnight of the gloomy past,
    Do we revert to-day; we look upon
  The golden present and the future vast
    Whose vistas show us visions of the dawn.
  Nor shall the sorrows of departed years
    The sweetness of our tranquil souls annoy,
  The sunshine of our hopes dispels the tears,
    And clears our eyes to see this later joy.
  Not ever in the years that God hath given
    Have we gone friendless down the thorny way,
  Always the clouds of pregnant black were riven
    By flashes from His own eternal day.
  The women of a race should be its pride;
    We glory in the strength our mothers had,
  We glory that this strength was not denied
    To labor bravely, nobly, and be glad.
  God give to these within this temple here,
    Clear vision of the dignity of toil,
  That virtue in them may its blossoms rear
    Unspotted, fragrant, from the lowly soil.
  God bless the givers for their noble deed,
    Shine on them with the mercy of Thy face,
  Who come with open hearts to help and speed
    The striving women of a struggling race.
A ROADWAY
  Let those who will stride on their barren roads
  And prick themselves to haste with self-made goads,
  Unheeding, as they struggle day by day,
  If flowers be sweet or skies be blue or gray:
  For me, the lone, cool way by purling brooks,
  The solemn quiet of the woodland nooks,
  A song-bird somewhere trilling sadly gay,
  A pause to pick a flower beside the way.
BY RUGGED WAYS
  By rugged ways and thro' the night
  We struggle blindly toward the light;
  And groping, stumbling, ever pray
  For sight of long delaying day.
  The cruel thorns beside the road
  Stretch eager points our steps to goad,
  And from the thickets all about
  Detaining hands reach threatening out.
  "Deliver us, oh, Lord," we cry,
  Our hands uplifted to the sky.
  No answer save the thunder's peal,
  And onward, onward, still we reel.
  "Oh, give us now thy guiding light;"
  Our sole reply, the lightning's blight.
  "Vain, vain," cries one, "in vain we call;"
  But faith serene is over all.
  Beside our way the streams are dried,
  And famine mates us side by side.
  Discouraged and reproachful eyes
  Seek once again the frowning skies.
  Yet shall there come, spite storm and shock,
  A Moses who shall smite the rock,
  Call manna from the Giver's hand,
  And lead us to the promised land!
  The way is dark and cold and steep,
  And shapes of horror murder sleep,
  And hard the unrelenting years;
  But 'twixt our sighs and moans and tears,
  We still can smile, we still can sing,
  Despite the arduous journeying.
  For faith and hope their courage lend,
  And rest and light are at the end.
LOVE'S SEASONS
  When the bees are humming in the honeysuckle vine
    And the summer days are in their bloom,
  Then my love is deepest, oh, dearest heart of mine,
  When the bees are humming in the honeysuckle vine.
  When the winds are moaning o'er the meadows chill and gray,
    And the land is dim with winter gloom,
  Then for thee, my darling, love will have its way,
  When the winds are moaning o'er the meadows chill and gray.
  In the vernal dawning with the starting of the leaf,
    In the merry-chanting time of spring,
  Love steals all my senses, oh, the happy-hearted thief!
  In the vernal morning with the starting of the leaf.
  Always, ever always, even in the autumn drear,
    When the days are sighing out their grief,
  Thou art still my darling, dearest of the dear,
  Always, ever always, even in the autumn drear.
TO A DEAD FRIEND
  It is as if a silver chord
    Were suddenly grown mute,
  And life's song with its rhythm warred
    Against a silver lute.
  It is as if a silence fell
    Where bides the garnered sheaf,
  And voices murmuring, "It is well,"
    Are stifled by our grief.
  It is as if the gloom of night
    Had hid a summer's day,
  And willows, sighing at their plight,
    Bent low beside the way.
  For he was part of all the best
    That Nature loves and gives,
  And ever more on Memory's breast
    He lies and laughs and lives.
TO THE SOUTH
ON ITS NEW SLAVERY
  Heart of the Southland, heed me pleading now,
  Who bearest, unashamed, upon my brow
  The long kiss of the loving tropic sun,
  And yet, whose veins with thy red current run.
  Borne on the bitter winds from every hand,
  Strange tales are flying over all the land,
  And Condemnation, with his pinions foul,
  Glooms in the place where broods the midnight owl.
  What art thou, that the world should point at thee,
  And vaunt and chide the weakness that they see?
  There was a time they were not wont to chide;
  Where is thy old, uncompromising pride?
  Blood-washed, thou shouldst lift up thine honored head,
  White with the sorrow for thy loyal dead
  Who lie on every plain, on every hill,
  And whose high spirit walks the Southland still:
  Whose infancy our mother's hands have nursed.
  Thy manhood, gone to battle unaccursed,
  Our fathers left to till th' reluctant field,
  To rape the soil for what she would not yield;
  Wooing for aye, the cold unam'rous sod,
  Whose growth for them still meant a master's rod;
  Tearing her bosom for the wealth that gave
  The strength that made the toiler still a slave.
  Too long we hear the deep impassioned cry
  That echoes vainly to the heedless sky;
  Too long, too long, the Macedonian call
  Falls fainting far beyond the outward wall,
  Within whose sweep, beneath the shadowing trees,
  A slumbering nation takes its dangerous ease;
  Too long the rumors of thy hatred go
  For those who loved thee and thy children so.
  Thou must arise forthwith, and strong, thou must
  Throw off the smirching of this baser dust,
  Lay by the practice of this later creed,
  And be thine honest self again indeed.
  There was a time when even slavery's chain
  Held in some joys to alternate with pain,
  Some little light to give the night relief,
  Some little smiles to take the place of grief.
  There was a time when, jocund as the day,
  The toiler hoed his row and sung his lay,
  Found something gleeful in the very air,
  And solace for his toiling everywhere.
  Now all is changed, within the rude stockade,
  A bondsman whom the greed of men has made
  Almost too brutish to deplore his plight,
  Toils hopeless on from joyless morn till night.
  For him no more the cabin's quiet rest,
  The homely joys that gave to labor zest;
  No more for him the merry banjo's sound,
  Nor trip of lightsome dances footing round.
  For him no more the lamp shall glow at eve,
  Nor chubby children pluck him by the sleeve;
  No more for him the master's eyes be bright,--
  He has nor freedom's nor a slave's delight.
  What, was it all for naught, those awful years
  That drenched a groaning land with blood and tears?
  Was it to leave this sly convenient hell,
  That brother fighting his own brother fell?
  When that great struggle held the world in awe,
  And all the nations blanched at what they saw,
  Did Sanctioned Slavery bow its conquered head
  That this unsanctioned crime might rise instead?
  Is it for this we all have felt the flame,--
  This newer bondage and this deeper shame?
  Nay, not for this, a nation's heroes bled,
  And North and South with tears beheld their dead.
  Oh, Mother South, hast thou forgot thy ways,
  Forgot the glory of thine ancient days,
  Forgot the honor that once made thee great,
  And stooped to this unhallowed estate?
  It cannot last, thou wilt come forth in might,
  A warrior queen full armored for the fight;
  And thou wilt take, e'en with thy spear in rest,
  Thy dusky children to thy saving breast.
  Till then, no more, no more the gladsome song,
  Strike only deeper chords, the notes of wrong;
  Till then, the sigh, the tear, the oath, the moan,
  Till thou, oh, South, and thine, come to thine own.
THE HAUNTED OAK
  Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
    Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
  And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
    Runs a shudder over me?
  My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
    And sap ran free in my veins,
  But I saw in the moonlight dim and weird
    A guiltless victim's pains.
  I bent me down to hear his sigh;
    I shook with his gurgling moan,
  And I trembled sore when they rode away,
    And left him here alone.
  They 'd charged him with the old, old crime,
    And set him fast in jail:
  Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
    And why does the night wind wail?
  He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
    And he raised his hand to the sky;
  But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
    And the steady tread drew nigh.
  Who is it rides by night, by night,
    Over the moonlit road?
  And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
    What is the galling goad?
  And now they beat at the prison door,
    "Ho, keeper, do not stay!
  We are friends of him whom you hold within,
    And we fain would take him away
  "From those who ride fast on our heels
    With mind to do him wrong;
  They have no care for his innocence,
    And the rope they bear is long."
  They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
    They have fooled the man with lies;
  The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
    And the great door open flies.
  Now they have taken him from the jail,
    And hard and fast they ride,
  And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
    As they halt my trunk beside.
  Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
    And the doctor one of white,
  And the minister, with his oldest son,
    Was curiously bedight.
  Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
    'Tis but a little space,
  And the time will come when these shall dread
    The mem'ry of your face.
  I feel the rope against my bark,
    And the weight of him in my grain,
  I feel in the throe of his final woe
    The touch of my own last pain.
  And never more shall leaves come forth
    On a bough that bears the ban;
  I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
    From the curse of a guiltless man.
  And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
    And goes to hunt the deer,
  And ever another rides his soul
    In the guise of a mortal fear.
  And ever the man he rides me hard,
    And never a night stays he;
  For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,
    On the trunk of a haunted tree.
WELTSCHMERTZ
  You ask why I am sad to-day,
  I have no cares, no griefs, you say?
  Ah, yes, 't is true, I have no grief--
  But--is there not the falling leaf?
  The bare tree there is mourning left
  With all of autumn's gray bereft;
  It is not what has happened me,
  Think of the bare, dismantled tree.
  The birds go South along the sky,
  I hear their lingering, long good-bye.
  Who goes reluctant from my breast?
  And yet--the lone and wind-swept nest.
  The mourning, pale-flowered hearse goes by,
  Why does a tear come to my eye?
  Is it the March rain blowing wild?
  I have no dead, I know no child.
  I am no widow by the bier
  Of him I held supremely dear.
  I have not seen the choicest one
  Sink down as sinks the westering sun.
  Faith unto faith have I beheld,
  For me, few solemn notes have swelled;
  Love bekoned me out to the dawn,
  And happily I followed on.
  And yet my heart goes out to them
  Whose sorrow is their diadem;
  The falling leaf, the crying bird,
  The voice to be, all lost, unheard--
  Not mine, not mine, and yet too much
  The thrilling power of human touch,
  While all the world looks on and scorns
  I wear another's crown of thorns.
  Count me a priest who understands
  The glorious pain of nail-pierced hands;
  Count me a comrade of the thief
  Hot driven into late belief.
  Oh, mother's tear, oh, father's sigh,
  Oh, mourning sweetheart's last good-bye,
  I yet have known no mourning save
  Beside some brother's brother's grave.
ROBERT GOULD SHAW
  Why was it that the thunder voice of Fate
    Should call thee, studious, from the classic groves,
    Where calm-eyed Pallas with still footstep roves,
  And charge thee seek the turmoil of the state?
  What bade thee hear the voice and rise elate,
    Leave home and kindred and thy spicy loaves,
    To lead th' unlettered and despised droves
  To manhood's home and thunder at the gate?
  Far better the slow blaze of Learning's light,
    The cool and quiet of her dearer fane,
  Than this hot terror of a hopeless fight,
    This cold endurance of the final pain,--
  Since thou and those who with thee died for right
    Have died, the Present teaches, but in vain!
ROSES
  Oh, wind of the spring-time, oh, free wind of May,
    When blossoms and bird-song are rife;
  Oh, joy for the season, and joy for the day,
    That gave me the roses of life, of life,
    That gave me the roses of life.
  Oh, wind of the summer, sing loud in the night,
    When flutters my heart like a dove;
  One came from thy kingdom, thy realm of delight,
    And gave me the roses of love, of love,
    And gave me the roses of love.
  Oh, wind of the winter, sigh low in thy grief,
    I hear thy compassionate breath;
  I wither, I fall, like the autumn-kissed leaf,
   He gave me the roses of death, of death,
   He gave me the roses of death.
A LOVE SONG
  Ah, love, my love is like a cry in the night,
  A long, loud cry to the empty sky,
  The cry of a man alone in the desert,
  With hands uplifted, with parching lips,
  Oh, rescue me, rescue me,
  Thy form to mine arms,
  The dew of thy lips to my mouth,
  Dost thou hear me?--my call thro' the night?
  Darling, I hear thee and answer,
  Thy fountain am I,
  All of the love of my soul will I bring to thee,
  All of the pains of my being shall wring to thee,
  Deep and forever the song of my loving shall sing to thee,
  Ever and ever thro' day and thro' night shall I cling to thee.
  Hearest thou the answer?
  Darling, I come, I come.
ITCHING HEELS
  Fu' de peace o' my eachin' heels, set down;
    Don' fiddle dat chune no mo'.
  Don' you see how dat melody stuhs me up
    An' baigs me to tek to de flo'?
  You knows I 's a Christian, good an' strong;
    I wusship f'om June to June;
  My pra'ahs dey ah loud an' my hymns ah long:

    I knows how de backslidah feels;
  So fiddle it on 'twell de break o' de day
    Fu' de sake o' my eachin' heels.
TO AN INGRATE
  This is to-day, a golden summer's day
    And yet--and yet
    My vengeful soul will not forget
  The past, forever now forgot, you say.
  From that half height where I had sadly climbed,
    I stretched my hand,
    I lone in all that land,
  Down there, where, helpless, you were limed.
  Our fingers clasped, and dragging me a pace,
    You struggled up.
    It is a bitter Cup,
  That now for naught, you turn away your face.
  I shall remember this for aye and aye.
    Whate'er may come,
    Although my lips are dumb,
  My spirit holds you to that yesterday.
IN THE TENTS OF AKBAR
  In the tents of Akbar
    Are dole and grief to-day,
  For the flower of all the Indies
    Has gone the silent way.
  In the tents of Akbar
    Are emptiness and gloom,
  And where the dancers gather,
    The silence of the tomb.
  Across the yellow desert,
   Across the burning sands,
  Old Akbar wanders madly,
    And wrings his fevered hands.
  And ever makes his moaning
    To the unanswering sky,
  For Sutna, lovely Sutna,
    Who was so fair to die.
  For Sutna danced at morning,
    And Sutna danced at eve;
  Her dusky eyes half hidden
    Behind her silken sleeve.
  Her pearly teeth out-glancing
    Between her coral lips,
  The tremulous rhythm of passion
    Marked by her quivering hips.
  As lovely as a jewel
    Of fire and dewdrop blent,
  So danced the maiden Sutna
    In gallant Akbar's tent.
  And one who saw her dancing,
    Saw her bosom's fall and rise
  Put all his body's yearning
    Into his lovelit eyes.
  Then Akbar came and drove him--
    A jackal--from his door,
  And bade him wander far and look
    On Sutna's face no more.
  Some day the sea disgorges,
    The wilderness gives back,
  Those half-dead who have wandered,
    Aimless, across its track.
  And he returned--the lover,
    Haggard of brow and spent;
  He found fair Sutna standing
    Before her master's tent.
  "Not mine, nor Akbar's, Sutna!"
    He cried and closely pressed,
  And drove his craven dagger
    Straight to the maiden's breast.
  Oh, weep, oh, weep, for Sutna,
    So young, so dear, so fair,
  Her face is gray and silent
    Beneath her dusky hair.
  And wail, oh, wail, for Akbar,
    Who walks the desert sands,
  Crying aloud for Sutna,
    Wringing his fevered hands.
  In the tents of Akbar
    The tears of sorrow run,
  But the corpse of Sutna's slayer,
    Lies rotting in the sun.
THE FOUNT OF TEARS
  All hot and grimy from the road,
    Dust gray from arduous years,
  I sat me down and eased my load
    Beside the Fount of Tears.
  The waters sparkled to my eye,
    Calm, crystal-like, and cool,
  And breathing there a restful sigh,
    I bent me to the pool.
  When, lo! a voice cried: "Pilgrim, rise,
    Harsh tho' the sentence be,
  And on to other lands and skies--
    This fount is not for thee.
  "Pass on, but calm thy needless fears,
    Some may not love or sin,
  An angel guards the Fount of Tears;
    All may not bathe therein."
  Then with my burden on my back
    I turned to gaze awhile,
  First at the uninviting track,
    Then at the water's smile.
  And so I go upon my way,
    Thro'out the sultry years,
  But pause no more, by night, by day,
    Beside the Fount of Tears.
LIFE'S TRAGEDY
  It may be misery not to sing at all
    And to go silent through the brimming day.
  It may be sorrow never to be loved,
    But deeper griefs than these beset the way.
  To have come near to sing the perfect song
    And only by a half-tone lost the key,
  There is the potent sorrow, there the grief,
    The pale, sad staring of life's tragedy.
  To have just missed the perfect love,
    Not the hot passion of untempered youth,
  But that which lays aside its vanity
    And gives thee, for thy trusting worship, truth--
  This, this it is to be accursed indeed;
    For if we mortals love, or if we sing,
  We count our joys not by the things we have,
    But by what kept us from the perfect thing.
DE WAY T'INGS COME
  De way t'ings come, hit seems to me,
  Is des' one monst'ous mystery;
  De way hit seem to strike a man,
  Dey ain't no sense, dey ain't no plan;
  Ef trouble sta'ts a pilin' down,
  It ain't no use to rage er frown,
  It ain't no use to strive er pray,
  Hit's mortal boun' to come dat way.
  Now, ef you 's hongry, an' yo' plate
  Des' keep on sayin' to you, "Wait,"
  Don't mek no diffunce how you feel,
  'T won't do no good to hunt a meal,
  Fu' dat ah meal des' boun' to hide
  Ontwell de devil's satisfied,
  An' 'twell dey's some'p'n by to cyave
  You 's got to ease yo'se'f an' sta've.
  But ef dey 's co'n meal on de she'f
  You need n't bothah 'roun' yo'se'f,
  Somebody's boun' to amble in
  An' 'vite you to dey co'n meal bin;
  An' ef you 's stuffed up to be froat
  Wid co'n er middlin', fowl er shoat,
  Des' look out an' you 'll see fu' sho
  A 'possum faint befo' yo' do'.
  De way t'ings happen, huhuh, chile,
  Dis worl' 's done puzzled me one w'ile;
  I 's mighty skeered I 'll fall in doubt,
  I des' won't try to reason out
  De reason why folks strive an' plan
  A dinnah fu' a full-fed man,
  An' shet de do' an' cross de street
  F'om one dat raaly needs to eat.
NOON
  Shadder in de valley
  Sunlight on de hill,
  Sut'ny wish dat locus'
  Knowed how to be still.
  Don't de heat already
  Mek a body hum,
  'Dout dat insec' sayin'
  Hottah days to come?
  Fiel' 's a shinin' yaller
  Wid de bendin' grain,
  Guinea hen a callin',
  Now's de time fu' rain;
  Shet yo' mouf, you rascal,
  Wha' 's de use to cry?
  You do' see no rain clouds
  Up dah in de sky.
  Dis hyeah sweat's been po'in'
  Down my face sence dawn;
  Ain't hit time we 's hyeahin'
  Dat ah dinnah ho'n?
  Go on, Ben an' Jaspah,
  Lif yo' feet an' fly,
  Hit out fu' de shadder
  Fo' I drap an' die.
  Hongry, lawd a' mussy,
  Hongry as a baih,
  Seems lak I hyeah dinnah
  Callin' evahwhaih;
  Daih 's de ho'n a blowin'!
  Let dat cradle swing,
  One mo' sweep, den da'kies,
  Beat me to de spring!
AT THE TAVERN
      A lilt and a swing,
      And a ditty to sing,
    Or ever the night grow old;
      The wine is within,
      And I 'm sure 't were a sin
  For a soldier to choose to be cold, my dear,
  For a soldier to choose to be cold.
      We 're right for a spell,
      But the fever is--well,
    No thing to be braved, at least;
      So bring me the wine;
      No low fever in mine,
  For a drink is more kind than a priest, my dear,
  For a drink is more kind than a priest.
DEATH
  Storm and strife and stress,
  Lost in a wilderness,
  Groping to find a way,
  Forth to the haunts of day
  Sudden a vista peeps,
  Out of the tangled deeps,
  Only a point--the ray
  But at the end is day.
  Dark is the dawn and chill,
  Daylight is on the hill,
  Night is the flitting breath,
  Day rides the hills of death.
NIGHT, DIM NIGHT
  Night, dim night, and it rains, my love, it rains,
    (Art thou dreaming of me, I wonder)
  The trees are sad, and the wind complains,
    Outside the rolling of the thunder,
  And the beat against the panes.
  Heart, my heart, thou art mournful in the rain,
    (Are thy redolent lips a-quiver?)
  My soul seeks thine, doth it seek in vain?
    My love goes surging like a river,
  Shall its tide bear naught save pain?

THAT YE BE ONE
A dream I had of busy workers,
Followers of the Crucified,
Men and women of all races,
Laboring meekly side by side.
Prejudice and racial hatred
Had been buried 'neath God's love;
One great thought theirs souls united—
Men, to lead from Self, above.
Shone dark faces as if visions
Of God's glory beamed within,
Shone fair faces with like rapture
Over souls redeemed from sin.
Crumbled down the walls of darkness,
Perished Satan in his pride,
When the hosts of God united,
When they labored side by side.
"Ye are brethren," sweet the message
Until now an empty sound,
Now caught up by holy millions,
Echoed all the world around.
Saxon, Negro, Jew and Hindoo,
All had felt the quickening flame
That had made of every nation
One in Jesus' hallowed name.
Speed, the time, oh, glorious Father,
When in all reality,
Christians out of every nation
May be truly one, in Thee.
IN OLE CA'LINY.
'Twas in de merry month of May,
   When down in ole Ca'liny
De winter to de springs gibs way,
   An' de woods smell sweet and piney,
Hi inhis nes' de bluebird sang
   Jas' lak he was in meetin',
All troo de woods de music rang
   De po' slaves' ears a-greetin'.
'Twas den I sed de words ob love
   O'er which «I long had pondered,
An' kissed de fus de little dove
   To whom my heart had wandered.
She slipped her toil-worn hand in mine
   As dere we stood togedder,
While oberhead de bright sunshine
   Warmed up de sweet spring wedder.
But dat was May. December's bref
   Came sweepin' o'er Ca'liny
An' all de flowers yield' to def
   An' so, too, did my Biny.
I laid her in de woods to res',
   De woods so sweet an' piney,
Where fus' I did my love confess,
   Way down in ole Ca'liny.
OUR CAUSE
Time was when in the Black's defense,
In hours with awful perils dense,
Brave men stood up and plead his cause
And stormed against inhuman laws;
But now where clanked his heavy chain
His slavers would rebind again,
And from him freed but yesterday--
Take every manly right away!
Brave Sumner! Whittier! are ye gone!
Thou hast no like to call upon.
Garrison! Lincoln! We call in vain,
We shall not see thy like again.
Then be the Black his own defense,
And though his struggles be intense,
Fight hard, fight e'er for every right
That's granted by our Charter's might!
A HYMN OF PRAISE
Oh, God, when days were dark indeed,
When we were fast in Slavery's chain,
Thou then our parents' prayers did heed
And helped us freedom to obtain.
And when adrift upon the world
A child race 'mid the great and strong.
Thy banner o'er was unfurled
And gently were we led along.
Help us to e'er remember Thee
And e'er to endless homage pay
For all the great prosperity
Enjoyed by our race to-day.
CLOTELLE—A TALE OF FLORIDA
Clotelle! Orange-blossoms, "A lover and a grave."
"Sweets to the sweet," and laurels for the brave!
Can I tell the story as it was told to me
Down in Florida by the deep murmuring sea?
Gentle muse, I now invoke thee,
Lend thy power while I shall tell
Men the story of a slave-maid
Of the bright-eyed slave Clotelle!
Light and tripping were her footsteps,
Beauteous both her face and form,
Yet no power could protect her
From the trader's golden charm.
Lived Clotelle on a plantation
Near the Gulf Stream's turbid wave
Lived through childhood's years unheeding;
She was but a helpless slave.
Sixteen years had lightly o'er her,
Tenderly o'er the maid had sped,
When the time came to Clotelle
That love's dreams her fancies led.
Cupid threw at her an arrow
Aimed at fair Clotelle his dart,
And love entered the recesses
Of her innocent young heart.
Dark her lover was and stately
As a prince of olden days,
And among slaves both old and young
Naught was heard of Pierre but praise.
Fate smiled on the poor slave lovers,
Oft they met in woodland bowers,
Oft exchanged love-vows in rapture
In those happy stolen hours.
Planned the two a little cabin,
Orange blossoms overhead,
Mocking-birds to lend their music;
Ah, those days too quickly sped!
But one day to the maiden
Sorrow, agony and shame,
For with words of subtile meaning
To her side her master, came.
Said the planter to the maiden,
"Thou art by far too fair to toil;
Hands like thine, so small and shapely,
Were not meant to till the soil."
"Come and be my loved companion,
Robed in silks and jewels rare;
'Tis no miser who entreats thee,
Come and all my riches share."
Shrank poor Clotelle from her master
With a countenance of shame,
While in low and tender accents
She sobbed forth her lover's name.
"I love Pierre, O worthy master,
And death with him beneath the sea
Would suit better far thy maiden
Than a life of shame with thee!"
Then the planter's brow grew clouded
And his voice both harsh and stern.
"If you thus my will defy, girl,
That I am your master you shall learn.
"You love Pierre, you say—my servant;
You prefer my slave to me,
Your love will but prove his ruin;
Never thou his bride wilt be."
Sank Clotelle's young heart with boding,
All her joy was turned to pain,
All the fond hopes she had cherished,
Vanished, ne'er to come again.
From that hour Pierre was doomed
By the planter's wish to die;
For he swore to see him hanging
Lifeless 'neath the southern sky.
At last accused of awful crime
Too hideous to breathe aloud,
Poor Pierre was hanged one fatal day,
Surrounded by a pitying crowd.
Clotelle gazed on him in anguish.
"Farewell, Pierre, my love," she cried.
"Farewell, sweet," to her he whispered,
Ere the fatal noose was tied.
When 'twas o'er, Clotelle stood silent,
Till her eyes the planter's met,
Then she ran like one demented,
Shrieking, "Pierre, thine am I yet."
Rushing to the water's edge,
Plunged she in its maddening foam,
And returned the planter, baffled,
To his princely, slave-bought home.
Rest in peace, Clotelle, sweet maiden;
Near the Gulf Stream's turbid wave,
Thou who for the love of virtue,
All untimely filled thy grave!
A SOUTHERN INCIDENT.
(Founded upon a true incident)
It was in a Southern city,
And the people from near and far
Clad in their august robes of wealth,
Crowded a passing car.
They quickly filled all the seats,
And then began to chat,
Of the weather, country, fashions—
From farms to the latest style hat.
An old colored woman
Came slowly struggling in,
And looked with hopeful glance
A pitying smile to win
On her arm an old worn basket
Hung awkwardly down in her way,
While to the strap she caught wildly.
Eighty years she'd seen if a day.
But men of vigorous manhood
And women young in years,
Kept their comfortable seats in silence
And found her a subject for jeers.
And then a young Southern woman,
And gladly the tale I repeat,
Rose in the car and said kindly,
"Here auntie, take my seat."
An electric shock thrilled the hearers,
She was an old colored woman, you know,
But they knew that the deed they had witnessed
Was as white as the falling snow.
The old woman comfortably nestled
In the depths of her cosy seat.
"Well, you is a rale lady,"
She sighed from her pleasant retreat.
"De Lawd bless you fo' yo' kindness;
You has he'p me mo' dan you kno',
But folks can see you's a lady
Dat nebber hab seen you befo'."
Three cheers for the Southern lady,
Who dared that act to do,
And speed the time when the Southland,
Shall be filled with such charity true.
WHEN MANDY COMBS HER HEAD
If there's one thing more than t'other
'Bout which something might be said,
And a subject that's important,
It's a colored person's head.
My Mandy's been to high school,
And she's got her books down fine;
She can figure like a lawyer,
And read Latin, line for line.
But there's one thing tries her spirit,
And an hour when tears are shed,
Oh, I hear the storm approaching
When my Mandy combs her head.
She starts at it Sunday morning,
Soon as ever she's done her work,
And begins to comb and pull
And to fume and sigh and jerk.
"'Taint no use to try to fix it.
Lord, I wish that I was dead!
Here I've worked hard for an hour
Trying to do something with my head."
Or it may be that at bedtime,
Just before her prayers are said,
Mandy gets the comb an' starts up
Working on her tired head.
How she'll fuss an' pull an' jerk it,
Working on that stubborn fleece,
'Till I hear her mother say,
"Mandy, stop an' get the grease!"
Like the oil upon the waters,
Things get better for a while.
The big comb it quits its jerking,
An' then Mandy tries to smile.
"Lord, I wish I'd been around there
When the Lord was giving hair;
While the white folks was a-getting,
I'd been sure to get my share."
Pap, if Gabriel blows for Judgement,
An' my name you don't hear read,
Don't you'n mammy get excited,
I'll be fixing of my head!
UNCLE NED'S STORY
Lay aside yo' books boys,
An' listen to ole Ned
While I tell to you a story
No man has eber read.
'Twas durin' ob de wah,
De wah ob sixty-three,
When thousan's ob brave Union men
Lef' home the slaves to free.
Way down on de ole plantashun
Was my wife Chloe an' I,
A takin' keer ob po ole Miss,
Who's den about to die.
De Union soldiers came one night,
An' said we'd soon be free;
An' dat we could go 'long o' them,
An' fight for liberty.
Now all had gone sabe us,
De slaves an' massa, too,
An' lef' us home to 'tend ole Miss,
Case dey'd alius foun' us true.
Now, I laks to be called hones',
But I ain' nebber took much stock
In de white folks a-praisin' me,
Dat used the auction block.
My Chloe she made a reg'lar feast
An' watched dem wid delight;
Until dey eat an' den prepared
To march out in de night.
I tied my few ole clo'es up quick,
An' tole Chloe do de same,
But dere she stood jes' lak a block,
An' me callin' her name.
"Come, Chloe, be quick, dey'll go away,
An' we nebber will be free.
Ain't you had enuf ob massa's whip,
An' 'nuf of slavery?
But Chloe she muttered 'bout ole Miss,
Almos' in de grave,
An' said she couldn' leave her den,
Ef 'twas her soul to save.
Chloe stayed, while I marched away
On de battle-fiel';
An' thoughts ob her kept me in heart,
My Chloe true as steel.
When all was done I hurried home,
But no Chloe a welcome gave;
By ole mistress' side she's buried
In a lonely Southern grave!
SEEKING THE LOST
Many Negro newspapers have from time to time
maintained a "Lost" column, for the purpose of
bringing together families that were sold apart
during the period of American slavery.
Is you de blessed editor
   Dat brings de dead to life,
United sons an' darters,
   An' husban's wid dere wife?
You is! Well I'se ole Mose,
   I hails from Virginny,
I'se huntin' fer my long-los' folks,
   Ole ooman' an' little Winnie.
On de banks ob de Missippy,
   In ole Missouri State,
'Twas dar dey took my wife
   When we fus' separate.
My other two chillen was boys,
   Dey's livin' now wid me.
Ef I can fin' my wife an' gal,
   How happy we will be.
I don' min' de money
   I wants my wife an' chile,
I want to see my folks
   I'se mourned for dis long while.
You don't know de sorrow
   Dat's filled my heart for y'ars,
Nor de days an' nites da
   I's spent in bitter tears.
My wife's name was Mandy,
   An' sah, she was a cook,
An' one ob de fines',
   Do' she don' use no book.
Why, Kernel Butler sed her cakes
   Was fit for any king,
An' comp'ny time she was de one
   Dat heaven's gates jes' opened wide
An' den she was a powah in prayer,
   Fer when she prayed it seem
Dat heaven's gates jes' opened wide,
   On all our souls to beam.
What made 'em sell her? Easy tole,
   Dey cleared up de estate
At master's death an' all was sole
   An' 'bliged to separate.
   
Li'l Winnie was de baby then,
   'Twas thirty years or mo.'
Ef libin', she's a woman now,
   An' Mandy's head's lak sno'.
Tink you kno' 'em? Winnie's yo wife,
   Mandy's libin' in dis yeah town!
Praise de Lawd, an' you, too, mister!
   Ole Mose' po' los' lams is foun'!
PHYLLIS WHEATELEY.
O little maid from Afric's slave coasts brought
By traders cruel to be put up and sold
As other goods by scheming merchants are,
A human life exchanged for senseless gold.
Rude, helpless child, right glad am I
That then thy lot and tender years
A woman's generous sympathies awoke
And thou wert christened with a woman's tears.
Oh, little did she dream that genius rare
Slumbered within thy childish brain,
Or that the time would come when thou
Wouldst lasting fame obtain;
But nurtured by a Christian woman's care
In all the graces true and sweet thou grew,
And soon the wise, the famed and the great
To pay thy genius homage quickly drew.
Thy verses with their meloncholy strain
Breathed from a soul so filled with poesy
Won my friends to thee, O Phyllis dear,
And made thy mistress more than proud of thee.
And Washington, our nation's chief,
Paid tribute to thee, gifted Afric maid,
Much pleasure found in lines thy dark hands penned
And thou with courtly praise did lade.
And England, too, applauded thee, dear one,
And read thy graceful verses with all pride.
Alas, that thou while in the bloom of life
Thy earthly task gave o'er—and died!
But, ah, thy memory still is green,
And Afric poets still are inspired by thee,
And thou wilt help them tune their harps
To grander strains of minstrelsy!
IDLERS AND TOILERS.
Heaven's great crowning day had come,
And all had gathered there,
And those who had no sheaves
Cried out in great despair.
"We ate and drank in thy presence
Whilst Thou passed through our street,
We knew Thee Lord, and now we pray
Thee give us welcome meet."
"Ye ate and drank in My presence,
While I passed through thy street,
And carelessly sat and feasted
With beggars unhelped at your feet.
For self ye wholly lived,
Despising Mine and Me.
Depart, ye ruined souls,
That worked iniquity.
"Far from earth's care and its sorrow
Ye lived your lives away.
Crowns are for the toilers,
Stand ye far back, I pray."
And abashed, the idlers vanished
Within a cloud of gloom,
While for' weary toilers
The heavenly hosts made room.
THE HAPPY CHRISTMAS BELLS
The happy Christmas bells are ringing,
The heavenly choir their anthems singing
The sweetest words of tongue or pen—
Peace on earth, good will to men!
A Saviour born in poverty
Brings to the world true liberty.
We sing the song angels sang then,
Peace on earth, good will to men!
The song the angels sang of peace
Its heavenly strains shall never cease,
Till discord from our earth shall flee
And then shall feel soul harmony.
Till man his brother's care shall feel,
And labor for his brother's weal,
And men of every tongue and race
The truths of Christ's great life embrace.
With heavenly hosts Him we adore,
Who all our sins and sorrows bore,
And upward still our songs ascend,
Peace on earth, good will to men!
AT ANCHOR
My bark, so tempest-tossed in days of youth,
Hath anchored now in seas of heavenly truth,
And peace, ne'er found in Pleasure's wanton ways
Now gently hallows all my passing days.
The work unblest, because an idol made
Down at the Cross, my soul at last hath laid
One lingering look at awful Calvary,
One look at Calvary's Christ, hath
Wrought this peace for me.
My faith, before so weak, is suddenly made strong,
I toil but worry not; all doth to God belong.
Dark often is my way, but songs in night time come
As happy pilgrims sing in sight of home.
Henceforth I tread but in the path He trod,
Henceforth I joy but in the love of God.
My life, my all to Thee, O blessed Christ, I give,
To Thee who suffered death that sinful men might live.
Farewell, unrest, and all my worldly pride
The Prince of Peace my soul hath satisfied.
My ship hath cast her anchor; all, all is well,
And mortal tongue can ne'er my soul's deep rapture tell.
OH, AFRICA!
Oh, Africa, dear Africa,
   Upon thy sun-kissed shore,
Shall the sable sons of Hamite sires
   Ne'er be masters more?
Or shall thy glowing splendors
   Of earth and air and sky,
   Except for alien nations
In dark oblivion lie?
Oh, canst thou not arise,
   Dear children of the sun,
As in thy primal strength,
   Before thy day is done?
Shall not thy old proud history,
   Thy pyramids of stone,
Thy mummied kings, thy riches,
   Arouse to crowns unwon?
The Sphinx, that wondrous marvel,
   Shames on us more than thou,
With all thy former glory,
   And naught but languor now.
The best king in the forest, the tiger
   In his lair,
Still throw their lordly challenge
   Upon the evening air.
But thou art torn and bleeding,
   And thou dost not arise,
And all thy fair, fair country
   Is searched by alien spies.
Throw down thy rude, dumb idols,
   Thy gods of wood and stone,
No help is there in idols,
   Help comes from God alone!
COLOR
There is a silent majesty which speaks
From lives of noble men
Of every nation, tongue and clime,
Beyond malicious ken.
And men with countenance as black
As skies of midnight hue
May yet be men of highest type
Of manhood strong and true.
And shall a thing of color be
A certain mark of infamy,
And shall all merit be despised
That's seen thro' color-blinded eyes?
Believe with sturdy Burns,
Manhood depends on worth,
And scorn the prejudice that spurns
The dark-faced men of earth.
THE SUPERANNUATE
Watch him totter down the street,
Haste the dear old man to greet.
From his steps so very slow,
And his voice so thin and low,
Nature doth to us relate
Leaves our superannuate!
But yesterday quite in his prime,
The foremost preacher of his time,
Warning in love old age and youth
To build their lives on Sacred Truth,
How Time did all his powers abate
And left him superannuate!
When first fell the dreaded word,
His inmost soul with pain was stirred
To lay his precious life-work by
And like all wornout things to die,
He felt so old, so out of date,
To be a superannuate!
But still he loves the Sacred Word,
And often shouts, "Praise ye the Lord!"
And bids the younger men go on
And win the prize that he has won.
He is no railer 'gainst his fate,
Our brave old superannuate!
And now he lingers by Death's stream^
Across the wave comes silvery gleam
Of waters still, of pastures green,
And forms arrayed in dazzling sheen,
Mansion and crown for him await,
Thrice blessed superannuate!
IF YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT.
If you are in the right, why, say,
Don't look down in that hangdog way.
Lift up your head, your heart as well,
If you are in the right—why, time will tell.
If you don't think that God is dead,
If you believe the words He's said,
Lift up your head and go along,
Start up a verse of some good song.
When God shall settle His accounts
You'll get just what to you amounts.
If you are right, why, say,
Just lift up heart and voice, and pray!
THE NEGRO.
We hold ourselves too cheaply;
   In God's sight
Manhood is simply manhood, nothing more,
   Nor worse nor better in His truth's clear light,
Then why should we our origin deplore?
If in time past a black man stood
   For naught; if ignorance was
Black Men's bequeathed store,
   It holds not true in days so grandly fraught
With Black Men's genius, spread
The wide world o'er.
We scorn ourselves, our past
Recalls the yoke.
   Are we than others better, once enslaved?
What nation but hath groaned till chains wefe broke?
Till they by some great Moses' hands were saved?
Erect we'll stand, as doth become a man
   "God's image cut in ebony," Fuller said.
Our revealed thoughts and aspirations can
   The world's thought in a juster channel lead.
SEN' ME BACK TO DE SOUF.
What does I wan' fo' Christmus gib?
Now, daughter, don' git mad,
Fo' I mus' say to one an' all,
You is de bes' chile dat I'se had.
You've tried quite hard since I've been heah
To mek me feel young lak an' gay,
But nothin' meks it seem lak home.
I want to be home Christmus Day.
Don' think me ungrateful fo' what you've done;
You have been kin' as kin' can be,
But I miss de sight ob my Southern home,
An' dar's fren's I longs to see.
Dar is ole Marse Jack, dat is gray lak me,
An' who lives jes' fo' blocks away.
He will not be here long, and I'd lak chile to see
Him an' all de res' Christmus Day.
I kno's dat our fo'ks am wronged in de Souf,
But den de Norf hab a spite at dem too,
An I' 'se too ole to be changin' my views,
I laks ole ways better'n new.
Dar's good sister Lu an' ole Uncle Joe,
Dat's missed me while I was away.
Dar's no one heah dat will miss me but you,
I want to be home Christmas day.
Dar's no one dar kno's about de rain,
Nor when it's gwine to sno\ chile, lak me.
Why, de nabors dey alius been 'pendin' on Ned
All ob de signs ob de wedder to see.
Den in the church, when de preacher gibs out
De words dat he has fo' to say,
He needs me to he'p by shoutin' Amen!
I's gwine to be dar dis Christmus Day.
I know dat I ain't stayed away berry long,
An' dey'll laf to see me so soon;
But, chile, I mus' go back to de sweet sunny Souf,
De lan' ob de possum an' coon.
Dar's whar I'se raised an' has buried my dead,
An' now I aint got no mo' fo' to say,
'Cep' dis, ef yo' want yo' ole pap to live,
Sen' him home fo' nex' Chrismus Day.
BASHY.
'A Negro girl killed in a house of shame."
In cities oft you may hear the same.
How the poor girls go down in the struggle of life,
And yield to dishonor, both maid and wife.
But Bashy, I'll swear, never had a chance;
A black face never does enhance
A woman's value in our land.
Black faces are, well—not just in demand.
Not only in proud Anglo-Saxon race,
But Negroes there are who hate a black face!
We have men who will pass a black girl by
Because she is black—that's the reason why.
You see, we look up to the Saxon race,
And prize above all a white man's face!
And our Bashy was black and ignorant, too,
And what was a poor black outcast to do?
She tried hard to work, but a green farm hand,
Is it strange she never could understand
How to please Miladi on the avenue,
Who could not teach her what to do.
Bashy loved, and she gave her all.
The man who caused her awful fall
Thought her too black to make a wife,
So she drifted on to a dreadful life.
Till one day, while filled with maddening drink,
Bashy was thrust o'er eternity's brink
Without a chance for a whispered prayer
That God would have mercy on her despair.
Her murderer was hung, but every day
Some poor girl goes down in the self-same way,
Some Bashy of our struggling race
Is made an outcast by her face!
Some black mother crooming her baby to sleep
Prays now that the Father of all may keep
Her girl away in the city to toil,
Pure from the deeds and thoughts that soil.
When she hears the news of her girl's dark shame,
And the strain she has brought on her soul and her name,
The house will be dark and the mother's heart
Ache till the life-threads break apart.
Oh, women and men of the Negro Race,
Can we not rise above color of face?
Teach our girls that the worst disgrace
Is blackness of life, not blackness of face!
That women are needed pure-souled and high,
Who sooner than fall will prefer to die!
That a black girl needing a helping hand
Will be helped by the blackmen of the land.
Lift the women up and the race ascends;
Let the women go down, and our progress ends.
SHE WHO NEVER HAD A CHANCE 
No, I never had a chance, sir, to be good,
I want it to be plainly understood.
You see, it was this way: mother married again
After father died, and you know what then,
The new father wanted us all out of the way,
And he made us feel it every day.
A curse and a blow, a blow and a curse,
Every day somehow things would grow worse.
Till I got to be near seventeen,
And met with the handsome fellow I had seen.
He'd treated me squarely and things might have gone right
Had not my father on one fatal night
Locked me out of doors, sir, for late coming in,
And called me a name that drove me to sin.
Rich women may leave wine rooms in fine homes to dwell,
But poor girls leave them on journeys to hell.
That's where I went, and these scars on my lace
And my red, swollen eyes tell my frequent disgrace.
It seems that I have been through the whole catalogue of crime,
Under each new lover I have served out my time.
I couldn't be lower if to be- so I tried,
And I often wish when born I had died,
And when the doctor said to me to-day,
"Moll, you will never live to be gray
That heart of yours and that bad cough
Are certain to hurry you off,"
Why, I laughed, for, sir, I just long to die!
Why, ont beneath the cool green grass to lie,
Respected at last, for grim death.elevates all,
I am willing at any time to fall.
Ready to go? No, not if you mean good,
For I know that good people should
Study their Bibles, be steady and pray;
And I, sir, was never brought up in that way.
The lessons I learned were to drink, swear and dance.
To be good,'sir, I never had the chance.
I've looked in cottages as I passed at night,
Little children in mother's arms clasped tight,
Or wee little ones kneeling down to pray,
And I've choked and sobbed and hurried away,
For I am a woman past forty-three,
And no one has ever said prayers to me.
And I have seen happy well-treated wives,
And I've sighed for our own miserable criminal lives;
But I've dared oft to be thankful that no baby came
To share in it's mother's dark life of shame!
But, sir, you are the chaplain, the priest of men's souls;
Some strange question oft within my mind rolls.
These society women that they call swell,
What's going to keep them from hell?
I read the papers and I know their life,
The heartless coquette, the unfaithful wife,
The parlor carousal, the club room's dance,
Don't tell me these people haven't had a chance.
Their names won't take them to heaven, I've heard,
Then they all will be lost, if there's truth in God's word.
They'd never think of helping a woman like me,
Nor could they, for no better are they that I see,
A good deal more money, a fashionable name,
And one in debauchery and in their shame.
Somehow, I have never liked a low life,
And if I had e'er been a good man's wife,
It seems to me no man's jewels or gold
Would have tempted my feet to stray from the fold.
But regrets are in vain, soon all will end,
And down to the grave without smile or friend,
Without, perhaps, one tearful glance,
Exit Moll—she who never had a chance.
THE HEROES OF THE IOWA CONFERENCE
"Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest."
A great man goes, a great man comes,
And all hearts are at rest.
For the zeal of our Grant for the Lord God of hosts
Is one of our proudest loud-spoken boasts.
For Bishop, they say when you stand for the Lord
That sinrters are saved by the power of the Word,
That revivals of blessing break out in your train,
And that forces long dormant awaken again.
We are glad this is true, and in hamlet and town
May the forces of sin through you be pulled down,
And in each of our churches, from end to end
The Holy Spirit in power descend.
A thousand welcomes to you, dear sir.
We have met to-day your heart to cheer,
For the woods are with Methodist preachers thick,
Heroes each one of them, tried men and true,
The makers of our Conference, I present them to you.
And on beehalf of the preachers assembled to-day,
Permit me these words of introduction to say:
Here is our Presiding Elder, Dr. George W. Gaines,
A man who generally says what he means;
Stalwart and staunch, true to his race,
Who some day the bench of bishops may grace;
And Presiding Elder Bundy, absent most of the time,
Overseeing his great work in the Snowball clime.
Here is Dr. Ransom, our brilliant host,
Whose gifts are the Conference' pride and boast.
Dr. Carey, pastor of old Mother Quinn,
A man whose graces are sure to win.
And dear Father Thompson, whom we all love
And hope may be given a seat above.
There's Daniels, a strong and earnest man,
Who says he'll raise money if any man can;
And Tillman, the Joshua of St. John,
Leading the young flock bravely on.
There's Slater, full of gospel fire,
And Butler, looking to go higher.
Dr. Booth, among our scholars the best;
Father Malone, the great pioneer of the West;
Seymour and Shaw, who lately came;
Fenwick and Jones, of growing fame.
I wish I had time to speak of them all,
Theological Reeves and dear Father Hall,
Bass, McDowell, Joplin and Grant,
Holly and Taylor, but you see I can't.
There's Rhinehart, Thomas, Gordon and Boyd;
There's Williamson, Peterson, two Johnsons and Ford;
There's Phillips and Higgins, Dr. McGee,
G. W. Jones and John Ferribee,
Williams, Christy, Jackson and Fort,
Lewis, Porter and Searcy, your hands to support.
Basfield, Taylor, Dowden, you see;
Dr. Peterson, F. J., and his brother, J. D.;
Festimun, Speece, Wharton and Knight,
Anderson and Brooks, young men of great might;
C. Peterson, McNeal and Mr. N. Work,
And Graves, who never a duty will shirk.
From here to the snowy plains of the West
Our heroes go forth and each does his best.
They've toiled hard and built up the work that you see,
And each one is anxious promoted to be.
They follow their Master, they fear no foe;
With you as their Bishop forward they'll go,
Living for Jesus, whatever the cost;
Dying like heroes on guard at their post.
UNCLE NED'S RETURN
"Well, Mary, I'se home once again,
An' my heart.am' brimmin' wid joy
To be at home wid my ole fren's,
Why, hit makes me feel like a boy!
When de engine stopped at de place
Whar de fo'ks dey gits off an' on,
Don' yo min' I waved hit a long farewell,
An' was glad to see hit was gone.
Why, de fo'ks dat was down to de train

Dey come in crowds, an' I felt proud
So many ole fren's thar to see.
I rode home in Massa Jack's chair,
Jo's boys was my hosses dat day,
An' when I got home de house was full,
Dey'd come frum eber which way.
Dey had built a fire on de h'arth,
An' de cabin was good an' warm.
De possum was roasting wid taters round,
An' de fo'ks lak bees 'gan to swarm.
I'se glad to be back home again,
An' my joy grows more wid each day.
Good by, chile, be good to yo'self,
I'se home, an' I'se heah fo' to stay."
UNCLE IKE'S TESTIMONY
De Lawd does save; His Son He gave

Ise surely glad dat I is had
De Lawd my, fren' fo' sho.
De Lawd am mine, an' ebery line

An' conquer in de flight.
He blesses me an' keeps me free
Frum danger an' frum sin.
I praise de Lawd I'se heard His Word
An' He had took me in!
OH, DEAR SOUTHLAND
My heart for thee is longing,
And thoughts of thee keep thronging,
   Oh, dear Southland!
My grief I cannot master,
My tears but flow the faster
When I would them command.
For thee my tears are flowing,
To thee I'd fain be going,
   My dear Southland!
I would that I could see thee,
I'd never, never leave thee,
   My own, my loved Southland!
THE GLAD NEW YEAR
Swiftly cometh the glad New Year,
Leaving in throes of pain
The dying year whose reign is o'er,
And who never will come again.
How shall we meet the glad New Year
As it enters our erring life?
By banishing sin from the door of our heart
And shutting out evil and strife.
If we have erred in the year that is past,
Let us live the New Year aright;
Let us atone for the wrongs we have done
Ere our spirits shall take their flight.
There may be a heart that the glad New Year
Findeth torn and bleeding with pain.
Oh, if thou hast aught to do with its woe,
Go quickly and bring joy again.
FAITH'S VISION
There is a place no mortal eye
   Hath ever seen,
Where spirits of the just may dwell
   In state serene,
Where pomp and pride are laid aside,
   And no one cares
For glittering gems or coronets
   The monarch wears.
The noble of the earth are there,
   The rich in truth,
And some who by the world were deemed
   Poor and uncouth,
The widow there is comforted
   By psalms of joy,
A mother clasps in ectasy
   An angel boy.
There little orphaned hearts are glad
   Around the Throne,
Who oft on earth wept bitter tears,
   Despised alone!
The sick, the sad, who loved the
   Savior well,
Laid crosses by for crowns and went
   With Him to dwell;
There, too, shall we when we
   Have done our task,
   Gave up life's lease,
Begin a life whose wondrous joy
   Shall never cease.
WHEN EDIE'S IN THE KITCHEN.
When Edie's in the kitchen
How my heart with rapture glows,
And when things begin a-smelling
How my zeal no longer knows,
For around I can't help poking
And remarking with a sigh,
I know that something good
Is a-coming by and by.
And I'm never disappointed,
Though, of course, it's hard to wait,
While the salad's fate hangs fire,
Or the pudding boileth late;
But all delays prove raptures
And my reward is sure,
For better cooks than Edie
Never opened oven door
Biscuits always light and puffy,
Fish cooked a la Normandy,
Salads that will fill your spirits
With a sweet, calm ecstacy.
When Edie's in the kitchen
Give yourself no concern,
For everything she dishes up
Will be done just to a turn.
When Edie's in the kitchen and the fellows
Sparkle round,
A little nervous feeling
Kinder makes my,head turn round,
For by and by, I know—
It's just the way of life—
Some likely chap will coax away
My Edie as his wife.
THE WORKER'S SONG.
Sometimes like tired children
We sigh for restful place,
To cuddle and soothe our weary selves,
Ere duties new we face.
But the need of the world is great,
And duty clamors strong;
And off we are at work again,
Battling against the wrong.
The hardest battle waged
Is the war that's on within,
Where the soul must wield its arms,
Against the hosts of sin.
For no true success in battle,
Can come to warriors bold
Until o'er foes within
The victor's place they hold.
SOUL VISION.
Have you ever seen a vision
In the day or in the night
Of what you might if you dared to be
And you shrank back in affright?
And accepted a lower purpose
Or lived by a weaker thought,
And sacrificed your ideals
For earth things that you sought?
We call our visions madness
And cast our ideals away,
And are ever less than we should be,
Had we bid our visions stay.
For those who most help the world
In its onward march to roll
Cherish night and day
The Visions of the Soul.
TO-DAY.
I had a song I would not sing
Because it seemed a simple thing.
I sang my song, and hearts in pain
Found heart to live and strive again.
I had a word I feared to say
A hope that lived with me always,
Nor breathed the hope, nor said the word,
And life for two fore'er was marred.
So sing the song you have to-day,
Though weak, yet cheering be thy lay;
Breathe love's fond hope and let be heard
In waiting cars love's tender word.
THE ANNUAL CELEBRATION.
Away back in Missouri,
Where they do things up so fine,
When the melons and the pumpkins
Are a-ripening on the vine,
All the loyal Colored people
In that part of the nation
Begin to send their invites out
For their annual celebration.
Few of them take much interest
In affairs of church and state,
Or in the serious, problems
That our statesmen agitate.
But among the Missourians,
Abe Lincoln's Proclamation
Is the occasion every year
For an annual celebration.
The colored folks are all on hand,
To hear again the precious news,
And white folks, too, galore,
They've heard so oft before,
How in the year of sixty-one
The Hero of the nation,
Abe Lincoln, Moses of our Race,
Signed that wondrous Proclamation.
The speech is long, the children tire,
But the old ones laugh and cry,
For they've been through the scorching fire,
And they sit and think and sigh.
The speech is o'er and the band strikes up,
And the well-dressed population,
Grandsires and striplings, all enjoy
Their annual celebration!
Some high strung college preachers,
Just out and up to date,
Said Missouri folks' annual
Was several months too late;
That on the first of January
Abe Lincoln's Proclamation
That freed the nation's host of slaves
Should have its celebration
They ran those preachers out of town—
How could they celebrate
With Jack Frost on the ground?
'Twas the preachers out of date!
But when the watermelons,
That fruit of God's creation,
Are ripe and sweet, Missouri folks
Have their annual celebration.
THE BLACK BOYS IN BLUE.
Watch as they march from the West to the sea,
Cavalry brave and armed infantry,
Men who have fought, so the records say,
Like lions on the frontiers far away.
"Black Buffaloes," the Indians called them first,
But when in the fight they got the worst
Of that awful burst of shot and shell,
They turned and rushed away pell-mell!
There were black boys fighting at Bunker's Hill;
In 1812 they were at it still,
And when they were called, in sixty-one,
Thousands shouldered a government gun!
Ne'er should the love of their country wane
For the black boys who sank in the gallant Maine
Nor the heroes who charged with such good will
And saved the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill.
THE PASTOR.
Dedicated to Rev. G. M. Tillman.
In a lonely little parish
For a year a man of God
Taught in love the common people
Of the pathway Christ has trod.
Told to them the old, old story
Of the wondrous One who gave
His own life on Calvary's summit
Lost and ruined souls to save.
Sometimes it was told in gladness,
But there, too, were hours of pain.
That they followed not the Savior,
Though besought o'er and again.
Oft he deemed his labor wasted,
Many times discouraged grew,
But, withal, he had resolved that
He would to the cross be true.
But no life that's truly given
To the service of the Lord
E'er is lost but in the seeming,
So declares the precious Word.
Words that months ago he'd spoken
One day quickened into life,
And a soul communed with Jesus
That before had known but strife.
Then the pastor's heart was gladdened
And his Godly faith renewed,
For he'd proved the precious promise.
He had waited on the Lord.
BLACK AND WHITE.
Two little ones played by the roadside green,
And an artist smiled at the pretty scene,
Laugh they aloud in pure delight,
Two little boys, one black, one white.
Two little fishermen idle away
The precious hours of one school day,
Trying in vain to get a bite,
Two little boys, One black, one white.
Two little truants homeward bent,
But there, alas, supperless sent
Straight off to bed, in broad daylight,
Two little boys, one black, one white.
Two little heads over hard lessons bend,
Wishing the goblin king might send
Some elf to take teacher away,
While they ran off to have their play.
Two little friends very loyal to each other,
Give to their mothers no ends of brother,
Must be together, both day and night,
Two little boys, one black, one white.
Two little boys kneel by the bed,
And somewhat sleepily prayers are said.
Angels bear to the throne of light,
Two little boys, one black, one white.
But, alas, when these two are men,
Where will be their old friendship then?
Will the white man give to the black man his right?
And will they still be friends, one black, one white?
DON'T BE ASHAMED TO DO RIGHT.
There are things of which we should be ashamed,
There are deeds that won't bear the' light,
But a motto good for both young and old,
Is, don't be ashamed to do right.
Perchance you are on the unpopular side,
And you stand alone in the fight,
Just hold your ground, my struggling friend,
And don't be ashamed to do right.
Riches and fame are good in their way,
But they can't give half the delight
That comes to the soul that is anchored on truth.
And is not ashanred to do right.
Then a cheer for the famed and a cheer for the wise
As onward they soar in their flight,
But louder yet let us cheer for the souls
Who are not ashamed to do right!
CHRISTMAS TIME.
The air is filled with hearty cheer,
For merry Christmas time is here,
And passing down the crowded street
Bright, joyous faces there we meet;
The shops are bursting o'er with toys
To please old Santa's girls and boys,
And stockings now are darned with care,
For Santa Claus will soon be here.
The children early seek their bed,
But filled is every little head
With thoughts of Santa Claus so kind
Who all the stockings soon will find.
Oh, happy Christmas time, I trow
That all will not thy gladness know,
For hearts are filled with anxious care,
And some are hardened by despair,
And those whom distance bears apart
From loved ones dear unto their heart
Will grieve for those they may not see
Despite the merry Christmas glee;
But hopeful still should be each heart,
For though by distance borne apart,
To dearest ones and well-loved friend
A Yule-tide token we may send,
And in memory of the Christchild's birth,
May pray for men of every clime
The hallowed joy of Christmas time.
AN EASTER LILY.
The church was ablaze with glory,
The glory of Easter tide,
And a crowd of struggling Arabs
Eagerly pressed outside.
"Oh, ain't them flowers stunnin'!
Wouldn't it just be fun
If one of them ladies in there
Would give each of us fellers one?"
And one of the altar committee,
With a little of wealth to spare,
Heard the voice of the blessed Master
In the little Arab's prayer.
She was off and back in a minute,
Her hands filled with lilies fair;
Each boy received his flower
With a shout that rent the air.
"May your lives be as white," said the giver
A sermon short but strong,
And one that went not unheeded,
But helped to save them from wrong.
And in an hour of after life,
Amid her future joys,
The giver found in a man of God
One of her Arab boys!
AMERICA'S FIRST CARGO OF SLAVES.
It was midnight in Africa,
   And on the western shore
Stood chained a huddled line of slaves,
   Full twenty souls or more,
While darkness like Egyptian night
   Reigned over all the land,
The slaves were hurried on the ship,
   And borne from Afric's strand.
On board a man-of-war they go
   To breathe the ship's foul air,
To stifle in the ship's close hole
   And shriek their wild despair.
Ah, who could tell the awful woe
   This fatal act would bring,
Surely in that Dutch captain's ears
   A million death cries ring!
Oh, charge not God with will to see
   His Afric sons enslaved
That doomed to dreary servitude
   Their lost souls might be saved.
Oh, no; for better in our land,
   The land possessed by Ham,
To dwell in perfect liberty
   Beneath the waving palm,
To have the gospel brought to us,
   As 'tis to Asia sent.
Than we like beasts should toil for years
   That Christian light be lent,
To labor like the patient ox,
   Like to him no more to know
Than endless toil for others' gain
   And take in peace his blow.
The ship sailed on o'er stormy seas
   Till this strange cargo came
To Jamestown's mart, and thus began
   Our country's greatest shame.
Oh, what a fatal hour that bro't
   The slave to this free shore,
On history's page the fearful blot
   With time doth blacker grow.
Two hundred weary years,
   The Negro tilled the soil,
Until America was rich
   With fruits of Negro toil.
Two hundred weary years
   But freedom came at last,
And no other lowly people
   Have ever climbed so fast.
See how they struggle, see!
   Will no one lend a hand,
Will no one help a race oppressed
   Within this Christian land?
Give them an equal chance,
   Freedom of life and aim,
This only can atone
   For America's dark shame!
THE BLUE VEIN CLUB
Down in Darktown there is trouble
   Of a most peculiar kind,
And the next "hair-straight'ner" found there
   Will some angry women find.
A Blue Vein Club was started
   By a ginger-faced Miss Dare,
And she said that every member
   Must have straight or straightened hair.
Miss Dare she did the straightening
   For a neat five dollar bill.
There were all in all one hundred
   Swallowed Miss Dare's Blue Vein pill.
All went well until it rained,
   And the hair it all went back,
Then a hundred colored women
   Went the straightener to attack.
But the Dare mansion was silent,
   They had left, the neighbors said,
And the Blue Vein Clu'b in Darktown
   Has been bursted in the head.
LINES TO BISHOP ARNETT.
Awake to life, poetic muse, and sing
The deeds of our great Churchman, Arnett, Great
Awake, and let the earth with echoes ring,
And praise our hero, famed in Church and State.
Sing of a life from lowest planes upreared,
Sing of a man self-made and truly great,
Of Bishop Arnett, to all -hearts endeared,
Of great Arnett, Napoleon of his fate!
Give me a man, Philistia's giant cried,
Boastful and proud, in gleaming armour clad,
And groans of dismay rang down Israel's side,
For they, God's host, no giant champion had.
But when this cause seemed lost, David, the future king,
Then but an obscure warrior in the field,
He who could fight for God as well as sing,
Golith slew, and caused the foe to yield.
"Give me a man," the scornful Saxon cried,
"A man of Negro blood, I challenge you,
To stand in Senate chambers at my side."
"Alas," we sighed, "this thing is hard to to do."
For we who feel warm Afric's blood
Throbbing and coursing through our veins
Love our own race, and feel we should
In spite of all revere its hallowed strains.
For they who worship God, the Father dear,
Know that all men are loved of Him alike;
We are despised of men who often err,
Such gave to Christ His cross, His crown of spike!
But God sent Arnett on to lead our host,
He swift of speech and large of heart and brain;
No pigmy-souled creation, or we had been lost,
But a man with whom the interests of a kingdom might have lain.
He stood in senate halls amid great men,
And there for us his people loudly spoke,
Denounced injustice with his voice and pen,
Till the last "Black Law" had vanished from Ohio's statute book.
He spoke for us, the women of the race,
Helpless and dumb through slavery's years of pain,
He bade our men accord to us an honored place,
As queens within their hearts and homes to reign.
Honor to whom honor—bring forth the laurel wreath,
And place it on our grand, brave leader's head.
We love him well, why wait for scenes of death,
Why keep our flowers for the voiceless dead?
Three debts we owe that we can never pay,
His service to his Church, his Race and Woman-kind,
While love's incense upon his shrine we lay,
With hearts that throb, and tears that blind.
IDA B. WELLS.
Thank God, there are hearts in England
That feel for the Negro's distress,
And gladly give of their substance
To seek for his wrongs a redress!
Speed on the day when the lynchers
No more shall exist in our land,
When even the poorest Negro
Protected by justice shall stand.
When no more the cries of terror
Shall break on the midnight air,
While poor and defenseless Negroes
Surrender their lives in despair.
When the spirit of our inspired Lincoln,
Wendell Phillips and Summer brave
Shall enkindle a spirit of justice
And our race from oppression save.
When loyal hearts of the Southland
With those of the North, tried and true,
Shall give to the'struggling Negro
That which is by nature his due.
And the cloud that threatens our land
Shall pale beneath Liberty's sun,
And in a prosperous future
Be atoned the wrongs to us done.
Go on, thou brave woman leader,
Spread our wrongs from shore to shore,
Until clothed with his rights is the Negro,
And lynchings are heard of no more.
And centuries hence the children
Sprung up from the Hamitic race
On history's unwritten pages
Thy daring deeds shall trace.
And the Afro-American mother
Who of Negro history tells
Shall speak in words of grateful praise
Of the noble Ida B. Wells!
EPOCHS.
Youth
I lie out in the meadow grass,
I lie out there and cry,
And the prairie dog and field mouse
Pass me unheeded by.
The grass blades sting my face,
Even the daisies annoy,
I am a Negro boy.
For I am the child of a hated race,
Different from all of the boys
That romp with me at the school,
I have felt it many a day,
In action and in rule.
My skin is dark, my hair is crisp,
But I didn't make it so;
I keep for it a menial's place,
But, O God, it is hard to do!
Why did you make a thing like me
For mankind to despise?
Why must I live to cower down
Before their scornful eyes?
I walk, I think, I act, I feel,
I wrestle, box and run;
I scorn to cheat, to lie, to steal,
Even in times of fun.
To-day, while leaving the old schoolhouse
Proud in a prize-won joy,
I heard it said in undertone,
"Too bad he is a Negro boy!"
"Why?" said the master's calm, grave voice.
"Why, ask you?" said the man.
Because he is of Negro blood,
And must live 'neath racial ban.
Tho' he has brain, he must keep back,
For this is the white man's land;
The Negro and all inferior folk
Must bow beneath the Saxon command.
They that were once our helpless slaves
Are safest at our feet
Would you grant Negro rule?
How then the problem meet?
"One is our Father, even God,"
The master made reply.
"All men are brothers, here I stand.
All pride of caste must die.
Let's give the black a white man's chance;
Nay, more, the chance of a man.
Take away all our caste-fixed bars,
And then outstrip him if we can."
Manhood
To-day, to-day I am twenty-one,
My days at the schools are done,
And out in the world in the dim unknown
Are its wars to be fought and won.
I'm happy today o'er a trifling thing,
A smile from the girl I love,
It means so much from a girl like her,
As pure as the stars above.
I've finished the schools with honors proud,
Good for the mother and I,
The little mother, who's toiled so hard,
I'll repay her before I die.
Out in the world I'll go and work
For her and the girl of my heart, --
My brown-faced maid with her love-lit eyes
And hair of the silkiest sort!
Ha! ha! the same old foe,
The thing I met in youth,
The color of my face a bar,
The same old ugly truth.
But I'll conquer yet, I swear I will,
For God lives, and He's true,
And somewhere in American hearts
Are stains of justice, too.
I'll get a chance some way, somehow,
To earn bread like a man,
Despite the foes who every day
The fires of hatred fan!
Old Age
Old age! Thank God, I've fought and won
An honorable place in life,
I've made a home like I said I would
For the mother and the wife.
PIPINGS OF DAWN.
When o'er the hills the rosy colored dawn
Steals on the nightwrapped world in fair array,
When thro' the air the heralds of the morn,
The pretty feathered tribe, begin to pipe their lay.
Pipings of dawn, weak, faint, perhaps, at first,
And sweet tho' faint, unto the love-tuned ear,
And when of melody, a glorious burst,
That calls the slumbering world to be astir.
Thus be these lines a prophecy of dawn,
Of larger hopes and deeds that are to be;
Of fruitage ripened in fair freedom's morn,
Such is my hope and such my gift to thee.

RHAPSODY
I AM glad daylong for the gift of song,
For time and change and sorrow;
For the sunset wings and the world-end things
Which hang on the edge of to-morrow.
I am glad for my heart whose gates apart
Are the entrance-place of wonders,
Where dreams come in from the rush and din
Like sheep from the rains and thunders.
Page  14
OUT OF THE SILENCE OF MY DREAMS
I HEAR a voice that speaks to me
Out of the silence of my dreams;
Somewhere from long eternity
Where the first white dawn gleams.
Night and the stars, day and the sun,
Winds and the trumpets of mid-seas,
All in one common key they run
Through deathless melodies.
Take this, my answer for all time —
Yea, to his speech, to his command:
Surrendering all life of mine
Unto his heart and hand.
Page  15
DIVIDED
'TIS strange that we should fall apart
And live divided nights and days!
What loneliness crowds on the heart,
What vacancy in eyes that gaze.
Oh! if there were a little child,
Whose innocence had made it wise,
Remembrance would have reconciled
Its father's face, its mother's eyes.
Page  16
TO A PERSIAN ROSE
To E. A. B.
IN the world's garden close,
Where a wild Eden blows,
Where the earth's treasury
Hoards by the Arat sea,
You grew, a rose.
In the flushed lyric dawn,
Poignant with scented heat,
Gold dew you fed upon,
Gleaming like crystals- sweet
Stars of the lawn.
From all the islands blent,
One thousand essences,
Odors of ravishment
Culled from the Eastern seas
Filled you with scent.
All the East's lavishhess
Dowered and nurtured you,
Till past all loveliness
That the East ever knew,
Regal you grew.
Page  17
One June in Maenad-mirth
The great luxurious Mother
Gave you strange, mystic birth, —
Such as she gave no other —
You child of earth.
No unguent was too precious
For the high gods to give;
No passion too delicious
Through which you might not live,
To joy and grieve.
Long wanton centuries since,
In days of Rome and Tyre,
Thou mated once a prince
Of a great Persian sire
For Love's desire.
O thou wast more than fair!
Thou Rose of Paradise —
In lips, and cheeks, and hair, —
All beauty wonder-wise
'Neath those hot skies.
Page  18
A DREAM AND A SONG
To B.V.T.
A DREAM comes in and a song goes forth;
The wind is south and the sun is north —
The daisies run on the dunes to the sea,
And over the world my soul goes free.
Ah, over the world to sing and roam
In the sun and wind- without a home
Till a woman's heart shall dream and say:
"O song of the dreamer I bid you stay
And sing in my heart: make glad my feet
To run as the winds do, soft and fleet
Over the dunes and down to the sea,
Where Love came home in a dream to me."
TWO QUESTIONS
HEART of the soft, wild rose
Hid in a forest close
Far from the world away,
Sweet for a night and day.
Rose, is it good to be sweet,
Sun and the dews to greet?
Life that is mine to keep
In travail, play and sleep
Firm on a tossing ball,
Drilled to march at a call;
Work, love, death — these three —
Life, is there more for me?
Page  20
A LITTLE SONG
To T.E.S.
A LITTLE song ill worth your while
On which to waste more than a smile,
Alas, I sing, for love is long —
A little song.
Though life be brief and art outlive
What joy or sorrow earth may give,
Time, then, might let the years prolong
A little song.
And it may chance your face will turn
Some day, the singer to discern —
Yea, smile to see who sang so long,
A little song.
Page  21
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL
STEEPT in the Muses' youthful, sultry maze,
He linkt his own with Shakespeare's lucid days —
And Camelot came to Cambridge in his heart,
Where Rosaline met ancient Britomart.
Page  21
IF I COULD TOUCH
IF I could touch your hand to-night
And hear you speak one little word,
I then might understand your flight
Up the star steps, unseen, unheard.
If through the mists of gold and gray
If only some small part of you
Would speak, or touch, or rise in sight,
Death would be then between us two
The passing of a summer's night.
Page  23
EVENING
AT my window what delight
Here to sit and watch the night,
Stealing after fleeting day,
Soft and quiet all the way.
Through my window like a flute's
Comes the robin's dying notes,
While above me dim and far
Silent breaks the evening star.
At my window o'er the street,
In the twilight calm and sweet,
From dim vistas of the past
Dreams come to me thick and fast;
Some are clothed in bright array,
Phantoms of a happier day —
Some, wan spectral shades assume,
Draped in anguished hours of doom.
This brief span of years we lease
Gives us fewer hours of peace
Than it does of strife and toll —
Therefore when subsides the broil,
Let it be but one brief hour,
'Tis a providential dower,
Just a stop upon the road
Easing us of life's great load.
Page  24
So to-night is one of those
Blissful times of blest repose;
And in unison I seem
With night's universal dream.
All is quiet near and far
From the lily to the star,
And my soul in dreamy ease
Strikes the soothing chords of peace.
Page  25
A LEAVE-TAKING, I
LET there be one word more
Before you go —
Some sweet old thing
Remembering,
Alas to know —
Some hope you fed, some look you gave,
Dead now in love's deep grave.
So, speak- and then depart,
And I will keep
The best of you forever in my heart.
All else shall sleep
As if death came and taught them to forget.
Only the best
Of you shah live without regret,
Within my breast.
Page  26
A LEAVE-TAKING, II
YOUR hand in mine for a space,
Through a brief living sigh;
The red rose white in your face,
And a swift good-bye.
One moment! ah, could it be
Life's veriest depth and height!
The death of my soul for me —
And you — well, the red rose white.
Page  27
KEATS WAS AN UNBELIEVER
"Keats was not a believer"
— Biographical Sketch
"KEATS was an unbeliever," — so they read.
The critic's words defame the poet's soul;
Nature and Life as one stupendous whole
He traced to the source. Thereof a Fountainhead:
His worship was where light enshrined the head
Of Beauty: — for true love and wisdom stole
From God to man within her aureole,
And God's elect but followed where she lead.
Of God's elect was Keats: his earthly duty
To sing again the music of creation;
That first of all, God's dream of life was Beauty;
That Beauty is the seed of all salvation : —
Holiest of all unbelievers, thus,
He made "Believing" possible for us.
Page  28
THE WATCHERS
TWO women on the lone wet strand
(The wind's out with a will to roam)
The waves wage war on rocks and sand,
(And a ship is long due home.)
The sea sprays in the women's eyes —
(Hearts can writhe like the sea's wild foam)
Lower descend the tempestuous skies,
(For the wind's out with a will to roam.)
"0 daughter, thine eyes be better than mine,"
(The waves ascend high as yonder dome)
"North or south is there never a sign?"
(And a ship is long due home.)
They watched there all the long night through —
(The wind's out with a wilt to roam)
Wind and rain and sorrow for two, —
(And heaven on the long reach home.)
Page  29
IN A GRAVE-YARD
IN calm fellowship they sleep
Where the graves are dark and deep,
Where nor hate nor fraud nor feud
Mar their perfect brotherhood.
After all was done they went
Into dreamless sleep, content,
That the years would pass them by,
Sightless, soundless, where they lie.
Wines and roses, song and dance,
Have no portion in their trance —
The four seasons are as one,
Dark of night, and light of sun.
Page  30
THE LAND OF HOPE-TO-BE
THERE'S a way to happiness
Up the road of Dreams,
Where my soul goes wayfaring
By the sleepy streams.
Heart that sends your memories
In the shape of song,
To the land of Hope-to-Be,
Is the journey long?
Nay, companion of my house,
In the longest flight,
Distance in desire is drowned
As the day in night.
Heart and soul go wayfaring
Up the road of Dreams,
To the land of Hope-to-Be
By the sleepy streams.
Page  31
A CITY GARDEN
HID in a close and lowly nook
In a city yard where no grass grows —
Wherein nor sun, nor stars may look
Full-faced,- are planted three short rows
Of pansies, geraniums, and a rose.
A little girl with quiet, wide eyes,
Slender figured, in tattered gown,
Whose pallored face no country skies
Have quickened to a healthy brown,
Made this garden in the barren town.
Poor little flowers, your life is hard;
No sun, nor wind, nor evening dew.
Poor little maid, whose city yard
Is a world of happy dreams to you —
God grant some day your dreams come true.
Page  32
SEA LYRIC
OVER the seas to-night, love,
Over the darksome deeps,
Over the seas to-night, love,
Slowly my vessel creeps.
Over the seas to-night, love,
Waking the sleeping foam —
Sailing away from thee, love,
Sailing from thee and home.
Over the seas to — night, love,
Dreaming beneath the spars —
Till in my dreams you shine, love,
Bright as the listening stars.
Page  33
DISTANCES
JUST where that star above
Shines with a cold, dispassionate smile —
If in the flesh I'd travel there,
How many, many a mile!
If this, my soul, should be
Unprisoned from its earthly bond,
Time could not count its markless flight
Beyond that star, beyond!
Page  34
SONG
UP and down the beach I wander
Here to-night beside the sea,
In my ears the ocean-thunder,
In my heart the dreams of thee.
The sea, the sea is high, love,
Dark, dark, 0 dark, the sky, love,
And sad is my heart.
In thy outward journey passing
Through the narrow gates of night,
Was there travail in the massing
Of the waters void of light?
0 the sea, the sea is high, love,
Swift surge the waters by, love,
And sad is my heart.
Page  35
AN OLD DREAM
YOU sang that song beside an olden sea,
In some low dream, some hundred years ago;
The time, the place is all unknown to me —
It is the feeling in my heart I know.
We were two Grecians then, I do believe,
And caught a dream some fair god's passion sighed;
Time wandered far, and left our hearts to grieve —
But somewhere Love lived on, though all else died.
Dear, as you sing, it all comes back to me;
The mood, though filled with centuries of strife
Is the same ecstasy; only the sea
Seems grown a little weary of its life.
No change has come unto your voice and heart,
No shadow on your face; and in your eyes —
Though Time has kept them from my eyes apart —
The rapture of sea-dreams and memories.
Page  36
LOVE IS A STAR
THIS is the song I sing for you,
Out of my heart the melodies rise —
Life is long for the brave and true,
Love is a star to your faithful eyes.
This is the dream your heart must hold:
One in the world is faithful still —
Here is warmth from the wind and cold,
Here is rest from the sea and hill.
Page  37
ON A PRESSED FLOWER IN MY COPY OF KEATS
AS Keats' old honeyed volume of romance
I oped to-day to drink its Latmos air,
I found all pressed a white flower lying where
The shepherd lad watched Pan's herd slow advance.
Ah, then what tender memories did chance
To bring again the day, when from your hair,
This frail carnation, delicate and fair,
You gave me, that I now might taste its trance.
And so to-day it brings a mellow dream
Of that sweet time when but to hear you speak
Filled all my soul. What waves of passion seem
About this flower to linger and to break,
Lit by the glamor of the moon's pale beam
The while my heart weeps for this dear flower's sake.
Page  38
WHEN TWILIGHT COMES WITH DREAMS
O LET the music play a little longer,
And sweetheart clasp me closer to your breast.
Life is strong, and death; but love is stronger —
And sweeter, sweeter, rest.
Oh, sweet is rest when love is watching over,
And twlight comes with dreams that reassure;
Weaving out of the silences that hover
Hopes which must endure.
Page  39
THE DEPARTURE OF PIERROTT
WE have housed, my Columbine,
With our songs and books and dreams,
Quiet and content it seems
Through the winter's cloud and shine.
In our lithe attic room
Looking o'er the city square,
Quite outside the world of care,
All unaltered by its gloom, —
Thou and I, my Columbine,
Let the world of men below
Unacquainted come and go,
In secludedness divine.
Ah, those nights, so long, were sweet,
And we shall not soon forget
Love songs sung in a duet,
Far above the city street.
And the company 'twas ours
To abide in — Tennyson,
Shelley, Keats, and Emerson —
Joyed us in those winter hours.
Page  40
So, my Columbine, together
We lived the long season through
Till March came, whose wild winds blew
Us to days of April weather.
All the first sweet dreams of Spring
Born again of new desires,
In me light unquenching fires
To be up and wandering.
Newer hopes have won my trust —
I but answer to the call,
April smiling over all
Fills my soul with wander-lust.
There is magic in the stir
When our mother April wakes;
Some wild riot in me breaks
When I feel the pulse of her.
On the slowly greening slopes
Something in the hanging haze,
Luring, leads my tramping ways
On a quest for April Hopes.
Nature keeps an open house,
I am bidden to her board;
And she fills me from her hoard
Where the sons of earth carouse.
Page  41
LOUISBERG SQUARE
A QUIET little space, set in
Upon the sloping hillside, where
Comes not the sound of traffic's din
To fill the air.
The stately houses on each side,
The little park which lies between —
How in seclusion, all abides
A quiet dream.
Page  42
APRIL
AT morn when light mine eyes unsealed
I gazed upon the open field;
The rain had fallen in the night —
The landscape in the new day's light
A countenance of grace revealed
Upon the meadow, wood and height.
The sun's light was a smile of gold,
Ere shut by sudden fold on fold
Of surging, showering clouds from view;
No sooner hid than it broke through
A tearful smile upon the wold
Where earth reflected heaven's blue.
Each separate divided part
Of day, was as the threefold art
Of God, who dreamed three dreams and made
The morning, noon, and night parade
In ever changing guise athwart
The day's hours, in His dreams arrayed.
The sky was as a canvas spun
To paint the new spring's nocturns on;
A blended melody of tints —
The sea's hue, and the myriad hints
Of garden-closes, when the sun
Hath stamped the work of nature's mints.
Page  43
OUT OF THE SUNSET'S RED
OUT of the sunset's red
Into the blushing sea,
The winds of day drop dead
And dreams come home to me. —
The sea is still,- and apart
Is a stillness in my heart.
The night comes up the beach,
The dark steals over all,
Though silence has no speech
I hear the sea-dreams call
To my heart; — and in reply
It answers with a sigh.
Page  44
TWILIGHT AND DREAMS
AT the outer edge of the world,
Where the long grey mists arise,
Between the sunset and the sea
I gaze with longing eyes.
0 the twilight and dreams for me,
And the things my fancy paints —
My hopes the light upon the sea
Which slowly faints and faints.
The surge and beat of the sea,
The mournful and endless dole, —
They swell with a thousand questionings
And overflow my soul.
Page  45
LOVE'S WAYFARING
DO you remember, love —
How long ago it seems —
When by the pebbled cove,
Our sweet, fair dreams
Took wing?
Alas, how long it is —
What wasted years between;
What untouched hours of bliss;
And unlived dream —
Time's sting!
Were not the high tides sweet!
The sails upon the stream —
The billows' bounding beat,
The sea-gull's scream
And swing.
What murmuring music rose
From zephyr's low-tuned chords,
To which in love's repose
Our hearts made words
To sing.
Page  46
Ah, sweet, where is Love gone?
To what bourne, east or west,
Shall you and I alone
Bide his behest
Wand'ring?
Page  47
SHE SLEEPS BENEATH THE WINTER SNOW
SHE sleeps beneath the winter snow
In Cedar's wintry vale;
The winter stars above her shine,
The pines about her wail,
And icy winds do chill and blow.
My Ciceline, my Ciceline,
Sleeps deep and low
Beneath the snow.
I sit beside my fire bright
And watch the embers glow,
And yet to-night so dark and chill
She sleeps beneath the snow.
And though the place be hid from sight,
My dreams its gloomy darkness fill —
With Ciceline's my heart is low
Beneath the winter snow.
Page  48
LYRIC: WHEN THE STILL SOMBRE EVENING CLOSES DOWN
WHEN the still, sombre evening closes down
Amid the autumn preludes of the wood,
I feel my soul take on its dreamy mood
'Midst nature's gold and brown.
The dear old dreams of June — blue-bird and rose
Have sunk into these sadder phantasies,
And once again old buried memories
Wake from their long repose.
Ah, when I look on Hesper clear and bright,
The thought of one dear autumn, sad and cool,
Transports me to a bygone forest pool
One long gone autumn night.
Now that my vision brightens, memory brings
That forest opening- sere leaves, the sheen
Of moonlight which soft stole the leaves be-tween
In their down flutterings.
Page  49
How solemn was the scene- that solitude!
Those fulgent woods our holy marriage house
Where Zephyrus sang his choral through the boughs
To bless us where we stood.
Ah, memory! dear conjurer of tears!
Bring vividly the vision of that night,
When our two hearts pledged by kind nature's rite
A union through the years.
Page  50
CHILD ELSIE
FOR love of the sea, Child Elsie,
Untethered the dory's rope,
To ride with native impulse
The water's rise and slope.
For love of the seaman's maiden,
The mew-tides running down,
Swept out to sea the dory
Afar from the fishing town.
Page  51
A SEA-PRAYER
LORD of wind and water
Where the ships go down
Reaching to the sunrise,
Lifting like a crown,
Out of the deep-hidden
Wells of night and day —
Mind the great sea-farers
On the open way.
When the last lights darken
On the far coastline,
Wave and port and peril
Sea-Lord — all are thine.[51]
Page  52
IT WERE AS IF THIS WORLD WERE PARADISE
IT were as if this world were Paradise,
That little hour when by the dancing sea
I told thee of the love I had for thee.
There seemed a newer glory in the skies
When thou didst look with pitying sweet eyes
Upon me when I pleaded. I felt that we
Did balance in some mystic harmony
Of old rose-gardens and low ocean sighs.
The sunshine stole some glory from your hair:
The sea, the magic of your eyes of blue —
The grace of all your nature soft and fair
Fill'd all the world until an Eden grew;
You were a gracious Eve beside me there,
And all the world was Paradise with you.
Page  53
YULE-SONG: A MEMORY
DECEMBER comes, snows come,
Comes the wintry weather;
Faces from away come —
Hearts must be together.
Down the stair-steps of the hours
Yule leaps the hills and towers —
Fill the bowl and hang the holly,
Let the times be jolly.
Day comes, and night comes
And the guests assemble —
Once again the old dream comes
That I would dissemble.
Falls a shadow 'cross the floor,
Seen! — and is seen no more.
0 that memory would forego
The hanging of the Mistletoe.
Page  54
VOICE OF THE SEA
VOICE of the sea that calls to me,
Heart of the woods my own heart loves,
I am part of your mystery —
Moved by the soul your own soul moves.
Dream of the stars in the night-sea's dome,
Somewhere in your infinite space
After the years I will come home,
Back to your halls to claim my place.
Page  54
APRIL'S DREAM
THE stream's breath tastes of the wood's perfume,
Filled are the woods with foam:
And the sea like a sheet 'neath the summer noon,
With the languorous swerve runs home.
The beat of a pulse the warm sun stirs
In the air, the sea and stream,
Beckons the heart- and the soul allures
Forth, into April's dream.
Page  56
ON MUSIC
I CANNOT tell how high my soul takes wing,
Nor to what depths in liquid sweets it sinks —
Yet well I know it suffers from thy sting,
As one who of Cyceon mixture drinks.
And I can feel a rose-stream thro' me creep,
Curving about my senses, as they leap,
And swell and rise and fall,
As blossoms ambrosial
Shook from some full blown orange-tree in spring,
Sink wav'ring to the ground
And bound
Unto the zephyr's piping, in dizzy, dizzy ring!
Page  57
SONG
OVER the long, the wide dark seas,
Wandering, goes my dream,
Borne on winnowings of the breeze
High as the heavens seem.
And O, dear love, where the waters foam
Further than pulsing star,
Wandering still my old dreams roam
Far from the shore — yea far!
Page  58
A LYRIC OF AUTUMN
THERE is music in the meadows, in the air —
Autumn is here;
Skies are gray, but hearts are mellow,
Leaves are crimson, brown, and yellow;
Pines are soughing, birches stir,
And the Gipsy trail is fresh beneath the fir.
There is rhythm in the woods, and in the fields,
Nature yields:
And the harvest voices crying,
Blend with Autumn zephyrs sighing;
Tone and color, frost and fire,
Wings the nocturne Nature plays upon her lyre.
Page  59
MOTHERHOOD
WITH what angelic countenance
She wonders as she sits alone,
With tender fear, and musing glance
Because a life is in her own.
Ah! if a woman should be loved
'T is when she hears the silent voice,
'T is when an unknown life has moved
Her soul to fear and to rejoice.
'T is when amidst life's blithesome scenes,
A something speaks she cannot hear,
And quells her spirit till it dreams
The sacred thing she is to bear.
Ah! what is needed most to bless
The weary waiting of the time!
Love's duty rendered tireless
To cheer her holy state sublime;
A tender presence that would teach
Her more than laws of science could;
That, life belongs to each and each,
To Fatherhood and Motherhood!

TO W. A. W. AND H. H.
On their Departure to Europe
GOOD-BYE, and may your journey be
Through nights with pleasant stars above,
And may your days upon the sea
Your souls with wonder fill and move.
By night the lyric-light of stars,
By day the pulsing tidal wars.
And may you safely reach the port
Where sweet the old-world dreams repose
In garden, vale, and palace-court,
Where long ago the sounds arose
Of feudal strife — and song took wing —
When men were brave, and Love was King.
And when you shall have made your stay
Through summer-moons that filled and waned,
May westward autumn lead your way
Untroubled, fill your home is gained.
So may propitious fortune keep
And bring you safely o'er the deep.
Page  61
THANKSGIVING
MY heart gives thanks for many things;
For strength to labor day by day,
For sleep that comes when darkness wings
With evening up the eastern way.
I give deep thanks that I'm at peace
With kith and kin and neighbors, too —
Dear Lord, for all last year's increase,
That helped me strive and hope and do.
My heart gives thanks for many things;
I know not how to name them all.
My soul is free from frets and stings,
My mind from creed and doctrine's thrall.
For sun and stars, for flowers and streams,
For work and hope and rest and play —
For empty moments given to dreams,
For these my hear gives thanks to-day.
Page  62
LIFE AND DEATH
I RENTED once a house of clay,
An object beautiful to see —
I lighted it with pleasant thoughts
And Life 'twas named by Mystery.
And when long years therein I lived
I moved into a fairer clime,
And then my house was named anew —
For it was christened Death, by Time.
Page  [62]
HOLLY BERRY AND MISTLETOE
THE trees are bare, wild flies the snow,
Hearths are glowing, hearts are merry —
High in the air is the Mistletoe,
Over the door is the Holly Berry.
Never have care how the winds may blow,
Never confess the revel grows weary —
Yule is the time of the Mistletoe,
Yule is the time of the Holly Berry.
Page  64
WHEN I BID YOU GOOD-BYE AND GO
WHEN I bid you good-bye and go
I do not want your tears to flow,
For I have filled so small a part
In your great heart.
And I shall sleep below and dream
You have been good to let it seem
I lived in all your heart- your life
Without one strife.
It cost so little- so, be kind
To keep a portion in your mind
Of me- remembering that I gave
Up to the grave.
Page  65
HEART-SONG
DEAR heart, what tho' I press the heedless throng
While high the stars shine in their blue retreat,
If so, I unto thee with heart of song
Wend thro' the street.
Dear heart, what tho' my song's inaudible
Unto this ceaseless, surging, heartless throng —
Far from the crowd wilt thou not hear it well
All the night long?
Page  66
BY AN INLAND LAKE
LONG drawn, the cool, green shadows
Steal o'er the lake's warm breast,
And the ancient silence follows
The burning sun to rest.
The calm of a thousand summers,
And dreams of countless Junes,
Return when the lake-wind murmurs
Thro' golden, August noons.
Page  67
SONG
I WENT down the ways of the roses this noon,
The birds were in tune with the infinite skies,
And all my heart sang, "It is June, it is June,"
And all my soul teemed with the lovely sur-prise,
As I went down the ways of the roses this noon.
And into my garden the shades bade them come,
The wayfaring dreams that came forth of the sun:
"Come, rest," said the roses, "ere further ye roam;"
"Be my guests" said my heart, "till the day it be done,"
As into my garden the shades bade them come.
0 long the dreams tarried within that sweet place,
And unto my heart and the roses they told,
How on their long travel they met with a face
All clouded with hair of the sun's fairest gold —
And my heart and the roses sighed in the sweet place.
Page  68
SONG: TO-NIGHT THE STARS ARE WOOING, LOVE
TO-NIGHT the stars are wooing, love,
The moon is full of languishment;
Low in the eastern firmament
Little, the golden waves above —
My dreams are wand'ring pensive-wise
Unto the-bourne of echo-sighs
Beneath the stars, within the grove.
To-night the rose-leaves fell apart,
And at their core the sweet dews dwell,
While dreams of echo in the shell
Conjures the crimson-scented heart.
So, ]ore, thy sweet influence steals
Upon me, and my spirit heals,
And dreams what loveliness thou art.
Page  69
TO-NIGHT ACROSS THE SEA
TO-NIGHT I sent a dream across the sea,
Beyond the bourne where sky and water meet;
Its ghost came back in mournful melody
Of waters at my feet.
The dream gone out, its ghost abides with me,
A visitant of sorrow in my heart;
And ever clings thereto the mystery
The mournful seas impart.
Page  70
A MEMORY
MY heart to thee an answer makes,
0 long, slow whisper of the sea,
Whose charm of mournful music wakes
A dream, a memory.
Touched hands, met lips, and soft fair speech —
Soul's silence to the past replies,
When love and hope illumined each,
Within a girl's blue eyes.
Page  71
AFTER HARVEST
FAINT is the speech of the tired heart
To the call of dreams replying,
When hope wends home across the fields
Where the rose o' the year is dying.
0 weary head and heart and hands
Look up where the sun is dying —
Love leads you home across the fields
To the call of dreams replying.
Page  72
IT'S A LONG WAY
IT'S a long way the sea-winds blow
Over the sea-plains blue, —
But longer far has my heart to go
Before its dreams come true.
It's work we must, and love we must,
And do the best we may,
And take the hope of dreams in trust
To keep us day by day.
It's a long way the sea-winds blow —
But somewhere lies a shore —
Thus down the tide of Time shall flow
My dreams forevermore.
Page  73
I BLOW YOU A KISS
I BLOW you a kiss on the evening wind
My dear, wherever you be;
Up in the north or down in the south,
Or over the rolling sea.
I blow you a kiss, but after the kiss
Do you know what follows, my dear?
Something the wind cannot bring to you —
Only a little tear.
Page  74
SEA VOICES
O'ER the wintry sea,
Mingled with its tone
Comes a voice to me,
That's not the sea's own.
Low and soft it is,
Near and far away —
Sad as winds that kiss
The sea beyond the bay.
Soulless, restless, swell,
0 what radiant guest,
Sad, invisible,
Hovers o'er thy breast?
Gray rocks and gray sea,
Stretch of barren shore,
Grief and memory
Claim me evermore.
Page  75
TO —
HALF in the dim light from the hall
I saw your fingers rise and fall
Along the pale, dusk-shadowed keys,
And heard your subtle melodies.
The magic of your mastery leant
Your soul unto the instrument;
Strange-wise, its spell of power seemed
To voice the visions that you dreamed.
The music gave my soul such wings
As bore me through the shadowings
Of mortal bondage; flight on flight
I circled dreams' supremest height.
Above were tender twilight skies,
Where stars were dreams and memories —
The long forgotten raptures of
My youth's dead fires of hope and love.
Page  76
IN MY LADY'S PRAISE
GOD wrought you flesh and hair and eyes
From some immortal loom and dyes;
For thou art filled with every rare
And precious thing of earth, sky, air.
The magical blue of warm June skies
Gleams in your calm and sultry eyes;
The unguent of the fragrant fields
No sweeter, subtler perfume yields
Than the aroma of your breath,
Delicate fragrance attarred 'neath
The sculptured, firm, white beauty of
Your throat, arched stately there above
The undulation of your breast
That heaves with love's divine unrest.
Page  77
NEAR THE END OF APRIL
NEAR the end of April,
On the verge of May —
And O my heart, the woods were dusk
At the close of day.
Half a word was spoken
Out of half a dream,
And God looked in my soul ana saw
A dawn rise and g]eam.
Near the end of April
Twenty Mays have met,
And half a word and half a dream
Remember and forget.
Page  78
HYMN FOR THE SLAIN IN BATTLE
LORD, God of all in Life and Death,
The winter's storm, the summer's breath,
Of fragrant bloom,- whose Mighty hand
Decrees the pow'r of sea and ]and,
Hear, Lord, this prayer for those who are
Slain in the hour of thund'rous war.
Have mercy, Lord, on those who fail
Rent by the iron-splintered ball.
Reck not their cause was right or wrong,
'Twas Duty led them blind and strong.
They shaped not what to war gave rise —
They make the greatest sacrifice.
Page  79
A SUMMER NIGHT'S ENCHANTMENT
THE perfume of the garden blows
Fill'd full with scent of musk and rose;
The little bay beneath us here
Is like a woman's jeweled hair,
Studded with sparkling shafts of light
Reflected from the diamond'd height.
And somewhere in the grove is heard
The passion of some ]ove-lorn bird;
And you, my dear, beside me here
With joy around us everywhere.
Page  80
IN THE HIGH HILLS
HEIGHT overhead to the deeps
Where the gleaming day-star peeps
From the bosom of the dawn
In God's infinite blue lawn.
The wings of the winds are whirled
Over the face of the world —
And the echo of them fills
The everlasting hills.

WINGS OF EBONY
President Theodore Roosevelt.
Not Lochinvar nor Sheridan
Thy horsemanship could beat,
Though each eclipsing record made
In great equestrian feat.
San Juan's heights and western wilds
Attest thy native skill,
And mettle rare and hardy frame
And stubborn, steel-clad will.
We've seen the prancing charger leap
And bite and paw the ground;
Beneath thy mount the mad mustang,
Has moved off at a bound.
Though steep the way and rough the
road
That duty bids thee take,
With bareback ride and rein of right
The upward goal thou'lt make.
In hot pursuit let others dash
The White House prize to win,
Thy measured gait will all outstrip,
Despite their cries and din.
Speed on, O knight of destiny,
Thou man of iron nerve,
Thy country bids thee keep thy place,
And still her welfare serve.
The Race Chariots—Black and White.
I saw two chariots in my dream,
Speeding the open plains,
In one a driver clad in white
Held tight the guiding reins.
The steeds that drew the foremost car
Were like the driven snow,
The coach was of the same fair hue,
The whip and lines also.
Another car close in the rear
Went bounding for the stand,
A sable coachman held the line
With dark whip in one hand.
The horses, coach and harness, all
Were black as shades of night;
The angry clouds by tempest chased
Ne'er made more darksome sight.
Good fortune opened wide the course,—
Each driver did his best;
The heated chargers sped through space
Each bending to the test.
The dust-cloud from the foremost wheels
Shut off the blacks from sight,
But presently the backward span
Sped by, with all their might.
Their heaving nostrils gasped for breath,
Their eyes flashed balls of fire;
The contest was for life or death,
And hence they dared not tire.
Grim Jove above the race track soared
With trident poised in air,
And pointed to the beck'ning goal
With visage stern and clear.
Spectators thronged in tiers mid air
The mighty race to scan,
And countless witnesses were there
To cheer the winning span.
"Drive Saxon, drive!" the thun'drous shout
From hills and woodland rung,
"Speed Negro, speed!" in deafening cheers
By ocean lips were sung.
The chariots turned the final curve
And for the victor's stand,
The foaming steeds bent neck and neck,
When the judge threw up his hand.
"Ye've both done well," the umpire said,
As the salvos died away;
"Would that I had a row of palms
To give ye both this day.
But since an only crown I have,
Instructed by the gods,
I hand to him who struggled here
In the face of the greatest odds.
The white of the other had the start
Two thousand years ago,
And tried his best to block the road
As all the world doth know."
And so the dark-skinned hero's brow
Received the crown that day,
While the plaudits rang through all the air
As the victor rode away.
If I Were White.
"If I were white—
My outerself I mean—
And that not quite,
My skin alone, I ween,
My teeth and eyes in part
Are white as fairest art.
"If I were white,
My whiteness I would boast,
And take delight
Despite all care and cost,
In skin untanned by heat
Or torrid suns that beat.
"If I were white,
My breast would proudly swell,
Nor fear nor fright
Could in my bosom dwell.
A link of flawless chain;
I will be proud and vain."
"Thou art not white,"
A silent voice replied;
Beings and forms more bright
Doth flourish far and wide;
Thy haughty boast and mind
Are lighter than the wind.
"If thou be white,
Rebuke the fleece-like clouds,
Tinged with the light
Or Summer's sable shrouds,
And change the Winter's snow,
And lilies' hue also.
If I were white
I'd pray to be like gold,
Of dross rid quite,
And inner worth unfold,
And hold as base and cheap
The white that's but skin deep.
A Song of Hope.
The race is onward marching
No matter what they say,
The morning light is breaking,
The dawn not far away,
From distant cloud-capped hilltops
To Africa's distant way,
The light comes shining brighter
And brighter every day.
We build our schools and churches,
Write books and ever toil,
With blood and brain and muscle
To bless our country's soil;
We're told this is but folly
For strive as best we may,
The world grows dark and darker
About us every day.
The clouds though thick and heavy,
Yet have a brighter side;
Remember so it was the day
When Christ our Saviour died.
Judge Lynch and vile oppressors,
Though terrible in sway,
Must fail, for God and right are
Gaining ground each day.
Think of the ills we suffer
With those our fathers bore
On Southern soil in slavery,
On Africa's bleeding shore;
Contrast their faith with ours,
Though storm cast was the way,
They trusted God and looked for
A better, brighter day.
Then to the winds our doubtings,
Our song shall rend the night,
For God and home and country
Most valiantly we'll fight;
God's word shall be our stronghold,
His will let us obey,
And bless His name for giving
Hope of a brighter day.
O for an inspiration
To thrill the mighty throng,
A bugle note of triumph
A Gospel wave of song.
A deeper consecration
Toward what we ought to say
And do for God who pledges
The better, brighter day.
Look!
Look up! for upward is hope's sunlight and thy God,
The parting clouds and radiant golden noon,
Or sombre shades of darkness, through which gleam
The shining stars or meteors bright.
Look up and thou'lt not see some threatening abyss,
Or yawning chasm verging thy footsteps,
Nor frightful forms uprising from beneath
To terrify thy thoughts and fill the soul with
apprehension's dread.
Look forward! for behind are prison walls,
Where inmates lurk with ever darkening
chains seeking thy bondage,
And graves of buried sorrows disentombed
shall yield their ghastly contents,
Or wolves of memory scenting thy foot tracks, thoul't not see
In mad pursuit chasing their victim.
Shouldst thou look forward nor behind e'er turn thy gaze,
Thy royal footsteps shall soon press the golden plains of life
And palm or crown forever thou shalt wear.
The Black Man's Burden.
Pile on the Black Man's Burden,
'Tis nearest at our door,
Why heed long bleeding Cuba
Or dark Hawaii's shore;
Halt ye your fearless armies
Which menace feeble folks,
Who fight with clubs and arrows
And brook your rifles' smoke.
Pile on the Black Man's Burden,
His wail with laughter drown,
You've sealed the Red Man's problem
And now deal with the Brown.
In vain you seek to end it
With bullet, blood or death,
Better by far defend it,
With honor's holy breath.
Pile on the Black Man's Burden,
His back is broad, though sore,
What though the weight oppress him
He's borne the like before;
Your Jim Crow laws and customs,
And fiendish midnight deed,
Though winked at by the nation
Will some day trouble breed.
Pile on the Black Man's Burden,
At length 'twill heaven pierce,
Then on you or your children
Will reign God's judgments fierce.
Your battleships and armies
May weaker ones appall,
But God Almighty's justice
They'll not disturb at all.
Richard Allen.
Fond freedom's bells, peal forth in merry chimes,
And ye loud anvil strokes, ring out your notes,
In gladsome echoes from departed times;
Thy tale to listening millions now unfold.
With brazen tongues or iron-volumed throats,
Proclaim our hero's deeds, a century old.
Of freedom from Great Britain's cruel power,
A land uplift from spite and foreign King.
Of him who in that peril-freighted hour,
Ventured his all and won—
George Washington,
Columbia's valiant son—
Thou needst not sing.
Our hero's arm, the gyves and shackles broke
That first his own form held, alike his mind,
Then Samson-like, from spell bound slumber woke,
Employed his strength to liberate his kind.
Thy chieftain's fame is known in every land.
Its magic spell remotest climes have felt;
Wherever praise with prayer go hand in hand;
Around this shrine they kneel—and long have knelt.
Our warrior bore no gun or blood-thirst sword;
Unlike thy soldier, scorned a path of gore,
His the dread weapon, God's enduring word
Whose tempered edges doth the right secure.
Immortal muse, thy well tuned viols bring,
Acclaim the news, resound this offering.
A people's incense in the name of truth,
Should burn and blaze
And still through coming days
Impart its fragrance to the unborn youth.
The nation's star let shine o'er empires waste,
But farther still truth's sun resplendent ray,
Whose touch the midnight pall of churchly caste
Caused to dissolve and break in Allen's Day.
The brightest orb that lit earth's Western skies,
Shines dimly in the light of Heaven's sun,
So when the chieftain's beams,
Like fleeting dreams,
Dissolve in night,
Our greater light whose lustre now begun,
In fadeless gleams
Shall greet admiring eyes.
Allen's Day.
What means this shout of "Allen's Day,"
This gladsome noise
Of men and women, far away,
And girls and boys?
Our Richard Allen's name be sung
By old and young, by every tongue,
He gave his people manhood's birth,
The noblest legacy of earth.
From bended knees as galley slave
By force updrawn;
He soared and left proscription's grave
And spied the dawn
Of coming ages in whose wake
Unfettered truth full orbed would break,
And Heaven's all protecting arm,
His Bethel shield from every harm.
In humbler lot was ever born
A nobler cause?
Did ever Satan's hoof or horn
Or gasping jaws
In maddened struggles seek to slay
The Babe incarnate in His day?
So Allen braved a thousand foes,
And battled down a thousand woes.
Where once reigned fettered hopes and tears
Now shines God light,
Forth from the gloom spring songs and cheers
And gospel sight.
One fatherhood in God above,
One universal Saviour's love,
One golden chain, one common blood,
Now binds us in man's brotherhood.
Memorial Ode to Frederick Douglass.
Both stately in form and noble in bearing,
Majestic in tread like some embassied lord;
Of leonine soul dread danger not fearing,
None braver than thou ever buckled on sword.
In fancy meseems to behold thee outsetting
For truth's sternest conflict and liberty's cause;
Of mien the Goliath of slavery fretting,
Disdaining his scorn and defying his laws.
Thine was not the armor of Saul, like another
Who thought to have vanquished the foe by his might;
The flame of thy zeal all thy foes could not smother,
So long as thy weapons were God and the right.
Titanic the soul that can win its own freedom,
Then turn to release others fettered with chain;
Such triumphs once marked the great victor from Edom
Who shouted his conquest o'er thousands of slain.
And thou too great hero of career now ended,
Didst free thine own self then with bravery rare,
Didst lift struggling millions and with them ascended
To heights high and strong kissed by freedom's pure air.
From lowliest depth of condition thou mountedst
And saw others mount from serfdom to the skies;
On wing as of light foul gloom thou discountedst
Till slavery's hell changed to man's paradise.
Yet on wage thy conflict illustrious wonder,
'Gainst wrong and oppression of whatever cast,
The keen-tempered lance of thy soul piercing thunder
Shall know no surcease while the struggle shall last.
Thy patience serene and thy faith's sweeping visions
Shall caste-fettered mountains view sunk out of sight;
The day is not distant though man's Indecision
Shouldst postpone its dawn and oft augur night.
Rest then wearied knight always true and victorious,
Thy helmet and plume lay aside for a crown;
In Time's starry expanse with lustre all glorious
Sunlike thou shalt shine with a radiance thine own.
William Fisher Dickerson, Bishop.
O, ye sable sons of Freedom,
Know ye not of Israel's loss,
How a mighty prince has fallen
From the king's advancing host?
In the prime of mortal vigor,
Ere life's sunset had begun,
Youngest, strongest, 'mong his compeers,
Far he seemed them all t' outrun.
Giant minded, nobly gifted,
With a soul that knew no bound,
On the race he quickly entered,
Heeding neither sight nor sound.
On he ran, the goal before him,
Up he looked with steadfast eyes;
Faint, pursuing, yet he ventured,
Till he grasped the outstretched prize.
Fare thee well, departed hero,
Life's stern conflict now is o'er;
Thou art gone where wars and tumults
Death or anguish come no more.
Fades the smoke from fields of carnage,
Cease the peals of mortal arms;
Peace sways wide its olive sceptre,
Victors shout triumphant psalms.
Error's hordes thou oft hast vanquished,
Sinful legions put to flight.—
Bold, courageous, and defiant,
Thou has won full many a fight.
What thine weapon and thine armor,
Let thy triumph loud proclaim;
With a sword divinely tempered
Hast thou battled in God's name.
Loth to give thee up, we sorrow
Great the loss we now sustain,
Yet we murmur not, but yield us
Unto Heaven's eternal gain.
On the plains of radiant glory,
In the saint's eternal rest,
Where robed millions tell the story,
Thou with Christ art ever blest.
Fare thee well, immortal hero,
Brother, leader, chieftain bold,
May we emulate thy virtues
And thy greatness yet untold.
Though God's valiant workmen perish,
Though they leave us one by one,
Still the work they deeply cherish,
On advances until done.
Triste Vale.
Gone from earth's home to yon mansions of brightness,
From the sphere of turmoil to much needed rest,
Gone where the wicked ne'er visit the tranquil,
Where no ripples of care reach the land of the blest.
Missed are the feet which trod errands of mercy,
Missed are the hands that have God's labors done;
O how much missed are those accents of sweetness,
The kind words and good deeds which so brilliantly shone.
Gone is a star from the home-circle firmament,
Plucked is a flower from the green field of time,
Gone, but to shine in the glory bright element;
Plucked, but transplanted in bloom more sublime.
Fled is a bird from its earth-bounded prison,
Sped is the spirit on wings swift as light;
Fleeing for freedom it rests on love's mountain,
It rests, sweetly rests on yon peak out of sight.
Bishop Henry McNeal Turner,
D.D., LL.D., D.C.L.
Far-famed and blest art thou beyond com¬
pare,
In stature robust, and in genius rare;
If cast in classic Greek or Roman mould
The ages long had writ thy name in gold.
Through royal loins or fabled ancestry,
Thy mettle must have coursed its onward
way,
For 'tis not known in man's recorded time,
That blood like thine has veins in common
clay.
Fearless and brave, with soul of iron knit,
No lance thou shunest, but doth strike to hit;
The enemies of freedom and the hordes of
caste
Shrink from the fury of thy trumpet's blast.
Thy people's cause or country's bugle call,
To fight or champion with the tongue or pen,
Thou'rt there to answer be it where or when.
Though trying years thy frame have palsied
now,
The fires of knighthood still adorn thy brow;
And when the clarion call of church or race,
Or far off Afric's pall thine ear or vision
claim,
To leap the sovereign mark of time and sea
Thy spirit struggles though but fearlessly.
Booker T. Washington.
Most men depend on others for a name,
Thou for thyself hast wrought immortal fame.
Stooping to mother earth like birds that rise,
Thou'st gathered power to bear thee to the skies.
The wings that bear thee to posterity,
Owe not a feather to prosperity. 
Bishop Daniel Alex. Payne, D.D., LL.D.
No greater name than thine
Fair beacon light of thought,
Among the men who dreamt or wrought
To open learning's shrine.
Then to that God-sent seer
Daniel A. Payne and Heaven,
Our schools' transcendent pioneer
Be tireless honors given.
Bishop A. Grant, D.D.
Great hero from the everglades,
Of lowly birth, but lordly dreams,
Destined to rise above the shades
And shine where freedom's glory beams.
Thy feet which gyves of bondage wore
In childhood's morn to check thy gait,
The lofty heights of manhood's shore
Now press beneath their lordly tread.
Thy hand once fettered wields a wand,
More sovereign far than slavery swayed;
For when uplifted, thy command
Is heard with gladness and obeyed.
Thy neck now scorns the despot's yoke,
But greatly lifts thy people's cares,
Thy tongue from muteness long has woke
In answer to long uttered prayers.
Thy burning words and flaming speech,
Make captive listeners heed God's will;
Thou'st called to minister and teach,
And nobly dost thy mission fill.
Bishop L. J. Coppin, D.D.
Before church honors crowned thy brow,
Or greatness gave thee place,
Thou wert the same as thou art now,
True to thy friends and race.
Wedding Anniversary of a Friend.
One year to-day on Hymen's sea,
A youthful bark took sail;
The sky was bright, the air was free
From signs of threatening gale.
Clasped in each other's fond embrace,
Two hearts comprised the crew;
The wind and wave they dared to face,
Nor fear nor peril knew.
Freighted with love the ship sped on,
Manned by an unseen hand—
The silvery waves she bore upon
Pictured a scene most grand.
In joy's fond port of honeymoon,
Our youthful craft reclined;
Her upturned brow was bronzed by noon,
Her pennant kissed the wind.
The happy crew a landing made:
With zephyrs as their guide,
In flowery walks through love's arcade,
They roamed the Eden wide.
Till warned by touch of busy care,
Or roused by duty's call,
'Twere life to see the lovely pair
Or hear their accents fall.
But from this port of matchless joy,
Full twelve months less but one;
With anchor weighed, love's floating toy,
Its sterner voyage begun.
And still she glides with sanguine pride,
On life's uncertain deep,
While the Unseen Lord of Time and Tide,
Her crew I pray may keep.
Emancipation Ode.
Sons of Freedom, swell the chorus;
Ring the anthem loud and clear,
Break it forth from vale and highland,
Shout it that the Heavens might hear.
Better time than now to sing it,
Better time to vent ye praise,
God hath not dispensed to mortals,
Since the birth of cosmic days.
While the hills and dales are list'ning,
And the mountain tops are glist'ning
With the frigid fruit from Winter's tree—
While the merry sleigh bells jingle,
And yon vesper orbs doth twinkle
Sound the notes of Freedom's jubilee.
Deep in volume, let the compass
Of our freedom day refrain,
Indicate the depth of gladness
That inspires a nation's strain.
In a day is born a nation,
In a day from death to life
Truth transforms embondaged millions,
Lifts them through a bloody strife.
Ere heart-rending sighs were ended,
While to God man's cries ascended
With a purpose born of faith divine.
Ruler Lincoln snapped the fetters
As he wrote in golden letters,
Freedom's sun shall rise o'er Dixon's line.
Yet we lingered in the darkness
Of the night of grim old war,
But while groping in the dungeon
Caught faint gleams of hope afar.
Poised was justice on her pinions,
In her scales stood right and might,
While she drew from God's dominion
Truth's stern sabre strong and bright.
This she waved with firm decision,
Though might scorned and in derision
Hurled defiance at her plea for liberty;
Knowing that the Lord had spoken,
Justice hold could not be broken,
For the truth of God was pledged to make
men free.
Then grim might so gored and smitten
By the flaming sword of truth,
Sighed to know its doom was written,
Sighed, then sank to rise no more.
In the grave of vast oblivion
Buried is this ghastly dead,
Broken now the bondsman prison
And his fears forever fled.
Where stood drivers with their lashes
Drawing gore from dreadful gashes,
Where ran freely mortal crimson streams;
Now the school house and the college,
Golden streams from founts of knowledge,
Rich supply doth give to Freedom's dreams.
Now we'll drown the howling bloodhounds
With the shout of freedom's march,
And will dissipate the dark frown
From the brow of slavery passed.
With our mighty notes of gladness
From our famous jubilees,
Let us banish every sadness
Till the foe our triumph sees.
In our galaxy of great men
See our Douglass, Payne and Townsend,
With their compeers Bruce, and Price,
While beside these see our Arnett;
See our Elliott, Brown, and Garnett
Whom with Simmons late doth shine in
Paradise.
Macedonia.
Through the pall of sin's midnight from the
verge of despair
Rings the cry of distress, the most pitiful
prayer;
'Tis the plea of the millions enshrouded in
gloom,
'Neath the weight of that sentence which
threatens their doom.
"Come over and help us, ye children of sight,
We grope in the darkness while ye boast the
light;
Your footsteps are lighted with rays from on
high,
While for want of salvation, we perish, we
die.
O hear our entreaties and heed our distress,
From the ills of Sin's serfdom give Heaven's
redress;
Our fathers have wrought in Sin's temple for
ages,
Ourselves and our children are reaping the
wages."
America's Seventh Wonder.
Most mighty marvel, height of human skill,
Acme of genius, fruit of mighty will;
Colossus statue, nor Niagara's span
Thy praise can rival, earth's most wondrous plan.
Beneath thy arch in forms majestic glide,
Proud ocean monarchs, stemming wind and tide,
Mid tempests rage or wild cyclonic gale
Thy towering pillars never shake nor fail.
Midway thy breast strong engines swell in vain,
To test thy strength though endless be the train
Of mortal freight that always come and go
Though surges beat and angry tempests blow.
Ten thousand footmen sweep across thy plain,
Still oft returning come and go again,
While youth and maiden sit or stroll alone
Whiling the hours in gleeful talk or song.
Here lovers meet within thy stout embrace
And chase their phantoms o'er the water's waste;
Here rogues convene and blacklegs catch their game,
Or maddened dreamers leap in quest of fame.
Here, too, the man of science scans his prize
With knitted eyebrows and far-gazing eyes,
Untangling skeins of rich and knotty thought
Until his thread of gold is firmly caught.
Too, from thy towering form the poets gaze
Neath twilight's lure or sun or comet's blaze,
Descries his own creations with delight
And welcomes dull-eyed souls to share the sight.
Most modern marvel, do I thee behold,
In dreamy frenzy, dost thou not unfold
Some mightier plan which yet may man mature
To link our land with some great foreign shore?
As from thy brow Bartholdi's beams I scan.
And see this shining queen illumine man,
My hopeful vision hastens on the day
When earth shall glisten in a brighter ray.
From thy seed thought I see the the columns rise
With earth their base mount sightless to the skies,
Which shall two countries span and link in one
The mightiest nations neath the shining sun.
From Gotham's wonder and from Brooklyn's pride,
From sky-kissed columns and from where the tide
Sweeps Ocean's floors and lays the cable bed,
To force Creative, all my thoughts are led.
Man Burning.
Like hungry tigers for the prey
They raged and rent the air,
Then with a wild and maddened rush
Sent terror everywhere.
What cared the mob for law's decree,
Or honor's plaintive cry,
'Twas out for blood, and each man swore
The prisoner must die.
In mad stampede the Court they awed
With pistol fire and yell,
The Judge and Sheriff, tip-staves all
Soon caught a glimpse of—
The Judge was hustled from the bench
The Sheriff seized and bound,
While cruel hands the pris'ner gagged
And hauled him like a hound.
In noontide's glare they bore the wretch
In full view of the crowd,
And piled the wood and poured the oil
That shaped his tragic shroud.
"Stand back the crowd!" the leader bawled,
With weapon cocked in hand;
"Make room for ladies and young folks!"
Rang out the stern command.
"Come ladies, girls and boys," he said,
"Gaze on the helpless dog;
We've got him fast, although he squirms,
We'll roast him like a hog.
Before we start the deadly blaze
We'll give the wretch a chance,
To own his crimes and say his prayers,
While ye around him dance.
Say culprit, your last time has come,
Have you a word to say,
So own your guilt and make your peace
Or sing, or preach or pray."
The prisoner upward glanced his eyes,
Then scanned the heartless crowd,
And dealt a blow of deep surprise
In answer clear and loud.
"I have no fears to meet my God,
The crime you charge to me
Was done by him who led this mob
To hide his infamy.
I saw this red-faced bully here,
As he struck the blow and ran;
I heard the struggling woman cry,
0 save me, if you can!
No woman's cries e'er reach my ears
Unless I answer make;
If I must die for aiding her,
1 die for honor's sake.
Soon as I saw that she was dead
I gave chase to her slayer,
Who chased the wind in lightning speed
Spurred on by guilt and fear.
He met a crowd of roadside men
And to them told a tale,
When all at once they turned on me
And shouted, 'Give him hail.'
They opened fire, but missed the mark;
Then I began to shoot
In self-defense and got my man,
But not the guilty brute.
Now if for these brave deeds of mine
You mean my flesh to burn,
I have but this last word to say,
To-day, it is your turn.
But he who marks the sparrow's fall,
And numbers every strand,
Will pour his wrath in judgment dread
On all who round me stand."
They lit the fire and burnt his flesh,
And kicked his quivering frame
Until all left of mortal life
Had slumbered in the flame.
They scrambled mid the ashes pale
Before the heat had left,
And fought for bits of relics rare
Like curs of wits bereft.
The ladies laughed and children cheered
In joyous, ghoulish glee,
No circus train had brought such sport
For folks to hear or see.
But nature settles not like men;
She takes her own good time,
And turns the vial when 'tis full
On heads of blood-guilt crime.
Marked from that day with vengeance pen
Was each foul lyncher's head,
And God's true archers drew the arm
Which reckoned for the dead.
Within the space of one twelvemonth
From that man-burning day,
Each lyncher's soul was summoned hence
In some unnatural way.
As each lost spirit sped the bounds
Of the infernal gate,
God's vengeful demons waiting stood
To sink him to his fate.
The sure results of what he sowed
The lyncher now doth reap,
The fires he built for man on earth
For him will devils keep.
A genuine sheet of raging fire
Shall be the lyncher's bed,
And he who burnt his brother's flesh
Shall with hell-fire be fed.
So lynchers take a fool's advice,
And henceforth from this day
Let reason curb thy passion wild,
And justice have its sway.
Allen University.
Long live to bless the race and kind
Ennobled by thy name,
Within thy walls may thousands find
Learning and power and fame.
Morris Brown College.
In days long ago when the skies hung like
midnight,
And curtained the hopes of a race bound in
chains,
Thy fame-titled namesake with far-reaching
insight
Moved manfully northward to Freedom's
domains.
So, too, may this offspring of light-giving
glory
Shed good cheer and hope to its long-
mantled race,
That oncoming ages may cherish the story
And sing of the fathers who gave thee thy
place.
For Deliverance from Oppression.
Regard in tenderness, O Lord,
The ills thy children bear;
Do thou thy gracious help afford,
And answer this our prayer.
We trust not in the arms of flesh;
We lean upon thy word;
For thine own arm omnipotent,
Is mightier than the sword.
What care we for the midnight foe?
Or arrows winged with light?
Or pestilence's fatal touch,
Since thou, Lord, art our might?
We need not fear the cruel hate
Of those we've done no wrong;
We look to thee, our Advocate,
For weapons sure and strong.
In common Fatherhood above,
Thou reignest o'er the world;
The poor thou liftest from the dust,
The proud are downward hurled.
Home.
From the glory region a sunbeam sped,
A token of love it bore,
And on my home a lustre shed
From the garment of light it wore.
The family group it cheered with life,
And a rainbow of hope it wove,
To girdle the brow of the love-guided wife,
And the helpmeet she promised to love.
Though I journey afar from this love-haloed
sphere,
Though distance our bodies divide,
I'll still with my loved ones in spirit be near,
And wake in my dreams at their side.
The Bad Black Man.
There's a bad black man,
And he causes lots of trouble;
He's like a pot from torment,
For he makes it bubble, bubble.
If it wasn't for this villain,
So I hear the white folks say,
There'd be a better feeling,
Than what exists to-day.
I wish this bad black fellow,
Had never seen the light,
But had tarried with the bad man,
In the region out of sight.
Bishop W. B. Derrick, D.D.
When cruel war her bugle note,
To far-off regions sounded,
Though but a lad in land remote,
Thy footsteps hither bounded.
'Midst screaming shells and whistling shot,
From belching gunboat broadside,
Through thickest fight and flinching not,
Thou battled till the foe died.
A sterner foe though made to face,
Thy courage knows no pallor,
Whate'er confronts the church and race,
Calls for thy ready valor.
Long may thy tongue its thunder claps,
Ring out against base treason,
'Till conquering like the valiant Japs,
The foe is taught to reason.
Bishop Charles Spencer Smith.
In silent grandeur 'neath yon southern skies,
Five stately stories to his honor rise,
To greet the rising sun and restful night,
And lift a rising people into light.
To Afric's field on equal service bent,
This valiant churchman has been lately sent,
Heroic toilsman in far-off woods or town
A nobler structure may his labors crown.
Bishop B. T. Tanner, D.D., LL.D.
A stream of light thy pen for years,
In radiance strong and clear,
Has shed across thy people's sky,
And drew the day dawn near.
In honor's fame thy place is won,
Thy church will fondly dwell
Upon thy worth in living thoughts,
That will for ages tell.
W. D. Chappelle, D.D.
Wielding the sword with all thy might,
Daring to battle for the right,
Content to face opposing foes,
Heroic as the conflict grows.
As royal as the knights of old,
Posing to meet the warrior bold,
Placid amid the raging crowd,
Easy when others thunder loud.
Long may thy mettled spirit burn,
Long may thy courage weakness spurn.

INTRODUCTION. 
 Despite untoward environments, there are some 
 choice spirits who, breaking "their birth's invidious 
 bars," mount, as it were, upon eagle's wings to the sub- 
 limest heights in the realms of fiction, fancy, or fact, 
 where Nature's God designed that only kindred souls 
 should meet. No amount of secular or sacred training 
 can either make or unmake such men. They are born 
 to their stations, not made heirs to such a heritage. 
 "The mystic bee" drops the honey of persuasion on but 
 few tongues in the domain of eloquence. These would 
 be eloquent whether savage or sage. 
 Euterpe and Polyhymnia, oft discounting the rheto- 
 rician's rules, allow but few mortal eyes "in fine frenzy 
 rolling" to sweep from earth to heaven in striving to 
 express the thoughts of God, and the heart of man. 
 Among these latter few Charles R. Dinkins seems to 
 belong. While his eyes and mine may have doubtless 
 left some errors of rhythm or rhyme in his verses, and 
 while our judgment may have passed over even graver 
 faults, yet I believe this little book will profit, please, 
 and help to sanctify those readers who admire genius, 
 whether crude or erudite. 
 John W. Gilbert. 
PREFACE. 
 It is customary for one to preface his writing with 
 a few remarks of an apologetic character. Reluctantly 
 complying with this custom, I offer this little volume 
 to the consideration of those who may feel disposed to 
 join me in my humble lays, with the earnest hope that 
 it may be to them what it has been to me — a source 
 of real comfort and a delightful recreation. Some 
 years ago, when I wrote my first verse, little did I think 
 that it would result in this effort. Since then, I have 
 written a few hundred poems and hymns, if such they 
 are worthy to be called, and of these a few choice se- 
 lections are given. I wrote not for profit, but for the 
 real pleasure of the hour; not for the poet's fame, which 
 is as polluting as it is perishable, except so far as it 
 widens the field of usefulness; but I wrote rather be- 
 cause "I love to sit at eve alone," and sing of Thee, 
 my Darling and Spouse. 
 Though the world is full of hymns, and rhymes 
 conclude each passing hour; and though the very least 
 of them may far surpass the best that I have written, 
 yet few, if any, can prove more sweet to me than the 
 very fruit of my own affection and experience. I lay 
 no claim to genius; to learning, less; nor dare I boast 
 a writer's gift, or penman's triumph. The critic may 
 find many thorns, the scrupulous a briar, but he who 
 really loves to love, a flower or two. 
 But suffice it to say that a song or poem which 
 glorifies God and alleviates mortal woe is not born of 
 mere human ingenuity. Those invisible visitors who 
 come to us in forms mysterious and unseen, embracing 
 our sinking breasts with flame-fledged pinions bright, 
 and breathing a message that only spirits can convey, 
 are not "of the earth, earthy," From Nature's happy 
 choirs there ever flow sweet anthems of ravishing de- 
 Hght which drown the contemplating soul in torrents 
 of such amazing joys as mortal tongue can but express 
 in part. For he who walks beneath Love's clearer sky, 
 where storms roll not, nor thunders harshly speak, nor 
 lightnings thread the air, shall listen to emollient 
 echoes of soul-enrapturing song. There lifted up, or 
 swooned away in blissful unconsciousness of all life's 
 ills, he waits in cheerful expectancy, like a thirsty bird 
 beneath a dewy bough, to catch the sweeter strains that 
 fall from holier lips. Love's fires burn deep in the 
 crater of the soul, and every nerve and tendon throbs 
 with triple stroke. Electric hands sweep over the 
 spirit's diapason, and the man is made a lyre. At 
 times, even imperial reason nods his kingly head in 
 sweet repose; with learning oft forgot, he drops the 
 folded scroll of experience from his forgetful hands. 
 He who prunes the vine greatly increases the harvest, 
 and richer makes the fruit. Such is the result of the 
 friendly criticism of this volume by Prof. John Wesley 
 Gilbert, A. M., of Paine College, Augusta, Ga., who 
 also wrote the introduction. Whatever be the magnifi- 
 cence of human character — its loftiness of love — its 
 majesty of life — it is best shown by that spirit that 
 criticizes with kindness, counsels without crushing, 
 and befriends without flattering. Such is the character 
 of him named above. Charles R. Dinkins.

To Jesus and Mankind 
 This humble volume is lovingly dedicated 
 by the Author. 
THE AUTHOR AS "THE BOY PREACHER" 
 AT THE AGE OF TWELVE. 
INVOCATION. 
 Lord of angelic nations, bright, 
 God of the mighty seas and skies, 
 Who shuts the mournful door of Night, 
 Who bids the gates of Day "Arise" — 
 Remember, Lord, Thy people here. 
 Our sins reprove; be not severe. 
 Far as Thy mercies belt the skies, 
 O'erarching nature's varied breeds; 
 Beneath, commingle weak and wise, 
 Companions all in crimes or creeds; 
 So far Thy gracious wings extend. 
 And shelter us, though we have sinned. 
 Speak not with Sinai's thunders, Lord, 
 Nor whip with Egypt's fiery thong, 
 Nor lift Vesuvius' flaming rod. 
 Nor lash with Etna's lava tongue. 
 With milder grace our sins reprove; 
 Remember Thy forgiving love. 
 Though by the flames of hell pursued, 
 Deliver, Lord, from threat'ning fate 
 Steer safely o'er the angry flood 
 Thine own erected Ship of State. 
 With Nineveh we now repent 
 On knees in dust and ashes bent. 
 Make not our fate like pagan Rome, 
 Nor perished empires as of old; 
 Nor let expected ages come. 
 And tread upon our shattered mold. 
 Make this Thy chosen nation, Lord, 
 To love Thy Law and keep Thy Word. 
 On caravans of steel from far 
 New nations travel o'er the seas; 
 They come to hail each stripe and star; 
 From chains they seek a moment's ease. 
 Make this, where pilgrim strangers rove, 
 A land of liberty and love. 
 Where floats our flag, whose emblems tell 
 The story of a people free, 
 Let choruses of freedom swell 
 Beyond the summit and the sea, 
 Till alien tribes Thy Law approve. 
 And join our covenant of love. 
 Not to the woven web of laws, 
 Not to the scholar's fancied dream; 
 But to Thy love we trust our cause, 
 And ponder on the sacred theme. 
 When laws succumb and letters fail, 
 Thy love, O God, shall still prevail. 
 How vain the miser's hoarded pile! 
 Our wealth lies not in treasured gain, 
 Nor hill where cities group and smile. 
 Nor harvest field, nor prairie plain; 
 But may our wealth forever be 
 True love and loyalty to Thee. 
 Not in our floating isles of steel, 
 Whose watchers guard our shores from 
 harm — 
 Whose every tow'ring mast and keel 
 Defies the fury of the storm; 
 But in Thy Law of Love, so just. 
 Shall be this nation's firmer trust. 
 Not grizzled batteries of stone. 
 Whose monsters crouch with look austere, 
 While seas majestic shout and moan. 
 And heave their frothy tributes near; 
 For none of these sufficient prove; 
 Our fortress is the nation's love. 
 Vain is the deep-eyed rifle's stare, 
 And vain the muffled musket's blast, 
 Or silver swords that pierce or tear, 
 Or bayonets by forgers cast : 
 Unless Thy arm protection give, 
 Death is the life the nations live. 
 Shall we on savage arms improve 
 To bid defiance to the seas ? 
 And trust the sword, but doubt Thy love, 
 And with our flag pollute the breeze ? 
 Lord, may we, to Thy love resigned. 
 Be unto heathen sinners kind. 
 We chain the lightning fast to earth, 
 And, harnessed well in steel and wire. 
 It draws the trains of toil and mirth — 
 A living messenger of fire. 
 So rich and wise, still sins improve; 
 When shall Thy people learn to love! 
 With peace abroad and war at home, 
 We glory in our cherished shame : 
 Our vessels manned, o'er seas we roam. 
 Our foes we bless, our friends we blame! 
 Forgive Thine erring people, Lord, 
 Who lynch at home and love abroad! 
 With holy zeal to heathen lands, 
 We run to kiss those far away; 
 Then turn with frantic heart and hands 
 On these at home, to burn and flay. 
 Yet, Lord, forgive! remove the stain, 
 Nor brand us with the curse of Cain. 
 With skill we weave our crooked laws 
 Which free the knave and lash the poor. 
 With none to help or plead their cause, 
 While Justice drives them from his door! 
 Let Love prevail with Justice now, 
 While at his shrine Thy people bow. 
 O, teach us. Lord, in spite of strife, 
 As one to live, as one to die; 
 Bound by the higher law of life — 
 With Jonathan and David's tie : 
 United, let our interest prove 
 DiviNEST Brotherhood of Love! 
 Bid strife depart and warring cease; 
 The bone of vile contention move; 
 Let all our fortresses be peace. 
 And all our bulwarks. Lord, be love — 
 While harvests smile from plain and hill, 
 And all our humble wants fulfill. 
 Lord, make us one great nation, strong, 
 Yet each his race distinction hold; 
 But one in love, in toil, in song. 
 With Christ the Shepherd of the fold : 
 Our rulers bless, their hearts make wise 
 To keep Thine earthly paradise. 
 Make peace Thy people's lasting boon, 
 And virtue, Lord, the nation's pride; 
 Then make our day an endless noon, 
 Nor let its sun in darkness hide : 
 Let Glory write on every brow. 
 Divided Once; United Now. 
 With vice and anarchy destroyed. 
 And the assassins turned to saints; 
 With liberty by all enjoyed. 
 Let happy song succeed complaints; 
 With love to reign at Justice bar, 
 Let peace disperse the gloom of war. 
 Then call our weary warriors home- 
 To nurse the dull camp-fire no more— 
 Nor pace to notes of fife or drum, 
 For peace prevails from shore to shore- 
 To bivouac now with those they love, 
 From mother, wife, no more to rove. 
 Call home our wandering navies, too, 
 Weary of warfare and the waves; 
 No more let brother sailors view 
 Their brethren sink to watery graves; 
 To home recall the lost marines, 
 Where rage no more the stormy scenes. 
 One country, East, or West, or North, 
 Or South, or classes high or low; 
 And one great army marching forth 
 Who only One Great Union know! 
 One people home, and one abroad, 
 Whose God and Sovereign is the Lord! 
 "Thy Works Shall Praise Thee." 
 All things a beam of glory shed, 
 And all to God a hymn compose : 
 In every leaf His love is read — 
 His mercy smiles in every rose. 
 The theme of Night's ten thousand choirs, 
 Affirms Thy love to sinners far; 
 While Nature, with her million lyres, 
 Sends back reply to every star. 
 Loud from the smiling lips of Day, 
 Come sweetest praises to Thy name : 
 A song is sung by every ray — 
 A cheering note by every beam. 
 Black moving clouds o'er clouds prevail. 
 Which by Jehovah's breath are driven; 
 And on their dark and stormy trail, 
 The lightnings write His love in heaven. 
 Dread thunders vie with thunders dread, 
 And praise Him in their notes of wrath, 
 Who hangs the rainbow o'er His head, 
 And spans the storm's well-beaten path. 
 Deep rolling seas their billows heave. 
 And chant a thousand solemn lays, 
 And on the trackless oceans leave 
 Their anthems of eternal praise. 
 Wake, mortals! sing Love's wondrous lay. 
 While Nature all her powers engage — 
 While singing Night and smiling Day 
 Repeat the song from age to age! 
 Omniscient Love. 
 Far as this vast expanse is spread, 
 God's loving eyes survey: 
 Where'er our feeble footsteps tread, 
 He watches on the way. 
 The universe a volume lies 
 Wide open to His gaze; 
 And still He looks with loving eyes 
 On every heart of praise. 
 He listens to the thunders loud, 
 And to our whispers low : 
 He hears the boasting of the proud — 
 The orphan's cry of woe. 
 The music of ten thousand choirs 
 Attracts Him none the more 
 Than does the heart of pure desires, 
 Or groaning of the poor. 
 A million threads of sacred laws 
 About His hand entwine : 
 Angelic tribes to Him He draws — 
 He draws this heart of mine. 
 He loves the pure and the defiled, 
 The mighty and the faint; 
 He loves the cherub and the child — 
 The seraph and the saint. 
 Unnumbered worlds in distant flight 
 Swing pendant on His arms; 
 There, too, my soul hangs with delight. 
 And laughs at hell's alarms. 
 The sinner may approach His feet, 
 While angels, too, surround : 
 Oh! what a happy place to meet 
 Where pardon free is found! 
 More brightly than the soothing morn, 
 Which bids the night recede, 
 Upon the humble heart forlorn, 
 He smiles in time of need. 
 He cheers the troubled nations all, 
 And soothes the infant's fright : 
 He marks the little sparrow's fall. 
 And views the cherub's flight. 
 He fills the oceans to their brim. 
 And chains them to the shore; 
 And so the soul that dwells in Him 
 Can roam afar no more. 
 He sees the flight of all the spheres. 
 And numbers every gem : 
 The cradled infant's cry He hears, 
 Observing each of them. 
 Deep in the fiery track of hell 
 His awful frowns reprove. 
 While myriads at His footstool tell 
 The wonders of His love. 
 With such a God and Father too. 
 May we not feel secure; 
 Nor fear what death and hell may do, 
 Though clouds our path obscure ? 
 The shining kingdoms cannot hold 
 The Presence we esteem; 
 For in the heart with love untold, 
 He dwells but to redeem. 
 The Wondrous Babe. 
 Sing, O bright heralds of the morn, 
 "Good news" to all creation cry; 
 Till shepherds on the plain forlorn 
 Receive Thy message from the sky. 
 Bid sin's engrossing gloom retreat, 
 While angels shout the wondrous theme; 
 Tread down the night with shining feet 
 Around the Babe of Bethlehem, 
 Let all the stars their luster pour. 
 And let the moon increase her light; 
 While all the seas, from shore to shore. 
 Proclaim, the Lord is born tonight. 
 Let hills and plains resound the lay. 
 And join with every smiling gem; 
 Tell to the world just ere the day 
 That Christ is born in Bethlehem. 
 Ye sinking isles from slumber wake, 
 Repeat the chorus of the star, 
 Till the angelic anthems break 
 On all Thy nations now afar. 
 Sing, heathen tribes! ye sages, sing! 
 The Lord shall all the earth redeem; 
 With grateful hearts a tribute bring, 
 And praise the Babe of Bethlehem. 
 Sing, too, ye listless dead, and tell 
 The love and power of thy God; 
 For yet a while and ye shall dwell 
 No more beneath the frozen clod. 
 Nor shall the grave with terrors fright; 
 Lo! all must now succumb to Him; 
 Lo! death and hell are put to flight 
 By Christ, the Babe of Bethlehem. 
 When Thou the parching scroll shall rend, 
 While hills depart and seas consume; 
 Rise up in judgment, Lord, descend. 
 And burst the shackles of the tomb. 
 cyclones and storms to song shall break. 
 While lightnings fringe His diadem — 
 While thunders after thunders speak, 
 And praise the Babe of Bethlehem. 
 Have You No Room for Jesus? 
 Have you no room for Jesus 
 To dwell within your heart? 
 Should sinful pleasures seize us, 
 And force Him to depart ? 
 O, why not now receive Him? 
 How dare you bid Him go ? 
 Have you no room to give Him ? 
 Why drive Him from thy door ? 
 No room for your dear Savior, 
 To spread a feast of love ? 
 Why show Him such behavior — 
 Your Friend from heaven above? 
 Though often from thee driven. 
 He waiteth still to bless — 
 To speak thy sins forgiven — 
 To bring thee happiness. 
 Unheeded long and slighted, 
 He knocketh at thy door : 
 Poor soul in sin benighted, 
 Bid Him depart no more. 
 With humble heart believing, 
 O, trust His love today; 
 He comes, free pardon giving. 
 Just let Him have His wa)^ 
 O, bid Him ''Welcome", "Enter", 
 And He will make thee glad; 
 He loves to bless the sinner 
 Whose heart is lone and sad. 
 With bleeding hands He's standing. 
 Still knocking at thy heart; 
 With tender love demanding, 
 Why bid me now depart ? 
 But if you still reject Him, 
 And will not give Him room, 
 Some day you will expect Him, 
 But He will never come. 
 Soon at the gates of heaven 
 You'll knock in doubt and sin; 
 To hell you shall be driven, 
 Unless you let Him in. 
 Triumphal March to Glory. 
 Hosts of hell, stand back before us, 
 Jesus is our Captain, strong : 
 With His banners lifted o'er us, 
 With triumphal shout and song — 
 We are marching 
 On to join the heavenly throng. 
 World, thou canst no more allure us, 
 Wealth, we scorn thy charming snare; 
 Death, in vain thou shalt pursue us, 
 Greedy grave, thy victory where ? 
 On to glory, 
 We will follow Jesus there. 
 Chilly stream, thy troubled waters 
 Shall delay us here no more; 
 Part, while Zion's sons and daughters 
 Shout their happy crossing o'er : 
 Land of Canaan, 
 We are near thy golden shore. 
 Watchmen on the towers of glory. 
 See, the ransomed hosts are near; 
 Lo, we sing a wondrous story, 
 Lo, we come to enter there : 
 Captain Jesus! 
 We are marching; in the rear. 
 "Who are they in white robes coming? 
 With what love their faces shine! 
 And the heavenly hills alarming 
 With a glorious theme divine ?" 
 Jesus answers, 
 "Hear, ye heavens! these are mine! 
 "Mine, redeemed through tribulation, 
 Mine, with garments washed in blood; 
 They are children of salvation. 
 They the powers of hell withstood; 
 They are worthy, 
 Lo! thev are the heirs of God!" 
 Dust to Dust. 
 Great Mother of this withered dust, 
 We now return thy child; 
 These relics hold in sacred trust, 
 Till all are reconciled. 
 Unfold thine arms; receive thine own, 
 And keep the treasured clay 
 Where neither pains nor toil are known, 
 Nor frightful passions play. 
 Ne'er can the foe's keen arrows pierce 
 Thy bosom now — so calm; 
 The grim array of battles fierce 
 Shall thee no more alarm. 
 Though o'er thy grave the strife may rage, 
 Unhallowed feet may tread; 
 But none shall call thee to engage, 
 Nor trouble thee with dread. 
 Peace is thy better portion now, 
 And thy possession, rest; 
 No cares can discompose thy brow, 
 Nor fears disturb thy breast. 
 But scenes of sweet, immortal bliss, 
 Thy purer eyes discern : 
 Thy soul shall live in righteousness, 
 Though dust to dust return. 
 How real the joys which here below 
 You sought by faith so long! 
 How sweet the bliss thy soul shall know! 
 How sweeter still thy song! 
 Oh! could we part the veil and see 
 What pleasures, all thine own, 
 We'd gladly sleep in death with thee, 
 And bid the world. Begone. 
 Not long hast thou to slumber here. 
 For soon the trump shall sound, 
 And Christ Himself shall soon appear, 
 With all His angels round. 
 Shiloh. 
 Behold! Shiloh is come to earth; 
 He's born in Bethlehem: 
 The star that marks his humble birth 
 Shall deck His diadem. 
 Departing from the Court above, 
 He laid aside His crown; 
 And angels marveled at His love, 
 As Jesus started down. 
 As He approached the gates, ajar, 
 The bright seraphic choir 
 Joined in the chorus of the star, 
 And smote their harps of fire. 
 Each tongue and harp flung forth the strain, 
 So sweet to sinners still — 
 Resounding from Elysian plain, 
 And from the heavenly hill. 
 Down Umbra's steeps they made their way, 
 While blushing darkness fled; 
 The news to earth they did convey, 
 And thus the tidings read: 
 "All glory be to God most high. 
 And peace to all mankind. 
 Go, shepherds, to the manger fly! 
 And your Salvation find." 
 "Good news! good news!" the minstrel cried, 
 Come, sinner, see the sight; 
 Be not afraid nor terrified. 
 The Lord is born this night. 
 The stillness of the night was broke 
 By swift seraphic wing, 
 Whose pinion made, at every stroke. 
 The vaults of glory ring. 
 The Lord is come! let Juda yield 
 The scepter to His hand; 
 O'er all creation let Him wield. 
 And let Him take command. 
 The Wonderful. 
 The Lamb is wonderful indeed. 
 To stand our bond above. 
 When none would for the sinner plead 
 In the high Court of Love. 
 When all the worlds were searched in vain, 
 And searching, none could find 
 A ransom to remove the stain 
 Of sin from all mankind; 
 When back to God the searchers came, 
 Exhausted in their flight; 
 With wing they hid in holy shame 
 Their guiltless faces bright; 
 "Whom shall we send, and who will go, 
 Salvation to provide ?" 
 The angels drooped their pinions low, 
 "Unworthy!" all replied. 
 Not one would face the fiery Law; 
 All shrank in silence there; 
 E'en Michael stood in speechless awe. 
 And Gabriel would not dare. 
 I wept when there could none be found, 
 To make salvation free; 
 Till lo! a Lamb, with glory crowned, 
 Said, "Llere am I; send me!" 
 Oh! that ten thousand harps were mine, 
 To sing the joys I feel — 
 To sing of all His love divine, 
 Who broke for me the seal. 
 Lo! sinners, see the wondrous sight — 
 Thy Savior's smiling face! 
 How wonderful in glory, bright — 
 In peace and pardoning grace! 
 He's wonderful in love to sway, 
 Us rebels to forgive; 
 He bade the sword of Justice stay, 
 And let the sinner live. 
 The Heavenly Child. 
 Unto us a Child is born; 
 Unto us a Son is given: 
 Wake to joy ye hearts that mourn, 
 Hail the Prince of Peace from heaven. 
 He is given to retrieve 
 Every sinner from despair: 
 Soul, awake! in Christ believe, 
 His redeeming glory share. 
 He is given to my heart, 
 Healing Balm of peace and rest; 
 Naught can bid my joys depart, 
 While He reigneth in my breast. 
 He is given, saving Power, 
 To protect the little flock; 
 In the dark and trying hour. 
 Flee and hide in Him, the Rock. 
 He is given here beneath — 
 Unto all believers given: 
 He's our strong defense in death, 
 And our endless life in heaven. 
 Victorious King. 
 King! come down; Thy work is finished; 
 Hang no longer on the tree: 
 Ancient glory undiminished, 
 New-won praise await for Thee: 
 I adore Thee, 
 Though forsaken on the tree. 
 King! old hell is fast retreating, 
 Lo, thou art the victor now; 
 Feebly though Thy heart is beating, 
 Though Thy head in death must bow — 
 Crowns of glory 
 Shall adorn Thy wounded brow. 
 King! sink into death's dark regions, 
 Back to life Thy ransomed bring; 
 Smite and scatter all his legions, 
 Rob the monster of his sting: 
 Easter morning. 
 Thou shalt rise victorious, King. 
 King! the gates of hell are yielding, 
 They no more Thy power withstand: 
 Over death Thy scepter wielding, 
 Hold their keys in Thy right hand: 
 Thou hast conquered, 
 Rise, O King! and take command. 
 King, awake! the morn is breaking. 
 Sleep no longer with the dead; 
 From the tomb its terrors taking, 
 Death is now a captive led: 
 He is risen! 
 Qirist is risen from the dead! 
 King! Thy saints around Thee bending, 
 Casting palms about Thy way. 
 Each a diadem extending — 
 With what rapture now they say: 
 Hallelujah! 
 Jesus is our King today! 
 "Let All the Angels Worship Him. 
 Hear! O, ye tall archangels, hear! 
 Ye seraph throng obey; 
 Let all of every rank and tier 
 Fall at His feet today. 
 Ye Elders, nearest to the throne, 
 Do homage to Him now; 
 And thus adore the Holy One; 
 Make bare your heads and bow. 
 Bow down, ye shining armies near. 
 And all His glory tell; 
 Your faces veil in holy fear 
 Before Immanuel. 
 In awe extend your wing of flame, 
 His praises still repeat; 
 To all His wondrous love proclaim. 
 And kiss His wounded feet. 
 Through distant worlds in rapture fly, 
 And tell the tidings there; 
 O, sing His praises all on high. 
 And then to sinners here. 
 Down through the deep, dark vaults of hell. 
 Let your loud anthems ring; 
 To the rebellious armies tell 
 That Jesus is our King. 
 Join in His praise, ye reconciled. 
 Ye saints who know His love; 
 Ye nations great, ye heathens wild. 
 With all the hosts above. 
 Hasten, O coronation day, 
 When all the ransomed dead 
 Shall spring triumphant from the clay. 
 And crown his wounded head. 
 My Beloved. 
 Lord Jesus, how I love Thee! 
 Thy precious name, how sweet! 
 To better things it moves me, 
 And makes my joys complete. 
 Thy presence sweet and balmy 
 Is so delightful here; 
 Mid all this life, so stormy, 
 'Tis heaven to feel Thee near. 
 Lord Jesus, I surrender, 
 And yield to love divine; 
 Nor life nor death can hinder 
 My heart from joining Thine. 
 All, all the world forsaking. 
 Of things though dear to me; 
 Since of Thy love partaking, 
 I quit them all for Thee. 
 Lord Jesus, I will serve Thee, 
 Though weak, and worn, and faint; 
 And nothing here shall swerve me — 
 Of nothing bring complaint. 
 I will, dear Lord, adore Thee, 
 For all Thy grace and love; 
 And nothing put before Thee, 
 And nothing lift above. 
 Lord Jesus, lead me ever, 
 Through darkness, woe or gloom; 
 And guide me o'er the river, 
 To my eternal home. 
 And all I want in heaven, 
 Of all its joys divine. 
 Just say, "My child, forgiven. 
 Forever thou art mine." 
 His Funeral. 
 Come, ye disciples, see! 
 Down from the Roman tree 
 Thy Lord is torn: 
 See how they pierced His side. 
 O sacred fountain, wide. 
 Whence flows a crimson tide 
 For all that mourn. 
 We gaze with inward pain 
 On the Immortal Slain, 
 And shrink with dread: 
 Deep from our hearts of woe, 
 As to the tomb we go — 
 Faith sees a star, although 
 The Lord is dead. 
 Take from His hallowed brow — 
 So rent and wounded now — 
 The cruel crown: 
 While here in sorrow deep. 
 Though much we sigh and weep, 
 In life's last solemn sleep 
 We lay Him down. 
 The sun is setting fast; 
 The dreadful day is past 
 Of woe and gloom: 
 Though like a withered flower. 
 He droopeth for an hour; 
 Still He shall rise in power — 
 Up from the tomb. 
 The stars, though once forlorn, 
 The solemn pomp of morn, 
 In glory breaks. 
 Asleep the soldiers fall. 
 While two archangels, tall. 
 The stone away they roll; 
 The Lord awakes. 
 He moves the startled skies, 
 While mountains sink and rise, 
 And Nature bends. 
 With hell defeated, fled, 
 With death a captive led, 
 Triumphant from the dead 
 The Lord ascends! 
 Some One Must Stand Up for Jesus. 
 Some one must stand up for Jesus, 
 Some one must go and obey; 
 Some one must follow Him gladly, 
 Some one must serve Him today. 
 Chorus. 
 Some one, some one. 
 Some one must stand up for Jesus: 
 Some one, some one, 
 Some one must serve Him today. 
 Some one must suffer for. Jesus, 
 Bearing the burden and blame; 
 Sharing the cross with Him daily, 
 Wearing the laurel of shame. 
 Some one must follow the Savior, 
 Holding His banner unfurled; 
 Bearing the scorns of the wicked. 
 Braving the frowns of the world. 
 Some one must witness for Jesiis, 
 Telling His mercies to all — 
 Unto the tribes and the nations, 
 Bidding them come at His call. 
 Some one must die for the Savior, 
 Yielding up life and its toys; 
 Shouting to hear him commanding, 
 "Enter my heavenly joys." 
 Should the Savior Come Tonight. 
 Should the Savior come tonight. 
 Would He find me ready now. 
 Waiting for my robe of white, 
 Ready at His feet to bow ? 
 Would I shrink, His presence shunning 
 Or rejoice to see the sight? 
 Could I welcome His returning. 
 Should the Savior come tonight ? 
 Chorus. 
 Should the Savior come tonight. 
 Should the Savior come tonight. 
 Could I welcome His returning. 
 Should the Savior come tonight? 
 Should the Savior come tonight, 
 Seated on His judgment throne, 
 Would he find me robed in white, 
 Or a naked wretch, undone? 
 Would I dread the trumpet's sounding, 
 Or rejoice with great delight? 
 Could I shout with those surrounding. 
 Should the Savior come tonight ? 
 Should the Savior come tonight, 
 Would He find me on the field. 
 Standing bravely by the right. 
 Or a coward fit to yield ? 
 Would He find me still neglecting. 
 Or engaged in this great fight ? 
 What reward am I expecting. 
 Should the Savior come tonight ? 
 Should the Savior come tonight. 
 What would the poor sinner do ? 
 Would you seek for guilty flight, 
 While His flaming sword pursue ? 
 Would you shout to hail the vision. 
 Would you faint with guilty fright ? 
 What would be the great decision. 
 Should the Savior come tonight? 
 Should the Savior come tonight, 
 With the rainbow on His brow, 
 Shaking earth in His great might, 
 Bidding hills and mountains bow; 
 Mid the parting heavens burning, 
 Saints assembling on His right; 
 I would shout at His returning, 
 Welcome, Savior! come tonight! 
 Who Is Like My Beloved? 
 Jesus, who on earth is like Thee, 
 Who can vie with Thee above ? 
 Who of friends can prove so faithful? 
 Who's so wonderful in love ? 
 Chorus. 
 There is none like Thee, my Savior, 
 None whose voice can call like Thine: 
 None whose love is so engaging, 
 None whose look is so divine. 
 Thou, my Chief among ten thousand, 
 Thou, my altogether Fair, 
 Thou, my sinful heart arousing 
 With what love! — beyond compare. 
 Brighter than the Sons of Morning, 
 Higher than archangels tall; 
 Heaven and earth can find none like Thee, 
 My Belov'd is best of all. 
 In the presence of my Savior, 
 Life is pleasant where I rove; 
 And in spite of pain and sorrow, 
 'Tis a paradise of love. 
 Death nor hell cannot deter me; 
 Never shall I dread the tomb. 
 If my soul can only hear Thee: 
 "Come, My well-beloved, come!" 
 Thou Knowest, Lord, I Love Thee. 
 Thou knowest, Lord, I love Thee 
 Than all this life more dear; 
 There's none in heaven above Thee, 
 And none so precious here. 
 Far more than earthly pleasures 
 Of things that charm and please. 
 Of all their richest treasures — 
 I love Thee more than these. 
 Thou knowest. Lord, I'll serve Thee, 
 While love directs the way, 
 While Thy dear look observes me, 
 Lest I should go astray. 
 Though cumbered oft with sorrow, 
 'Midst storm and wintry blast; 
 The thought of sweet tomorrow 
 Consoles my heart at last. 
 Thou knowest, Lord, I'll praise Thee, 
 And never blush with shame: 
 High as the heavens I'll raise Thee, 
 Thy love to all proclaim. 
 Thy glory! O, how wondrous! 
 Thy mercy! how divine! 
 I'll sing the blessed chorus, 
 With full salvation mine. 
 Thou knowest. Lord, I love Thee, 
 I'll gladly feed Thy sheep; 
 Since oft Thy rod reproves me, 
 Thy little lambs I'll keep. 
 I quit my worldly craving. 
 The sinful greed of gold; 
 I go, the wounded saving, 
 And bring them to Thy fold. 
 If No One Loves Me but Jesus. 
 If no one loves me but Jesus, 
 If no one cheers me below; 
 I shall rejoice in His mercy; 
 He will be faithful, I know. 
 Chorus. 
 Though often forlorn and forsaken, 
 Toiling so wearily here; 
 I shall be lovingly taken 
 Into His bosom so dear. 
 If no one helps me but Jesus 
 In the hard struggles of life, 
 I shall be faithful and serve Him, 
 I shall be victor o'er strife. 
 If no one calls me but Jesus, 
 Cheerily bidding me come, 
 I shall go shouting to heaven. 
 I shall be welcome at home. 
 If no one knows me but Jesus 
 In the bright city of love, 
 I will shout ''Glory!" forever, 
 Vying with angels above. 
 Longing for the Lord. 
 When will the Lord return and take 
 His anxious children home? 
 When will He bid His Bride awake. 
 No more on earth to roam ? 
 Through ages of relentless grief. 
 Midst sorrow, want and fears. 
 We've waited long for our relief, 
 And watched through veils of tears. 
 The pelting rain and lashing storm 
 Have made our passage hard; 
 Defiant still of hell's alarm, 
 We wait for our reward. 
 Heart-rent and faint and sick with woe, 
 Yet not discouraged here — 
 For the believing children know 
 Some day He will appear. 
 Ravaged by death, diseases dire. 
 This hope we still retain: 
 That He shall, with His heavenly choir. 
 Return to earth again. 
 Soon at the gate He shall appear. 
 And ready to descend; 
 While every eye shall view Him near. 
 And every knee shall bend. 
 Sinners! pray tell what will ye do. 
 And whither will ye fly. 
 When you the King of Glory view, 
 Descending from the sky? 
 My soul, enraptured with the sight. 
 Shall shout to see Him there. 
 And join with all the saints in white, 
 To meet Him in the air. 
 Till then we'll watch and wait and sing, 
 While here by faith we roam. 
 Thy children want to see the King, 
 Make haste, O Lord, and come! 
 His Sacred Name. 
 Jesus! the sweetness of Thy name 
 Is all our hearts' desire; 
 It kindles Love's immortal flame 
 And sets the soul on fire. 
 No other name like Thine is found. 
 So mighty to redeem; 
 Since first I heard the charming sound 
 I can't forgfet the theme. 
 It lightens toil and sweetens care, 
 From pain it grants respite; 
 It makes the midnight of despair 
 A heavenly morning bright. 
 What joy it gives, what peace it brings. 
 What bliss it doth impart 1 
 O, that Thy name. Thou King of Kings, 
 Were graven on my heart! 
 My soul would into hell immerge, 
 Without Thy precious name; 
 And life would be a funeral dirge, 
 And end in lasting shame. 
 But with Thy name to sinners known — 
 The pledge of love divine — 
 I challenge Justice at the throne, 
 And claim salvation mine. 
 Though hell with all her crew assail. 
 Or death inject his sting, 
 I'll shout Thy name in this dark vale 
 Triumphantly, and sing: 
 My Savior lives forevermore, 
 And at the latter day 
 He'll open the sepulchral door, 
 And bid me fly away. 
 Immanuel. 
 God is with us in the manger, 
 Lo, what tidings angels tell! 
 Welcome! welcome. Heavenly Stranger! 
 Welcome, dear Immanuel! 
 Welcome, dear Immanuel! 
 God is with us. On to conquest. 
 Soldiers, let us take the field: 
 When we're weakest He is strongest, 
 How the powers of hell do yield! 
 How the powers of hell do yield! 
 God is with us. Up and working 
 Humbly at His blest command; 
 Though mid dangers round us lurking. 
 Nothing shall His power withstand. 
 Nothing shall His power withstand. 
 God is with us; shout His glory. 
 Like the Sons of God of old. 
 Like the Morning Stars, the story 
 Sing with all thy harps of gold; 
 Sing with all thy harps of gold. 
 God is with us at the river 
 As we pass to Canaan's shore, 
 To that bright and sweet forever. 
 Death is but the crossing o'er; 
 Death is but the crossing o'er. 
 God is with us: no more driven. 
 We shall in His kingdom dwell. 
 Shouting with the hosts of heaven: 
 Hail, Thou great Immanuel! 
 Hail, Thou great Immanuel! 
 The Wandering Dove. 
 Come home, my soul, thou wandering dove, 
 Back to thine Ark and rest; 
 Fly to the bosom of His love — 
 The Savior's waiting breast. 
 Rove not afar in regions cold, 
 But quit the chilly waste; 
 Come back, while Jesus' arms enfold, 
 Come to thy Lord in haste. 
 Fear not the clouds that hang between, 
 Nor dread the threat'ning storm; 
 Though thunders loud and lightnings keen 
 Do smite thee with alarm. 
 'Tis death to stay; 'tis life to dare, 
 So linger here no more; 
 Plunge forth and pierce the chilly air, 
 And all the clouds before. 
 Faith is a glorious leap through shade — 
 A landing in the light: 
 Plunge forth, and God will lend thee aid, 
 And guide thee in thy flight. 
 Believe, and thou shalt win the race. 
 Then dare no more to rove; 
 Fly to the Ark of pardoning grace — 
 The Open Door of Love. 
 The Old Pilgrim. 
 Old pilgrim, are you traveling still 
 Upon the heavenly road? 
 O yes! I'm bound for Zion hill, 
 The traveler's blest abode. 
 How have the past times with you been. 
 And who hath led you on ? 
 How many conflicts have you seen, 
 How many victories won? 
 Oh, yes! the hills were rough and steep, 
 The streams were dark and cold; 
 But Jesus led me o'er the deep. 
 Though troubled waters rolled. 
 And oftentimes the noon did seem 
 Like midnight on the road. 
 But all along a sacred beam 
 Did heavenly light afford. 
 Sometimes forsaken, lone and sad. 
 But still I could not stay; 
 Though some, the best of friends I had, 
 Forsook me on the way. 
 The fights were fierce, the battles long. 
 And oft in heart cast down; 
 But still I stood against the wrong, 
 Contending for my crown. 
 But through it all my heavenly Friend 
 Walked closely by my side; 
 In strife He did my soul defend, 
 In darkness He did guide. 
 But since the worst is now behind, 
 The fiercest fight is o'er, 
 I journey on in hope to find 
 The better things before. 
 Old Canaan seems to greet mine eyes, 
 The shining coast is near; 
 And e'en the music of the skies 
 I think sometimes I hear. 
 Just what the pilgrim's end will prove 
 r cannot say to you; 
 But this I know: that all is love, 
 And all is heaven, too. 
 Resignation. 
 Self, thou must obey thy Savior, 
 Long thou hast enjoyed thy way 
 Holiness be thy behavior, 
 All resign to Christ today: 
 Yield to Jesus, 
 Yield unto His loving sway. 
 Let thy vain and foolish craving 
 Die exhausted in desire; 
 Purer love for Jesus having 
 Will to nobler things inspire: 
 Purge me, Savior, 
 With the pure refining fire. 
 Now from vice to virtue turning — 
 Now from worldly lust to love; 
 Every sinful pleasure spurning, 
 Let thy better nature prove — 
 Life eternal. 
 Even while on earth I rove. 
 In the hard and busy hours, 
 Li the fearful strife, alone. 
 Exercising all thy powers, 
 Make His love to others knov^^n. 
 Thee in heaven. 
 He will gladly own and crown. 
 Believe and Be Saved. 
 My heart is almost broken, 
 I know not what to do; 
 I want a heavenly token. 
 And full salvation, too. 
 Chorus. 
 What must I do to be saved ? 
 What must I do to be saved ? 
 From all my guilt and shame, 
 What must I do to be saved ? 
 I hear sweet music ringing 
 About my darksome way; 
 It must be angels singing, 
 And this is what they say: 
 Chorus. 
 Believe, believe and be saved; 
 Believe, believe and be saved — 
 On Jesus, precious, the Lamb, 
 Believe, believe and be saved. 
 I am so weak and weary. 
 Sin-sick and faint in soul; 
 The night is dark and dreary, 
 The clouds above me roll. 
 My heavy sins oppress me. 
 And bear me to the ground; 
 I want the Lord to bless me. 
 And let His grace be found. 
 Could I o'ercome my doubting. 
 He would my sins remove; 
 I'd rise, salvation shouting. 
 And praise His pardoning love. 
 Have mercy, Lord, and hear me, 
 Now speak my sins forgiven. 
 And walk forever near me 
 Until I get to heaven. 
 I feel the Spirit moving, 
 I've lost my load of sin; 
 There's something sweet and loving, 
 O'erflows my heart within. 
 Chorus. 
 I now believe on His name, 
 I now believe on His name, 
 All glory be to the Lamb! 
 I now believe on His name. 
 The Lord's Baptism. 
 Hark! how the humble John exclaims. 
 The Lamb of God behold! 
 How faithfully he now proclaims 
 What prophets long foretold! 
 And lo! a multitude of eyes 
 Look on the Savior near; 
 The prophet views Him with surprise, 
 And shrinks with holy fear. 
 I'm too unworthy now to loose 
 Thy sacred latchets, Lord; 
 And O, to touch Thy hallowed shoes 
 I cannot now accord. 
 While to the ocean's spacious bound 
 The solemn waters sped, 
 A wreath of glory shone around 
 His consecrated head. 
 He prayed, and lo! the heavens bowed, 
 With all their portals wide; 
 The Dove descended from the cloud, 
 And Christ was glorified. 
 A voice ne'er heard on earth before, 
 With such degree of love. 
 Spoke from the opening of the door, 
 And from the gate above: 
 "Hear Him, my well-beloved Son, 
 In whom my soul is pleased; 
 Hear Him, ye wretches so undone, 
 Be from your chains released. 
 Hear Him! while heaven and earth combine. 
 And God and man agree; 
 O let this blest baptismal sign 
 Bespeak thy love to me!" 
 Speak, Lord, again from heaven above. 
 And let us hear Thee say: 
  
 Soul, in the Jordan of my love, 
 I baptize thee today. 
 Come, Holy Ghost, on burning wings. 
 And light upon us now; 
 Thy love alone the blessing brings, 
 And seals this solemn vow. 
 A Friend in Trouble. 
 Friend of the tried and troubled breast, 
 Balm of the wounded heart; 
 I come to Thee for peace and rest, 
 I know how true Thou art. 
 Mine earthly friends are turned away. 
 My foes are thick around; 
 And they pursue me night and day 
 With malice to confound. 
 They wag their heads and mock my plea, 
 And treat my love with scorn; 
 Come, O my Lord, deliver me. 
 And comfort the forlorn. 
 And though the odds against me stand, 
 r must not falter here; 
 Nor will I yield one inch of land. 
 Nor quit the field in fear. 
 Let troubles rise and sorrows roll, 
 And all mankind oppose; 
 My God, and one believing soul, 
 Outnumber all the foes. 
 Though angels camp about me still. 
 To guard me through this wild; 
 Come, Lord, Thyself, Thy word fulfill. 
 And walk close by Thy child. 
 No angel guard can satisfy. 
 Nor Michael's sword defend; 
 Come, Lord, Thyself, or else I die, 
 Come now, my heavenly Friend. 
 If, when contending for the right. 
 My soul in fear would fly; 
 Lord, only smile and I will fight, 
 And fight until I die. 
 Still with the foe fled in defeat. 
 With glory to embrace; 
 Not even heaven would be sweet, 
 Without Thy smiling face. 
 The Lord God. 
 Jesus, Thou promised Seed beloved, 
 Arise and bruise the serpent's head; 
 Let Juda's scepter ne'er be moved, 
 Until Shiloh shall reign instead. 
 Jehovah, Lord, Immanuel, 
 Shekinah, God, I Am of old; 
 Still in Thy Church, in Zion dwell, 
 Though all the heavens cannot hold. 
 Thou Burning Bush of Horeb's brov^. 
 Convince Thy servants of Thy might; 
 And bid them go, commissioned now, 
 And lead Thy people to the light. 
 O mount the cloud. Thy steed of flame, 
 And let Thy pilgrim Church prevail; 
 With thunder voice Thy love proclaim. 
 Though mountains smoke and nations quail. 
 Lord, with Thy people still abide, 
 While all the hosts of hell pursue. 
 Come, Job's Redeemer, us to guide; 
 Come, David's gentle Shepherd, too. 
 Come, Sharon's Rose, us reconcile; 
 Bright Morning Star, upon us beam; 
 Sweet Lily of the Valley, smile; 
 Didst Thou not promise to redeem? 
 My Chief of all ten thousands, known, 
 My Darling- Savior and my Dove; 
 Come down with great compassion shown, 
 And with the fire of Thy great love. 
 Come, Prince of Peace, to us appear; 
 Come, Wonderful, of old renown; 
 Come, everlasting Father, near; 
 Come, O Thou mighty God, come down! 
 Arise, O Beauty! Branch of Love! 
 Thou King who reigns in heaven high! 
 Thou Fellow of the throne above! 
 Arise in answer to our cry! 
 O take from death his cruel sting. 
 And rob the grave of all its gain; 
 From Earth's four corners. Savior, bring 
 Thy ransomed Church with Thee to reign. 
 Turn On the Current. 
 In this dark, benighted land. 
 All scattered on the shore 
 Are souls who droop in sadness, sin and shame; 
 Where the billows lave the strand. 
 Where the angry tempests roar, 
 Let the blessed light of heaven gently beam. 
 Chorus. 
 Turn on the current from the Power House above; 
 Turn on the current — the electric Hght of Love; 
 Until this heart of mine 
 In Jesus' glory shine. 
 Turn on the current from the Power House above. 
 There are souls with blinded eyes 
 Who long to see the light, 
 Who stumble on, misguided, to despair; 
 - Let the light of heaven rise, 
 And kiss away their night. 
 Until the dawn of love shall bid them cheer. 
 O, thou poor, blackslidden child. 
 How sad and lone thy way! 
 The mournful shadows deepen into gloom; 
 Art thou lost in all the wild, 
 Does the midnight crowd thy day? 
 Art thou weary-worn and weak, and far from homei 
 Dear Jesus, Thou Lamb of God, 
 When in the vale of death, 
 And all the things of earth are fled and gone, 
 I'll lean upon Thy rod. 
 And heave the dying breath. 
 While angels come to turn the current on. 
 Learning. 
 How vain our fairest thought, 
 Till tempered with Thy love! 
 And vain is Wisdom's fabric wrought, 
 Till grace divine approve. 
 Till God our knowledge bless, 
 'Tis but a dying spark; 
 In vain we cherish and caress — 
 Still groping through the dark. 
 Lord, with Thy breath revive, 
 Our knowledge here improve. 
 Till sanctified and made alive — 
 A flaming torch of love. 
 And so illume the mind, 
 Till holy it shall be; 
 For all the wisdom of mankind 
 Is foolishness to Thee. 
 We watch the starry host. 
 And trace the comet's flight; 
 Reason beholds the beams, at most, 
 But faith, the God of light. 
 The solemn past reviewed 
 But leaves confused the mind; 
 While Reason marks the path pursued. 
 But Faith, what God designed. 
 Oh, ye who love to sing 
 Of Wisdom's richer prize; 
 Go, learn of Christ, your Savior, King, 
 And humbly be made wise. 
 How cold, and blank, and dead. 
 The mind with Christ disowned! 
 Their stormy passions reign instead. 
 And reason is dethroned. 
 Bow, all ye sages, low. 
 With humble heart and mind; 
 Ye shall your own damnation know. 
 Or your salvation find. 
 The Institution. 
 Lx)rd God, this institution bless 
 With Thy divine approval seal. 
 Till all the light of truth possess. 
 Till all the love of Jesus feel. 
 Let flow from here a gracious stream. 
 Till all shall know and love the right; 
 The savage from his shame redeem. 
 The lands of darkness turn to light. 
 Give light till ignorance shall fail, 
 Till vice and crime shall be no more, 
 Till virtue, truth and love prevail, 
 And be the riches of the poor. 
 Send forth the light of truth to all, 
 Till India shall see her shame, 
 Till Afric's night and China's wall 
 Shall blush before Thy glorious name. 
 Here let Thy teachers, taught by Thee, 
 Their high commission now receive; 
 And let them, ere they try the sea, 
 Be consecrated, ere they leave. 
 When fiercer grows the strife around. 
 Give courage. Savior, lest they yield; 
 And should they fall, let them be found 
 Still holding to their sword and shield. 
 Thus to the world in mercy send 
 The lights of truth, and faith, and love, 
 Till the tall spires of darkness bend. 
 And Wisdom's towers rise above. 
 With mind unfettered, reason free, 
 And every soul washed in Thy blood; 
 Let every thought point up to Thee, 
 Thus prove Thy image in us. Lord. 
 Then let the nations' conflicts cease, 
 The nations' richer glories prove — 
 The universal boon of peace, 
 The universal law of Love. 
 Thou Lovest Me. 
 Thou lovest me, O Christ, I know, 
 Thou lovest me; Thou lovest me. 
 Whatever be my weal or woe, 
 O Lord! I know Thou lovest me. 
 However humble be my part. 
 This sweet assurance fills my heart, 
 Though poor, forsaken, here I be. 
 Dear Lord, I know Thou lovest me. 
 Thou lovest me in spite of sin, 
 For Thou didst die to set me free. 
 Within my humble heart to reign. 
 And bring salvation down to me. 
 Thy wounds repeat the story, sweet. 
 From Thy dear hands and side and feet; 
 Thy dying groans on Calvary 
 Declare Thy wondrous love to me. 
 Thou lovest me, though weak and frail; 
 Thou lovest me; Thou lovest me. 
 Though friends forsake and foes assail, 
 How blest the thought. Thou lovest me! 
 I love Thee, O, my heavenly Friend, 
 I'll serve Thee till this life shall end; 
 I now forsake the world for Thee 
 Because I know Thou lovest me. 
 Thou lovest me; and such a love 
 Through all eternity shall stand; 
 When through the vale of death I rove, 
 Lord Jesus, take my feeble hand; 
 Then let me pass beyond the gloom, 
 And mock the terrors of the tomb; 
 Into Thy kingdom, Lord, with Thee, 
 O take me, since Thou lovest me. 
 Rejoice. 
 O ye that bow in grief, 
 Attend the heavenly voice; 
 Lo, Jesus speaks a sweet relief. 
 And bids thy hearts rejoice. 
 Then why are ye so sad? 
 Why flow thy tears so free? 
 Think how he groaned to make thee glad- 
 To cheer and comfort thee. 
 Let not thy sorrows past 
 Thy happiness destroy; 
 What seems so hard must prove at last 
 A source of endless joy. 
 Though envious foes revile, 
 To crush and wound and break; 
 The King of Love doth on thee smile, 
 Though all the world forsake. 
 And does the chastening rod 
 Too heavy on thee smite? 
 Rejoice, believing child of God, 
 Thou art His heart's delight. 
 Why weep, O troubled heart. 
 O'er friends to heaven gone ? 
 Rejoice, for those who now must part 
 Shall meet around His throne. 
 Our joys shall be fulfilled, 
 Though we sleep with the dead; 
 There Hope her heavenly castle builds. 
 And light divine is shed. 
 The Betrayer. 
 Must I my Lord betray. 
 And still be called His own ? 
 And must I scorn His love today, 
 With all His mercy shown ? 
 What though it be a kiss 
 That give the wicked sign ? 
 Oh, shall I forfeit heavenly bliss, 
 And damn this soul of mine ? 
 Must I with Jesus part. 
 With sinners here to rove? 
 How can I hate Him in my heart, 
 And yet pretend to love ? 
 Must I His love forsake, 
 And sell my Lord for gold; 
 And let a host of sinners take. 
 To scourge, and bind, and hold ? 
 Can I despise His word. 
 Which comforts the distressed ? 
 Can I forget the message heard, 
 When hard by sin oppressed ? 
 And if His blood I shed, 
 In hope of worldly gain, 
 'Twill bring damnation on my head, 
 And everlasting pain. 
 O, Jesus 1 let Thy grace 
 Take full possession now; 
 I'd rather have Thy loved embrace 
 Than all else here below. 
^2  
 Loyalty. 
 I find no fault in this just Man, 
 He suits my heart so well: 
 He loves as none but Jesus can, 
 Too wonderful to tell. 
 I now recall when first we met. 
 Oh, 'twas a happy day! 
 I think of those sweet moments yet. 
 And sing along my way. 
 I like the story of His love — 
 The message of His grace — 
 The peace He bringeth from above — 
 The smiling of His face. 
 And though He wore the thorny wreath, 
 I'm not ashamed to own; 
 Though once the poorest here beneath, 
 But still the loveliest known, 
 'Tis true from proud Jerusalem 
 They lashed Him to the tree; 
 But still I'm not ashamed of Him, 
 For there He died for me. 
 His hands were pierced. His feet were nailed, 
 His precious blood they drew; 
 There love o'er death and hell prevailed. 
 And I shall triumph too. 
 Though lowly laid among the dead, 
 Still, full of love and grace. 
 He made the tomb, with all its dread, 
 A pleasant resting place. 
 And do you think I would accuse 
 My gracious Lord, divine? 
 A world of friends I'd rather lose 
 Than one sweet smile of thine! 
 Away With Him. 
 'Away with Him!" the rabble cried. 
 The King they did condemn: 
 O, sinner, hast thou too replied, 
 Away! Away with Him ? 
 And dost thou too, like those of old. 
 Reject thy King today ? 
 Why will you turn in sin so bold, 
 And cry, "Away! away!" 
 Hard-hearted wretch! though now you scorn 
 Thy Savior's loved command. 
 Remember that in judgment morn 
 You must before Him stand. 
 If rocks with all their strength must rend, 
 And earth and sky give way; 
 How can you still refuse to bend 
 Before your God today ? 
 Poor thoughtless soul! that fate evade, 
 Which meets the sinners there, 
 When Jesus draws His flaming blade, 
 And drives them to despair! 
 Yield to the pleadings of His grace, 
 Nor think thyself secure; 
 Come, while He calls with smiHng face, 
 Or else His frowns endure. 
 Come now and set your heart aright. 
 Nor longer dare delay; 
 What if He lift His sword tonight. 
 And cry, Away! away! 
 The Royal Captive. 
 A captive, lo! my Lord is led; 
 They bufifet, mock, and try: 
 He is arraigned in sinners' stead. 
 And must for sinners die. 
 The Innocent! what guilt He bears! 
 The Pure! yet how they blame! 
 The King! yet what a crown He wears! 
 The Lord all wrapped in shame! 
 Beneath the scourge of sinners bent, 
 The fiery strokes He feels: 
 The lash, with all its fury spent, 
 A balm of life reveals. 
 On Him the tattered robe they place, 
 His royal right profane: 
 They wag their heads and smite His face, 
 And hold Him in disdain. 
 By all the guilt of man oppressed, 
 Which bows my Savior low; 
 And down His pallid cheeks, distressed. 
 What crimson torrents flow! 
 The prisoner's seat He occupies, 
 Though once the King above: 
 How justly damned the soul that dies, 
 In spite of all Thy love! 
'J^)  
 What Must I Do With Him? 
 What must I do with Jesus, 
 Whose love I can't deny? 
 Must I reject His mercy, 
 And help them crucify? 
 Must I approach, embracing, 
 But only to betray ? 
 Or lean upon His bosom. 
 And trust Him all the way? 
 What must I do with Jesus 
 In life's low valley, deep? 
 Must I be up and praying. 
 Or thoughtlessly asleep? 
 When infidels deride Him, 
 And sinners scorn and try; 
 Must I forsake my Savior, 
 And shamefully deny ? 
 What must I do with Jesus, 
 Mid business, care and pain? 
 Must I neglect to praise Him, 
 Because of earthly gain? 
 Mid friends and social pleasures, 
 Or in the busy mart, 
 Oh! must I drive Him from me, 
 Or take Him to my heart? 
 What must I do with Jesus, 
 With fame and honor mine? 
 Must I, with self exalted, 
 Forget His love divine ? 
 Amid the surging masses, 
 In honor, wealth, or fame; 
 I will, dear King of Glory, 
 Exalt Thy gracious name. 
 What must I do with Jesus, 
 When life's last sun is low — 
 When fall the solemn shadows 
 About the path I go ? 
 I'll lean upon His bosom. 
 Nor dread the last few hours; 
 I'll look beyond the river, 
 On fields of fruits and flowers. 
 Dear Calvary. 
 O Calvary! dear mount of love! 
 No top so sacred to mine eyes: 
 When from my sins I look above 
 On thee I view my sacrifice. 
 More dear than Horeb's flaming top, 
 To which a rebel may not dare: 
 On Calvary, the sinner's hope, 
 I can approach my Savior there. 
 And not Sinai, whose fiery law 
 Pealed forth in dreadful thunders, bold; 
 Though Calvary moves me to awe, 
 But, oh, it is with love untold. 
 Pisgah may lift me up so high 
 Till I the shores of Canaan see; 
 And even there still I may die, 
 But not on dear old Calvary. 
 Though Carmel, with her answered prayer. 
 Did all Jehovah's wonders prove; 
 But none like Calvary, so dear. 
 Can show the wonders of His love. 
 The hill where Jacob's ladder stood, 
 With angels flying from the skies, 
 Vies not with thee, blest hill of Blood, 
 Where stands the cross before mine eyes. 
 On Hermon's height in fear I see 
 His form transfigured and divine; 
 But when I turn to Calvary, 
 'Tis then I know that Thou art mine. 
 Nor Zion's top, whose temple stands 
 Sublimely high for all to see; 
 Bowed on my knees with clasped hands, 
 I'd rather gaze on Calvary. 
 No towers of all the kingdoms, Lord, 
 Nor steepled temples yet can vie; 
 And none can such delights afford. 
 And none so precious to mine eye. 
 His March to Death. 
 Now from Jerusalem He starts 
 To tragic Calvary: 
 Death, with a thousand flaming darts, 
 Pursues Him to the tree. 
 Justice stands waiting on the mount, 
 With Mercy at his side: 
 In David's house the sacred fount 
 Will soon be opened wide. 
 "Come on, Thou Victim!" Justice cries, 
 "No more my sword detain." 
 "Justice, I come!" the Lord replies, 
 "For sinners to be slain." 
 "A guilty world hangs on Thy breath. 
 And Thou alone canst save. 
 O, come! and yield Thyself to death, 
 And to the greedy grave." 
 He comes! Though sinners round Him now 
 Do lash and mock with scorns; 
 And though His tender, kingly brow 
 Is pierced by many thorns. 
 His flesh they rend, His blood they spill. 
 Though weary on the road, 
 He struggles up Golgotha's hill, 
 And drags His heavy load. 
 Hell from beneath crowds on His path, 
 In all its fury dread; 
 And deep damnation heaves its wrath 
 Upon the Savior's head. 
 All nature shrouds itself in night. 
 And its foundations shake; 
 Lo! Heaven shuts her portals bright. 
 And all her hosts forsake. 
 Death throws his palls creation wide. 
 Unearthly terrors reign 
 Around the mangled Cruicfied — 
 The world's Redeemer slain. 
 The sun and moon give no relief, 
 The stars are fled away; 
 All bow in universal grief 
 Around the Lord today! 
 One Shepherd and One Fold. 
 Shepherd of love, back to one fold 
 Thy scattered sheep recall; 
 And make Thy people, as of old, 
 United, one and all. 
 One God we praise, one Christ we know, 
 One Holy Ghost we love; 
 Lord, let Thy Church be one below. 
 And then be one above. 
 Unite Thy long divided flock. 
 In one position hold; 
 One faith in one eternal Rock, 
 One Shepherd and one fold. 
 One Calvary, one sacred fount 
 For each and all of them; 
 One temple, Lord, one holy mount. 
 And one Jerusalem. 
 One rule of life, one doctrine teach, 
 To every tribe and race; 
 One creed for all, one gospel preach- 
 The gospel of Thy grace. 
 One loving heart, one toiling hand. 
 One task for all to do; 
 One fold in this and every land, 
 One journey to pursue. 
 One host against one common foe, 
 Let all Thy soldiers stand; 
 One Captain at whose word we go, 
 And fight at His command. 
 One banner raise o'er every brow, 
 One blessed story tell; 
 And one immortal standard now, 
 Defying death and hell. 
 One password at the gates above. 
 One sacred sign be given; 
 One wondrous theme — Redeeming Love!- 
 One army entering heaven. 
 One universal anthem raise. 
 One white-robed throng we sing — 
 One everlasting song of praise, 
 To one eternal King! 
 I Am Going Up and Surrender. 
 I am going up and surrender 
 My heart to Jesus now, 
 In spite of my condition, 
 And at His footstool bow. 
 Chorus. 
 I am going just now, 
 I am going just now, 
 I am going up and surrender 
 My heart to Jesus now. 
 Too long in doubt I've waited, 
 Contending for my way; 
 But I'm going up and surrender 
 My heart to Christ today. 
 r know I am unworthy, 
 I feel my guilt and shame; 
 But I'm going up and surrender 
 To Jesus just the same. 
 Adieu! my old companions, 
 I bid you all farewell; 
 I'll walk no longer with you 
 Upon the road to hell. 
 I will take my burdens to Him, 
 Myself I now deny; 
 I am going up to Jesus, 
 And trust Him though I die. 
 The Father. 
 Dear Father, God of love. 
 May we with those above 
 Join in Thy praise? 
 May we adore aright 
 Thee, gracious God of light; 
 Let every heart unite — 
 An anthem raise. 
 Dost Thou not love us all 
 More deeply than the fall 
 In fatal sin ? 
 Then, Father, kind and good, 
 Redeem us by Thy blood, 
 And let the cleansing flood 
 Flow freely in. 
 No other joys are found. 
 And no delights surround 
 Like love divine: 
 It soothes the aching pain. 
 And moves the deepest stain 
 Till we are born again — 
 New creatures — thine. 
 While in the flesh we live, 
 A hymn of praise we give 
 Though Thy dear name: 
 When parting with this breath. 
 Midst fading scenes beneath, 
 We'll sing Thy love in death — 
 In heaven the same. 
 The Father's Throne. 
 What bliss and majesty surround 
 The Father's throne above! 
 And what amazing joys are found, 
 Through all the realms of love! 
 The rainbow spans Jehovah's seat, 
 And hangs above His brow, 
 While angels worship at His feet, 
 And praise him as they bow. 
 Thunders and lightnings issue fast 
 In loud, adoring lays; 
 While distant worlds repeat the blast. 
 And awful is His praise. 
 Ten thousand choirs — a flaming throng — 
 Around His altars sing 
 Love is the theme of all their song 
 To their eternal King. 
 Archangels, saints and seraphs, bright, 
 Commingle 'round the throne; 
 Their faces shine with Love's delight. 
 For only love is known. 
 The gathering saints their joys relate. 
 As they the portals near; 
 They shout their entrance through the gate. 
 And soon in heaven appear. 
 Quicken, my soul, thy sluggish pace, 
 And hasten to thy home; 
 Soon thou shalt win the glorious race, 
 No more on earth to roam. 
 We Are One. 
 We are one in unity; 
 One eternal Trinity: 
 One in works and one in ways; 
 One in glory and in praise. 
 We are one in every place; 
 One in all the works of grace: 
 One to pardon, one to bless; 
 One to comfort in distress. 
 We are one to all on high; 
 One to heed the sinner's cry; 
 One in all the mercies given; 
 One on earth and one in heaven. 
 We are one Immanuel, 
 One in every soul to dwell 
 O, believing children, see, 
 We are one great Trinity! 
 One in truth and one in light, 
 One in wisdom, one in might; 
 One in every good designed; 
 One eternal Sovereign Mind. 
 Trials. 
 These trials, Lord, how great the test! 
 My heart they wound and tear; 
 They cripple hope and rend my breast; 
 And threaten with despair. 
 Each passing hour they grow severe, 
 To crush me on the field; 
 How can I stand the conflicts here. 
 But, Lord, how can I yield? 
 My bosom friends forsake me now. 
 My comrades all are gone; 
 Thy cause to fail can I allow, 
 Though left to stand alone ? 
 Should not I gladly give my life, 
 While battling for the right? 
 And stand unyielding in the strife, 
 And for my Savior fight ? 
 O, help me, Lord! nor let me fail — 
 I'm willing, though I'm weak; 
 Cannot Thy word o'er all prevail ? 
 Then, Lord, my triumph speak. 
 Lift up Thine arm, Immanuel! 
 Stretch forth Thy ancient rod; 
 And shake the iron gates of hell. 
 Thou conquering Son of God! 
 Forth from the fight Thy servant bring, 
 O'er all victorious still; 
 Though weak, yet faithful to the King, 
 Submissive to Thy will. 
 Though friends be far, and false, and few. 
 Since victory is mine. 
 And since I know that Thou art true, 
 I will not faint and pine. 
 The Christian's Right. 
 Oh, do not drive me from the fold. 
 Nor all my rights destroy; 
 I shall my place in Zion hold, 
 My privilege enjoy; 
 Why should my spirit be oppressed ? 
 Why crush me to the ground? 
 I'm one among the number blest, 
 And shall be with them crowned. 
 Should not a blood-bought heir of heaven 
 Dwell with His saints below ? 
 Why should I be from Zion driven; 
 Why will you bid me go ? 
 And must I leave, afar to roam, 
 While hungry wolves pursue ? 
 I have a right to stay at home — 
 A part in Jesus too. 
 Then do not bid me to depart; 
 Here I would ever dwell. 
 I love the Christians in my heart, 
 I love the fold too well. 
 Hoi 
 mess. 
 I must live holy, Lord, 
 I must live meek and pure; 
 For such the gospel doth afford, 
 And this I will secure. 
QO  
 Come, Sanctifying Power, 
 Come, Holy Ghost within; 
 The carnal things in me devour, 
 Give liberty from sin. 
 Is not Thy saving grace 
 Sufficient to release? 
 Then let me walk before Thy face. 
 In holiness and peace. 
 I crave to walk with Thee 
 The high and holy way; 
 And perfect like my Savior be, 
 And happy every day. 
 Let through my nature flow 
 The pure celestial stream; 
 Thy power of salvation show — 
 Thy power to redeem. 
 With full salvation mine, 
 And free from every stain; 
 Then life on earth shall be divine, 
 And labor, rest from pain. 
 Thus, Lord, I want to live. 
 Nor even think to die; 
 To death a holy body give. 
 From heaven to heaven fly. 
 The Apostles' Creed. 
 I believe in God the Father, 
 Maker of the human race; 
 First, of pleasures, I would rather 
 Be a humble child of grace: 
 God is loving; 
 Soul, repose in His embrace. 
 I believe in Christ the Savior, 
 Lowly of the Virgin born: 
 Holiness in His behavior. 
 Though a world of sinners scorn; 
 Blessed Jesus! 
 Thou the Friend of the forlorn. 
 I believe the Holy Spirit 
 Is the Comforter of all; 
 Thus believing, life inherit, 
 Though once wounded by the fall. 
 Holy Spirit, 
 Lo! we answer to Thy call. 
 I believe that in the morning. 
 Midst the judgment's awful dread. 
 Then to hail the Lord's returning, 
 We shall rise up from the dead. 
 Into glory 
 We shall be by Jesus led. 
 The Divine Controversy. 
 Hear, O my people, saith the Lord, 
 What have I done to thee 
 That thou shouldst murmur at my word. 
 And turn away from me ? 
 O, have I wearied thee with love, 
 And made my pleas in vain ? 
 And should I not mine own reprove, 
 And bring them back again ? 
 Will you despise my mercy then. 
 And in your shame rebel? 
 Why will you form a league with sin. 
 And compromise with hell ? 
 When did my hand deny thee aid. 
 Or deal a cruel blow ? 
 Have I not straight thy pathway made. 
 And hewn thy mountains low? 
 When hedged around by hills and strife. 
 Who bade the seas divide? 
 Through all the crooked ways of life. 
 Have I not been thy guide ? 
 Then why reject my holy word, 
 And all my prophets kill ? 
 Why turn away from Me — your Lx)rd, 
 And prove so faithless still? 
 Father, forgive! our sins remove, 
 Nor drive us now away; 
 But in Thy arms of pardoning love, 
 Receive us back today. 
 Reflection. 
 O God! with all Thy love made known, 
 Shall I despise — and die undone — • 
 Thy love which bids me life receive ? 
 Lord, must I die and not believe? 
 Shall I, with Love's entreaty given, 
 Refuse to heed Thy calls to heaven ? 
 Must I against Thy love rebel, 
 And plunge regardless into hell? 
 How could I bear such endless pains. 
 Dragged in Despair's eternal chains; 
 While Vengeance lashed me harder still 
 For trampling on Thy gracious will. 
 Would not my conscience there reprove. 
 When I recall Thy slighted love; 
 While all my sins above me swell. 
 And sink me deeper into hell ? 
 Lord, ere the dying groan I heave, 
 And ere again Thy love I grieve; 
 O, save me by Thy pardoning grace- 
 The worst of a rebelHous race! 
 The Sinner's Death. 
 O what a death the sinner dies. 
 With all Thy grace unknown! 
 In what a woeful state he lies. 
 When Jesus will not own! 
 The soul that tramples on Thy grace, 
 And scorns Thy loving calls, 
 And turns away from Thy embrace — 
 In what despair he falls! 
 The grieving Dove extends His wings, 
 The Holy Ghost departs; 
 Death wounds him with a thousand stings- 
 A thousand fiery darts. 
 Then gentle Mercy folds her arms, 
 And bids the soul. Adieu! 
 And hellish crews, in wild alarms. 
 In all their wrath pursue. 
 Friends must forsake though they would cHng, 
 And kindred must forbear; 
 The soul that scorns Thy love, O King, 
 Must die forsaken here. 
 His day is past, his sun is set, 
 To Hope he bids farewell; 
 His awful doom at last is met 
 In darkness, death and hell. 
 His baleful eyes survey the deep. 
 Where quenchless furies burn; 
 And Oh! how awful is that leap 
 From whence there's no return! 
 Plead, O my God! with sinners still, 
 Do not forsake today; 
 Perhaps these stubborn rebels will 
 Obey Thy love and pray. 
 If yet they scorn Thy love's appeal, 
 And spurn salvation too; 
 Let Vengeance their damnation seal, 
 And Mercy say, Adieu! 
 Pentecost. 
 Supernal Dove, on us descend, 
 Sit on our waiting hearts today; 
 Come as a mighty rushing wind, 
 And fill this house while here we pray. 
 Join every heart in blest accord; 
 New zeal revive, new love inspire; 
 And let the servants of the Lord 
 Declare Thy grace with tongues of fire. 
 Make this our pentecostal hour, 
 Fulfill Thy promise, still the same: 
 Thus demonstrate Thy saving power, 
 Nor put Thy followers to shame. 
 Prove, Lord, to all Thy promise given. 
 That Thou dost yet in Zion dwell; 
 And let the humble heirs of heaven 
 Defy the yawning gates of hell. 
 Revive the faint, the seeker bless. 
 The wounded heal, the dead awake, 
 The lost reclaim, the proud distress, 
 The stony hearts of sinners break. 
 Alarm the cold and careless breast, 
 And those at ease in Zion move; 
 Nor let a single member rest 
 Till every heart shall feel Thy love. 
 Still in Thy pulpit. Lord, appear; 
 Endow Thy servants from on high; 
 Thy word let guilty sinners hear. 
 Believe and live, or doubt and die. 
 At Eventide. 
 How sweet to walk at eve alone, 
 When fall the shadows here. 
 When all the toilsome hours are gone, 
 With none but Jesus near! 
 As up I gaze, a thousand eyes 
 Look gently down in mine; 
 'Thy God is love," the friendly skies 
 Speak with a voice divine. 
 I sing, and all the stars, it seems, 
 Join in my humble lays; 
 The listening night, the answering beams. 
 Are all engaged in praise. 
 The solemn shade, the slumbering rocks. 
 The happy brooks that move. 
 The pensive plains where nod the flocks. 
 Do breathe a song of love. 
 Then why should I my joys restrain, 
 To ponder in despair, 
 To brood of care, of woe complain. 
 When all His love declare? 
 Far richer joys than these can prove 
 Are by believers found, 
 When in His presence, in His love. 
 And all is heaven around. 
 Launch Out Into the Deep. 
 Launch out, my soul, into the deep, 
 Where purer waters roll, 
 Where waves of rapture ever sweep 
 Around the humble soul. 
 Though here the ocean's wrath is spent, 
 While dangerous shoals ensnare; 
 But farther out is sweet content, 
 'Tis sweet and pleasant there. 
 Nurse not the shores in doubt and fear, 
 But trust the Lord to keep; 
 The waves that break so furious here 
 Are calmer in the deep. 
 Though thou hast toiled so hard in vain 
 Through all the stormy night, 
 Launch out, and cast thy net again, 
 But cast it on thy right. 
 Thou shalt a draft of fishes take. 
 And faint in holy fear; 
 Immortal souls thy net shall break. 
 If only Qirist is near. 
 Call to thine aid thy partners now, 
 And let them help afford; 
 Then sink in wonderment and bow 
 Before Thy gracious Lord. 
 Present Bliss. 
 Life need not be in sorrow spent. 
 E'er weeping o'er a broken vow; 
 Sufficient is the mercy sent; 
 'Tis heaven. Lord, to love Thee now. 
 When so oppressed by clouds of woe. 
 Thy presence is my Eden, Lord; 
 Thy love my heaven here below. 
 My daily bread, Thy sacred word. 
 si. sfC. 
lOO  
 Then might my soul with angels vie, 
 To sing Thy praise creation round; 
 When to the flesh and sin I die, 
 On earth Thy love is heaven found. 
 Though not with seraphs' awe I wait, 
 Who veil their faces with their wing, 
 With fiery tongues Thy love relate; 
 'Tis glory here to praise the King. 
 Dwell not alone on joys to come. 
 Since here is spread a feast of love; 
 Oh! there are joys this side of Home 
 As sweet as those we'll taste above. 
 When in the heated furnace thrown, 
 Or through the den of lions driven. 
 My soul, think not thyself alone; 
 Lo! Jesus turns them into heaven. 
 If love, where storms of sorrow roll. 
 Is sweet, while yet by tempest driven. 
 What shall it be to thee, my soul, 
 When all is love and all is heaven ? 
 The Macedonian Cry. 
 I hear the Macedonian cry: 
 "Come o'er and help," they say; 
 'Behold how we in darkness die, 
 Without the gospel day!" 
 The shadows deepen and the gloom 
 Hangs dark and thick around; 
 Come and reverse our woeful doom. 
 And let the light be found. 
 I hear the Macedonian cry. 
 How loud and sad they call! 
 How helplessly they pine and sigh 
 In Satan's awful thrall! 
 One messenger by Jesus sent 
 Would be an angel there; 
 One penny in compassion spent 
 Is more than millions here. 
 I hear the Macedonian cry. 
 Who will in pity move? 
 And who will say. Lord, here am I, 
 If but Thou wilt approve ? 
 How can we from their rescue stay. 
 And send them no reply? 
 Lord, consecrate some heart today, 
 To go and dare or die. 
I02  
 I hear the Macedonian cry. 
 To Africa in sin, 
 Now let a band of soldiers fly — 
 A thousand holy men. 
 With Jesus at the tomb of woe, 
 We'll move the stone and cry: 
 O, loose the man and let him go, 
 That he may prophesy! 
 Beyond the Tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb, where Jesus reigns, 
 Where lives the best of all my friends; 
 A sweet and happy rest remains 
 Of perfect peace, beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb my friend is gone 
 Where only heavenly bliss is known; 
 Though thou hast left me here alone, 
 I'll meet you just beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb, no strife's array 
 Shall call thee forth to meet the fray; 
 Well hast thou fought and won the day, 
 Go reign with Christ, beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb no sickness now, 
 Nor woes to make thee weep and bow, 
 Nor death-dews stain the radiant brow; 
 For all is life — beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb, thy building stands, 
 A heavenly house not made with hands; 
 Go enter as thy Lord commands, 
 Thy mansion bright, beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb no palls of night 
 Cast forth their shadows to affright; 
 The balmy morn is sweet and bright 
 With Jesus' smiles, beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb, though now we part, 
 We shall be joined again in heart; 
 I soon shall come o'er where thou art, 
 To live and love, beyond the tomb. 
 Beyond the tomb, my mother dear. 
 My father, brother, kindred near; 
 Our little one and friends o'er there 
 Are waiting just beyond the tomb. 
 The Little Flock. 
 Come, little flock by Jesus led, 
 And gather round your Guide; 
 And take by faith the blood He shed, 
 The flesh He did provide. 
I04 LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 Feast on your Lord and then rejoice, 
 Still Him by faith we see; 
 And still we hear His gentle voice, 
 "This do, remember me." 
 Remember now how with the few 
 He groaned upon the ground. 
 His sacred locks all wet with dew. 
 While nature wept around. 
 And with what love He lingered still 
 In sad Gethsemane! 
 Must sorrow flow from Olive's hill. 
 And none, my soul, from thee ? 
 See, like a lamb to slaughter led, 
 At Pilate's bar He stood; 
 With piercing thorns they crowned His head. 
 His vesture stained with blood. 
 Though faint, He took the forked beam. 
 And went to Calvary; 
 They lashed, and lo! a fresher stream 
 Flowed freely down for me. 
 And as He poured His soul in death. 
 Which angels wept to see; 
 We kneel around the board by faith. 
 And view Him on the tree. 
 My Prodigal Child. 
 The prodigal strayed afar from home, 
 And through a stranger's land to roam; 
 The father marked his erring way, 
 And called his son from day to day: 
 My prodigal child! O prodigal child! 
 Why leave thy home to roam the wild? 
 Why turn away and grieve me so? 
 O prodigal child! why will you go ? 
 The father plead, but all in vain; 
 His love could not the child restrain, 
 Who wandered on till all was gone; 
 And still he called his erring son: 
 My prodigal child! O prodigal child! 
 Why will thou not be reconciled ? 
 Come back, my poor, forsaken son. 
 My prodigal child, why die undone ? 
 But heedless still from home he'd rove. 
 Regardless of his father's love, 
 Whose anxious heart and pitying grace 
 Would still his long-lost son embrace: 
 My prodigal child! how long away 
 Will thou remain from me today? 
 Why wander on against my will ? 
 My prodigal child! I love thee still. 
I06 LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 When hungry, faint and fit to die, 
 He fain would eat the swine's supply. 
 At last he said, his pride o'ercome, 
 "1 will arise and start for home." 
 Poor prodigal child! return in haste, 
 Through valley dark and desert waste; 
 There's bread at home and more to spare, 
 prodigal! thou art welcome there. 
 With bleeding feet and aching bone, 
 He journeys all the way alone; 
 With broken heart and weeping eyes. 
 He meets his father and he cries: 
 "Thy prodigal child! Thy prodigal child 
 Is come, and would be reconciled: 
 I've sinned against thy love and grace, 
 1 only ask a servant's place." 
 The father greets the wayward one, 
 And throws his arms around his son; 
 Bring forth a robe, a golden ring, 
 Go spread the feast, rejoice and sing! 
 My prodigal child! my prodigal child 
 Is come, to roam no more the wild; 
 Let angels shout the joyful sound. 
 The dead's alive, the lost is found! 
 God Is Love. 
 Hark! I hear a happy chorus, 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Song immortal, rapturous, wondrous, 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Oh, it must be angels singing, 
 Loud their harps from glory ringing. 
 And this blessed tiding bringing, 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Weary soul, art thou despairing? 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Hear the song so sweet and cheering, 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Art thou lonely and forsaken? 
 He my broken heart hath taken, 
 And to heavenly joys awaken; 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Is the world unkind and friendless ? 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Trust His grace, eternal, endless, 
 God is love! God is love! 
 How He loves the broken spirit! 
 He will take and heal and cheer it; 
 Life and love thou shalt inherit; 
 God is love! God is love! 
I08 LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 Does thy cup o'errun with sorrow? 
 God is love! God is love! 
 He will bring thee joy tomorrow; 
 God is love! God is love! 
 Art thou fainting, sinking, heaving 
 Sighs of woe, and ever grieving? 
 Only come, His word believing; 
 God is love! God is love! 
 My Dearest Friend. 
 Jesus, of all the friends I love, 
 Is dearest to my heart; 
 What else could my affections move. 
 Would he from me depart? 
 Cold and indifferent to the world, 
 I'd droop in sad despair. 
 With hope's inactive pinions furled; 
 Did not His presence cheer. 
 All human love would be in vain. 
 Were but His love unknown; 
 And naught could soothe my heart of pain, 
 Were His sweet smiles withdrawn. 
 Fame's fabric, though so finely wrought, 
 Would but reproaches bring; 
 And all the joys by riches brought 
 Would prove a fiery sting. 
 Wisdom would each delight reverse, 
 Without Thy sacred name; 
 And knowledge, the profoundest curse, 
 Without love's holy flame. 
 The feast of kings would filthy prove, 
 With Christ excluded there: 
 Lord, what is life without Thy love. 
 Or death but deep despair ? 
 The Sacred Morn. 
 Awake, and greet the brightening skies, 
 And hail the sacred day 
 Which saw the King of Glory rise, 
 To rend His shroud away. 
 The stars, which lately sank in gloom, 
 Are brighter than before. 
 They speak His triumph o'er the tomb, 
 And fade away no more. 
 The moon, illustrious and sublime. 
 Pursues her ancient road; 
 As glorious now as in her prime. 
 She throws her light abroad. 
no LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 The pensive hills look o'er the deep, 
 The skies are clear and calm; 
 While happy saints awake from sleep, 
 But not in dread alarm. 
 Behold the sun, whose brighter beams 
 Do smile on every shore; 
 Down on a guilty world, in streams, 
 Refulgent oceans pour. 
 And with the morn we rise to sing 
 His praise, as angels do; 
 We tell the triumph of our King, 
 And shout His glory too. 
 Oh, that with hearts and tongues of fire 
 We might our Savior praise; 
 And, with the universal choir, 
 Join the immortal lays. 
 The Glorified Savior. 
 Behold the King! what crowns adorn 
 His bruised and bleeding brow! 
 Though meanly slain, and pierced, and torn. 
 Yet, oh! how glorious now! 
 By sin and death and hell withstood, 
 He rose, His power to show; 
 His vesture, though once stained with blood, 
 Is now as white as snow. 
 Bright as the sun His face doth shine. 
 More wondrous than of old; 
 What a majestic sight divine, 
 For sinners to behold! 
 His hands are spread creation wide, 
 For rebels to embrace; 
 Who in His pardoning love confide 
 Shall find His pardoning grace. 
 Forth from His mouth the truth proceeds — 
 A keen two-edged sword; 
 The heart, corrupted, how it bleeds! 
 But leaves the wounded cured. 
 His feet like polished brass, He stands 
 With all-engaging love — 
 A dying world He now commands: 
 Believe and look above. 
 Oh! with what joy it fills my heart 
 To hear His voice, so mild: 
 "I am thy God, and lo, thou art 
 My own beloved child." 
 The Returning Chief. 
 Welcome, Thou great returning Chief! 
 A diadem awaits Thy brow: 
 Thy worshipers, once bowed in grief, 
 Do shout Thy glorious triumph now. 
 Come forth to conquer and to reign, 
 To listening worlds Thy victories tell: 
 Though once we viewed Thee as the Slain, 
 We hail Thee, King Immanuel! 
 Lo! I am He! and from the dead 
 I come, o'er all I take command; 
 With death and hell my captives led, 
 I hold their keys in my right hand. 
 I challenged Death and met the war. 
 And triumphed in the conflict there; 
 What though I wear the warrior's scar. 
 Behold, the victor's palm I bear. 
 I smote the hosts of Satan well, 
 Subduing all the powers of sin; 
 I shut the mighty gates of hell. 
 And locked its murmuring millions in. 
 In the domain of death and night. 
 To spirits bound in prison long, 
 I preached the word of love and light. 
 And now Salvation is their song. 
 O, ghastly Death! where is thy sting ? 
 Engulfing grave! thy victory where ? 
 Yield up your spoils to Christ our King, 
 For He is risen, we declare. 
 His Ascension. 
 Swing back, ye gates eternal; swing, 
 Ye everlasting doors — 
 Lift up your heads, behold your King, 
 Himself to life restores. 
 Lo! hell, with all her minions, strong, 
 Is put to shameful flight; 
 And death, the king of ages long, 
 Succumbs to Jesus' might. 
 Swing low, ye clouds, your chariots bright, 
 By swift archangels driven — 
 On wheels of love, by steeds of light, 
 And bear the Lord to heaven. 
 Ye thunders, rend the skies with praise; 
 Ye lightnings, join the lay; 
 Ye shining hosts, your pinions raise, 
 Receive your King today. 
 Cry, angels, loud, Come, welcome, Lord, 
 While all the hosts fall down; 
 Come up and reign^ by heaven adored, 
 While wreaths of glory crown. 
 Let all the shining legions fly 
 O'er golden peak and plain; 
 To heaven's extended borders cry, 
 "Jesus is come to reign!" 
 Replying worlds the chorus take, 
 The joyful news proclaim. 
 Till universal anthems break 
 In honor of His name. 
 Your ancient harps and lyres string, 
 And welcome Jesus home; 
 Thus ever praise the wondrous King, 
 Till all His saints are come. 
 And then His saints shall start a song, 
 Ne'er heard in heaven before — 
 To Jesus, who shall lead the throng 
 Triumphant through the door. 
 Oh, who with Jesus can compare. 
 Or who above can vie,. 
 When all His saints assembled there 
 Shall sing His praise on high? 
 Lord, Speak the Word. 
 Jesus! Thou matchless Lamb of Love, 
 To Thee, a wretch, I cry; 
 If Thou wilt in compassion move. 
 Now save me ere I die. 
 I heard that Thou Thyself wast slain, 
 That sinners might go free; 
 I left the gates of hell in pain, 
 To search for Calvary. 
 Justice pursues me day by day. 
 And still is close behind; 
 The gospel says a sinner may 
 In Thee salvation find. 
 As such I come; wilt Thou forgive, 
 And stay this awful fate? 
 Oh speak the word, and I shall live. 
 Before it is too late. 
 In all my sins and guilt I kneel 
 Before Thy throne today; 
 Lest Justice my damnation seal. 
 Lord, speak the word, I pray. 
 I've slighted long Thy calls of love. 
 And turned away so vile; 
 Just one more time Thy mercy prove, 
 And on a sinner smile. 
Il6 LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 Back to Thy love my soul restore 
 And heed my humble cry: 
 Speak, Lord, and I will fear no more; 
 Keep silent, and I die. 
 The Conflict. 
 Come, Lord, as in the days of yore. 
 And fight for Israel here; 
 In all the conflict lead before, 
 Nor let us think of fear. 
 Let none the fiercer strife evade, 
 Lest Zion suffer loss; 
 But let us stand with shield and blade. 
 And thus defend the cross. 
 Old hell is in her usual rage, 
 Conspired against the right; 
 Let all Thy soldiers now engage, 
 And boldly face the fight. 
 Still marshaled on, in Thee we trust — 
 In Thy almighty name; 
 Ne'er let our banner trail the dust, 
 Nor let her suffer shame. 
 Thus onward led at Thy command, 
 We shall to nothing yield; 
 And at our post we'll die or stand 
 Until we take the field. 
 With victory won o'er all at last, 
 While song and rapture thrill; 
 All honors at Thy feet v»^e'll cast. 
 And feel unworthy still. 
 Longing for Rest. 
 Had I thy wings, O gentle dove, 
 I'd fly away and rest; 
 I'd sweep through the bright gates above, 
 And lodge in Jesus' breast. 
 I'd pierce the lowering clouds of night, 
 And soar beyond the sky; 
 Nor would I falter in my flight, 
 Till safe in glory high. 
 I'd lay aside each earthly care, 
 And think no more of pain; 
 I'd leave my sad surroundings here, 
 Nor would return again. 
Il8 LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 Straight to His throne with eagle flight, 
 I'd pierce the pathless air; 
 And shout with all His saints in white, 
 The love of Jesus there. 
 Nestled in His embrace I'd sing 
 As angels never knew; 
 And, oh! the glory of my King 
 I'd shout forever, too. 
 Having Done All, Stand. 
 Firm on the rock of truth I stand, 
 Our standard still unfurled; 
 And heeding none but God's command, 
 I challenare all the world. 
 By faith and love made stronger yet, 
 I death and hell defy; 
 My sword is drawn, my shield is set, 
 And here I'll stand or die. 
 No earthly foes can make me yield, 
 Nor thundering terrors cower; 
 I'll hold my post upon this field, 
 And trust in Jesus' power. 
 I'll stand and ne'er desert the fort, 
 Though all may fly away; 
 I'll fight, and then to God report 
 The conflicts of the day. 
 Though wounded in the fray I fall, 
 But ne'er in heart cast down; 
 I'll signal to my comrades all, 
 Press on and win the crown. 
 Nor would my Captain spurn me there. 
 Though all mankind despise; 
 For if I conquer for Him here, 
 He'll crown me in the skies. 
 And did a crown e'er look so bright, 
 As on a wounded brow? 
 And what can give such sweet delight 
 As "warfare over now" ? 
 A Vision of Faith. 
 Methinks by faith the throne I see. 
 And Jesus standing near; 
 All clothed in sovereign majesty, 
 He pleads for sinners here. 
I20 LYRICS OF LOVE. 
 The nail-prints in His feet and hands, 
 The deep wound in His side, 
 Are just as fresh while there He stands 
 As when for us He died. 
 A golden diadem adorns 
 His blest and wounded brow, 
 Which once was pierced by cruel thorns. 
 But crowned with glory now. 
 His praises sound like roaring storms, 
 Harmonious, loud and sweet; 
 While millions bend their shining forms, 
 And kiss His wounded feet. 
 The Elders, too, our Lord adore. 
 While the high chorus rings; 
 With faces veiled, they bow before 
 The matchless King of Kings. 
 There Justice stands before His face 
 And wields his saber round; 
 But Mercy pleads for pardoning grace 
 And points him to the wound. 
 Cherubic hosts in bright array. 
 In groups of thousands fly; 
 They sweep through all the realms of day, 
 And shout, and sing, and cry: 
 "How worthy now to be adored, 
 How worthy, too, to reign! 
 And holy, holy is the Lord, 
 The Lord who once was slain!" 
 Ah! what a scene! and what a song! 
 How wonderful above! 
 Oh! that I now might join the throng, 
 And sing redeeming love! 
 Triumph of Truth. 
 Awake, my soul, from slumber rise, 
 With keener sense, beware! 
 Even sin assumes a hol}^ guise 
 When most it would ensnare. 
 Though Falsehood in Truth's robe conceals 
 Its hideous form so sly, 
 In spite of all its base appeals, 
 Ne'er trust a foe so nigh. 
 Though Hate the crown of Love may wear, 
 With feigned affection's smile; 
 Be watchful of the danger near, 
 'Tis none the less as vile. 
 From Error's grasp thus bravely wrest 
 The sacred truths of heaven; 
 And every inch of ground contest, 
 Nor let an inch be given. 
 Heed not the voice of kind deceit, 
 But spurn the flatterer's song; 
 Stand for the right! the foe's defeat 
 Comes with discovered wrong. 
 At dangers laugh, though hellish bands 
 Surround with threatenings wild; 
 Stand and obey thy God's commands, 
 He will protect His child. 
 What seems defeat, if thou wilt trust. 
 Shall yet a victory prove; 
 Tread thy opposers in the dust, 
 And on to glory move. 
 And in His time the Lord will bring 
 The long-sought triumph near; 
 His gracious hand will make thee king 
 O'er thy opposers here. 
 Let friends be few, or false, or far, 
 And all the world deride; 
 Be strong, for God and angels are 
 Enlisted on thy side. 
 The Forsaken Lord. 
 Of all that moves my stony heart — ■ 
 That bids me from my sins depart — 
 It is that cry upon the tree, 
 "My God, hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
 Oh, how it doth my pride reprove 
 And sinks my soul beneath His love. 
 To hear my dying Savior's plea, 
 "My God, hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
 My guilty soul, what is thy state 
 If sin includes such awful fate; 
 If sovereign Love must frown to see 
 The Savior die instead of thee ? 
 What means the rending of the rocks? 
 What means the dread and sudden shocks ? 
 What means this sad, distressing plea, 
 "My God, hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
 Why falls the pall of night so fast? 
 Why death his frightful shadows cast 
 About the hill of Calvary, 
 While Jesus dies upon the tree ? 
 Where are the hosts who told His birth ? 
 Where are His dearest friends on earth? 
 Do they forsake and flee the view? 
 O Love! dost Thou forsake Him too ? 
 "Let angels shun the awful sight, 
 Let hell pursue, or sinners smite; 
 Let rocks and hills in terror flee, 
 But why hast Thou forsaken me? 
 "Why ? Why ? I challenge Justice, why ? 
 Though dying, why forsaken die? 
 Are We not one great Trinity ? 
 Then, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
 O Lamb! let me, a sinner, tell, 
 'Twas to redeem my soul from hell; 
 With all Thy sufferings on the tree, 
 Thou art forsaken, Lord for me! 
 What Have You Done for Jesus? 
 What have you done for Jesus, 
 Since you were saved from sin, 
 Since you received salvation. 
 And joy and peace within? 
 Have you been sitting idly 
 Through all the precious day — 
 No love for those around you. 
 With talent hid away? 
 What have you done for Jesus, 
 At home or in the street? 
 Are you ashamed to own Him — 
 His wondrous love so sweet? 
 Though but a word be spoken 
 Of your Immanuel; 
 Some weary, sinking sinner 
 Might thus be saved from hell. 
 What have you done for Jesus 
 Since life became your own, 
 With all its joy and glory — 
 Its peace and pardon known? 
 Is life, or love, or labor, 
 Or wealth, or fame too dear 
 To give your Friend from heaven, 
 Who died to save you here ? 
 Whom have you led to Jesus 
 Since first you found the way? 
 Oh, have you been unmindful 
 Of those who roam astray? 
 And would you enter glory 
 With naught but foolish toys ? 
 With none you've led to Jesus, 
 And none to share your joys? 
 What do you want from Jesus, 
 In heaven from your Lord ? 
 Remember, O my brother! 
 No labor, no reward! 
 His rest is for the weary 
 Who now the cross endure; 
 His glory for the faithful. 
 His pleasures for the pure. 
 The Immortal Story. 
 God is love! Immortal story! 
 Angels chant the wondrous strain; 
 Waft it from the hills of glory, 
 To creation's nightly plain; 
 All declaring, 
 God is love! and He shall reign! 
 Wondrous worlds, in grandeur turning, 
 Hum His praises where ye rove; 
 Suns, in all your splendor burning, 
 Let your light proclaim His love; 
 Stars of heaven. 
 Sing, O, sing it from above! 
 Highest heaven of heavens, adore Him, 
 Shout His praise, ye million bands; 
 Cast your glittering crowns before Him, 
 Smite your harps and clap your hands- 
 Thus exclaiming, 
 God is love! o'er all commands. 
 Mighty love in all creation, 
 Tender love provides for me. 
 Gracious love in free salvation, 
 Wondrous love on Calvary! 
 Holy! holy! 
 Oh, what love in Thee I see! 
 The Infallible Word. 
 More firm than earth's foundation, Lord, 
 Is this dear Book divine; 
 More Hght than all the stars afford 
 From its blest pages shine. 
 Though mountains from their places move, 
 And all the hills depart, 
 Still stands the Volume of Thy Love — 
 Still stands the trusting heart. 
 The laws by human thought contrived 
 With kingdoms sank in shame; 
 While nations perished, it survived, 
 Nor perished in the flame. 
 True as the needle to the pole. 
 O'er this rough sea of time 
 How it directs the pilgrim soul 
 To a diviner clime! 
 Down the dark vistas of that age, 
 Through which we sinners roam. 
 It throws a beam from every page 
 On our eternal home. 
 The sun, with all his light, must fail. 
 The stars must fade above, 
 The moon her silver brow must veil. 
 But not this Book of Love. 
 Experience. 
 I like the road to Zion well, 
 Though narrow, straight and steep; 
 I started from the gates of hell, 
 And from the valley deep. 
 Thus far, I've traveled with my Friend- 
 My Jesus at my side; 
 I think that I can reach the end 
 And safely trust my Guide. 
 The frequent storms did not impede. 
 Nor trials did delay; 
 They made me but increase my speed. 
 And made me watch and pray. 
 I've often stood upon the field. 
 Midst all the strife alone; 
 I've seen my dear companions yield. 
 But still I struggled on. 
 Yes, through the thickest of the fight, 
 In spite of dangers near, 
 I came, contending for the right, 
 And fighting without fear. 
 It has not been so pleasant, though 
 I like the journey still; 
 And upward I'm resolved to go. 
 And rest on Zion hill. 
 I've climbed too high to slide back down; 
 I've run and must prevail; 
 I've fought too hard to miss my crown, 
 And too near home to fail. 
 The Pilgrimage. 
 Lord, stay the storm. 
 Or be my refuge while 
 The tempests roll; 
 The clouds remove. 
 Or let me see Thee smile 
 Upon my soul; 
 And still the waves, 
 Or Thou Thyself must steer 
 My tossed bark. 
 Or else I founder here. 
 The thunders hush. 
 Or let me also hear, 
 "Peace! peace! be still!" 
 The lightnings sheathe, 
 Or whisper to mine ear, 
 " 'Tis but My will"; 
 And though around 
 The furious billows break, 
 I shall not fear 
 Since Thou wilt not forsake. 
 Speak, as I pass 
 The shoals of death in dread, 
 "Fear not to die"; 
 And let me hear Thee say, 
 "Be not afraid, 
 Lo litis I." 
 Then let my soul. 
 Though here the wrecks remain. 
 Approach the shore — 
 The port of heaven gain. 
SECULAR POEMS. 
 An Appeal from the Stake. 
 Are pagan vices thine, 
 Ye saintly Southern elves? 
 Why make a hell for mine, 
 And heaven for yourselves ? 
 Why wake a nation's ire 
 To chase a fleeing mouse? 
 Why set the world on fire 
 To burn a humble louse ? 
 With blood of lowly pride, 
 Why stain your blessed South; 
 And take the Negro's hide 
 To wipe your holy mouth — 
 To justify your rules, 
 Whose anger never slacks; 
 Why love your dogs and mules 
 Much better than your blacks? 
 Your friend you view with scorns. 
 And bind with iron thread 
 His feet, that crush your thorns — 
 His hands that make your bread. 
 Why burn, revile and curse 
 The man who would not harm — 
 Who rocked your cradle first, 
 Who nursed you on his arm ? 
 Was I not faithful still 
 When brother sought your life ? 
 Why blame me for the ill — 
 The issues of your strife ? 
 Why rage, my heart to rend, 
 And bid your love forbear ? ' 
 Am I not still your friend. 
 Though flayed and tortured here? 
 I'll suffer — though 'tis hard — 
 The fury of your ire: 
 My blood shall cry to God 
 Against you from the fire. 
 Excuse will not avail. 
 For Justice will pursue; 
 ''Who by the sword prevail 
 Shall by it perish, too." 
 Where is that spark divine, 
 Which often did console — 
 Did on my pathway shine — 
 Around my heathen soul; 
 That sacred spark of love. 
 Which shone so bright of yore ? 
 Does it such friendship prove? 
 Is this the fruit it bore? 
 That love which breathed within 
 A confidence divine — 
 Which made me fear to sin — 
 Which joined my heart to thine; 
 Which bound me fast and strong 
 To my old master's feet; 
 Which made me feel, so long, 
 That chattel life was sweet. 
 Shall love at last subdue — 
 The Ethiop's heart refine; 
 And leave it still for you 
 To prove it less divine; 
 Who saw its shining first, 
 And found its dear embrace; 
 Who saw its glory burst 
 On all in pardoning grace? 
 And why debase the Good, 
 With Evil to be bound; 
 And spill thy brother's blood 
 With piety profound? 
 Will ye your honor stain, 
 Ye best and wisest known, 
 Bid vile Anarchy reign 
 With Justice on the throne ? 
 Why spread the sacred Book 
 Before my dimmer eyes; 
 And then, with pious look, 
 Direct me to that prize — 
 By meek obedience won. 
 The pure in heart's reward; 
 Then draw your torch and gun 
 Against the heirs of God? 
 Ye tell me, "God is love"— 
 That I should this embrace; 
 Then, why so different prove, 
 Ye children of His grace? 
 That I should like Him be, 
 Forgiving, good and kind; 
 Why shout with joy to see 
 Thy friend in flames confined? 
 But God is also just, 
 Alike to weak and wise; 
 And from my smouldering dust 
 Shall your damnation rise! 
 You should remember now, 
 The lesson of those years 
 When Justice made you bow 
 In sorrow, grief and tears. 
 Though hopeless of your grace 
 While still my flesh consume, 
 I'll love the ruddy race 
 In spite of all that come: 
 In spite of gun or sword, 
 Or fagot's cruel flame; 
 Like Thee, my gracious Lord, 
 I love them just the same! 
 I love ye not for aught 
 That your strong hands have done — 
 Nor what your skill has wrought, 
 Nor for )'^our triumphs won; 
 Not to appease your laws. 
 Nor Color's creed approve; 
 I love ye just because 
 My Father God is love! 
 In spite of stifling heat, 
 Or rabble's savage cry; 
 Still, still I now repeat, 
 I love you though I die! 
 And thus my soul would heave 
 Its dying breath for you. 
 And cry, "O Lord, forgive! 
 They know not what they do!" 
 God, Save the South! 
 God, save the South, 
 Lest pagan vices rend her; 
 Thy arm upraise, 
 With love and law defend her; 
 God, save the South! 
 God, save the South! 
 O, bless her people's 
 Humble habitation, 
 Their hearts rejoin 
 With all this mighty nation. 
 To sing the song 
 Of Freedom and Salvation; 
 God, save the South! 
 God, save the South, 
 Who hast with honor crowned her; 
 Now throw the robe 
 Of peace and love around her: 
 God, save the South! 
 God, save the South! 
 Her borders bless; 
 Upon her fields and flowers 
 In season send 
 The sweet refreshing showers. 
 Till plenty smile 
 O'er all this land of ours; 
 God, save the South! 
 God, save the South 
 Till her divided races 
 Shall cease to frown, 
 And sing with smiling faces, 
 God, save the South! 
 God, save the South! 
 Till North, and West, 
 And East, with peace adorning 
 Our country. Lord — 
 All voices now rejoining. 
 In union sing 
 Like the fair Sons of Morning, 
 "God bless the South!" 
 Let Him Alone. 
 "What must we with the Negro do ?" 
 Let him alone; 
 He has some rights as well as you. 
 Let him alone: 
 When you see him go to vote. 
 With his head set like a goat, 
 Don't be pulling at his coat; 
 Let him alone. 
 When he's on his way to school, 
 Let him alone; 
 He is not the only fool. 
 Let him alone: 
 If he wears a beaver hat, 
 Why, don't bother him for that; 
 He's as happy as a cat; 
 Let him alone. 
 When you find him in your field, 
 Let him alone; 
 He can eat all he will steal, 
 Let him alone; 
 If he's in your melon patch. 
 And it's time for them to hatch; 
 Don't be sneaking round to catch, 
 Let him alone. 
 When you meet him on the street. 
 Let him alone; 
 He will work enough to eat, 
 Let him alone; 
 If he comes to your hotel, 
 He is guided by the smell, 
 Please don't run him down to 11, 
 Let him alone. 
 If he's in your chicken house, 
 Let him alone; 
 It might only be a mouse. 
 Let him alone: 
 Though your chickens start a row, 
 And are cackling "wow-o-wow!" 
 Hens are fussy anyhow. 
 Let him alone. 
 When he's studying poHtics, 
 Let him alone; 
 He is learning your old tricks, 
 Let him alone; 
 Though he cannot read his name, 
 Heaven knows he's not to blame; 
 He's a citizen just the same; 
 Let him alone. 
 Nothing Rules My Heart but Love. 
 Matters mortals what am I? 
 Though a pudding or a pie; 
 I am only what I am, 
 Though a lion or a lamb — 
 In the country, in the town. 
 Standing up or kneeling down; 
 Matters not where'er I rove. 
 Nothing rules my heart but love. 
 Though my skin be black or white. 
 He who made me made me right; 
 Made my heart and eyes to scan, 
 Made me black, but still a man; 
 Lynch or burn, with all you do, 
 Shoot and pierce me through and through; 
 I will not your hate approve; 
 Nothing bends my heart but love. 
 Take your throne and sit and frown, 
 Crush and bend creation down; 
 Call your minions round your stool, 
 Make them swear to keep your rule; 
 Take the senate in your claws, 
 Write your statutes, write your laws; 
 Law may lash and law reprove. 
 Nothing rules my heart but love. 
 Call your navies from afar, 
 And array your men of war; 
 Load your cannon, fire your guns, 
 Until blood like rivers runs, 
 Then with thunder voice declare, 
 I must rule and you must fear; 
 All of this can never move, 
 Till I see a smile of love. 
 Dress your finest, dress your best, 
 Ask me in to be your guest; 
 Spread your parlor, show your suit. 
 Pass your wine, and pass your fruit; 
 Kiss and cackle, smirk and grin, 
 All of this is but a sin 
 Till you woo me like a dove; 
 Nothing wins my heart but love. 
 Talk of wealth and riches won. 
 Of your sports with cue or gun; 
 Of your land with fertile plain, 
 Of your fields of golden grain: 
 Boast of your ancestral wealth, 
 Of your wisdom, virtue, health; 
 This I hate, I disapprove, 
 Till you crown them all with love. 
 Take the pulpit as your stand. 
 Read to me the Lord's command — 
 Read the Bible through and through, 
 Tell me how to live and do; 
 Picture hell with all its fire 
 Mingling with the Devil's ire; 
 None of these can ever move. 
 Till you whisper, "God is love." 
 Tell me of Jehovah's wrath 
 Howling on the sinner's path — 
 Of that day of dread and gloom 
 When my soul shall hear its doom; 
 None of these disturbs my mind 
 Till you tell me, "He is kind"; 
 This can bend me, this can move, 
 Oh! I can't withstand His love! 
 The Dear Old Farm. 
 Give me the farm — the dear old farm, 
 Where fashion false, and lying charm 
 Do not allure; 
 Where life is simple, real and sweet, 
 Where song is heard while woods repeat, 
 And love is pure. 
 Give me the farm, where rustic pride 
 Aims not to turn the true aside 
 From Love's highway; 
 Where virtue finds a paradise. 
 Nor vices blind the virgin's eyes 
 In life's best day. 
 Give me the farm, where grows the corn, 
 Shouting with tassel gold unworn, 
 While breezes roll; 
 Where smiles the fleecy staple, white, 
 Like snowy fields of Eden bright 
 Around the soul. 
 Give me the farm — the cabin dear, 
 With the fireplace so spacious there — 
 Full five feet wide — 
 With the backlog just burning down, 
 Potatoes sweet and 'possum brown 
 Right by my side. 
 Give me the farm when Sunday comes, 
 When all the girls and all the chums 
 Meet at the spring; 
 When long-eared mules, ox-carts in droves, 
 Come sailing through the woods and groves, 
 Oh, how we sing! 
 The preacher reads the hymn divine. 
 And we remember not a line, 
 But sing right on; 
 When with the text we start to shout. 
 Forgetting shame, or pride, or doubt, 
 To heaven most gone. 
 How can we live like Abraham, 
 Or Moses, meeker than a lamb, 
 Or Job, bowed down ? 
 Or how can we like David sing, 
 With Satan running everything. 
 E'en the whole town? 
 How Was Woman Made? 
 Was a miracle so common 
 When creation first began — 
 When Jehovah made the woman 
 With a sparerib of the man; 
 Did He make her for a wife, 
 When from Adam's side He took it ? 
 I've been wondering all my life, 
 Did He make the woman crooked? 
 Filled with love and crowned with beauty, 
 Sweeter than a rose she'll smile; 
 Faithful, too, in every duty. 
 False and true, and good and vile. 
 Here's a riddle hard to find. 
 Any way that you may look it, 
 Here's the question in my mind, 
 Did He make that woman crooked? 
 Eyes of radiant azure splendor. 
 Gazing from a cleft of gold; 
 Cruel and mean, yet soft and tender, 
 Timid, sweet, yet fearful, bold. 
 Mind that loving look, my friend, 
 Write it down with ink, and book it; 
 Ere you reach your journey's end, 
 You will find that some are crooked. 
 On the bank of life she's fishing, 
 In the stream she drops her line; 
 Minnows swimming round and wishing 
 That the pretty girl was mine. 
 Quickly then she pulls it out, 
 Ah! she knows just how to hook it; 
 What you bite it for, you trout? 
 Didn't you know that she was crooked ? 
 Meek as Moses, mean as Judas, 
 Kiss with lip and curse with eye; 
 Frank as Paul, and sly as Brutus, 
 Speaks the truth, and acts — O my! 
 Well, we both are just the same, 
 Any way you boil and cook it; 
 The poor woman's not to blame. 
 Some old scoundrel made her crooked! 
 The Truth. 
 Mother taught me when a boy, 
 "Tell the truth; 
 If you steal a pie or toy, 
 Tell the truth: 
 Tell it only if you must 
 Toil in sorrow, toil in dust; 
 Tell the truth, my boy, and trust. 
 Tell the truth."' 
 Well, I told it and I got 
 For the truth — 
 On my head another knot, 
 Like the truth; 
 Bowed across her able knee, 
 Oh, she used her hand so free; 
 There was nothing left for me 
 But the truth. 
 Used to seem to me a sin 
 In my youth. 
 Only one old shirt and then, 
 Tell the truth; 
 Well, my ma would hit so hard. 
 And I'd holler, "Mussy, Lard \" 
 After all, that's the reward 
 For the truth. 
 Since I've grown to be a man, 
 As in youth. 
 There are times I hardly can 
 Tell the truth: 
 Even love will make you lie. 
 For your darling is so shy. 
 And you hate to see her fly 
 From the truth. 
 Took the pulpit and I preached 
 All the truth; 
 Thundered, hollered, roared, and screeched 
 'Bout the truth: 
 Well, the people shouted first, 
 But at last I got the worst; 
 For they turned, and frowned, and cursed 
 At the truth. 
 Tried the politician's game 
 With the truth; 
 Got the devil just the same 
 'Bout the truth; 
 Had me 'lected long before, 
 I was the right man and more; 
 But was kicked out the back door 
 With the truth. 
 Took a paper, tried the pen 
 And the truth; 
 Praised the country, praised the men, 
 Praised the truth. 
 "Send the paper." It was sent; 
 Plad to curse and then repent; 
 Had their names and not a cent, 
 And the truth. 
 Bought a bag and got some roots 
 And the truth; 
 Washed my face and brushed my boots 
 With the truth: 
 "Morning, Doctor; almost dying!" 
 Well, to cure him I was trying; 
 Paid me off by lying and lying 
 On the truth. 
 But I'm not discouraged yet 
 With the truth; 
 Cannot tell what I may get 
 For the truth: 
 But, O God! since truth is right. 
 For its cause FIl die or fight 
 Till to Thee I take my flight 
 With the truth! 
 A Dream. 
 Of late I had a cheering dream, 
 When sorrow's cold, perpetual stream 
 Was dark and deep; 
 When all that friendly Hope could do 
 Had failed; and Faith had faltered too; 
 With their last beams now hid from view, 
 I fell asleep. 
 Led by a mystic hand afar 
 Where shone no sun, or moon, or star, 
 But all was night; 
 I followed on in curious quest, 
 So weak and faint, and so distressed, 
 My weary spirit sighed for rest 
 In dreamy flight. 
 Soon, left upon a plain alone, 
 I looked around — my friend was gone, 
 I knew not where j 
 Black darkness reigned creation round. 
 The thunders roared, the heavens frowned, 
 The lightnings leaped from sky to ground, 
 And rent the air. 
 No shelter could I hope to find. 
 My weary eyes were almost blind, 
 Afraid to move; 
 The flowers threw themselves away. 
 The trees were splintered in the fray; 
 Just then I heard a whisper say 
 That "God is Love!" 
 A heavenly thrill of sweet delight 
 Pierced through my soul's obtrusive night, 
 Destroying fear; 
 Regaining strength, I raised my head, 
 While hope returned and gently said, 
 "Thy Father lives, fear not the dread, 
 Lo! He is near." 
 Soon staid the storm, and all was well; 
 Still near my feet were death and hell. 
 Then some one spoke: 
 "Trust thou in God," He said more sweet, 
 "For death and hell beneath my feet 
 Are crushed"; and both were in retreat, 
 When I awoke. 
 The Purest Smile. 
 Were life extended as the scroll, 
 And home a blissful paradise; 
 When gloomy clouds above it roll, 
 And o'er the furious tempest rise; 
 To find an angel were it mine 
 Who would domestic gloom beguile; 
 I'd seek that one with faith divine. 
 Who meets her hardships with a smile. 
 Were all the kinds of Eves to pass 
 Before my face from day to day; 
 And were it mine to choose a lass 
 To roll a world of woe away, 
 And I, the only worshiper 
 Of all the slaves of tyrant Style, 
 I'd choose and crown the brow of her 
 Who bears her burdens with a smile. 
 The flattered, flaunting, faking flirt 
 Would but a deep disdain awake: 
 The flower bedecked with Fashion's dirt 
 I would not kiss for Beauty's sake: 
 But ah! that loving seraph fair, 
 Who turns from every pleasure vile, 
 Who stands amidst the storms severe, 
 And braves the tempest with a smile. 
 A demon lurks within thy breast 
 Who only smiles with silk and fan; 
 Who's only happy with the best. 
 Who weds the money, not the man; 
 Who hugs the lamb to rend and tear 
 Like wolf, with teeth and talon vile; 
 Safe is the man who shuns such snare, 
 Blest is the man who hates thy smile. 
 Bright smiles are not of life the whole; 
 The sweetest smiles we see in tears. 
 When deep within a humble soul 
 Bears hopefully the load of years: 
 In life it cheers; in death it soothes, 
 When nothing else can reconcile; 
 The path to heaven how it smooths, 
 Surpassing the angelic smile! 
 We Are Black, but We Are Men. 
 What's the boasted creed of color? 
 'Tis no standard for a race; 
 Justice' mansion has no cellar, 
 All must fill an even place. 
 We must share the rights of others, 
 Dwelling here as kin with kin; 
 We are black, but we are brothers; 
 We are black, but we are men. 
 Heaven smiles on all the dwellers 
 Of creation's varied breeds; 
 Virtue beameth not in colors, 
 But in kind and noble deeds. 
 Though in humble contemplation, 
 Driven here from den to den; 
 We're a part of this great nation; 
 We are black, but we are men. 
 South, the land we love so dearly, 
 Wilt thou plunge us in despair? 
 Wilt thou hate a brother merely 
 For the texture of his hair? 
 Boast yourselves as our superiors, 
 We allow your claim, but then, 
 We are black, but not inferiors; 
 We are black, but we are men. 
 When our God His image gave thee, 
 We received a mortal's due; 
 And when Jesus died to save thee, 
 Died to save the Negro too. 
 Stabbed by death, by sorrows driven, 
 Through one gate we enter when 
 Passing into hell or heaven; 
 We are black, but we are men. 
 Hundreds crowding every college, 
 What will ye to them impute? 
 Climbing up the tree of knowledge. 
 Reaching for the golden fruit. 
 To this creed the world converting, 
 There's no virtue in the skin; 
 Daily proving, still asserting, 
 We are black, but we are men. 
 Yet in spite of Death the Raider, 
 And in spite of hellish strife; 
 We must rise from this low nadir 
 To the zenith of this life. 
 Rising though they mob and seize us. 
 Hound and chase o'er moor and fen; 
 Rising by Thy grace, O Jesus! 
 We are black, but we are men. 
 Heaven hath your deeds recorded. 
 Vengeance is Jehovah's own! 
 And though late, you'll be rewarded, 
 You must reap what you have sown! 
 Trusting, Father, to Thy goodness. 
 We shall in the conflict win; 
 Yet, forgive our brethren's rudeness; 
 Let us live like loving men. 
 Reminiscent. 
 There are sad and mournful days 
 Which return without relief. 
 When the little ones sit nodding round the hearth: 
 When the father's pensive gaze, 
 And the mother's look of grief 
 Seem to spurn the very thought of joy and mirth. 
 Home is not the home of old 
 When the rapture of those hours 
 Brought a balm instead of burdens to the breast; 
 When the golden moments rolled 
 Like the dewdrops from the flowers. 
 But returned again at morning, and caressed. 
 Sadly, though, the scene has changed, 
 And those sweeter hours are gone, 
 All is silent and how oft our hearts do burn! 
 For the home is disarranged. 
 And a dear and loving one 
 Has departed, and will never more return. 
 Though we turn our eyes above, 
 Peering through the vacant air, 
 Still that dear familiar form no more we see; 
 And that soft, sweet voice of love, 
 And that faithful heart of prayer, 
 Though I call, but they will never answer me. 
 My poor heart can never tell, 
 Save by sighing while forlorn, 
 To the neighbors whom we greet with breathless nod— * 
 Vv^'hat doth in the bosom swell — 
 What is by the spirit borne, 
 As it heaves its deep-felt sorrows up to God. 
 Oh, the moments seem to tire 
 As the old clock keeps its pace 
 With the weary fleeting hours as on they move; 
 We sit gazing in the fire 
 As it gleams back in the face. 
 Telling of the inward strife of grief and love. 
 Tears unwelcomed steal their way 
 Down the sorrow-riven cheek — 
 Touching lightly on the garments — freely poured; 
 And the lips forbear to say 
 What the broken heart would speak; 
 Still we all remember well the last sweet word. 
 Friends who whisper to uphold 
 Oft but vex our thankless grief, 
 And their soothing words but seem like sounding brass; 
 But when He, whose love untold. 
 Softly breathes His kind relief, 
 Then we yield and say, "Thy will be done," at last. 
 That relief will only come 
 To the meek and trusting heart; 
 'Tis the sweetest balm that heaven to mortal gives — 
 Tells of meetings over Home, 
 Where we nevermore shall part; 
 Of those mansions glorious, grand, where Jesus lives. 
 Oh, it sheds its sacred beams 
 In my humble cottage here, 
 And what heavenly light it gives! what joy untold! 
 Till sometimes it really seems 
 That with my dear ones over there 
 And with Jesus I now walk the streets of gold. 
 To the Sacred Memory of N. G. Gonzales. 
 Embalmed in South Carolina's love. 
 He sleeps; 
 With lion strength and heart of dove, 
 He sleeps; 
 While o'er the tomb our heads we bow, 
 Love's final tribute to bestow; 
 Beneath a mound of flowers now 
 He sleeps. 
 With folded arms across the breast, 
 He sleeps; 
 Reposed in that eternal rest. 
 He sleeps; 
 Far from the loud, keen clash of strife, 
 Far from the love of friends and wife, 
 Far from the busy paths of life. 
 He sleeps. 
 'Tis but the wounded, mortal span 
 That sleeps. 
 'Tis not the higher, nobler man 
 That sleeps. 
 His soul, illustrious and sublime. 
 Soars high above the peaks of Time; 
 To that diviner, happier clime 
 He leaps! 
 Afterwards. 
 There fell a man to virtue born — 
 To love a lord — to truth a king — 
 To law a priest, whose fate we mourn; 
 Beneath anarchy's venomed sting. 
 The fight for honor long had past, 
 And he, the victor in the strife. 
 Was smitten by the Luger's blast. 
 But triumphed more in death than life. 
 Beneath the dome where Hampton's voice 
 Still hums his last immortal lay, 
 Where once Calhoun (the people's choice) 
 With thunder rivaled thundering Clay; 
 A moving arsenal of death 
 Impaled its honored shrine in shame; 
 And with the fury of its breath. 
 Extinguished life's supernal flame! 
 Ke fell a wounded hero, low, 
 Yet thoughtless of his fate so nigh; 
 He threw his hands upon his brow 
 And looked into eternity. 
 Far viewed, the fields of Eden stood. 
 Inviting palm and waiting kin; 
 E'en on the margin of the flood. 
 He felt no consciousness of sin. 
 A stunning shock, a thrill of dread. 
 Aroused a trembling people's fears; 
 The messenger declared him dead, 
 And South Carolina bowed in tears. 
 A wounded State with Justice fled. 
 An orphan law with Mercy gone, 
 Bowed with an aching heart and head, 
 While bold anarchy trampled on! 
 Ah! weep with me, ye Muses here, 
 Lo! widowed love unpitied stands. 
 With face all torn by grief severe. 
 With broken heart and helpless hands — 
 Where lies a head with honor crowned — 
 Where finds the valiant heart repose — • 
 Where sleeps a dear one 'neath the mound — 
 Where fades the violet and the rose! 
 Let marble shaft his ashes span. 
 And tell the listening ears of Time 
 The worth and virtues of the man — 
 The horrors of a sinner's crime. 
 Let fame a fadeless laurel give. 
 While his immortal annals tell 
 The life of honor he did live — 
 The cause lor which Gonzales fell! 
 King Edward. 
 Son of the world's most loving queen, 
 Heir of a blest and pious throne. 
 Beam of a star whose silver sheen 
 Is faded and forever gone; 
l6o  
 Mourn not the royal dust's repose, 
 Nor weep the silence of that voice 
 Whose sweetness quelled uprising foes, 
 Her alien subjects made rejoice. 
 In the sepulchral palace where 
 She lies 'twixt two archangels tall, 
 The hostile tempests breathe not there, 
 Nor storms of fury shake the wall, 
 There peace perpetual bless the shrine. 
 There royal hands move not to toil. 
 There love is perfect and divine, 
 And life is more than death can spoil. 
 Crowns fade not there, nor thrones decay. 
 Nor scepters fail, nor foes defame. 
 Nor empires rise up in one day. 
 And sink and perish in the same. 
 A strong dominion, glorious, grand, 
 A lasting throne, a fadeless crown, 
 Through endless ages ever stand, 
 And such is now Victoria's own. 
 God grant thy reign may so improve 
 Till Europe a millennium see — 
 A thousand years of peace and love, 
 A thousand of prosperity. 
 Let Britain spread her borders far. 
 Till all breathe her congenial air; 
 Till the immortal Stripe and Star 
 Shall wed the Lion on the Square. 
 Thine be a reign not fraught with strife, 
 A throne unthreatened and undoomed; 
 Safe as the paradise of Hfe, 
 Bright as the kingdom unbegloomed. 
 Thine be no partial scepter swayed 
 By warring creeds, but full of grace; 
 A crown with purest gems arrayed, 
 Sublime to all the human race. 
 King! Africa, my fatherland. 
 Awaits the blessing of the crown; 
 Extend to her a helping hand, 
 Though weighed by woe and warfare down. 
 Give sure relief and safe retreat, 
 Grasp all her shores in Britain's arms; 
 And then forbid that tyrant feet 
 Should crush and rend her with alarm.s. 
 Blest be the crown whose glories shone 
 Around Victoria's gentle brow; 
 Lord God, preserve her royal son, 
 And be his strong protector now. 
 Who next the royal lineage brings 
 Victoria's virtues still retain; 
 What else her sons should be but kings ? 
 What else her heirs should do but reign ? 
1 62  
 No Longer a Slave. 
 No longer a slave, for 
 The ages are gone 
 Which bound us in shackles 
 Like monsters of stone; 
 Which hunted for mortals 
 Like beasts of the wood, 
 Despising the soul of 
 The helpless and good; 
 And herding and droving 
 The broods of the race 
 By the sting of the lash 
 And the frown of the face. 
 Thus hated and driven 
 From cradle to grave; 
 Now blest with their freedom, 
 No longer a slave. 
 No longer a slave, though 
 The dent of the chain, 
 And the wounds of the lash 
 Upon us remain; 
 Though the clouds of that day 
 So darkly depart, 
 Still hurling its thunders 
 Of wrath at the heart, 
 Still flashing its sabers 
 Of lightning again, 
 That terror ma}'- bind us 
 More fast than the chain; 
 But still unalarmed, in 
 The battle as brave, 
 We shout to the masters, 
 "No longer a slave!'" 
 No longer a slave; for 
 The ransom was paid 
 By the life of the noble — 
 The blood of the dead — 
 By tears of the mother, 
 The woes of the wife — 
 The blood of the soldiers. 
 So fearless in strife. 
 Who, facing the cannon. 
 Inhaling its breath, 
 Did offer their lives on 
 The altars of death! 
 With groans of the dying, 
 And shouts of the brave. 
 How solemn the echo! 
 No longer a slave! 
 No longer a slave; now 
 In freedom to live. 
 In freedom to die and 
 To love and forgive; 
 In freedom to reign at 
 The family fold, 
 To shelter my own from 
 The storm and the cold. 
 Though only a cabin 
 My mansion may be, 
 I'm happy, O Heaven! 
 Since now I am free: 
 Though nothing but a board 
 Shall point out my grave, 
 Still write on the head-piece, 
 "No longer a slave." 
 No longer a slave; and 
 To heaven we sing 
 The praise of the Father, 
 The wonderful King, 
 Who gave to the Nation 
 A friend of the poor 
 Like Lincoln, who freed us; 
 That freedom we 'dore. 
 In word and in deed, and 
 In virtue and good. 
 We'll pay to this nation 
 The price of her blood; 
 A tribute of love we 
 Will pay to the brave, 
 Who fell, but exclaiming, 
 "No longer a slave!" 
 Judging. 
 Judge not a man by what he says, 
 The mouth can speak a thousand ways, 
 With truth untold; 
 The knave can imitate the pure, 
 The Har speak just hke the true; 
 The thief is somewhat honest too, 
 The sneak is bold. 
 Ne'er judge a lady by her looks. 
 Her face is like fictitious books, 
 An author's trick; 
 When most she takes you for a fool, 
 A loving look will be her rule; 
 Yet in her heart she is a mule. 
 Prepared to kick. 
 But judge her by that holy stare. 
 If meekness reigns supremely there. 
 She'll blush and whirl; 
 When uncommanded beauty beams, 
 When love flows like a thousand streams, 
 And floats you, like a ship, it seems — 
 Then, that's the girl. 
 The hardest thing on earth to guess 
 Is falsehood in its Sunday dress — 
 A holy sham! 
1 66  
 With pious face and roguish eyes, 
 It schemes to take you by surprise, 
 Though but a Hon in disguise, 
 And not a lamb. 
 Judge not a preacher by his coat, 
 For he may be a jack or goat, 
 To butt and kick; 
 But judge his Hfe, his love, his walk, 
 Nor be deceived by mournful talk; 
 He may be just a holy hawk, 
 To catch the chick. 
 Judge not at all, lest ye be judged. 
 Unless your life has been emerged 
 From filth about; 
 A monkey mocks his brother's shame. 
 The brother turns and does the same. 
 And both at last are then to blame; 
 So just look out! 
 Gen, Wade Hampton. 
 Veteran of a thousand battles. 
 Conqueror of unnumbered frays! 
 Those whom you once held as chattels 
 Still recall thy name with praise; 
 Those who knelt around you praying, 
 With their shackles harnessed tight, 
 Wept to see you die, but saying, 
 "Father, bless both black and white." 
 Though in calm repose you slumber. 
 All of life an afterdream; 
 Though you've gone to join that number 
 Far beyond the solemn stream; 
 Though you're harping with the singers 
 In that Home to which we tend; 
 Sweet! ah, sweet! the memory lingers 
 Of a master and a friend. 
 Right e'er found thee brave, but tender; 
 Wrong could not around thee grow; 
 Virtue knew thee as defender. 
 Vice regarded thee its foe. 
 Greatest of Carolina's brothers. 
 Bravest of thy natal sod; 
 Lo! thy life was spent for others, 
 For thy country and thy God. 
 Say, ye friends, let all repeat it 
 While receding ages move — 
 Fled from strife but not defeated. 
 Dead, but lives embalmed in love! 
1 68  
 Speak, ye tongues, your chieftain's glory; 
 Rhyme his name, ye bards, and sing; 
 Tell to the unborn the story 
 Of the patriot, soldier, king! 
 Fame her sacred beams is pouring 
 Where the world's Wade Hampton lies, 
 Shaded by an oak adoring 
 'Neath Columbia's sunny skies. 
 Earth! the good increase thy numbers, 
 Clay! this mortal star enclose. 
 Tomb! in thee a conqueror slumbers; 
 Hampton resting in repose! 
 The Wife Problem. 
 When your wife is hard to rule, 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Don't be kicking like a mule, 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Let her 'lone in what she's doin', 
 She is but her way pursuin'; 
 She don't care if she does ruin, 
 She's a 'oman. 
 If she quarrels now and then, 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Just make up and kiss again. 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Talk of gospel till you're dead, 
 There's no Bible in her head; 
 Just make up and kiss instead; 
 She's a 'oman. 
 Never answer every breath, 
 She's a 'oman; 
 She can talk your tongue to death. 
 She's a 'oman; 
 When she's ragin', never fret, 
 Call her honey, call her pet; 
 Don't you understan' 'er yet ? 
 She's a 'oman. 
 If she breaks your pocketbook. 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Needn't twitch your eyes and look, 
 She's a 'oman: 
 She is fresh, and she is funny, 
 She is sugar, she is honey 
 When she wants to get your money; 
 She's a 'oman. 
 When you take her out to ride. 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Make her think she's just a bride. 
 She's a 'oman; 
 Tell her she is pretty, though 
 It's a story, but you know 
 That's the way we have to do 
 With a 'oman. 
 Dorothy Dix. 
 Dorothy Dix, Dorothy Dix, 
 Thou Shakspeare of the family fold. 
 Whose love and wisdom grandly mix — 
 Surpassing that of sages old. 
 Thy pen, the scepter of the home. 
 Shall guide in peace and shield in strife. 
 Till thoughtless bride and giddy groom 
 Be made a husband and a wife. 
 Dorothy Dix, Dorothy Dix, 
 High priestess of the holy place. 
 Whose cherubs their bright pinions fix. 
 And stare each other in the face; 
 Read Love's commands with sacred awe, 
 Till heart and heart shall be made whole, 
 Till Love's Shekinah writes the law 
 Upon the marble of the soul. 
 Dorothy Dix, Dorothy Dix, 
 Rise up and thy blest sex incline 
 To love with love that knows no tricks, 
 A love both simple and divine; 
 Till home be "Home, sweet home," again — 
 A paradise of joy and mirth — 
 Till love in every cottage reign — 
 Till peace preside at every hearth. 
 Where Shall I End? 
 How sweet is the morning! 
 How golden the dawn! 
 The night is despairing, 
 The stars are forlorn, 
 The dear moon is weary, 
 And sinks in the west; 
 The star of the morning 
 Is shining his best. 
 The trees are awaking, 
 And humming today 
 A welcome of gladness — 
 A rapturous lay. 
 The lyrical brooklets 
 Are rhyming their themes, 
 And shout as they journey 
 To the mother of streams. 
 The birds are awaking. 
 The chickens do skip; 
 The old hen is clucking. 
 The biddies do chip, 
 While down in the bottom 
 The old whippoorwill 
 Is chanting the dirges 
 Of the evening still. 
 171 
 The old mule is braying 
 With head o'er the gate; 
 And mournfully praying, 
 Don't slumber too late. 
 The smoke is ascending, 
 And curling away. 
 And bearing to heaven 
 The prayers of the day. 
 The baby is rubbing 
 His eyelids of steel, 
 And whirling and whining 
 To break off the seal. 
 And mother is cooking. 
 And watching the sun; 
 And papa is waiting 
 Till breakfast is done. 
 And Johnny is whistling 
 A hymn or a reel. 
 And goading the mule with 
 The spur on his heel. 
 The plowman has started. 
 The furrow begun; 
 But where shall he end at 
 The setting of sun? 
 I look over the field, 
 Its broadness survey. 
 And tr}^ to determine 
 My task for the day; 
 I ponder and think as 
 Life's furrow I run, 
 Lord, where shall I end at 
 The setting of sun? 
 Beginning in brightness, 
 To end in the gloom; 
 Arising so cheerful, 
 To enter the tomb; 
 And starting so sprightly. 
 In joy or in fun; 
 But where shall I end at 
 The setting of sun ? 
 Pursuing and singing. 
 In silence to hush; 
 And hoping, and living, 
 In death's arms to rush; 
 And, toiling and gaining. 
 To lose what is won: 
 Lord, where shall I end at 
 The setting of sun ? 
 Now starting with plenty. 
 To leave off with naught; 
 Designing and scheming. 
 To spoil what is wrought: 
 Beginning with many, 
 To lie down alone; 
 Be heaven my end at 
 The setting of sun! 
 You're a 'Ool. 
 If you love him for his looks, 
 You're a 'ool; 
 Better bite a thousand hooks, 
 Like a 'ool; 
 Beauty's teeth are sharp and sly. 
 Though they only bite the eye, 
 If the bitten does not die, 
 I'm a 'ool. 
 He is handsome, sweet and fine, 
 Course, you 'ool; 
 That's the place to set your line 
 For a 'ool; 
 But when you get on his hook, 
 You will find a devilish crook; 
 Heart contrary to the look; 
 Too late, 'ool. 
 Oh, he'll give the presents now 
 To his 'ool; 
 Just to make you take the vow. 
 Like a 'ool; 
 After that you'll buy your own, 
 Pay him dearly for the loan; 
 He will sleep, but you work on. 
 Poor old 'ool! 
 Better choose a stack of rags, 
 Pretty 'ool; 
 One who works and never brags 
 Like a 'ool; 
 Works from morn to setting sun; 
 When his daily task is done, 
 Comes to kiss his darling one, 
 Wiser 'ool. 
 Let the social people talk, 
 'Bout you 'ool; 
 When their horses kick and balk. 
 Who's the 'ool ? 
 While yours climb the steepest hill. 
 Faithful, loving, gentle still; 
 Ah! your love he'll never spill. 
 Angel 'ool! 
 Choice of Love. 
 At last I've found the one I love, 
 Though long the precious hour delayed; 
 Though oft it seemed that faith would prove 
 Untrue, the more I bowed and prayed; 
 At last I've met her fond embrace; 
 I loved her ere I saw her face. 
 I had the picture in my mind — 
 There treasured as a sacred scroll; 
 'Twas not by skill or art designed, 
 But wrought by love deep in my soul; 
 That very look, that smile of grace — 
 I loved her ere I saw her face. 
 Though queens have passed me on life's way, 
 I let them go and walked alone; 
 I knew that there would come a day 
 When I would meet my darling one: 
 It came, and now I've won the race; 
 I loved her ere I saw her faice. . 
 Dame Fashion's charms could never move. 
 And social schemes could never bind; 
 And custom could not change that love 
 Where lived a picture in the mind; 
 We met in love's appointed place, 
 And, oh, how sweet was the embrace! 
 Amidst the thronging multitude, 
 I saw her smile, and strangely, though, 
 'Twas one my heart had often viewed, 
 And one my spirit seemed to know; 
 When eye met eye each spoke with grace; 
 'I loved thee ere I saw thy face." 
 Without the painful toil of art — 
 The magic touch of friendly aid — 
 We nearer drew; 'twas heart to heart 
 In love's eternal union made: 
 She drank my soul in with a smile, 
 And all the world was lost awhile. 
 'Twas just as natural as a song, 
 When sings the soul in rapture high: 
 There is no use of blushing long 
 When love is talking through your eye 
 Just give right up as lovers do, 
 And love will prove itself more true. 
 No use of talking of your worth. 
 Or what of learning you approve; 
 The only happiness on earth 
 Is just to wed the one you love; 
 The love is all the wealth you need. 
 He who is loved is rich, indeed. 
 'Tis not the face that makes the love, 
 Else some of us would hate like gall; 
 'Tis not the smile that we approve, 
 For some of us can't smile at all: 
 But something deep within, divine. 
 That says, "I'll give my heart for thine." 
 Should death divide, thy heart will crave 
 That presence, though you can't retain; 
 Your love will weep around that grave, 
 No matter how you court again; 
 And oft you'll say in that lone spot, 
 'T love thee, though I see thee not." 
 And heaven never was too high 
 For love to reach his ladder there. 
 And hope in that sweet "by-and-by," 
 To spend eternity with "Dear"; 
 Why, such a place just suits the eyes. 
 To walk with "Dear" in paradise. 
 It Is Grand to Be Old. 
 It is grand to be old. 
 Though weary and worn. 
 Though bending and bearing 
 Thy burdens, forlorn; 
 Though feeble and waning, 
 And sickly and frail, 
 With the scars of the fight, 
 And wounds of the past; 
 Still braving the tempest — 
 The thunder and hail; 
 Still trusting in spite of 
 The furious blast; 
 Still pressing your way to 
 The heavenly fold, 
 And younger in hope — it 
 Is grand to be old. 
 It is grand to be old. 
 Though furrowed thy brow. 
 Whose ditches were trended 
 By sorrow's steel plow; 
 Though dimmer thy vision, 
 And weaker thine eyes, 
 With the rose of thy cheek 
 Now faded and gone. 
 With the look of the young 
 And the cheer of the wise 
 Departed, while the skin 
 Still cleaves to the bone; 
 But brighter and brighter 
 Thine eyes can behold 
 The Canaan of love, and 
 The home of the old. 
l80  
 It is grand to be old, 
 Though withered the hand, 
 And though falter thy feet 
 To walk or to stand; 
 So weary of earth and 
 So sick of its charms, 
 Contemning its riches 
 And pleasures so vain; 
 Defying its conflicts — 
 Its empty alarms, 
 And hoping for heaven. 
 Where there is no pain: 
 Renewed and envigored, 
 Courageous and bold; 
 Still trusting in Jesus, 
 How grand to be old! 
 Appomattox. 
 Proud Appomattox! evermore 
 Thy peace we keep; 
 From North to South, from shore to shore, 
 Thy fruit we reap. 
 Thou, once the center of the world, 
 When Lee his tattered banner furled, 
 Whom fate oft favored, but it whirled 
 And pierced more deep. 
 Drooped, seraph-like, his pinions proud — 
 His fate to meet; 
 'Neath Glory's wreath his head was bowed 
 In sad defeat, 
 While near his fearless comrades stood 
 And ankle-deep in sweat and blood, 
 Defying still the fiery flood, 
 They wept retreat. 
 The fleecy tents were spread around, 
 So sad to view, 
 Like herded flocks upon the ground, 
 All wet with dew. 
 There 'neath an ancient apple tree 
 Stood gallant Grant and gallant Lee — 
 A sight the world was glad to see. 
 And heaven, too, 
 "Comrades! the war is over; halt!" 
 The general said; 
 "Though we have failed, 'tis not our fault. 
 Nor of the dead." 
 The crimson swords with edges keen, 
 They did in brazen scabbards screen; 
 Courageous still, they wept the scene, 
 With comfort fled. 
 "We've bravely faced the cannon's mouth. 
 Nor trembled there; 
1 82  
 To save the honor of the South, 
 Again we'd dare; 
 But courage must to wisdom yield 
 When things once hid are now revealed; 
 Come, comrades! let us quit the field- 
 And let us cheer! 
 "Back to our sad, deserted homes, 
 We now return; 
 As bravely face whatever comes, 
 Our fortunes earn; 
 Retracing where we fought and crept — 
 Where once we watched, and prayed, and slept; 
 With victory lost and virtue kept, 
 Why should we mourn? 
 "And since surrender is our lot, 
 We wisely then 
 Accept what time and fate have wrought 
 For braver men; 
 When fails the sword, the better way 
 Becomes the soldier's part to play; 
 The South will whip the North some day 
 With ink. and pen. 
 "Now, let the slave his freedom own 
 Like us, the white; 
 As noble in surrender known 
 As in the fight. 
 Let earth receive what heaven ordains • 
 Let Liberty untie their chains, 
 And God will soothe our wounds and pains — 
 Our wrong set right. 
 "Adieu, my comrades! I have done 
 My very best; 
 Though many from our ranks are gone 
 To that sweet rest; 
 For all we bear, some day on high. 
 The God of love will tell us why; 
 With duty done, I say good-bye! 
 Be heaven blest." 
 Marrying. 
 He who marries, marries double, 
 Marries women, marries trouble. 
 Marries weals and marries woes; 
 Only he who marries knows. 
 Marries sickness, marries health. 
 Marries want and marries wealth, 
 Marries pleasure, marries pain. 
 Marries slayer, marries slain, 
 Marries go and marries greet, 
 Marries bitter, marries sweet, 
 Marries love and marries hate, 
 Marries fortune, marries fate, 
 Marries worst and marries best, 
 Marries stranger, marries guest. 
 Marries high and marries low, 
 Marries friend and marries foe. 
 Marries right and marries wrong. 
 Marries sorrow, marries song. 
 Marries honey, marries gall, 
 Marries nothing, marries all. 
 Marries gold and marries dross, 
 Marries servant, marries boss. 
 Marries sting and marries balm. 
 Marries thunder, marries calm. 
 Marries falsehood, marries truth, 
 Marries age and marries youth. 
 Marries weakness, marries power. 
 Marries thorn and marries flower, 
 Marries fresh and marries taint, 
 Marries beauty, marries paint. 
 Marries reckless, marries rule, 
 Marries wise and marries fool. 
 Marries joy and marries grief. 
 Marries honest, marries thief, 
 Marries peace and marries strife, 
 Marries death and marries life, 
 Marries bad and marries well, 
 Marries heaven, marries hell; 
 Sternest verdict 'neath the sun, 
 Marry all or marry none! 
 The Prophet of the Plow (Washington). 
 Recumbent on Hope's couch he lies. 
 Serenely calm and still; 
 To dreamland sweet his spirit flies 
 O'er ocean, vale and hill. 
 With eagle speed his pinioned soul 
 Encircles and surveys 
 The South — the vast and wondrous whole 
 Appears before his gaze. 
 At first the giant wild is seen, 
 With here and there a place 
 Where massive woods stand up between 
 The sparsely tilled waste; 
 And there the thriftless toiler plods, 
 Nor gaining what is his; 
 He tramples on the golden clods. 
 And starves where plenty is. 
 Like hungry broods, his weeping race 
 Is crying loud for more, 
 While manna grows in every place. 
 E'en at the cabin door; 
1 86  
 While taller heads than theirs demand 
 For rent, what crumbs they find; 
 And leave them empty purse and hand — 
 The worst, an empty mind. 
 There Woe and Want stand grim and tall- 
 More dangerous than the rope; 
 One slays a few, the other all — 
 A helpless people's hope! 
 Like herded brute they're driven still, 
 While stronger chains confine; 
 They toil and faint, the earth to till, 
 And eat the husk of swine. 
 Hoar Winter falls and finds them bare, 
 With nothing to inspire; 
 A host of shivering children there 
 Sit freezing at the fire. 
 Nor safely sheltered from the storm, 
 While biting winds invade; 
 Diseases at the doorway swarm 
 And death will not be stayed. 
 The vision takes a brighter turn 
 (And 'tis a smile of God); 
 His people gathering to learn 
 The mysteries of the clod. 
 He, their forerunner, stands to plead, 
 And pave their pathway now; 
 From far they come, with joy they heed 
 The Prophet of the Plow. 
 He sees in every foot of earth 
 A lump of waiting gold; 
 For every stroke, a drop of mirth; 
 And thus he cries, "Behold! 
 The ready fields their harvests shed; 
 Go forth, and plenty find; 
 Prosperity's rich store is spread 
 Before my people blind!" 
 The forest felled, bright mansions start. 
 The cabin to supplant, 
 While thrifty hand weds honest heart. 
 And Plenty buries Want. 
 He cries, there's bread for every mouth- 
 For each a portion just; 
 And the salvation of the South 
 Is wrapped up in the dust. 
 Back to the plow now each returns, 
 And to the waiting sheaf; 
 While Hope her sacred candle burns 
 And labor brings relief. 
1 88  
 Vast fields on every side — how vast — 
 With profifered riches wait; 
 Go forth and reap, your sickles cast, 
 Nor grovel here too late. 
 Tuskegee like a molehill starts. 
 Then like a mountain stands; 
 The joy and pride of laboring hearts 
 Upreared by loving hands. 
 Proud sphinx and pyramid of mind 
 All former days excel; 
 Who enter in thy halls, though blind, 
 Shall not in darkness dwell. 
 Lo! the astonished nation views — 
 And marvels at the sight — 
 The prophet of contrasted hues, 
 Who leads his race to light. 
 And on his tiara they read 
 What ages could not find ■: 
 That curls upon the Negro's head 
 Can never chain his mind; 
 That blackness may be just as whole, 
 And just as pure and brave; 
 That color does not stain the soul. 
 Nor make the heart deprave. 
 A monument he rears above, 
 To all creation's view — 
 A monument of racial love, 
 Of faith and friendship, too. 
 Grief yields to song; made friends of foes, 
 While skill their hands employ; 
 And the sad tales of Negro woes 
 Are turned to shouts of joy. 
 Just then a rapid rustling broke 
 The sweet and pleasing spell; 
 An angel kissed him and he woke, 
 And made the vision real! 
 D.D. 
 I have no D. D. to my name, 
 For oftentime I scorn 'em; 
 It looks just like a faker's game, 
 A faker must have borne 'em. 
 I'd rather have my name or naught 
 Just as my mother gave it; 
 When honor can be cheaply bought, 
 'Tis better not to have it. 
 There's too much squirrel about you still, 
 All tail and little-headed; 
 You cannot be a man until 
 The public's praise is dreaded. 
 Why, would you be a holy sham — 
 A puffed and haughty brother ? 
 One D is quite enough to damn, 
 Why do you want another ? 
 Seek not with titles, friend, to bribe 
 The praise of silly donors; 
 Be virtuous, and men will ascribe 
 To you your rightful honors. 
 If still you think such is the best. 
 We'll have no fuss about 'em; 
 You take the D. D.'s and the rest, 
 I'll be a man without 'em. 
 New Orleans. 
 New Orleans! O New Orleans 
 I cannot love you, dear; 
 You have too many "skeeters" 
 To hollow in my ear, 
 I like your business manners. 
 Your "gumbo" is all right; 
 But your a la mosquitoes 
 Will make a fellow fight. 
 This is not a poet's parlor. 
 This is not the place to be; 
 Not a thought and not a dollar, 
 Not a happy day for me. 
 Baby in the bed is cryin'. 
 Wife is gruntin' loud and low; 
 Is my little darling dying? 
 Is the thought that haunts me so. 
 Flies are whinin' round my shoulder, 
 Junin', zunin', in my ear; 
 Mice are ever grov^rin' bolder, 
 Sailin' all around my chair. 
 Rooster, he is just a crowin', 
 Makin' all the fuss he can; 
 And the noisy wind is throwin' 
 Down the bucket, broom and pan. 
 Round and round my head a-ringin', 
 "Skeeters" flyin' all the time; 
 What on earth can he be singin' ? 
 Is he tryin' to make a rhyme ? 
 Keep me fannin', keep me fightin', 
 And I don't know what to do; 
 Every now and then he's bitin'. 
 Almost knock my head in two. 
 191 
 Bending pensively and pennin' 
 Every thought that I can find; 
 But the "skeeters" keep me sinnin', 
 And I'm tryin' to keep my mind. 
 Take the street and start to talkin', 
 People lookin' down m}^ mouth; 
 In the mud and ditches walkin', 
 Toughest place in all the South! 
 Beneath a Smile. 
 Beneath the smile which cheers us so 
 There often beats a heart of woe — 
 A heart made sad 
 By all the strife, and woe, and pain, 
 That make the heart their battle plain, 
 And in the bosom war and reign. 
 Though we seem glad. 
 Beneath the smile of those who vowed 
 To cheer each other through the cloud 
 Of life's dark day. 
 There often reigns within a gloom 
 As dreadful as that last sad doom, 
 When each lies quiet in the tomb — 
 The parent clay. 
 Beneath the smile of lovers, sweet, 
 There broods the thought of what defeat 
 May come at last, 
 When love in all his triumphs, bold. 
 Reigns in his youth and then grows old; 
 Ah! what will be the story told. 
 When life is past ? 
 Beneath the smile of mother dear. 
 While gazing on her angel here — 
 Her darling thing; 
 She muses, what will here below 
 Befall her child; what weal or woe ? 
 And what on him will death bestow — 
 A crown, or sting? 
 Beneath the smile we give to those 
 Whose woes we often make our woes — 
 An equal part — 
 We bear the burdens by them borne, 
 And oft we smile when most forlorn; 
 While deep beneath that smile there mourn 
 An aching heart. 
i94  
 The Heart of Woman. 
 There is a nest deep in her breast, 
 With many a jewel in it; 
 The boys, with pain, have tried in vain, 
 And all have failed to win it. 
 The sportsman tried with all his pride 
 To win the blessed treasure; 
 Though very gay he dressed each day, 
 She would not yield to pleasure. 
 The faker came and tried his game 
 Of soft and sweetest talking, 
 Until, though late, he saw his fate 
 Was only words and walking. 
 The millionaire, with look austere. 
 And manners high and haughty. 
 Thus did advance to take a chance, 
 But glittering wealth was naughty. 
 And then, there came a man of fame — 
 Of culture and of splendor; 
 Though nice he spoke of art and book, 
 But none of these could win her. 
 The parson kind, with pious mind. 
 And coat of awful measure, 
 Came up and tried, and almost cried 
 To lose the blessed treasure. 
 And after all, a workman tall, 
 A brave, true-hearted yeoman, 
 With simple look his love he spoke, 
 And won the heart of woman. 
 Why is it true that none of you 
 Could win the precious jewel; 
 Or was it that you tipped your hat, 
 And were a little cruel ? 
 Or did she crave a workman brave — 
 A man so meek and humble ? 
 Or did she think that we would drink. 
 And yell, and roll, and tumble? 
 Nay! she admired what Love desired. 
 Not simply the meek yeoman; 
 But Loving Heart to take the part 
 Of loving-hearted Woman! 
 The Last Sweet Word. 
 For years that sad, sweet day of yore 
 I've oft deplored; 
 Yet, cannot tell how many more 
 May come, O Lord! 
 But mid the storm and clash of all. 
 Mid pleasures sweet, and sorrow's gall; 
 And, sadly though, I still recall 
 The last sweet word. 
 The world is changed and life grows new 
 As years roll by; 
 Though things present another view 
 Unto mine eye, 
 Midst rising sentiment and song, 
 Midst all the shouting, toiling throng; 
 I still recall, though e'er so long, 
 The last sweet word. 
 'Twas uttered on the dying bed 
 By one I love; 
 Though long since up to heaven fled — 
 To live above; 
 Though fate or fortune me befall, 
 Though peace may bless, or strife appall, 
 This is at last the best of all. 
 The last sweet word. 
 'Twas spoken as I made a vow. 
 With hand in mine; 
 While death-dews stained the radiant brow. 
 Which looked divine. 
 And while one breathed a parting sigh. 
 Still pointing upward to the sky. 
 Then whispered low to me, "Good-By!" 
 The last sweet word. 
 I oft recall it when alone. 
 With heavy heart; 
 And say, we'll meet around the throne, 
 No more to part; 
 And often, too, I seem to hear 
 A whisper saying to mine ear, 
 You promised long to meet me, dear. 
 How sweet the word! 
 To the Bachelor. 
 Go wed a wife, nor longer wait, 
 It may be well; 
 Go wed thy fortune, or thy fate — 
 Thy heaven or hell; 
 Perhaps a demon full of strife. 
 Perhaps an angel for a wife 
 May be your weal or woe in life; 
 Lord, who can tell ? 
 In hope to win the best, advance. 
 Nor dread the gloom; 
 All life is but a certain chance 
 'Twixt doom and doom; 
 A poltroon he who "baches" here, 
 And spurns the burden he should bear; 
 He dies, unworthy of a tear. 
 E'en of a tomb. 
 Life's better joys are never known, 
 Till love you know; 
 Two loving hearts together grown 
 Make heaven below; 
 If some true heart be joined to thine, 
 Though sorrows come, still love will shine; 
 Life joined to love becomes divine, 
 Without it, woe! 
 You love no one ? How sad thy life! 
 How poor a rule! 
 If you can love, why not a wife? — 
 Love's living pool! 
 The hawk loves hawk, and dove loves dove, 
 Quail goes with quail, e'en buzzards love; 
 Are you of all beneath, above, 
 The single fool? 
 My Dove. 
 My Dove, you've caused my heart to bleed. 
 And sadly sit and cry. 
 When there was none my groans to heed. 
 And none to satisfy; 
 That thOu should from my bosom turn. 
 And all my heart's affections spurn, 
 That worst of fates that I might learn, 
 I often wonder, Why? 
 The golden morning of our love 
 Is now a gloomy sky; 
 Why did you stretch your wings, my Dove, 
 So far away to fly ? 
 How did your heart consent to leave 
 Me all alone to sit and grieve, 
 With none my spirit to relieve? 
 Will you not tell me why? 
 Bereft of life's most dearest friend 
 Save that Dear One on high; 
 I often wish that death would end 
 My grief, and let me die; 
 I'd gladly feel his fiery sting. 
 And all the pains that death can bring, 
 To soar away to Christ, my King, 
 That He might tell me why? 
 Joined to a fate of woe and love, 
 I only sing and sigh; 
 Perhaps I'll find relief, my Dove, 
 In that sweet by-and-by; 
 Since silence seals the answer here, 
 I must submit, my fate to bear; 
 But over there, my Dove, my Dear, 
 I'll never ask you why ? 
 The Vassals of the Bar. 
 Are these not brothers of mankind, 
 Who toil in striped shame ? 
 And have they not a soul and mind? 
 Or only men in name ? 
 Though they are weak and born to fate, 
 Should we less godly prove? 
 Have we the charity to hate, 
 And not a heart to love ? 
 What hope have they of better things ? 
 What hope of heaven high. 
 When human law to mortal brings 
 A human hell so nigh? 
 In social shame your whites and blacks 
 Do clean your dirty street; 
 A world of woe upon their backs, 
 And shackles on their feet. 
 E'en at your governor's mansion door. 
 These felons toil for you; 
 Though they have sinned, why crush the poor? 
 Are we not sinners too ? 
 Though sinners rich from windows stare 
 Upon their chums in chains; 
 They pay their fines, and them you clear, 
 But not from moral stains. 
 And were these free, you'd hardly pay 
 One nickel for their time; 
 And now you work them all the day, 
 And still grow rich on crime. 
 Your bulls and beeves are pastured far. 
 Your mules are fed and groomed; 
 But these poor vassals of your bar 
 To public shame are doomed. 
 E'en the old swine with filthy share 
 Is kept in backyards well; 
 While men the public's contempt bear, 
 The worse — a public hell! 
 They clean your streets, the dirt you pile 
 On souls, you crush and jam; 
 What you should purge, you make more vile, 
 What you should bless, you damn! 
 You kill their sense of moral shame. 
 And make them more deprave: 
 Your guards, who watch their human game. 
 Should they not seek to save? 
 Ah! is it not enough to toil. 
 From every pleasure torn — 
 From mother, home, and freedom's spoil. 
 To wamble, weep and mourn ? 
 Those boys in stripes have seen, I know. 
 Than these much better things: 
 Yet they may rise, though now so low, 
 And be your future kings. 
 Has Charity no secret place 
 Her wretches to conceal. 
 And let these creatures of disgrace 
 Enjoy a moment's weal ? 
 Thou hast a son, and canst not say 
 What fate your child may meet; 
 Yet he may wear the chains some day, 
 And sweep some dirty street! 
 Be this ascribed, while law approves. 
 Not to your nobler aim. 
 Not to your honor nor your love; 
 But South Carolina's shame! 
 The Station. 
 Man will rise in his ambition. 
 Rend the rocks and mofuntains here, 
 Raise the devil and sedition, 
 Till he gains his natural pier. 
 Then in thankful contemplation, 
 With his tears and toils forgot, 
 He will occupy his station. 
 And is happy with his lot. 
 Politician is no preacher, 
 Village parson is no pope; 
 Each contented as a teacher, 
 This is all of life they hope. 
 What's the people's condemnation, 
 If they make no higher shot? 
 Each is measured for his station, 
 And is happy with his lot. 
 Cannon cannot hit a sparrow. 
 Yet the marksman is no fool; 
 But the boy who aims the arrow 
 Is the master of his school. 
 But when fighting for his nation, 
 Then the gunner hits the spot; 
 Each is measured for his station, 
 And is happy with his lot. 
 Some are made to coin the dollar, 
 Some to reap them from the row; 
 Some to sit up in the parlor. 
 Some to wrestle with the hoe. 
 Some to rob their own relation. 
 Some to give with meekest grace; 
 Each is measured for his station. 
 And is happy in his place. 
 Some are made to cheer the people, 
 Some to mourn, with banner furled; 
 Some to climb the highest steeple, 
 Show their faults to all the world. 
 Such is life in all creation, 
 But the man with faith in heart 
 Is best fitted for his station, 
 And is happiest with his part. 
 One should never blame another 
 For his humble station here; 
 We should love and help a brother 
 When the conflict grows severe. 
 Strive to reach your destination, 
 Never stop until you do; 
 Do not take your brother's station, 
 It will be no good to you. 
 This is not a caricature. 
 Still, it should not us alarm; 
 'Tis divinest human nature 
 To be faithful and be calm. 
 With the boon of full salvation, 
 With the ills of life forgot, 
 And with heaven my last station, 
 I'll be happy with my lot. 
 Wonders of Love. 
 Part I. 
 Love is the chief glory of the universe; 
 The supernal Life; the saccharine sweetly 
 Flowing of the Nature called Divine; the 
 Sovereign attribute, the Soul — the grand 
 Immortal Ego of rarest majesties — 
 The universal Soul of Deity; 
 The gist of Goodness, holy and unborn, 
 Nor yet inherited; the God-Life's high 
 Quintessence, inherent and intrinsic! 
 He is the centripetal of all souls — 
 All worlds; and about His holy footstool 
 All suns revolve, all moons blush, pale and bow. 
 All stars shimmer and sing eternally. 
 He is the bright and fair celestial Flame — 
 The everlasting Noon — the blest and sweet 
 Eternal Day; from whose unapproachable 
 Zenith He pours majestic floods on all, 
 The universal ocean fills. With Thee, 
 Thou universal Throb, Thou universal 
 Life, ten million suns, refulgent, bright, like 
 One great orb from one immortal center 
 Burning, are but a spark compared! Were all 
 The seas, eternal and terrestrial. 
 Poured into one, 'twere only a drop. 
 O Love! O Love! with thine no depth compares.- 
 No height a similitude suggests, and 
 No fullness can portray to finite mind 
 The faintest thought of Thy incomputable 
 Immensity! Only to Thyself, and 
 To Thyself alone, art Thou fully known. 
 Falls, falls each being — seraph, spirit, or 
 Man — to an inferior scale. Nor can 
 Their blended forms, and strengths, and wings ascend 
 The wondrous height — Thy most sacred dwelling- 
 Place — Eternity's Sanctum Sanctorum! 
 Love is omnipresent, gracious and good. 
 All powerful, glorious, wondrous, kind; 
 And His divinest expression is life. 
 All natures draw the essence of their souls, 
 The life of their spirits, the acumen 
 Of their genius, from this celestial Spring. 
 Particles, ignescent and invisible — 
 Transforming themselves into living beings — 
 Angels, spirits, men — beings on Love's pure 
 Fires fed, armed with power and winged with light, are 
 Ever flying from this divine matrix. 
 They go like busy bees with honey and 
 Song, and group themselves in blissful spheres 
 To their sweet natures suited, and call their 
 New location heaven. Their hands no crimson 
 Scythes or thirsty weapons helve; nor do their 
 Lips embrace the brazen trump to stir with 
 Dreadful blast their comrades for the strife. Their 
 Feet tread joyfully the thornless maze and 
 Stride the mountain's even sides with spirit 
 Pace, while golden lutes and silver lyres — born 
 Instruments of praise — engage their native 
 Powers. Over hills eternal their sweet 
 Voices rise in holy anthems unto Love. 
 But the highest note, the most tremendous 
 Lay that heaven's immortal choirs can hurl, 
 Falls far short of a common expression 
 Of that Glory of glories. It murmurs 
 Like the shallow wave upon the nether 
 Shore, while all the great, profounder deep lies 
 Undisturbed. Here at His shrine the hoary 
 Head may ponder long in pensive silence 
 And shed its frosty glory all in vain 
 To vie the high honors of His footstool. 
 And even in the hope of this embrace, 
 The aspiring youth must find his greatest 
 Strength in a keener sense of his weakness. 
 For where approaching cherubim kneel with 
 Shining pinions dropped, with wiser heads made 
 Bare, with guiltless faces veiled, and shrink in 
 Adoring unworthiness to kiss His 
 Hallowed feet, there men must faint and die! 
 Love's coruscant breath is life's divinest 
 Spark. Who this inhales must never think of 
 Death. Cool though at times the flame to us may 
 Seem, and thoughtless men would oft declare it 
 Dead; but still the living germ is there, and 
 Still imperishable. Dies never the soul 
 That lives to love; nor faints the heart, nor fail 
 The wings that feel the heavenly thrill. Its 
 Wounds are healed in hopeful flight; its ills are 
 Lost in song. Its reproductive powers 
 Are irresistible; its movement is 
 Orbicular — revolving as it moves, 
 Moving ever onward and upward as 
 It revolves — reaching out for higher and 
 Sublimer heights, tending to its heavenly 
 Center, In its retrocessive flight it 
 Produces other selves, other souls and 
 Loves, until myriads of happy creatures 
 Are born; then it leads the shouting choir of 
 Its own progeny singing back to God. 
 Beings are always being made; the act 
 Of creation is eternal. Love spends 
 No idle time in aimless supinity. 
 But He is ever improving upon 
 His divine stock and adding to His fold. 
 With every breath another world to bright 
 Existence springs and joins the sisterhood 
 Of worlds. Space, illimitable Space, must 
 Yet contain billions of burning spheres, and 
 The glorious consummation of all 
 Progressive eons shall finally make 
 An indivisible domain of the 
 Multifarious whole. He labors not 
 Avariciously; not with the miser's 
 Niggard aim, nor the long-eyed tyrant's thirst. 
 God would have all His children share with Him 
 The glory and power of His dominion. 
 Though at the Universe's helm, 
 He steers eternally there; 
 A throne, a diadem, a realm. 
 Await each royal heir! 
 And why wrought Paternal Love nature's vast 
 Fabric so, but that His sons might reign over 
 All the broad and pleasant region where naught 
 Might interrupt their joys, obstruct their lay, 
 Or stay the rapture of their better hours ? 
 Would He not have His earthly children to 
 Congregate and sing like the harmonious 
 Hosts of heaven; to cluster without a 
 Clash, to sing without a sigh, to greet without 
 Grief, and to smile without frowning; with 
 All the earth as smooth, and calm, and sweet as 
 A cloudless sky at summer eve; with every 
 Soul a shining star, and every star a 
 Lover; with warfare never known and its 
 Vile art untaught; nor yet to shrink a pain, 
 Or foe, or dreaded task; nor ever feel the 
 Fiery sting of Death's ignited arrows? 
 Would He not have our sad surroundings here 
 Clothed in soothing light and carpeted with 
2IO  
 Fadeless green, while Nature's hand direct the 
 Woven vine, touch the honeyed bud till 
 All its petals smile; garland all the rocks 
 And hills in mossy majesty — clothe the 
 Forest in grandeur of green — embroider 
 The bosom of the maiden plain with roses 
 Of rarest beauty, while Life, Light and Love — 
 Heaven's earthly trinity — hold sway over 
 Tranquil land and quiescent sea and isle? 
 Lf thou wouldst know the loving kindness of 
 Thy God, mark well thy own creation. See 
 What was wrought and for whose sake arose this 
 Stupendous temple here; though now so wrecked. 
 Defiled and torn, 'twas better made when first 
 Designed for thee, and shall be reconstructed. 
 Come, walk with me along those ancient shores 
 Where nothing was until the earth was made. 
 Venerable Shade! Imperial Gloom! 
 Thy voiceless vacuum I now traverse. 
 Majestic Night, monarchial Darkness, yield! 
 Unbar thy doors of adamant, nor let thy 
 Inky arches frown and bid me stay. Thou 
 Proud dominion of old Nocturnity, 
 Thy darkness is not of such that one might 
 Fear to roam thy realms alone; but safely 
 Screened from every eye save that which seeth 
 All, one feels the security of the babe 
 Who buries its face in mother's gentle 
 Breast, contemning outer fate. No paths are 
 Found, nor voices heard, nor anthems smite the 
 Ear. No hurried shrieks with terror pierce, nor 
 Frightful images surround. No ghastly 
 Visages, nor growling brutes, nor croaking fiends 
 Are met with here. Here night is divine 
 And beautiful. The darkest shades are 
 Balmy, cool and sweet, worthy of the fond 
 Embrace of a lover. God's sable robe 
 Of silk! And here, guided only by the 
 Senses of the soul and viewing all by 
 Faith, one walks more safely than in regions 
 Invaded by the swift-feet warriors of 
 Light. Here life is death, and death a blissful 
 Sleep. For never have angels' salient wing 
 O'erleaped thy walls nor pierced thy shade. 
 Mysterious Night! thou womb of ancient worlds, 
 Lo! near thy door a sovereign footstep treads — 
 A sovereign voice commands, "Fly wide!" Behold! 
 Jehovah comes down from the throne, and down 
 The shining way! Ah! what a sight! over 
 Vast Elysium's blissful realms, transporting, 
 Glorious, grand (as thickly meshed as rushes 
 In the prairie marsh), bright angels stand with 
 Interlacing wings upheld and arching 
 Every brow. Well might they screen their faces 
 And shield the tearless stare which His 
 Transplendent glory dazes. They view Him now — 
 Jehovah passing — descending to the 
 Deep! Like us, their sweetest lays, their highest 
 Notes of praise, are sung in silent awe. Times 
 There beseem when thought, although no sound is 
 heard. 
 Speaks louder than the seven thunders' voice. 
 'TIS when the tongue and harp despair to warble 
 Hallowed lays — when walketh the soul alone 
 With God. The rustling of whose sacred robe 
 Is more than song can breathe. And anthems sung 
 By thought are sweeter still. 'Tis not the sound 
 That singeth, but the soul. Thus sing the hosts. 
 Drawn from His sovereign girth, a thousand 
 Golden keys strung on a golden chain, the 
 Great Jehovah now unlocks the awful 
 Doors of Night. Over the black precipice 
 Of granite shade, down umbrous stairs and dark 
 Meanderings in kingly contemplation 
 He winds His way. Impregnant Gloom with Love 
 In holy parturiency are met in 
 Pan's nigrescent chamber, and from the womb 
 Of black Nonentity He calls an infant 
 World. Now cradled in the embracing lap 
 Of Love, young Nature see! and ah! behold. 
 How shapeless, inane, void! Alone He moves. 
 While embosomed in all the gemless majesty of 
 Primal Night, whose solemn shades hold over all 
 Quiescent sway, and listening gloom in 
 Sable pomp kneels reverently around. 
 Yet, not a voice is heard, nor rustling of 
 Cherubic wing disturb the calm, nor tongues 
 Of fire, nor lips of burning loves, nor harps 
 That live, breathe forth a sacred sound 
 Of high empyrean song. No clarion 
 Voices clatter here or hum emollient 
 Echoes. No shining heaps of enraptured 
 Worshipers, nor tinkling crowns of pure 
 Celestial grandeur enshrine His feet. 
 No champing steed with fiery mane, lightning 
 Feet and thundering breath with chariot waits. 
 Alone He walks in keeping with His 
 Love's commandings, in holy, omniscient 
 Anticipation of that time when a 
 Newly-fashioned world and a newborn 
 Child of love shall sing at His paternal 
 Shrine. As with magic stroke. He moves His hand 
 While willing darkness yields, and the ancient 
 Bulwarks of adamantine blackness He 
 Levels low. Spacious enough creation's 
 Bounds are spread, and in the swarthy robe of 
 Blushing Shade He enfolds infant Nature. 
 Perhaps fresh from the great Designer's palm; 
 Perhaps long since conceived and just brought forth, 
 A higher mission to pursue; perhaps 
 A hoary world with all its former forces 
 Spent — recast in the universal mold — 
 Rewrought for nobler and sublimer flights. 
 A deep, calm mist, impenetrable and 
 Dark, encloses around. The far-seeing 
 Sister spheres cast down a solemn, smiling 
 Stare, and wait with ready lips, with halted 
 Approbation to kiss the darling thing. 
 Now panting for its infant breath, or lifted 
 From its tomb — a reviving corpse — or a 
 Skeleton of some old world, it yields to 
 The Creator's touch, a flexible ball. 
 Well threaded upon unvarying laws. 
 Well fashioned, too, He swings out upon 
 The electric hinges of universal 
 Fraternity, and tunes her harp to the 
 Music of ancient spheres. Silent be 
 The tongue that would depict the rapture of the 
 Young world in maiden flight! Now for the first 
 Time its globule form revolves, while gladness 
 Thrills the frame. The plastic fingers of Love 
 Fashion the hills, form the shoulder of 
 Monarchial peaks and set them on their throne. 
 He smooths the plain and breathes upon the dust, 
 While silver, gold and diamonds sparkle. He 
 Scoops out the spacious gulf of all the seas, 
 And marks the crooked trend of a thousand streams 
 And rivaling rivers to their great deeps — 
 Insatiable. Down roll the mighty floods. 
 Hoar-headed Ararat and sovereign Sinai, 
 Majestic Horeb, pardoning Calvary, 
 Are fashioned now, and well suited for a 
 Purpose. On them the Ark, the Bush, the Law, 
 And the dying Lamb appear before Him. 
 All times arise, and events now unborn 
 Approach His gracious shrine. All triumphs and 
 Tragedies and fiercely fought conflicts mail 
 Their bloody records to Him now. On each 
 He writes His love's design, and squares the whole. 
 The voices of the years, the anthems of 
 The ages — commingling song and sighing — 
 The shouts of joy, the groans of grief, and the 
 Sad wails of intoxicating despair, 
 Appeal to Him now. Love answers all and 
 Mercy makes reply. Sunshine and shadows 
 Cast their changing scenes with curtains drawn, while 
 Weeping nations from the cradle creep and 
 Departing pale and speechless. Kingdoms each 
 Moment rise, and in a moment fall. Vast 
 Empires heave and spread themselves like 
 Overflowing seas, and sink in lasting ruins. 
 What battles rage! How conquerors win! and Oh! 
 How soonly too, they fail! Proud kings ascend 
 And sit on haughty thrones, then nod to Fate. 
 The warrior's thrilling whoop, the victor's 
 Lay, the woeful shriek of wounded defeat, 
 The widow's pitiful wail, the orphan's 
 Mournful cry; with all singing or sighing, 
 Cursing or crying, living or dying — 
 All! all! all! now approach His sovereign ear! 
 He sees the need of all the progeny 
2l6  
 Of man, and makes a greater provision. 
 To every effort a rich premium is 
 Set; an answer for every prayer is sent. 
 Mercy proceeds ere the petitioner 
 Is born; provides ere the want is feh, and 
 The blessing is at hand ere the knee-print 
 Is cold, but only discovered by faith. 
 Forth called, the conscious floods come rushing 
 Up, and, at His beckon, go shouting to 
 Their places. Now first dame Nature murm.urs 
 Low, but with a glad and swelling heart, the 
 Mysterious sonant of the seas. Loudly 
 Roars the clamorous flood, and yet 'tis dark. 
 But louder still a sovereign voice commands, 
 "Let there be light." Lo! fair Morning throws her 
 Portals wide — her shining gates ajar, and 
 Ah! how sweet, how soothing, how golden is 
 The Dawn! How soon swift- footed night departs! 
 The sapphire sheet — the firmamental scroll 
 With engaging loveliness unfolds above. 
 Long wedded seas divide. Now come the clouds. 
 Like fleecy caravans refreshed, and 
 Entering on their pilgrimage of long 
 And stormy ages, with oceans of Nature's 
 Milk and wine to soothe the thirst of all her 
 Crying broods. Now from the listening clod, 
 Florific and frugiferous, a thousand 
 Stately forests and fields in verdant mantles 
 Clad. Eolus' harp is strung; let nature 
 Sing! Well garbed in his selected dress, 
 Majestic in splendor, grandly attired. 
 Magnificently radiant, and with 
 All the charming beauty of fair Venus, 
 And, like Narcissus, shall behold his tall 
 And burning likeness reflected from the deep — 
 The King of Day ascends his fiery throne! 
 Less brilliant, but none the less illustrious. 
 The gentle bride, the weeping queen, the sweet 
 And loving moon, with silvery tresses. 
 Comes. Close at her side the singing sisters 
 Of the night, and less pretentious, too. They 
 Bathe the earth in all their light, baptizing 
 Nature in the glorious floods; and all is 
 Pleasant, sweet and congenial now. 
 The careering sun, the blushing moon, the 
 Happy stars, the trooping clouds, the whirling- 
 Winds, the laughing waves, the nodding trees, the 
 Caressing flowers, the pondering beasts, 
 The pensive rocks and the engaging plains, 
 With all else here combined, are messengers 
 Of love to man, and worshipers of God: 
 Expressing in themselves the will and affection 
 Of the Creator, but none His holy 
 Image bears. Deeply engraven upon 
 The soul of Nature is the infallible 
 Law of Love. This all may read; all must its 
2l8  
 Mandates heed, or perish by the strong weapon 
 Of irresistible Fate. What a sweet 
 Paradise of love! Here all varieties 
 Harmonize, all diversities blend; all 
 Tongues, all languages, all voices 
 Sweetly join in one universal chorus — 
 One universal theme — Love! Love! Love! 
 Part H. 
 Love calls his parliament in heaven. The 
 Trinity assembles. Divinity 
 Meets Divinity. God confers with God. 
 The divine Cabinet is in session! 
 A glorious cloud — snowy, fleecy, white — a 
 Bleached, an alabaster wall of milky 
 Majesty — encloses around. From there 
 Oceans of silver floods, all the heavens 
 Filling, in all directions flowing, now 
 Proceed. Ye covering cherubs, stand back; 
 Recline your holy wing; keep silent if 
 You can; cry, "Holy! holy!" if you must, 
 But sink in speechless awe again. And ye 
 Seraphic legions — six-winged heralds 
 Of God — halt aloof; wait on your middle 
 Pinion; your holy feet and faces veil 
 With equal unworthiness. And if your 
 Burning bosoms swell, suppress your joys: should 
 They with rapture high o'errun, let burst a 
 Glorious "halleluiah," and say no more. 
 Let heavenly stateliness prevail in 
 Solemn pomp around, and quiescent grandeur 
 Hold a sacred guard. All ye bright hierarchy, 
 Tall, swift messengers of Love, stay your flight. 
 Nor dare approach the Throne; your longer wing 
 Of power set, with lightning readiness 
 Halt till God commands; then sweep from world to 
 World, and Him obey. Gabriel, take up thy 
 Trump, hold high in hand and backward lean with 
 Ember lips set to embrace, and with the 
 Voice of twice a thousand thunders to tell 
 Unto the ears of listening worlds the first 
 Whisper of the Celestial Court. Michael, 
 Thy flaming blade unsheath, whet well upon 
 The marble of some burning sphere; and in the 
 Fist of vengeance boldly drawn — amply keen 
 To pierce the soul of adamantine spirit — 
 Stand still and wait for swiftest execution. 
 O Heaven! O Heaven! a moment's pause, 
 A pensive stillness, an adoring stoop 
 Is more becoming now than all thy praise. 
 Hush! hush! the lyrical hum of all thy harps 
 Of gold. Innumerable hosts! 
 Arrayed in all your holy files, your 
 Pinions still; await the proclamation! 
 What wonders will be wrought! And ah! 
 What will Almighty Love perform — what will 
 Jehovah do, and what the issue be! 
 My little soul, put on thy humbler wings — 
 Faith's lucid pinions — and soar away to 
 Heaven, forgetting thy sad surroundings 
 Here, and viewing the Throne, as the eagle 
 Eyes the blazing noon, draw near, let down thy 
 Wings and kneel. This thy petition be: "O 
 God! O God! Father of love! me, a wretch, 
 Forgive; a rebel reconcile. And may a 
 Mortal worm surmise the wonders of his 
 Own creation ?" And now, my soul, approach 
 The outer door of the High Court of Love, 
 Nor nearer dare, and hear the contemplation: 
 "All is good, and very good. Let us make 
 Man in our image, after our likeness: 
 And let them have dominion." And thus the 
 Responding attributes of all Thy Nature, 
 Lord, reply: 
 Love: 
 "1, the living germ, life's brilliant spark, divine 
 Vitality, Love's spirit frame, finite. 
 Yet deiform, bestow on thee. Be thine 
 Ever to live and love; thy dwelling be 
 With God; if otherwise, let thy abode 
 Be darkness, and thy surroundings hateful." 
 Omnipotence: 
 'T give the will — unconquerable and 
 Strong. Be this thy seat of power, thy strength 
 To do, to enforce, to execute what 
 God permits. No powers in heaven, earth or 
 Hell shall thee subdue but love. Obey, and 
 Thyself preserve; rebel, thyself destroy." 
 Omnipresence: 
 "I donate the Conscience, and thou shalt be — 
 Be with thyself and with thy God and be 
 Social being. I keep thy peace, when danger 
 Nears I warn; I, the sheriff of God, the 
 Accuser of transgressors, the voice that 
 Cries to all eternity, shall arrest thee, 
 And hold thee strong in chains of love; nor shall 
 Thy flight for refuge bring thee gain; nor shall 
 The darker shades of night conceal thee from 
 My view; nor thunders hush my voice. I judge 
 Thy deeds according to His love. If I 
 Defend, though all condemn, be happy still. 
 If I condemn, though all commend with all 
 Thy doing hid, be thou a miserable worm!" 
 Immutability: 
 "Change thy ways, thy walks, thy words, thy mind and 
 Heart — thy station change; but change thy being 
 Never. I set thee in thy orb — the dear 
 Bosom of God — a statellite divine. 
 Thou mayst remain where now thou art, or sink 
 To death and the dark, still, still a being be." 
 Eternity: 
 "Live ever; die never. If with thy God 
 Thy lot be cast, be ever blest and glorious 
 Thy years; be else ever damned and dying." 
 Spirituality: 
 "1 ordain thee unto immortality. 
 Ever breathe, and breathing, let the music 
 Of thy breath be an eternal song. But 
 A little lower than the angels be 
 The glory of thy being. Go forth unchained, 
 Untrammeled, free; and none shall bar thy 
 Entrance at any door but God. Him, Him obey 
 And ever be a happy son; be thou 
 Otherwise an outcast orphan spirit." 
 Unity: 
 "With the fetters of divine love I chain 
 Thee to the throne of God — thy immovable 
 Anchor, and thy heart to all thy fellows. 
 Its elastic links shall permit thee a ' 
 Wide and glorious range. Thus ever bound, 
 Be ever safe; one severed link lets drop 
 To dark eternal ruin — a lost wretch." 
 Omniscience: 
 "1 give Cognition — a pure primordial 
 Germ. I Reason's holy temple build, and 
 Rear his intellectual towers, and 
 Set his altars up, and place the vessels 
 There. Genius is thy archangel, thy prophet, 
 Thy forerunner, and he shall mark as God 
 Directs the course of pilgrim Thought through all thy 
 Wandering. Imagination shall be 
 Thy wing to bear thee safely over chasms 
 Yet unspanned; on it thou mayst traverse 
 All space, and journey long in other worlds. 
 Be prudent now, thy golden vessels fill; 
 Be brute-like, otherwise — a mortal fool." 
 Wisdom: 
 "1 ignite the sentient flame. Intelligence. 
 Have light in thee — the palace of thy soul — 
 And in thy altars ever burn the golden 
 Candlestick. This castle shall be thy mart 
 Of mind, and thy moral exchange. Trade thou 
 Wisely then, and richer grow. Lay well in 
 Store against the eternal winters. Deal 
 Often with thy God; engage celestial 
 Caravans — angelic merchants — to bring 
 Thy merchandise from afar — Love's purest 
 Gold covet. Seek other than His love to 
 Enrich thee, and the worms of sin shall eat 
 Into thy heart and spoil thy store. Thus done. 
 Black vaporous Night shall shroud thee in the 
 Tattered robe of hell, with Death thy bed-guest." 
 Holiness: 
 "Rectitude! rectitude! be this the posture 
 Of a being toward his God, his fellow 
 And the brute. Thy head with righteousness 
 I crown; thy mind with meekness set; thy tongue 
 I touch with Love's holy live-coal; thy form 
 With purity I clothe; thy feet with virtue 
 Shod. Stand up, and be thou holy like thy God." 
 Truth: 
 "Divine reality I give; and be 
 It the case — the fact. Thou art a being 
 Now and God will ever own thee. Exist, 
 And nothing shall annihilate. Be thou 
 The truth in thyself, in relation to 
 All mind, matter, spirit; and to time and 
 All eternity. Think, speak, act, live, love, 
 Believe, receive and defend the truth — the 
 Essence of thy nature. Truth be thy priest — 
 The trumpeter of thy praise — the guardian 
 Of thy life — the fortress of thy love. 
 O'er all thy devotion he shall preside. 
 And present thine offerings to the Throne. 
 He shall dwell in Memory's holy place and 
 Keep the sacred archives. And whether to 
 The judgment bar of thine own soul, or to 
 Thy neighbor's, or thy God's, thou art brought, 
 He shall bear the records beneath his arm, 
 And testify of thee through time and all 
 Eternity. Forsake it once and thy 
 God shall be forgotten, Heaven swept from 
 V^iew, Love's light withdrawn; and with witch-like 
 arms 
 Hell shall hug thee to her sickly embrace, 
 Whose horny-headed crew shall gore thee mad." 
 Justice: 
 "I endow thee with judgment. Thou shalt have 
 Power to decide, enact, legislate. 
 Adjudicate, organize and govern. 
 Reason shall dictate the proceedings of 
 Thy court. Love shall be thy highest law, thy 
 Sovereign rule in equity. Mete, and 
 It shall be measured back to thee; judge. 
 As thou judgest, thou shalt so be judged. And 
 Then report thyself before God's bar." 
 Mercy: 
 "I, Love's only daughter — the Darling 
 Attribute, do breathe in thee compassion, 
 The softest, sweetest and divinest kiss 
 Of love, and lo! thou are lovely. So be 
 Thou to all thy fellows. I embrace thee 
 With goodness; I impart to thee benevolence; 
 I conceal in thee rich treasures of 
 Infinite kindness, and he who 
 Wields the wand of love shall find. This shall be 
 Thy everlasting glory; this, none can 
 Steal from thee save thy own self; and this, if 
 Ever lost, cannot on earth be found; 'tis 
 Only kept in heaven. 'Tis the nectar 
 Of thy soul — the honey of song — the smile • 
 Of beauty — the substance of life — the flower 
 Of life — God's golden chain around the heart! 
 It shall make thy presence desirable; 
 Thy song shall be implored, thy look embraced. 
 Thy counsel sought and treasured, thy being loved. 
 And in what circle thou shalt move that shall 
 Be heaven. Where love is not, is hell! Be 
 Thou merciful, not only to thy kin. 
 But even to the brute. And being thus. 
 The highest throne, the fairest realm, brightest 
 Crown, be thine to reign unthreatened and undoomed, 
 While angels rejoice to wed thine arm, 
 And join their happy destinies with yours." 
 And Father Love thus speaks again, "Now let 
 The whole in Me dissolve. Be thou conceived, 
 Be thou baptized, be thou brought forth a 
 Living Soul! I name the creature Man." 
 The Parliament adjourns. Creation's 
 Wondrous scheme receives the crowning touch. 
 The body is made a sacred temple 
 Of magnificent dust. The cathedral of 
 Mind and the soul's blest Sanctum Sanctorum! 
 Mysterious Architecture! thou Son of 
 Love, I have breathed in thee the Hfe of 
 God — a spark divine. I've set mine image 
 In this earthen urn. enclosing it with 
 Clay. 'Tis not a passing shadow; 'tis not 
 A fleeting breath; but Love's immortal stamp — 
 His likeness infinite — a second self — 
 The alter ego of thy God. Endurable, 
 Indelible, unannihilable. 
 Shall be the athanasia spark to all 
 Eternity. Unclouded, unbegloomed. 
 Through all thy nature it shall shine, and still 
 From every pore. And from thy diaphanous 
 Form — mirroring to all the photo of 
 Thy God — shall flow a thousand brilliant streams 
 To all creation's bounds. These relucent 
 Rays shall awe the straggling beast to tameness 
 And charm the birds to sing. This shall sustain 
 Thy sovereignty over all; by this 
 Alone shall all both know and love thee as 
 King. The plodding brute shall stoop about thy 
 Shrine and bow his willing head in humble 
 Supplication for a smile. The feathered 
 Orchestra shall crowd the pavilion of 
 Eolus and sing to thy delight. The 
 Four winds shall approach thee and softly 
 Breathe the mountain sonnet to thine ear, and 
 The far-away seas, where nether breakers 
 Lave, shall send to thee a welcome sound. When 
 On the seashore thou shalt stand — a radiant 
 Being — a statue of magnificent 
 Dust — the finny tribes shall view thee from the 
 Deep, and congregate at thy shrine, singing 
 In zestful muteness 'mid the seas. Thou shalt 
 Give them all a name according to their 
 Natural bent. At eve thou shalt stand and 
 Gaze above, reading the silver-paged 
 Volumes of the heavens, communing with 
 Each mysterious gem. When turned aside 
 To dream upon thy bed of roses, thy 
 Spirit shall ascend a golden ladder 
 Escorted by thy elder kin — the angels — 
 Thy flight shall not be wearisome, nor faintness 
 Wear the heart; but entering brighter portals, 
 And fairer realms, thou mayest corn-mingle in 
 Social bliss with thy brothers of the skies. 
 There drink from nobler springs and chant loftier 
 Lays until the silver lips of Morn shall 
 Kiss thy eyelids wake. Vast as thine eyes may 
 Now survey this broad expanse, lo! thy own 
 Dominion lies. Over height and depth thy 
 Scepter wield, sustained by high heaven. 
 Its gates shall not be shut against thy wants, 
 Nor shall thy humbler station be disdained 
 By thy seraph kin. None shall thy love — life's 
 Vital germ — destroy; none shall its light with 
 Cruel darkness hide, and none thy liberty 
 Proscribe except you turn from me, thus all 
 My love ignoring. Thou art a living 
 Soul — ^true likeness of the universal 
 Soul — true image of thy God — thyself a 
 Son. Remember ever thy Father's love, 
 And my commandments keep. And this is love, 
 The Tree of Life; its fruit shall feed thy wants 
 With all thy soul can wish. And this, the Tree 
 Of Death. Choose for thyself. If not content 
 To only know the good, thou wouldst know evil, 
 Too; such knowledge seek and death is found. Go 
 Forth. Lo! Paradise await thee, make for 
 Thyself a heaven or fashion thy own hell. 
 The Heavenly Choir. 
 "Holy! holy!! holy!!!" 
 Bright angelic armies singing, 
 O'er the hills their courses winging, 
 Down the vale the anthem ringing; 
 Wondrous song! 
 Shimmering in all their flight 
 As they mount the lofty height. 
 Like a thousand worlds of light 
 Together strung. 
 "Holy! holy!! holy!!!" 
 Cherubim the chorus wedding, 
 Far their limpid pinions spreading, 
 Beams of wondrous glory shedding 
 Here and there: 
 Wondrous theme by angels sung, 
 From Elysium's altars flung, 
 From each fiery harp and tongue 
 Everywhere. 
 "Holy! holy!! holy!!!" 
 Everywhere the creatures flying, 
 Loud, harmonious voices crying, 
 Distant worlds to them replying 
 From abroad: 
 "Holy! holy!" all conspire, 
 Striking every flute and lyre; 
 Sings the universal choir 
 Unto God. 
 "Holy! holy!! holy!!!" 
 Morning stars are downward driven. 
 Cleaving the cerulean heaven; 
 Let your song to earth be given. 
 Earth, adore! 
 Praise with all the shining host. 
 Lost in love — in wonder lost, 
 Father, Son and Holy Ghost, 
 Evermore!

THE PROBLEM AND OTHER POEMS BY Benjamin Griffith Brawley. 
“So many gods, so many creeds, So many paths that wind and wind, When just the art of being kind Is all this sad world needs." Atlanta Baptist College Print, ATLANTA, GA.
In the heart of a black man there is ever a feeling of wonder. His faith bids him be hopeful, but the present makes him dubious of the future. He looks at his child or his younger brother and wonders what the end of it all will be. Those who know this may be able to understand what I have tried to say in this little book. 
There is one who has lived much but whose heart is yet young, one who has suffered much but whose faith is still strong. By her my earliest footsteps were directed toward the Mount of High Ideals; and it is because I know that she is but one of many noble women who in this tide of times have high purpose for their sons that I dedicate these faltering lines TO MY MOTHER.

THE PROBLEM 
Ye who have the vision, ye who know the plan 
Of the stretch of empire o'er the haunts of man, 
Ye who claim dominion far as man may reach, 
What are these wild doctrines that at home ye teach? 
What is this new notion of the lust of laws, 
Sheltered by your ensign, bargained for your cause? 
Farther yet and farther spreads the eagle's wing, 
Louder yet your triumph bids the heathen sing; 
Farther yet and farther do your footsteps go, 
Each new day a harvest of the seed ye sow: 
Ye who day by day are seeking for your need, 
What is this ye harbor, what is this ye breed, 
This the hope of glory, this the great desire, 
Daily growing fatter 'neath altar-fire? 
What are these decrees your legislators make, 
Striving all the founding of your code to shake? 
What is this proscription, what these brazen bars, 
What this fearful phantom of the jim-crow cars? 
Whence these gods of fury at whose feet ye bow, 
Relics of the darkness, superseded now? 
Was it then for this ye sank the Merrimac, 
Or is this the whole wild fabric going back --
Back across the ages to the river-brink 
Where the man meets slave, where young slave children drink? 
One of your strong poets, virile and of sight, 
Saw the fearful image, piteous in its plight, 
Of a man of might, with muffled undertone, 
Rolling, rolling, rolling up a hill a stone. 
All the agitation, all the strife and woe, 
All the stress and tumult forty years ago, 
Left this ancient problem, reared at your command, 
Shall ye try to crush this man, or bid him stand? 
Was it idle speaking. was it platitude, 
Do we bend the meaning, stretch the magnitude, 
Of the Declaration—all the hope it meant, 
That We hold these truths to be self-evident?” 
Were the fathers wrong, or did they say too much? 
Was oppression such but when they felt its touch? 
What are all the words here that ye fail to heed? 
Can it be that folly satisfied your need; 
Or is this the God-sent oracle of truth, 
Purchased with your blood for all the world forsooth? 
Hearts are still unchanging; what ye craved for then 
Burns within the bosoms of a million men; 
All ye fain would teach us by a sterner band 
Do our minds full-seeing fail to understand. 
Ye who have the vision, ye who know the way, 
Hear the mighty millions singing as they pray; 
Heed the word the dubious present prophesies, 
List the music-making as the toilers rise, 
Toiling with their face full-turned upon the sun, 
Rising yet and higher when each day is done. 
Ye who claim the gospel, ye who know the law, 
Worship ye the night, or what your fathers saw?
THE BATTLEGROUND 
     Let me live close to men's hearts. In the years 
When youth is full, let me know men and grow 
Into the knowledge of their pulsing souls. 
Not on some distant peak where in the veil 
Fame tapers and the siren temples blaze, 
May my days pass, but on a lower ground, 
Where men of might brave dubious circumstance 
Where sorrow wears the heart, would lose the soul, 
Where strenuous life demands high ideals. 
In lusty labor and the fight with fire, 
Or sin, unlovable benightedness, 
May I know men, and knowing learn to love, 
And loving learn to help them in their toil.
 THE SLAVER 
 A Vision of What has Been, Viewed off Charleston Harbor. 
 As I stand near the ripple and plash of the wave, as I stand 
 Where the soul of the sea throbs with passion and love for the land, 
 As I muse in the attar of lilies and jessamine-bloom, 
 All the stress and the song of a hundred years fall in the loom. 
 Who is that? It is Taney; John Brown is making a raid ! 
 Is it Vesey that thinks? Are the mothers of Charleston afraid? 
 What a beautiful girl for an auction! a slave? and-hah!-she 
 With bouquets? Why, that's Topsy; that soldier there? Robert E. Lee. 
 It may be but the mist which the sea from its caverns hath wrung, 
 It may be but an impotent dream, undeveloped, unsung, 
 But that tosses and tunes a ghost-dance, and that shudders and veers, 
 While the pilot greets hence in the darkness the death that he steers. 
 And the mist settles low on the deep, and the night-wind comes down 
 On the heart of the sea where the myriad star-dartings drown; 
 Is it death-can it be?—that dim mist, and that scent from the line- 
 That strange vapor that mixes in heav'n with palmetto and pine? 
 It comes nearer, becomes more defined, and the waters let slip, 
 And the vasty dim blackness grows blacker; ah, see ! 'tis a ship! 
 It recedes, it reçoils like a serpent full ready to spring; 
 Far across the Atlantic's deep chest hear the slaves as they sing.
And the anthem spurred on by the driver rolls over the main, 
And the wavelets would fain bear the wail to the home-shore again ; 
Surely these are thy creatures, O God, they live under thy skies- 
Why, why do they shudder at even, why hate the sunrise? 
Yes, here! it was here that they brought them, those captives of old; 
It was here that they huddled at bell-taps, and here they were sold; 
Is it scourge and the death that I fear, nine-and, Africa, thine? 
No! in heav'n, mixed with beauty and blue, see Aldebaran shine!
 THE FLAG 
 Not though the prospect beckons, 
     Not though deep-wrung by crimes 
 My heart grows hot within me 
     In this full tide of times, 
 Could thrills of love impel me 
     To bless another shrine, 
 Or clasp another standard 
     Than this one so long mine. 
 The lot to brand injustice, 
     The task of wrong to right, 
 Demands a surer ensign 
     Than one full-bought by spite; 
 In vain is to disparage, 
     Or e'er attempt to meet 
 The glory of Old Glory, 
     The hope our hearts repeat. 
 Let not the dubious present 
     Obscure the soul of things, 
 Let not a wayward impulse 
     Breed far-fetched bargainings; 
 The trading made by Esau 
     And Jacob each to each, 
 Is not to pass unheeded 
     By those whom it might teach. 
 The hope our fathers fought for, 
     The way their footsteps trod, 
 Is not to be forsaken 
     By children of their God; 
 'Tis in the stress of impulse, 
     The strife of clan with clan, 
 He proves them true believers 
     And tries the soul of man.
THE RELIGION 
Go find a new religion, 
    Eschew the Christ ye praise, 
Let him no more be reckoned 
    The keeper of your ways; 
Ye men of vague protesting, 
    Of scarlet heart and hand, 
What means to you Mount Sinai, 
     The law and God's command? 
One day full-bought with fury 
    The funeral altars rise, 
And then to rage and madness 
    Ye make full sacrifice; 
And ere your work is finished, 
    Or ere the pyre is cold, 
The Sabbath dawns to witness 
    The tale your hands have told. 
Ye go to sanctuary, 
    And on your bended knees 
Ye lisp the Master's doctrine 
    Of “Inasmuch to these;" 
O dull of comprehension, 
    O vain in your conceit, 
What mean ye by “Our Father,”- 
    The form your lips repeat? 
The Master loved no seeming, 
    He lived that all might see 
His hate of sham and fashion 
    And all hypocrisy ; 
How think you ye will reckon, 
    How think you ye will pray, 
When judgment and when justice 
    Begin their destined sway?
 Go find a new religion, 
     Some more trustworthy creed, 
 Some faith your hearts will answer 
     In time of fear and need, 
     No insufficient doctrine Like that of Galilee, 
 Some rule more worth believing,- 
     Be honest and be free.
 THE LAW 
     Out in the fury of the summer sun 
 In sullen silence stood the multitude; 
 Within the crowd awaiting the event 
 With nimble fingers wrought a favored few, 
 Till all was ready and a rope did coil 
 Around the victim crouching at the stake. 
     What boots it that this tale was told before, 
 That but another Negro is no more? 
 What means it that this mob in silence turns,- 
 That in its breast no light of conscience burns? 
     But this: -- Where once the dawn of Justice neared, 
 Behold a nation with a conscience seared; 
 Over the land where men on judgment wait, 
 See baby-fingers clasp the helm of state; 
 See men whose sires did Magna Carta sign, 
 All wanton duty to the winds resign; 
 Or when at midnight comes an armed band, 
 Behold a coward or a traitor stand! 
     The arm of Liberty no more in air, 
 Ten thousand now the Constitution dare; 
 And mindful but of gold or full-crammed maw, 
 What reck these men of freedom or the law ? 
 And they that of democracy take keep 
 See those that sowed the wind the whirlwind reap; 
 While down the ages goes the sad refrain, 
 “Here once the vision of the world did reign."
 THE PEON'S CHILD 
     Out in the acres underneath the sun, 
 The full-blown cotton, after months of rain, 
 Breaks from the boll and longs to kiss the ground. 
 Wearied with pain and blinded by the dust, 
 A child plods slowly down the long white rows, 
 A sack hung on his back, and in his eyes 
 The press and greed of ages and the world, 
 But evermore within his heart a hope, 
 And on his lips a trill and snatch of song. 
     What knows this child of how to give and take, 
 Of syntax or of places on the map? 
 What does he think of Isaac Newton's law; 
 What does he care for Shakspere and the light? 
 How can he measure in the after-years 
 The scale of justice or be held for sin? 
 Around him in God's glory and the light
 A passionate bird hurls its defiant soul 
 Forth to the clouds in mocking of the blue; 
 But what is this to him whom in the years 
 A long, long wilderness of white awaits? 
 Around him sings the silence of the dawn, 
 Above him all the symphonies of heaven; 
 But what to him the glory or the gleam, 
 What means the music of the spheres to him? 
     Ye men who own the cotton-fields and plains, 
 Who run the whirring factories and the mills, 
 Weaving your wealth of heart-strings and of tears, 
 What is the heritage ye give this child? 
 What will ye say in that hereafter day, 
 When far beyond the working of the world, 
 Within the circuit of a righteous judge, 
 He greets you in the thunder-clouds of heaven?
 THE EDUCATION 
 There was a time when Socrates 
     The wisdom of the young men drew, 
 When not such leaden forms as these 
     I see, were what the people knew:
 But now the light the fathers burned 
 By other lights is overturned. 
 And now the Doric numbers flow 
     More slowly than in elder days; 
 And some less ancient Cicero 
     Now thunders forth in blame or praise; 
 To other gods than Zeus we throng, 
 For Homer is a wornout song. 
 And now a people with a zeal
     For things that they can make and see, 
 Forgets the lyric trance to feel, 
     Hears but the anvil's clank and plea'; 
 The heart's most sacred thrill and tone 
 Is sacrifice to wood and stone.
 The leaders of the nations strive, 
     But strive with water, air, and fire; 
 And day by day they onward drive
     Their sons, made mad by mad desire; 
 Yet as their phantoms they pursue, 
 I wonder if the gains are true. 
 Let me upon Olympus steep 
     Hold forth my unimpeded way; 
 There may I not forget to keep 
     The mystery of yesterday; 
 The life we live is more than meat; 
 Beware the creeds your lips repeat!
 TO THE OLD HOME. 
 We are going back to the country,
     Away from the rush of the town, 
For I've given 'em both a trial, 
    And it's here that we all run down; 
For the rows in the fields are calling, 
    The rows of the cotton and corn, 
And we're going back to the country, 
    Where father's father was born. 
You see it was this way, stranger, 
    When we come to Atlanta to stay --
We'd had a bad year in Coweta, 
    And thought we'd do better away; 
So wife and I and the children 
    All talked it over one night, 
And then we decided on leaving 
    The farm with its uphill fight. 
So not many mornings after, 
    With Ed—that's my eldest son---
I come up here to the city 
    To see what work could be done ; 
We liked the streets and the business- 
    We'd seen 'em but twice before- 
And where everyone seemed prosp’rous 
    We looked to be mighty poor. 
We rented a house over yonder 
    Where you seen me a year ago; 
It wasn't much like the others, 
    But our means was short, you know;
 And then all the rest for the money 
    Looked to me much worse by a mile, 
And we thought that we might do better 
    After working and waiting a while. 
So I went for wife and the children, 
    And brought them all here to stay; 
I was glad to see 'em so happy- 
    My own heart was light that day; 
But I tell you, I tell you, stranger, 
    For the town at least to speak, 
It's hard to support eight children 
    On seven and a' half a week. 
First Ed got to goin' with people 
    His mother and I couldn't see ; 
We tried to break up his habits, 
    But the city was stronger than we; 
At last he got into trouble- 
    All over some sort of a game- 
The other fellow began it, 
    But they all said Ed was to blame. 
Then Minnie our eldest daughter 
    Did not turn out very well, 
And after we spoke about it 
    She went off and stayed for a spell ; 
But we gritted our teeth and stood it, 
    And moved over here cross town; 
But the city is still the city 
    Whether we be up or down. 
And so one after another 
    The long months passed somehow ; 
When Nancy was here I could stand it, 
    But I'm at my road's end now;
The way somehow seemed clearer 
    When she was by my side- 
But last week came a sickness, 
    And then my dear wife died. 
The bread's been hard in the winning, 
    The city has cost me dear, 
I have paid the price that was asked for, 
    And I leave my heart's life here; 
But I said when Nancy left us 
    To rest from her pain and care, 
That I'd go home with the children 
    And do my best for 'em there. 
So we're going back to the country, 
    Away from the rush of the town, 
For I've given 'em both a trial, 
    And it's here that we all run down; 
For the rows in the fields are calling, 
    The rows of the cotton and corn, 
And we're going back to the country 
    Where my father's father was born.
 THE LITTLE SISTER 
 At sunset in the open door, 
    My little sister sits with me; 
We watch the shadows fall before 
    The wood-bine and the apple-tree; 
She sews a dress for baby Dot, 
And I untie a tangled knot. 
High up and down the golden strand 
    My little sister runs with me; 
She tightly holds me by the hand, 
    And calls to watch the ships at sea; 
The merry wavelets gleam and dance, 
Reflected in her happy glance. 
Ah, Margie, when the after-years 
    Bring days of wisdom to your head, 
When duty calls and wisdom nears, 
    Shall I untie the tangled thread? 
When long from now we view the sea, 
How will it be with you and me? 
 THE PLAY 
Far above the strife and striving, 
    And the hate of man for man, 
I can see the great contriving 
    Of a more than human plan. 
And day by day more clearly 
    Do we see the great design, 
And day by day more nearly 
    Do we footsteps fall in line; 
For in spite of the winds repeating 
    The rule of the lash and rod, 
The heart of the world is beating 
    With the love that was born of God.
 A PRAYER 
 Lord God, to whom our fathers prayed, 
    To whom they did not pray in vain, 
And who for hem assurance made, 
    Though oft repeated their refrain, 
Hope of our race, again we cry, 
Draw near and help us, lest we die. 
The battle rages fierce and long, 
    The wicked seem to triumph still; 
Yet all things to the Lord belong, 
    And all must bow beneath his will. 
Lord God of old, again we cry, 
Draw near and help us, lest we die. 
If brooding o’er the wrongs we grieve, 
    Our hearts forget to turn to thee, 
Or if they e’er do not believe 
    That thou in time wilt hear our plea, 
Hope of our race, stand by us then, 
And help us "quit ourselves like men." 
As now we bend before thy throne, 
    Upon us send thy truth and light; 
From us all other hopes are flown- 
    We pray thee, help us in the right. 
Father of lights, thy mercy send 
Upon us, as we lowly bend. 
Lord God, we pray thee help us all 
    To live in harmony and peace; 
Help us to listen to thy call, 
    And from all evil-doing cease. 
Hope of our people, hear our cry; 
Draw near and help us, lest we die.
MY CREED* 
I believe in faith in God, and in man. 
I believe in life and in work, and in lending a helping hand. 
I believe in faith, hope, and love, these three, and that the greatest of these is love. 
I believe in the ultimate convergence of systems, and in the ready sympathy of human hearts. 
I believe in the triumph of time, in the ordaining of the course of the ages, and the ruling of the progress of the stars.
I believe in the development of matter, in the evolution of things, in the final solution of problems, and in the ultimate unfolding of mysteries. 
I believe in the failure of the flesh, in the downfall of the material, in the triumph of the invisible, and the supremacy of the unseen. 
I believe in the second emancipation, in the liberty of conscience, in the freedom of the spirit, in the deliverance of the soul. 
I believe in the doom of injustice, in the final failure of prejudice, in the overthrow of evil, and in the final enthronement of good. 
I believe in the kinship of the universe, in the providence of Providence, in the fatherhood of God, and in the brotherhood of Christ. 
*This creed first appeared in April, 1904, in The Note-Book, a school periodical formerly published in Atlanta, Ga.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE.
IN submitting this collection of verse to the public I do not seek to gratify any personal vanity. During twenty years of active journalism in New York I have found it to be true that the successes we achieve in life, of whatever character, usually cost us so much in effort and anxiety that very little capacity for the enjoyment of the fruits of our labors is left us. I dare say this is a common experience. Very few men go to sleep unknown and wake up famous, as Byron did, while they are yet young; it more often happens that such good fortune comes after years of patient toil and waiting, and when the capacity to enjoy success is lacking. In our youth we are carried forward in every effort by an enthusiasm and a confidence which defy obstacles and laugh at criticism and judicious advice; in maturer age we are governed by a philosophy which comprehends in its calculation every obstacle, and invites rather than repels criticism and judicious advice. The confidence of youth is replaced by the skepticism of maturity. A piece of work which, at the age of twenty, we may regard as being well nigh perfect, is more than likely to be regarded as being very tame and commonplace and faulty at forty.
Of the accumulated mass of matter which I have composed for my own amusement and pastime during the past twenty-five years, I found by far the larger part more adapted to the grate than the public eye; and, perhaps, much that has been preserved and presented in this volume might more appropriately have been committed to the flames; because, after all is said and done, we are more partial to our own progeny, of whatever sort, than others can be, and blind to faults in it which become apparent to others upon the most superficial observation. And yet I have the satisfaction of having labored earnestly not to impose upon the reader any scrap of work the reading of which might be regarded as a waste of time; the chief aim of all writing being either to instruct or amuse the reader.
That the scene of most of the poems in this volume should be laid in Florida is natural, as I was born in that State and love it above all others, and shall always do so, and as early impressions exercise a more lasting influence, for weal or woe, upon the mind than any other. However we will, the impressions made upon the mind between the years of childhood and manhood color all of our future thought and effort. The home where we were born, the persons whose lives touched our own, however remotely; the public square in which we played marbles or "shinny," the ponds in which we bathed in summer, the little streams in which we fished, the fields in which we set traps for birds, the dear little church, the stately court house and the sombre jail, and the village schoolhouse—the remembrance of these abides with us in the hurly-burly of after years, however far we wander from them and whatever other associations may enter into our lives and become a part therof.
The various history and romance of Florida appeal more strongly to her own children than to others, and will probably do so more in the future than in the past. The long struggle of Spaniard and Englishman and Frenchman and Indian, and the too little known "Exiles of Florida"—of whom Joshua R. Giddings wrote with so much eloquence and sympathy and pathos—make the whole State a veritable storehouse of priceless treasure to the literary antiquary.

DREAMS OF LIFE.
I.
O, Life of Dreams! O, Dreams of Life!
Ye mysteries are that breathe and thrill—
In times of peace, in times of strife—
Through all the pulses of our will.
In hours of joy, in hours of pain,
In all of Love, in all of Hate,
We strive t' evade thee, but in vain,
For ye are messengers of Fate!
How vain is man! How passing vain!
The son of Macedon see stride
His day upon the battle plain,
And sate with blood his vaulting pride!
Conquered he all of earth then known,
And for more worlds to conquer sighed!
Then, drunk with crime, Death claimed his own—
The cruel monster drank and died!
II.
Then Cæsar took the world's command,
And savage millions cut he down!
E'en mighty Pompey, great and grand,
Fell like the fresh green grass, new mown!
And Rome, Imperial Rome! the Fates
Resigned to his corrupt embrace!
And all of Rome's dependent states
Implored the boon of Cæsar's grace!
He who had conquered from the Nile
To where the Rhone and Thamès stray,
Who basked in beauty's fickle smile
And thought supreme to end his day—
The master of the world was slain
In the swift movement of the eye;
In torture that subdued e'en pain
He went to judgment in the sky!
His grasp of power the world in thrall
As adamantine chains did hold;
No arm was raised to stay his fall—
And treason triumphed, treason bold!
The mind grows faint the blood to view
That selfish man has spilt—for what?
To dull his hate, or chain renew
That binds the helot to his lot!
That mad ambition may o'erleap
The bounds of Reason and of Right,
Or in cursèd chains doomed millions keep
On plea of Wisdom and of Might.
III.
The Corsican, fierce Bonaparte,
Worse than the savage Hun, arose,
A war god born, with head and heart
That conquered heat and laughed at snows!
The burning sands of Egypt old—
Italia's peerless land and sky—
Bald Russia's blighting storm and cold—
These had he chained to misery
Ere Destiny upon him beamed
The torture of its withering frown—
Disarmed the purpose he had dreamed,
To make the world to him play clown!
This Corsican, whose name to speak
Made proudest nations quake with fear—
Caucasian, Latin, and the Greek—
This slave of Power was spent with care!
Above his murderous head the roar
Was heard of shot and shell and flame!
From every tribe, from every shore,
His foes in massive armies came!
The trembling world at Waterloo,
In dread suspense and fear, did wait,
Bowed in sackcloth and ashes low,
Upon the verdict of grim Fate!
What if the Corsican had won
The doubtful hazard of the day?
What if no Iron Wellington
To victory had led the way?
The course of empire still had been
In paths that titled rogues had hewn!
Some names in history's pages green
On other fields their fame had won!
O gracious Lord! forgive the crime
That rears on high itself a throne.
Which, like the pagan's idol, Time
Defaces—spurns the thing to own.
Prescriptive right is claimed to starve
The children of the fruitful soil,
Whose ceaseless labors do but carve
For those who thrive but do not toil.
IV.
'Twas Adam, first of sinners, sought
His cowardice to cover o'er;
The traitor, by the foeman bought,
Flies from his country's wrathful shore;
Still, conscience haunts the guilty soul,
Accuses and condemns him still;
Alone he staggers to the goal,
Hated, descends life's cheerless hill!
Where'er he skulks the angry sky
Hangs threatening o'er his guilty head;
E'en in his dreams do phantoms nigh
Make horrible his exile's bed.
V.
Upon the future life we build,
As built the toilers of the Nile,
Whose rude and ruthless tyrants willed
That God's eternal sun should smile
On monuments of dust and stone
Which should defy the flight of Time,
Beneath dumb hieroglyphics groan,
The wonder of each age and clime!
And still they stand, in Winter's storms
And vernal Summer's rays benign,
Lifting on high grand, gloomy forms
Round which eternity may twine!
VI.
The Pyramids! When did they rear
Their sombre bulk to Time's stern gaze?
Canst estimate the thought—the care—
The lives condemned—the flight of days—
That went to consecrate the pile
Where Egypt's tyrants now repose,
The sentient serpents of the Nile,
At whose commands the phantoms rose?
Each stone cemented with the gore,
The tears and sweat of some poor slave!
For each dead king the millions bore
Into the gloomy vaults, his grave,
A thousand men, perchance, had bled,
Had sacrificed their all in death,
To guard the tyrant in his bed
And watch for his returning breath!
VII.
Yes; on the Future Life we build,
Rear crumbling monuments to fame,
When Death's remorseless clasp has stilled
The currents of the mortal frame!
Man's labors here are all in vain,
Are scattered on the cyclone blast—
Scattered afar like tiny seed,
Upon a barren desert cast,
If Duty and Justice be not
The objects of his care and zeal;
Or in the granary will rot,
As time eats up the blade of steel!
The universal law ordains,
Nor can we change the just decree,
That man to man, as man, remains,
By kindred ties, each as each free!
VIII.
There were no kings of men till men
Made kings of men, and of the earth;
There were no privileged classes when
First Nature, man and beasts, had birth.
Man was sole monarch of his sphere,
And each with equal power was made;
Each from the earth partook his share;
Each shared with each earth's sun and shade.
No fetters on the limbs were bound;
The intellect was free as light;
Man's every wish abundance found;
He gloried in his earth-wide right.
God made the earth and sky—the breath
Of mountain and of smiling vale—
And filled them all with life, not death,
As bracing as the ocean gale!
IX.
The giant warrior clothed in steel,
The high-walled city, ravaged plain,
The angry millions as they reel
To battle, death, or woe and pain—
The world in thrall to him whose might
And cunning triumph o'er his kind—
Did God make Might the test of Right,
Or man—blind leader of the blind!
No; Vanity has reared on high
The grandeur of its fragile power,
But it will fall, will prostrate lie,
The broken idol of an hour.
X.
O, Life of Dreams! O, Dreams of Life!
Ye mysteries are that breathe and thrill—
In times of peace, in times of strife—
Through all the pulses of our will.
THE WILDWOOD ROSE WILL GROW.
(Stewart Fortune, born August 16, 1884; died May 27, 1888)
"Suffer little children to come unto Me, and forbid
them not; for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven."
Our little boy has fled!
We know he is not dead!
"Of such the Kingdom is," Christ said.
The wildwood rose will grow,
And honeysuckles blow,
Where we have laid our Stewart low!
The birds will sing their song
All through the Summer long,
Above his grave, the trees among!
The brook will murmur by,
And glorious be the sky,
Where shattered now our fond hopes lie!
Sadly we bear the cross!
The world can give but dross,
As gain, for our too grievous loss.
We will not question now
Why death is on his brow!
Broken in hope, we bow, we bow!
EMANUEL.
Note.--Emanuel Fortune was born at Marianna, Jackson County, Florida, August 17, 1863, and died at Jacksonville, Florida, March 4, 1890. When he was quite small he had an attack of pneumonia, which left him paralyzed as to his whole left side, and proved a great handicap to him in all his efforts. In 1869 his parents moved to Jacksonville, and young Emanuel entered the public schools, upon graduating from which he enterd the Cookman Institute, at the same place, from which he graduated, with high honors, in 1882. He desired to read law, but came to New York instead in 1883, and entered the business department of his brother's newspaper. In 1888 he contracted a cold in the great blizzard of that year, which developed into lung trouble, from which he never recovered. He returns to Florida in 1889. He was a man of great studiousness and of remarkable eloquence in public speech. While very positive in character he was of an extremely lovable disposition. He had the possibilities of a great career in him, and his early death was regarded as a calamity by the great number of people who knew him as a public speaker and frequent contributor to the periodical press of the day.
I.
Emanuel is dead! I shall not see again,
In all the earth, his manly form, or hear
The music of his voice, in soothing strain,
Persuasive as a lute to my bent ear,
Wean from my mind all thought of wasting care.
The noble youth is dead! The earth no more
Will listen when he speaks; nor can it share
The fullness of the gracious love he bore
For all the race before his lease of life was o'er!
II.
It seems not true to me; it seems not true,
That one so gifted and so young could die—
Fresh as a wild flower kissed by morning dew,
Blown to full life beneath the Southern sky,
As fragile as a flower, I know not why,
As sensitive withal to winter's blast;
Yet, on his fragile strength did he rely,
Among men towering as the ship whose mast
O'ertops the anchored fleet, the stormy passage past.
III.
Emanuel is dead! Perhaps you may not know
The man who bore that charmèd name, until
So short a time, it seems an hour ago,
When He, who rules in life and death, did will
The proud heart should forevermore be still!
Yet, he was not unknown to fickle fame!
And he had power the sluggish sense to thrill
With eloquence that without effort came
When he did speak to men in Freedom's holy name!
IV.
And he did speak with all the force and fire
The ancient Tribunes spoke, when tyrants trod
Upon the rights of men with vengeance dire—
Invoked the wrath of earth and high heaven's God
To shield the human weaklings of the sod!
Contented slaves no longer wore their chains,
Content, obedient to the master's rod.
But roused to life their chafed and bruisèd brains,
When he compared their losses with their slender gains.
V.
He was a Tribune of the people, true,
Unselfish in the people's righteous cause,
A giant for the Right, from which he drew
The strength to crush the force of unjust laws,
Sharp to destroy as are the lion's claws.
And he was young! The race of life begun,
Swift as the winds that sweep along the straws
Clenched in their grasp! Each hard-fought stage he won,
Rejoicing in the fray, its tragedy and fun.
VI.
Serious he was, and passing cold and stern;
For life is serious, and its work, to those
Intent to do their share, to those who yearn
To serve the race, is hard, and harder grows—
As the wild storm with fiercer fury blows,
Concentred—as they hide themselves from sight,
Laboring for human kind, for friends and foes,
Patiently plodding through the long. dark night.
Upward, to God! eternal Love, and Life, and Light!
VII.
Serious and cold and stern he was, or seemed,
In all the labors that engaged his hand,
Obedient to his mind; for life he deemed
Too short to waste a part thereof. He planned
His labor, as a soldier in command
Of certain duty, his strong mind imbued
With lofty purposes. In all this land
None to his duty, as a man, e'er stood
More resolute, however siren voices wooed!
VIII.
His sternness some repelled; for men are light
Of heart, and, as the gorgeous butterfly,
Prefer the sunshine to the stars of night,
The man of mirth to him whose earnest eye
Upon the things of earth looks solemnly.
Yet, he was not unkind, not even stern;
Deep in his swelling soul's great mystery
A flame of tenderness did glow and burn
For all mankind, for whom his sympathies did yearn.
IX.
The richest jewels often come, we know,
In caskets that tell naught of wealth unseen,
So rough the casements are. The thoughtful brow,
The aspect cold, the eye that scorns a queen,
So lordly and commanding be the mien,
May not disclose the man, but rather hide
Him from the common gaze—they may but screen.
Or they may indicate, an honest pride,
That chafes at what the gods to mortals have denied!
X.
We cannot always tell from out the face
One of the world's great masters may possess
What it conceals beneath; but we may trace,
If we shall study well, with some success,
The lofty thoughts that surge and burn distress
Where faithful Nature writes her tale of woe;
True, those who most the human race do bless,
Smile less than common men, and they bow low
Beneath their burden, as the years do come and go.
XI.
Like Atlas, they the busy world uphold;
They think for those who do not think withal,
But who prefer the role of common scold,
Thoughtless, finding the hidden flaws in all
The agents who have reared the mighty wall.
Go, read, who can, the Nazarene's calm eye—
Beaming in pity over man's sad fall,
The pulseless face where grief and sorrow lie—
Then read the soul that to the race did naught deny!
XII.
Go, read in Fame's illustrious pages, then,
The faces of the world's heroic dead,
The great array of earth's immortal men
Who to the nobler life the hosts have led—
The timid hosts—in what they did and said,
And you will find the furrowed thoughts stamped deep—
Like sabre strokes through which the life had fled—
In every line, stamped as they climbed the steep
Where weak men halt and faint and strong men often weep!
XIII.
Such was Emanuel—for others felt
More than himself—to whom the race was dear—
The human race! Base-born selfishness ne'er knelt
At mortal shrine and plead to deafer ear
Than his—the noble dead! He had no fear,
Conscious of right, since just his mighty cause!
And he has gone away! He still seems near,
Constant as one of Nature's constant laws,
So that I seem to hear him breathe, as here I pause!
XIV.
And do the dead we love go far away
And nevermore return? Can it be true,
They never come again? No; truth to say,
They come again to us and oft renew—
Unseen, unheard—the vanished moments few!
And thus it is with me! My solitude
Is oft disturbed, and he in life I knew
Sits with me through the hours I watch and brood,
Groping in silence after life's eternal good!
XV.
Somehow we feel, when it is solemn night,
When silence reigns in all, that not alone
Are we, but that the air is soft and light
And warm with other breath, by kind winds blown,
That makes us company of those, our own,
Who go away awhile, but come again!
We deem it so, as the sad winds sigh and moan
Without, or angel tears bedew with rain
The earth, washing away, perchance, its crimson stain!
XVI.
We cannot tell! With close-shut eyes, we wait,
While fitful silence rules the slumbrous night,
And struggling flames burn low within the grate,
To hear a voice we love, a footfall light,
To see a form arrayed in raiment white,
Recall us to the earthly place and hour;
And darkness then is pierced with dazzling light,
And fear and pain lose all their dreaded power,
And hate and greed before its radiance bend and cower!
XVII.
We dream—we sleep—and still we are alive—
Midway 'twixt life and death—living, but dead—
And break the spell cannot, howe'er we strive,
For earthly strength seems spent; and we are led,
In fancy led, though not a word is said,
Into the great Unknown, we know not where,
We do not wish to know, we have no dread;
A blissful state of earth and air we share—
Awake, yet sleeping! Dead, yet living! Here, yet there!
XVIII.
We know the dead is with us in that dream,
In that strange hour, so blissful and so true,
In which old memories and new all seem
To pass in quick processional review—
All we have done, all that we ever knew!
How strange it is! We would not wake again,
Though not asleep, but wander on, and through
The Night of Time—free from all care and pain,
Speechless—feeling no other bliss were worth the gain!
XIX.
Then comes a blank! We plunge into the night!
Vanish the dead, and we become as they,
Or something less, where not a ray of light
Through all the mind falls on the darkened way!
What is it! Where the prophet who can say!
We sleep! How long! We start! A breath—a sound—
We wake! The night has passed into the day!
What was, seems but a dream, an echo sound,
Reverberating in the chambers of the mind around!
XX.
He was my brother, younger far than I,
And shared with me the sports of happy youth,
In that reposeful village where my eye,
Still constant, pleading ever, turns, forsooth,
To scenes of guileless innocence and truth!
It is a memory! Time was when he
And I found in some shaded grove or booth,
In field or forest wild, all that can be
The joy of youth—fun-loving, gay, and shackle-free!
XXI.
How oft have we entrapped the wily hare,
Ensnared the bird, whose nest was rifled first,
Or raided apple trees, or luscious pear,
Fearless of jealous eyes! Boys have their thirst
Destructive, and, like pent-up waters, burst
O'er dykes into the basins of the main,
Restrainèd most appear to act the worst!
Those days will ne'er return to us again,
For one is dead—a broken link in life's short chain!
XXII.
The days of youth have not for men the charm
They have for boys, save as a retrospect,
A backward reading of the tale of harm,
Of damage done, thoughtless, they little recked,
For boys ne'er think, but in their pranks reflect
Reverse of thought; a willful disregard
Of others' rights—a madness, I suspect;
And, if their wayward pleasure is not marred,
All twitchings of the guilty conscience are disbarred.
XXIII.
'Twas so with us. Forsooth, there were some years
Whose Summer sky was painted dark, indeed,
When childish laughter mingled with our tears,
And our young hearts, oft pierced with steel, did bleed;
The rank tares soon choke up the honest seed.
Let those years pass! Let them e'en be forgot—
Remembered only as the broken reed!
He lived to know a while a happier lot,
But far removed from that loved, consecrated spot!
XXIV.
He little dreamed in those delightful hours
The changes that the future years would bring;
He little dreamed the sunshine and the showers
That made our Southern life an endless Spring,
Whose joys the mocking bird delights to sing,
Would merge into the storms of Northern life
Intense, and wither him—a blasted thing!
The tropic plant, before the North Wind's strife,
Too often falls a victim to Death's pruning knife!
XXV.
Why do the brave and good and true die young,
Or such we deem the noblest of their kind?
Do we mistake? Of such have poets sung
Since first their raptures moved the human mind,
As angels feel when harpists of the wind
The silver strings with fingers touch divine!
I do not know! It may be we are blind
With grief, that clouds the brain as too much wine,
When choicest buds of home are plucked from off the vine!
XXVI.
Or, it may be, we miss the one that goes
Out from the circle of our narrow sphere,
Seeming to slight the loving ones who close
Remain about us—constant, tender, dear—
The solace of the changing, treacherous year!
We see them, hear them; but the absent one
We never see, alas! we never hear!
And hence the void, when all is said and done,
That fills our life with grief profound, and grief alone!
XXVII.
And Moses stood on Pisgah's lofty height
And viewed the Promised Land his race possessed,
But reached it not himself! So, in the night.
Perchance, the grand old Prophet found his rest
In lonely Moab's consecrated breast!
Was it for this he worked and prayed and sighed
That God his wayward race, so often blessed,
Would lead from bondage, in their humbled pride,
To Freedom's heritage beyond the Jordan's tide?
XXVIII.
We cannot say! But many since have stood
Upon the threshold of the Promised Land,
And perished in the dismal solitude,
While viewing nothing of the hopes they planned,
Seeing naught fruitful issue from their hand!
Oh, who will make our hopes a burning flame,
As potent as was Moses' magic wand,
When we are dead, returned to whence we came,
And are forgot in deed and act and e'en in name?
XXIX.
The good die young! Emanuel is dead!
Toll, solemn funeral bells, in anguish toll!
And all ye people bow the reverent head!
Eternity has claimed a noble soul
From out the dismal walls of Life's dread goal!
Peal forth, ye bells, your awful monotone!
And far and near upon the winds let roll
The wail of woe above the sod and stone!
Emanuel is dead! I am alone! Alone!
THE DIAMOND IN THE CLAY.
The man who finds a diamond in the clay
And knows its worth from common glass
That others trod upon or blindly pass—
Their dreamful eyes uplifted from the way,
The people of that all too common class
Diogenes rebuked, as we may still, alas!
For wisdom's children yet are prone to stray
In nature's sunlight groping through life's day,
And holds it at its value true, howe'er
The common sort may taunt him for his faith,
Until it nestles in Fame's fickle ear,
Brilliant, compelling Admiration's breath,
   Is more to be esteemed of men by far
   Than they who praise the stone become a star.
JESSIE AND I.
What time the August days were dying,
   And leadened clouds hung dense and low,
And drowsy Summer winds were sighing,
And seagulls, far away, were crying,
   And merry throngs passed to and fro,
We two, Jessie and I, together
Thought not of time or place or weather;
   But, strolling on the golden sand,
We lived in "grand old ocean," dreaming,
Mute, watching white-caps dancing, gleaming,
   Far to sea—we two, hand in hand.
THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE SOUL.
The pathway up the mountain may be plain,
But who can rob th' ascent of toil and pain?
Far up the valley's sloping sides we gaze
To where the summits tower in misty haze;
Or, when the sun dispels the clouds that lower,
The giant stands disclosed in matchless power.
Nature's eternal walls that pierce the clouds,
Pendant like gorgeous floating muslin shrouds,
Charm and o'erawe the soul that looks to God—
Who dwells in skies, in peaks afar, in sod—
And feels the force that made the prophets rear
Their sacred altars in the upper air.
The soul will lift itself above the clay
And seek beyond the earth eternal day.
And never can the man who once has seen
Unveiled the myst'ries of the mountain's sheen;
Its vastness and its strength and rugged brow,
Feel as he felt before, content to dwell
Cooped in the confines of his native cell.
Far out into th' unknown he takes his flight,
Seeking for sunbeams through the pathless night.
LOVE'S DIVINEST POWER.
Let mad ambition strive to gain
The cherished wish that yields but pain;
Let others seek for wealth alone,
And with its cares their lives atone;
But let me live my fleeting hour
The slave of Love's divinest power.
SWEETEST FLOWER OF THE WOOD.
I send thee from this Summer land,
   Fair maiden of the Northern clime,
These sweet shrubs, gathered by my hand,
   Where we two lingered in past time.
You loved so well no other flower
   As this, the sweetest of the wood,
That prospers most in shaded bower,
   In Nature's own grand solitude.
And as I pluck these from her breast,
   The last to open to the sky,
You'll joy to know my lips them pressed
   As on thy gentle breast they lie.
THE SERPENT.
I once strode down a mountain's side,
A thoughtless boy, in youth's young pride,
And stopped to pluck a violet
With diamond dews of morn still wet;
But, as I paused, a poisonous snake,
Coiled near, dared me the flower to take!
So, all through life, a poisonous stream
Is mingled with the sweetest dream!
Our smiles and tears, like sun and rain,
Commingled are with joy and pain.
SLAVERY TO THE SLAVE!
On the hills of Hayti ring
Mandates of the Frenchman's king,
And the waves the tidings bring—
   "Slavery to the slave!"
Toussaint, arm thee for the fight!
Strike a blow for human right!
Crush, O crush! the tyrant's might,
   And thy country save!
Stay thy arm when every foe
From thy land in haste shall go,
Sick at heart beneath the blow
   On the battlefield!
Long may Hayti's banners wave!
O'er her valiant few, so brave!
Heroes worthy patriots' grave,
   Who would never yield!
WHAT HAS BEEN LOST IS LOST.
Why waste regrets on shattered hopes that beat
   Themselves to death against a woman's breast?
Why seek in Arctic fields of snow and sleet
   For sunbeams of the Gardens of the Blest?
What has been lost, is lost! and nevermore,
   Through all the changes of the unborn years,
That sigh and waste away upon the shore
   Of Time, can be recalled by prayers or tears!
MARY CONROY.
She was young; old Conroy took her,
Took her for herself alone,
For no wealth had she to offer,
Love for him she had not shown.
But, he said, that did not move him;
He of wealth abundance had;
He was old, and she could make him
Less a recluse, lone and sad!
Age had robbed his breast of passion,
And had drained his eyes of tears;
He would leave his ample fortune
To the wife of his last years.
She was all that painters picture,
All that poets deem divine;
Beautiful and virtuous was she—
More than genius can define.
Little cared she for the glitter,
And the pomp of tinsel wealth,
For she knew that much that's deadly
Lurks beneath its show of health.
When her aged father urged her
To accept her suitor's hand,
As he soon fore'er must leave her
Poor and friendless in the land,
She consented without murmuring,
For no other choice had she;
Love, she thought, a vain delusion,
Fruitful source of misery.
So young Mary left a village
For a city's untried life,
Left an humble, happy cottage,
As rich banker Conroy's wife.
And a faithful partner made she,
Filled her husband's heart with pride;
Courted was she as the fairest,
Richest, on the social tide.
Conroy learned to love the maiden
Who was now his queenly bride;
But she smiled—'twas not love-laden—
On the husband at her side—
Told him she could never love him—
That she knew not what love meant—
But would constantly obey him;—
And with this he sought content.
But content was now a stranger
To the husband's love-torn breast,
And about him came and lingered
Jealous thoughts that broke his rest.
Sadly on his lot he pondered,
And him gold no more could charm;
All too late he knew he'd blundered—
Slipped his cable in life's storm!
Soon upon his bed they laid him—
Broken-hearted, silly man!
Mary ever was beside him,
Doing all a woman can;
But, for more than friendship sighed he,
And, since that was still denied,
What relief for crushed hopes had he!
In a short time Conroy died.
When the banker-prince was buried,
And his testament was brought,
It was found, since he was married,
That to spite his wife he'd sought,
As he had by will commanded
That his wife should single live;
But, if she again should marry,
To the poor his riches give!
Mary smiled, and said 'twas kindly
That her aged husband meant;
She'd not barter her blest freedom,
Lest by it she gained content.
So, she lived a life of pleasure,
Loved and sought by noble men,
Men who loved and strove to measure
Beauty with a poet's pen.
But to love she was a stranger,
And, without it, would not wed,
'Though about her men did linger
Pure of heart and wise of head.
And the poet and the artist,
In the Old World and the New,
Merit, worth, howe'er poor it,
Such adored her, such she knew.
All about her hovered fancy,
Wit and humor of the best,
And of such she ne'er grew weary—
Such, indeed, can soothe the breast.
But, a change of life impended,
Such as she, perhaps, ne'er dreamed;
She, whose smile with wealth was blended,
Turned her thoughts to love and deemed
'Twas a boon to her more precious
Than the treasures of Conroy—
Deemed that she could leave the splendid
Halls that gave her now no joy!
Freely had her word been given,
Faithful to the trust reposed,
And the duty now was ended
Which, she found, too much imposed.
He was but a struggling artist;
Little gold could he command;
She, a wealthy, lovely widow,
Rated fairest in the land.
Far too proud to leave his station
And to seek for joy so high,
He, with manly hope, probation
Fixed to labor to her sky.
To the future he committed
All he loved and cherished most:
He would conquer by persistence,
Or fall struggling at his post
And when he to her could offer,
With his love, no empty hand,
He would gladly go and ask her
All to take of love and land!
Mary read his brave intention,
Read it in his anxious eye,
And she knew that great devotion
Swelled his manly bosom high.
But no word by him was spoken
To disclose the burning thought;
Silence, when no longer silence,
Oft destroys the boon most sought!
Thus, the silence was unbroken,
Each content to have it so;
But their loving thoughts had voices—
Voices lovers so well know.
Since Bedell refused to utter
Words which he so longed to speak,
He resolved no more to see her—
For his love had made him weak!
He from her himself absented,
And he strove to her forget;
In his solitude he brooded;
Oft his checks with tears were wet!
Then he spread the friendly canvas,
And beneath his touch it glowed,
Till his cunning hand had painted
All his soul in secret vowed!
Thus, one day, he sat reviewing
That which he so well had done,
And in anguished silence dreaming
Of the love he longed to own,
When young Mary up behind him,
Softly, quickly treading, stole,
Much amazed so sad to find him—
Find him dreaming out his soul!
Young Bedell, intently musing,
Did not hear her gently sweep
Into his studio's warm stillness,
Into his sweet dream's half sleep!
On his shoulder Mary gently
Laid the pressure of her hand,
And the young Bedell, from musing,
Woke to hear some mild command!
Mary gazed, herself now dreaming,
On the glowing canvas near,
Then upon Bedell, low bending,
Waiting what she said to hear!
"Bedell," said she, "this your labor
Plainly tells me what I knew,
Knew, and sadly pondered over,
That, 'though absent, you were true;
"That, from some great pain to shield me,
You have sought your solitude!
But you more than pain have caused me—
Left me on your love to brood!"
"Mary, had I loved you idly,
Loved you with a love less strong,
Thought you less an angel saintly,
I had stayed and worked you wrong;
"But I knew full well my weakness,
And resolved to conquer all,
For I would not have your fortune
To my poor estate to fall.
"Noble men and noble women
Worship at your peerless shrine;
Leave Bedell, who long has striven
'Gainst your charms—they are divine!"
"Why, Bedell, should I now leave you,
When my heart to you is true?
Why should love's injunction pain you?—
Do what duty bids you do!
"You, to hide your love, had left me,
Yes, in haste from me had flown;
I have sought, and, unasked, given
What so long has been your own!
"Tell me why you made me seek you?
Tell me why you spurn my love?
Tell me why my picture moves you,
When I failed, 'though oft I strove?"
"I have ever loved you, Mary;
'Twas for that I left your side!
This, your pictured image, cannot
E'en that boundless love divide!
"I had schooled myself intently
To your cherished face forget,
But my hand, with loving cunning,
Taught me memory knew you yet!
"Why did I fly? You are happy—
You are rich, and, I—am poor!
Would I have you share my misery?
No! I should not see you more!
"Leave me, then, who long has striven
'Gainst your charms—they are divine!
Wealth like yours was never given
Save with equal wealth to twine!"
"Then, Bedell, we now are equal—
Rich, indeed, in equal love—
Richer than the mines of Ophir—
Rich as diamond courts above!
"He who took me from a cottage,
Made me mistress of Conroy,
Left the world in pain and anger,
Left the world without a joy!
"His estate I hold as trustee,
Hold it for the needy poor;
He who takes my hand in marriage
Takes a bride, and nothing more!"
Young Bedell, with joy, embraced her,
Pressed her to his beating heart,
And the world to him looked brighter
Since again they should not part!
But his joy died with the moment;
Cloudy grew his ample brow;
He would not, for his contentment,
Thus accept her marriage vow!
"Mary, you to me are dearer,
Dearer than all earth beside;
But, if marriage make you poorer,
Then, I single must abide!
"Leave me to my sore bereavement!
Leave me with the world to fight!
Time will bring you calmer judgment,
And you'll say Bedell was right!
"When I win the fame I covet,
Win the artist's golden dream,
I to you will then come, speaking
Words you cannot empty deem!"
"Then, I leave you, and shall never,
Never, speak again your name!
I'll not own a timid suitor,
One who waits on laggard fame!
"He who shrinks with life to grapple
Cheered by woman's constant love,
Is a coward, and in conflict
Will his craven nature prove!"
Mary would have left his presence,
But he faced her then and there,
And, with words whose fervent passion
Would have won a queen as fair,
Claimed her hand and ceased his dreaming—
Vowed that they for love would wed—
For her words of scorn and passion
Pointed where his duty led.
MUTATION'S VOICELESS NIGHT.
When life's fitful reign is over,
   When its cherished dreams are dead,
When the spirit is a rover,
   When the soul from earth has fled
To the realms of endless glory,
   Mortals cannot comprehend—
Long the theme of song and story—
   Where old joys and new joys blend,
We shall know and love each other,
   Know and love each other there,
Where the angels dwell together—
   Angels passing bright and fair.
Nothing lives but love's sweet essence,
   And the soul's all quenchless light;
All else sinks its form and presence
   In mutation's voiceless night.
I MAKE MY BED OF ROSES.
I make my bed of roses sweet!
I scorn the frowns of envious Fate!
I will my careless song repeat
While 'round may surge contending hate!
For life is what we make it still,
And I am master of my will.
Then let me quaff life's nectar wine
And live, a lord, the passing hour;
The world, and all therein, is mine,
Of fame or wealth or transient power;
For he, indeed, is all supreme
Whose dream of life is all a dream.
COME AWAY, LOVE.
Come away, love, come away
Where the men do gather hay;—
In the fruitful fields remote
Join with mine thy merry note,
In the toilsome pleasures where
Plenty drives away all care!
On the hills the flocks do browse,
And the dogs the echoes rouse;
All is life, and all is joy.
Where all hands do find employ.
HEAR THE MUSIC OF THE PINES.
Hear the music of the pines—
Murmuring through the climbing vines,
Sighing through the tree tops high,
Floating upward to the sky,
Then descending where I lie—
Hear the music of the pines!
What sweet thoughts the music brings,
What new gladness from it springs—
As reclining, in a dream,
Watch I, listless, a sunbeam
Dancing on the silvery stream—
What sweet thoughts the music brings!
Hear the music of the pines!
How it 'round my fancy twines—
While fragrances of flowers fill
All the pulses of my will
As I, lingering, linger still—
Hear the music of the pines!
GENTLE HEART, INDULGE THY DREAMING.
Gentle heart, indulge thy dreaming!
Wake not from thy peaceful mood!
The great world around thee streaming
Holds no joy one-half so good!
Soon thy dreams must have an ending!
Thou wilt wake some early morn
And, o'er shattered idols bending,
Find thy peace from thee is torn!
A WHISPER SOFT AND LOW.
I heard a whisper soft and low,
Borne on the winds, that blow and blow,
   That made me listen then;
For though the voice was changed in all,
Each weighted word seemed me to call
To some far-off Eden.
   And then the silence reigned again;
Awful it was and full of pain,
For from the dead it came!
   The message of an angel dove
That once had been my fondest love—
   Unspoken be her name!
Whence come these thoughts that will not die
Of those who dwell beyond the sky?
   These whispers in the night,
That bid us come from earth away—
Canst say, grim Doubt, from whence come they?
   Canst say, and say aright?
LOVE'S MYSTIC TIDE.
When once the mountain stream has mingled with the sea,
Think you it can again a mountain stream e'er be?
Does it not take the grander and more awful form
Of the blue waters where abides the King of Storm?
So, lives that once have mingled in Love's mystic tide,
Not e'en the God of Fate can evermore divide.
No rule of church or state can turn the precious wine
Back to the grape that ripened on the fruitful vine.
LINCOLN.
The waves dashed high; the thunders echoed far;
The lightnings flashed into the dismal gloom
The bolts by Vulcan forged in Nature's womb,
And earth was shaken by the furious war!
The Ship of State was strained in every spar!
And strong men felt that now had come their doom;
And weak men scanned the dark heavens for a star
To save them from a fratricidal tomb.
But, one, amid the strife—collected, calm,
Patient and resolute—was firm, and trod
The deck, defiant of the angry storm,
Guiding the ship—like to some ancient god!
   And high upon the scroll of endless fame,
   In diamond letters, flashes Lincoln's name.
ABSENCE.
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,"
   One who knew has wisely said,
Since it gives us time to ponder
   Over love, though living, dead!
As we will the sweet face haunts us,
   And the voice we love is heard,
Though the accent pains and taunts us
   With a deathless hope deferred.
Could we die when love no longer
   Lives but in one constant breast,
Would that be, forsooth, to wrong her
   Who had cursed what she had blessed?
SADIE FONTAINE.
Argument.—Sébastien Fontaine, who was of French and Spanish ancestry, and John Lefair, who came of British parentage, grew up from childhood together. They were sons of rich Southern planters. When the young men came of age it was their misfortune to be rival suitors. This led to a duel, in which Fontaine was severely wounded. When he recovered from the effects of his wound Fontaine married the lady of his choice and immediately left the country for an extended stay in Europe.
A short time after Fontaine left the country Lefair married a lady of good family, and some seventeen months thereafter an heir was born to him, the same who figures in the narrative as Maurice Lefair. Among the possessions that Fontaine's wife brought to him was a slave girl, whose faultless figure, finely chiselled features, clear complexion and black straight hair, would have stamped her as an unmixed Anglo Saxon woman anywhere outside the Southern States of the United States. Fontaine early discovered a passion for this girl.
When the party reached France, Fontaine, against the wishes of his wife, placed the young girl in one of the convent schools of Paris. Possessing, naturally, a fine intellect, she made very rapid progress in the various branches of a liberal education. At the expiration of four years the party returned to the United States. A few days after their arrival in the South a child was born to the slave girl, and Mrs. Fontaine, who had developed a case of quick consumption, died at about the same time. It was given out on the Fontaine estate that the child was Mrs. Fontaine's. This was stoutly discredited by many, and by none more so than John Lefair.
I.
Poets may sing in raptured verse
The glory of Italian skies,
Or praise in language sweet and terse
The Spanish ladies' dazzling eyes;
But be it mine to languish in
The smiles of maids as rich and fair
As any that the world has seen,
And sing of balmy skies and air
And fields as peaceful and as green.
Marian, thou village of my joy!
I love thee as a babe its toy,
For thou art all that's dear to me—
Since 'neath thy oaks I first did see
My wealth of boyish hopes expand
And built those hopes in clay and sand.
O boyhood's dream! It is so fair!
A dream where joy is found in care.
Now, in my manhood, let me turn
To scenes for which I often yearn,
To forms departed that I knew—
The aged, young, the fickle, true—
Let me recount one simple tale
Of all the many on the scale
Where memory weighs her garnered store,
And lingers long its value o'er.
II.
Some fifty years ago, I ween,
In Flora's vales, all rich and green,
There dwelt a man of sober mood
Who was not bad—who was not good;
And though his lands were rich and broad,
And he of many slaves was lord,
He yet did feel the common tie
That swells the heart and thrills the eye
Of all mankind, whate'er the state
Ordained them by all-ruling Fate.
And thus his rule was just and kind,
And did those closer to him bind
Who knew that though he was their chief
He sought to spare them needless grief.
III.
Fontaine's young heiress took the name
Of Sadie, one he deemed
Was not too common, or too tame;
But it to me has seemed,
A name with more romance allied
Could just as well have been supplied.
To charming women name is much,
Since men delight to lisp all such
In accents mild and low and sweet
When empty nothings they repeat;
For love, although 'tis but a trance,
Must have all things in consonance.
The name, the form, the face, the voice,
With mental gifts, determine choice,
And make the man the willing tool
Of her who deems him god or fool.
Young Sadie was a gem, 'tis true,
The like of which we find but few
Existing to the sight of men
Or dancing on the poet's pen.
Her lips were such as gods would kiss
And deem it cream of earthly bliss;
Her eyes were such as through us thrill
The magic of a ruling will,
To which we yield with one accord
Our "right divine" as woman's lord.
Yet, we but make a beauty plain
When we attempt to it explain,
But all, and more than I have said,
Had pierced the heart and turned the head
Of one at least—Maurice Lefair—
For he it was who loved this rare
Young charmer of our Southern clime,
This meteor beauty of the time.
His love was of the furious kind
That robs a man of lucid mind:
For he was born wild passion's child,
And had from baby days been spoiled—
Untaught to curb his fretful ire,
Allowed each whim of his desire;
Manhood to him was childhood o'er,
His will less subject than before.
For him to love was to be mad,
Until possession made him glad.
IV.
The son, fit counterpart, was taught,
As soon as he could master thought,
All that his father's selfish mold
Contained, and his had room to hold.
In truth, he was a man whose mind
Was of that overbearing kind
He needed not to have been reared
To lord it o'er poor slaves—who feared
His smile or frown—to deem that he
Was more than mortal man can be.
The license of his will was known
No curb to brook. He would not own
His father's right to designate
When he should go, when he should wait.
As he was bent, just so he grew—
His wish the only law he knew.
The ancient honor of the South
Was in his lands, and in his mouth!
The Southern grandee scorns the claim
That would eclipse his knightly name,
Or law more binding than his own,
Unless by force such law be shown!
Fontaine regarded Maurice as
A venomed reptile, whom to pass
Was exercise of clemency
That scarcely could more humane be.
His boundless fund of insolence,
Which served him on most slight pretense,
Was felt by friends and met by foes
As oft with words as angry blows.
Yet some his many faults forgave,
For wealth the vilest wretch can save
From condemnation of the crowd,
When Virtue's claims are disallowed!
And many beauties—fair, select,
Of Southern soil the blest elect—
Would not have spurned his guilty hand,
But placed their love at his command.
V.
As oft the case is found to be
With men who never can agree
With men, Lefair was not the same
When ladies on him had a claim.
Indeed, he held the gentle fair
As creatures of another air,
Whom men are bound by every tie
To show each mark of gallantry.
Thus, while the men with one accord
Denounced Lefair in every word,
The ladies vowed he was "too nice,
With wealth and looks and not a vice!"
And thus the ladies ever act,
A demonstration of their tact,
And likewise of their tender heart,
Which of their natures is a part—
The part that makes the soldier brave
And noodles primp and poets rave.
Earth's proudest, most historic names,
Were won in war's destructive games.
The rarest virtues are unsung,
Such as to deathless fame belong,
Great women who have given birth
To heroes who have moved the earth,
Who trained the sons to garner fame—
Who ever speaks their sainted name!
VI.
Young Maurice was by passion swayed,
And opposition now but made
Him more resolved and bent to gain
The maid's consent, whate'er the pain;
For, in the fatal moment that
He fell a victim to his fate,
All men appeared to him as foes,
And women, too, against him rose,
Reviling and reviled, because
He brooked no reason, spurned all laws.
There was but one for whom he felt
His wayward, stubborn, nature melt
Into a feeling just to feel—
From whom, indeed, was no appeal.
VII.
I will not tarry to relate
How Maurice met and won Sadie;
There are so many ways that wait
Upon those hearts that would agree.
Indeed, their parents' stern behest
But urged the lovers to the test—
But hastened on the tragic end
'Gainst which 'tis futile to contend.
They schooled themselves their friends were foes,
And, therefore, authors of their woes;
For love is loudest in complaint
When forced to feel the least restraint.
It will not list to reason's voice,
If reason bid it not rejoice.
So Sadie and her lover found
That earth is not all peaceful ground—
For sweetest joy can make us weep,
Can steal from us the boon of sleep.
Loudly the present they bewailed,
Nor with delight the future hailed,
But feared their troubles still would last
When those they suffered all had passed.
VIII.
Our Southern fields were rich with light,
And green was nature's Summer dress;
The cotton fields were snowy white;
The corn crop tasseled in excess.
Far o'er the hillsides hastened all
The Negroes to their daily call,
And, with delight, their merry song
Echoed the hills and dales along.
What if the sun in glory rise,
Flooding the earth with his emprise?
He cannot rob the sightless night
Of its ill-omened, stealthy might
Maurice Lefair has won his bride—
Sadie Fontaine is at his side!
All Marian stands in mute amaze;
The country, too, is all ablaze.
Old John Lefair is in despair
And curses heaps upon his heir;
He'll cut him off with not a cent!
He'll show him that he can resent
A son who dares to take a bride
Who ne'er could be her father's pride.
Thus vowed Lefair, and stoutly swore
His son he'd never speak to more.
IX.
Yet was Fontaine enraged no less
Than John Lefair, and his distress
Aroused that slumbering Southern hate
Lefair had sought to aggravate;
But, had not Maurice now abused
His patience, he had still refused
To deal the crushing, vengeful blow,
Upon his long inveterate foe.
Then, though it cost him life and wealth,
He'd strike the man who won by stealth.
Thus moved by hate he sought the foe
Who robbed his home of its content,
Resolved to strike so hard a blow
That young Lefair could not resent—
If so his pride was of the type
His haughty tongue so loved to pipe;
For he would strike that Southern pride
Through her who was his peerless bride!
Then, if he still to her was true,
Time would disclose what he should do;
For had not Maurice dared to spurn
The name that his glib tongue must burn
In the rapt moment that he pressed
The charming Sadie to his breast,
And poured those words into her ear
Which none but lovers ought to hear—
Since none can speak who has not felt
And to that heaven-born rapture knelt.
X.
Thus Fontaine spoke: "I, sir, must pray
"Your patience, while, in short, I say,
"That which, in justice, you should know,
"And fitter place and time than now
"May never come again, I vow.
"Sadie—my daughter, and your wife—
"Will end, I trust, the bitter strife
"That now has stood for many a year
"Between myself and John Lefair.
"An only cherished child is she,
"And nothing less can be to me.
"My plenteous wealth and this my arm
"Will shield her from whatever harm
"The present or the future brings—
"If you'll accept of such small things!
"Their wealth with you and her, your bride,
"Your common parents will divide;—
"For though her mother was a slave,
"Her father rated as a knave,
"Her husband now will soon forget
"His wife has Afric blood in veins
"He deemed as pure as old Fontaine's!
"I leave you, hoping you much health,
"And, when you please, come share our wealth!"
XI.
Wrath pinned Lefair fast to the spot!
His vengeance was e'en half forgot!
So sudden was the crushing blow
That fell upon his haughty brow;
For he were happier in the grave
Than know the offspring of a slave
Was wife to him! And she so dear
That e'en her charmed name to hear
Was dearer than all else is dear!
XII.
Fontaine took Sadie to his breast,
Where she so oft had found sweet rest,
And soothed her sorrow and her pain,
And strove to make her smile again;
For all the world to her was he,
And all the world to him was she.
XIII.
Sadie ne'er learned why Maurice died
The coward's death of suicide!
She never knew he cursed her name
And deemed it linked with blackest shame:
Her hero still was he in death;
His last fond words love's parting breath.
XIV.
How many hearts would bleed and die—
Grow lustreless the flashing eye,
Shrink matchless forms of queenly make—
Melt hearts as pure as new snow-flake—
If from the face the mask were torn,
The brow of fraud of fraud was shorn,
And lying hearts were turned to view,
That trusting ones might read them through!
XV.
Fontaine no longer cared to live
'Midst scenes which could no pleasure give;
And Sadie's listless step and eye
Urged him to seek a friendlier sky;
And hence he sold his old domain,
And left the scenes of so much pain,
And, too, of joy and hope and pride,
And wandered over th' ocean wide;
In France his future home he made,
Where from his mind the past might fade.
New faces, objects rare and strange,
Brought to young Sadie, with the change,
A heart to her lost love resigned
And hope renewed and peace of mind;
And, in her riper womanhood,
When by a noble Frenchman wooed,
She gave again her heart and hand
And lived, the merriest in the land.
WE KNOW NO MORE.
I sometimes feel that life contains
   Nothing, in all its wealth, to pay
For half the sorrows and the pains
   That haunt our day.
Ambition lures us on and on,
   A dangerous and a treacherous guide!
With every vict'ry that is won
   Goes humbled pride!
And, still, we labor, love, and trust,
   And seek to conquer as we go!
We reap at last repose in dust—
   Naught else we know!
We leave the gewgaws of our power,
   The hearts that hate us, and adore!
And after life's distressing hour—
   We know no more!
EDGAR ALLAN POE.
I know not why, but it is true—it may,
In some way, be because he was a child
Of the fierce sun where I first wept and smiled—
I love the dark-browed Poe. His feverish day
Was spent in dreams inspired, that him beguiled,
When not along his path shone forth one ray
Of light, of hope, to guide him on the way,
That to earth's cares he might be reconciled.
Not one of all Columbia's tuneful choir
Has pitched his notes to such a matchless key
As Poe—the wizard of the Orphic lyre!
Not one has dreamed, has sung, such songs as he,
   Who, like an echo came, an echo went,
   Singing, back to his mother element.
THE BIRD HAS VANISHED.
The bird has vanished from its cage—
   Has left its prison house to me!
It will not fill its song with rage
   Again—for it is free!
Will it forget, can it forget,
   The love, the tender care, I gave,
Or feel one throb of sad regret
   That 'tis no more my slave?
Go, nameless one, and find a mate
   Which will be more than friend to thee,
But, in thy freedom, do not hate,
   Do not think ill of me!
MIRAMA.
I.
She dwelt near by the ocean wide;
The lighthouse was her earliest home;
From infancy she watched the tide
From out her elevated dome,
And saw the vessels swiftly glide
Upon the phosphorescent foam.
II.
She came to love her eyry seat
Among the friendly clouds so high,
For there 'twas calm; her breast could beat
So free she ne'er had cause to sigh;
'Twas there life's pleasure came to greet
Her as the years went slowly by.
III.
For miles along the stormy coast
Her praises loud by all were sung;
And many fearless lads did boast
Of deeds of strength from her that sprung;
And, too, the hardy fisher's toast
With the same theme as often rung.
IV.
It was when blew the winds a storm
In March, the month of wail and wind,
That from the ocean came alarm
From those the elements did blind;
And paralyzed was each stout arm,
And direst fear was in each mind.
V.
And not a soul for miles around,
Upon the shore, was near to aid,
Except the lighthouse girl. The sound,
Borne on the breeze, in sadness played,
And every other wail was drowned;
But she, brave girl, was not dismayed!
VI.
Fearless she stood, a woman true,
A beauty and a joyous thing,
Amid the storm—as if she knew
Its furious rage to her could bring
No human fear, though it should brew
Dread death, and back her efforts fling!
VII.
'Twas Duty gave to her the post
To guide the mariner afar,
And Duty held her there. A host,
Bright as the morning's brightest star,
Or terrible as Hell at most,
Her constant purpose could not mar!
VIII.
The elements did fiercer rage;
The vessel on the billows heaved,
And louder grew the din! The wage
Of war from such, I'm sure 's relieved,
For such the art of every age
Has taught to curb what Fury weaved.
IX.
Nearer the fated vessel came,
Careering to the treacherous shore;
A toy she rode, like men on fame,
And, short as theirs, her course is o'er,
For hidden rocks will sink her name
Too soon from sight forevermore.
X.
The lifeboat from its place she swung
And launched it on the tempest wave,
Then grasped the oars, with courage young,
And with a skillful hand did lave
Their tips—while Ocean loudly sung
That those she sought she could not save!
XI.
But Ocean's wail, old Neptune's groan,
Could not her resolution check;
His vaunted power she would not own;
And, though she was a tiny speck,
Superior to his dismal moan
She was, amid the furious wreck.
XII.
About her on the vasty deep
Attendants there she knew were near,
Her constant company to keep!
What if she did the storm-king hear,
Who roused the finny tribes from sleep?
She was serene. Why should she fear?
XIII.
There hovers o'er the brave and wise
A guardian not of this vain world;
A guide before them ever flies
Whose banner bright is never furled;
And 'gainst Him force of Hell may rise
But into atoms to be hurled!
XIV.
Mirama on the billows rode,
Triumphant in her fragile might.
She was at ease, she knew the road,
Though hid from her far-reaching sight
By darkness all around, o'erflowed,
Creating phantoms of the night!
XV.
Still, as the lightning darts through air,
The vessel sped towards the shore;
A thing of fright, with danger near,
A living soul, could be no more
Affrighted with a ghastly fear
Than she, that knew not what she bore!
XVI.
Her human freight dismayed, aghast,
Inactive were! They could but weep,
As ceaseless wailed the stormy blast
And shook afar the vasty deep!
Sweet Hope to them was of the past,
And in the past their hope must sleep!
XVII.
She struck! Then madly forward sped!
While from her rose a cry of woe
Which must have reached the phantom dead,
Borne on the wings of winds below—
If there be access to that bed
Where rest the souls that from us go!
XVIII.
And she made haste to them relieve,
And soon was by them on the wave;
But sorely did the maiden grieve
That, of the valiant and the brave,
They most of them she needs must leave—
But one from death could she then save!
XIX.
She stood with oars extended high;
Her craft was stout, 'gainst weather strong;
But death around her and so nigh
Bore life and fondest hopes along,
While wind and wave did roar and sigh,
And brazen Neptune led the song!
XX.
How much sore pain a generous heart
Must feel, when those it sought to aid,
By one dread stroke are borne apart
From Hope and prostrate, helpless laid,
Beyond the succor of man's art,
Which fails, as all by man that's made!
XXI.
No life without a tearful page!
No man has lived who has not felt
The tempest in its stormy rage!
The virgin snow the sun will melt,
And beauty fade by strokes of age,
And forms be bent that never knelt!
XXII.
Yet, from the ashes of our hope,
We often gain a strength unknown,
And, e'en in disappointment, grope
With surer tread our pathway lone!
Misfortune sometimes gives us scope
To feast on joys we thought had flown.
XXIII.
Although she mourned so many lost
To whom she sought their lives to give,
Men still did of her prowess boast—
For was not one of them alive!
Is not one heart that beats a host
When it is left with us to strive?
XXIV.
Yes, one brave heart that strongly beats—
Warm, pure, and to devotion true—
Is worth an army dead! The sweets
Of life he knows, and they're not few,
Who, coming home from roaming, greets
Those whom from infancy he knew.
XXV.
That night of storm and death she ne'er,
In future works of love, forgot;
And, noble maiden! did revere
The giver of her happy lot
To cheer the wind-tossed mariner
And thwart the storm-king when he'd plot!
XXVI.
For she had learned by courage rare
The good that she alone could do;
'Tis oft we know, but will not dare,
The deeds which mark the hero true,
But in our servile nature bear
To see them done but by the few!
XXVII.
Long may she live and ever prove
A woman may be true and brave;
Nor made alone was she to love,
But deeds can dare which lives do save,
For He who rules us from above
Has crowned her "Mistress of the Wave"!
A HOMELESS SPIRIT.
A homeless spirit in a homeless world astray,
I chase forever shadows through the pathless way,
Yearning for joys beyond this world of care,
And leap the present, seeking future life to share—
But seek in vain! Some hearts are constant, always true,
But such, indeed, how rare they are, and Oh, how few!
Yet, from the galling present would we haste away,
Blindly groping, ever seeking eternal day.
WHAT IS WOMAN BUT A SONG!
There was love, and there was beauty,
   In the face upturned to me;
And her hair was long and golden,
   Soft to touch and good to see;
Her blue eyes were full of laughter
   As they burned into my own,
Glowing like a priceless diamond—
   Fascinating as that stone.
What is life but love, devotion!—
   What is woman but a song—
But a lyric caught from Nature—
   But an echo sounding long—
Filling all the earth with gladness—
Filling all the earth with madness—
   What is woman but a song!
BEYOND THE VEIL.
Across our path a sunbeam gently lies;
We know not whence it came; we think we know;
But, as we watch its glories come and go,
It fades away! Whither? Into the skies?
We seek to follow it, with blinking eyes,
Beyond the Veil—of which we nothing know!
But e'en imagination is too slow
To chase a sunbeam as it heavenward flies.
The fairest and the dearest objects fade,
Just as a sunbeam comes and glides away;
But, e'en while lingering in the gloom and shade,
Struggling through sorrow's night into the day,
   We feel "'tis better to have loved and lost
   Than never to have loved"—whate'er the cost.
THE CLIME OF MY BIRTH.
Oh, take me again to the clime of my birth,
The dearest, the fairest, to me on the earth,
The clime where the roses are sweetest that bloom,
And nature is bathed in the rarest perfume!
Where the songs of the birds awake us at morn
With a thrill of delight and pleasure new born;
For the mocking bird there is loudest in hymn,
With notes ever changing, none fettering him.
When the hills of the North are shrouded in snow,
When the winds of Winter their fiercest do blow—
Then take me again to the clime of my birth,
Dear Florida—dearest to me on the earth.
THE MOCKING BIRD,
Have you e'er heard, at early morn,
The feathered poet sing his song,
Clear as a huntsman's clarion horn,
Yet softer, sweeter, and as strong?
Have you e'er felt his magic power
Soothe, as a balm, your troubled breast,
Change into mirth the gloomy hour,
Cradle th' enchanted sense to rest?
Have you e'er heard in native bowers
The mocking bird's angelic lay,
In Summer's home, the "Land of Flowers,"
Where cooling streams refresh the way?
I've roamed the woods from morn till night
In that delicious Summer clime—
For there my eyes first saw the light,
There kissed I first the cheek of Time!
I've heard the feathered poet sing—
Electrify the peace around—
Make the wild echoes gladsome ring—
With melody's divinest sound.
The wild flowers all about in bloom—
The nodding pine—the winding stream—
The orange blossoms' sweet perfume—
Ah! was it not a blissful dream?
FAH-FAH.
A Legend of the Seminole Indians.
List to the tale of Fah-Fah,
Fah-Fah, the Indian maid;
So brave and lovely was she
Her virtues should not fade.
The pride of the lone prairie,
With black and searching eyes,
She wandered free the forests
And slept beneath the skies.
Ogo, the Chief, her parent,
Regarded her with pride,
And claimed she was the beauty
Of all the prairie wide.
The youth who won his Fah-Fah
Must be a valiant brave,
A warrior wise in council
Whom Nature prowess gave.
And there were two young warriors
Who sought young Fah-Fah's hand,
And one was brave Lomnaker
Of Ogo's loyal band.
And none of all the warriors
Could better draw the bow,
Or mount the Indian pony,
Or wield the long lasso.
His voice was heard in council,
Where scars of honor spoke,
'Mongst men who had borne bravely
The light and heavy yoke.
And, next, the Chief, Amwamba,
His haughty claims preferred—
Amwamba, quick to anger,
To danger long inured.
Ogo disliked this Chieftain,
But more his warriors feared;
He wished to give his Fah-Fah
To one his counsels shared.
He dreaded a collision
With this great warrior Chief,
And pain him 'twould Lomnaker
To cause a cureless grief.
He shrewdly dropped the matter;
His Fah-Fah must decide
To which of her brave suitors
She wished to be a bride.
Then both the tribes did gather
Upon the level plain,
To know the lucky suitor
The Prairie Rose would gain.
Old Ogo signaled silence
And lifted up his voice:
"You must name now, my daughter;
The warrior of your choice;
"They both are brave and valiant,
To honor known and fame;
And your choice of a partner
Will cause you naught of shame."
And then there was excitement,
But yet no word arose;
And silent was young Fah-Fah,
While thinking which to choose.
The rival suitors fiercely
Upon each other glared,
And both the tribes in anger
About them wildly stared.
Young Fah-Fah raised her eyes up,
On young Lomnaker gazed,
Then to his side moved quickly,
By love and ardor dazed!
The human mass in silence
A moment did remain,
Then 'rose loud yells of fierceness
That echoed o'er the plain.
Lomnaker stood with valor
By his elected bride,
And, with the arm of courage,
Felled many at his side.
Amwamba rushed upon him
And aimed a deadly blow,
Which, had not Fah-Fah warded,
Would sure have laid him low,
The rival chieftains grappled,
With prowess laid about,
While from a thousand voices
Arose a deafening shout.
Then ceased the other warriors
The clatter of their bows,
To watch in breathless silence
Their champions deal the blows.
So valiant, well-matched warriors
We do not often see,
And long the time in coming
Their like again will be!
His foe Lomnaker conquered,
And trampled on his head!
He proudly stood the victor—
Amwamba now was dead.
IN TOKEN OF THE LOVE YOU GAVE.
In token of the love you gave,
   The faith, the trust, reposed in me,
   When our young hearts were gay and free,
I plant this flower upon thy grave!
The world is far too poor to give
   A value like it took away!
   I nevermore a joyous day,
Since you are gone, shall know or live.
WE MUST GROW OLD.
We must grow old! The years go by,
Sometimes on wings they seem to fly;
But why such haste? We know not why!
We only know that we grow old!
Sometimes, alas! the years they go
As if with leaden feet, so slow
We faint from pain. We cannot know
Wherefore or why, but we grow old!
Each vanished year its own sad tale
Of disappointment, woe, and wail,
Adds to the score, until we fail,
Since we grow old! We must grow old.
The broken links of life's short chain
Can never find their place again;
The heart will bleed when pierced with pain,
When loved ones die, and we grow old.
Into the dark unknown we take
The hopes misfortune could not shake,
Pure as the mountain's snowy flake,
Where all is well—when we are old.
HIGH ABOVE THE WRECKS OF AGES.
High above the wrecks of ages,
Brightening all of hist'ry's pages,
Love has shone,
Planet-like, in life's dark heaven,
"Sweetest boon to mortals given,"
Sweet alone!
Life is brief, but Love's eternal,
Always young, as Spring is vernal,
Always strong.
Give me love in largest measure,
From your hearts' abundant treasure,
Is my song.
THE HEART THAT IS PINING.
The heart that is pining for love that is vain
Will outlive its sorrow and conquer its pain,
Will seek where is hidden the balsam 'gainst woe,
And smile with the merry in pleasure's glad flow.
A few rashly seek to forget in red wine
Th' affection they strove with their love to entwine,
But they are far wiser who pine not, but choose
To seek and secure them an easier won rose.
This life is too short and this world is too fair
To bury existence in sorrow and care,
And hearts are too plenty to seek what is lost,
Thus making life's Summer a Winter of frost.
DUKALON.
PART I.
"Then, what is life," I cried— 
—Shelley.
And life is thorny, and youth is vain.
—Coleridge.
All my hopes, where'er thou goest,
Wither—yet, with thee they go.
—Byron.
Guy Dukalon of worth possessed his share;
With more than manly height endowed was he;
And long and silken was his golden hair.
He was a dreamer, careless, happy, free;
A creature to the human slavery bound—
A creature of the earth, the air, the sea;
But he was not a dreamer, ever found
In melancholy's train. Forsooth, some said
He was a poet, gifted in the sound
Of all the tuneful chords in heart and head;
The language knew of every blooming flower;
And, it was said, he could the fury dread
Of savage beasts, prone to their kind devour,
Disarm with his strange gifts. And his sweet song,
With trembling variations, filled the hour
With melody divine, when, clear and strong,
He used his art to banish haunting care.
But not to those did Dukalon belong
Who sing for empty praise. His songs did bear
A charmèd message to the gracious throne
Of endless Mercy, and the Lord did hear,
And angels blest. He sang to those alone,
The chosen dwellers of the earth and sky,
Whose deathless souls were kindred to his own—
Pitching his notes to auditors so high
That mortal man, as angels fair, unbent
To hear; and, when he ceased, a joyous sigh
Bore testimony that his raptures spent
Their force and sweetness where they'd live forever,
Reverberations into th' ages sent!
He looked into life as into a river,
And saw reflected not what others saw,
Or, with their finite vision, could see ever;
For, as the mocking bird in song can draw
More diverse, sweeter notes, the soul to move
Than all the feathered hosts, by that same law
Of matchless wisdom and exhaustless love,
Some visions see where others stare in space!
'Twas so with Dukalon. And high above,
And far beneath, he saw, and so could trace
A truer tale of human joy and pain,
Of love and hate, which actuate all the race!
He did not need to use his powers for gain;
He little cared for earth's delusive fame;
He knew inconstant man had always slain
The gods he honored most, covered the name
With execrations his false reverence
Had glorified! The rabble's praise may tame,
Intoxicate, the soul of Innocence;
Not so with him who knows its vulgar breath
To be a fetid exhalation, whence
Are generated seeds of woe and death!
And he deludes himself who plans to live
Beyond the years of th' inspired prophet's faith.
Thus mused young Dukalon. The world could give
Him much, and much had given, for he was blest
With robust youth and wealth, for which men strive,
And oft in vain; a rich-stored mind possessed,
And fancy that could soar to worlds unknown
And people them with more that e'er caressed
With trusting love or cursed with hate our own,
Since clothed in more ethereal form the while,
For life is life, lived in whatever zone.
His name was ancient—and you need not smile—
As antiquity in our country goes;
He ample acres owned, long mile on mile,
But turned from them. As birds of song repose,
Not long in field or tree, but flit and sing,
Or as the bee that hums from rose to rose,
Restless in the fresh gladness of the Spring,
Not pausing long, seeking new fields of sweets,
Sipping awhile, awhile upon the wing,
So Dukalon. Now gazes he on sheets
Of glassy water of a lake, or stream
Wildly leaping through a glade; now he repeats,
In woodland solitude, some thrilling theme
His wayward fancy caught; care-free in all,
A genius born. Such Dukalon did seem,
And such he was. Nor had the schools withal,
Nor residence afar, changed him a whir.
Still through the fields his jocund voice would call
The yelping hounds the hare to chase; still wit
And roguish pranks were his; still was a boy
In heart and soul. And the long years did sit
But lightly on him. Age did not destroy
His childhood dreams. But now misfortune's gloom
Came o'er his careless life and killed his joy!
It seemed to Dukalon a silent tomb
Had swallowed up the day in rayless night!
And all feel thus who face in youth the doom
Of their first love, sweet love!—sweet e'en in flight,
When it is fresh, and fair to see, and young,
Snatched from the feeling and the raptured sight
In its virginal morn, by the serpent stung!
And it seemed death to Dukalon, a sting
More awful than to die, since he among
His fellows hence must be a nameless thing,
Bereft of any save the voice of woe,
A harp unstrung, except the mournful string!
What had he lost? Ay, what? When fell the blow,
Though strong he was and brave, he reeled like one
By strong drink crazed; his cheeks' vermilion glow
Vanished to paleness; and his eyes scarce shone—
Dull, lustreless, and dead—bright orbs of light
Eclipsed that lit for him fair worlds alone!
They thought that he would die, crushed by the blight
Of youth's first faith, he was so motionless
Who long had shown so much of manly might
In the fierce glare of social nothingness!
Crushed was young Dukalon! The world could give
Like that it took away, his grief the less
To make—why, nothing! What is life to live
When love is dead, or turned to hate, in man?
In vain against obdurate Fate we strive.
Let him assume indifference who can,
And play the Stoic's part, and such are few,
When Cupid's dart the trusting heart doth span,
And lingers there, and no fond hand and true,
Responsive to the bleeding victim's plea,
Is raised to pull it out and heal with dew,
Distilled from eyes of gentlest sympathy,
The cruel laceration! His loyal heart,
Faithful in all, so fickle could not be;
He mourned for what was lost. He could no part
Assume—so generous his nature was—
So free from all Deception's subtle art.
Sophine had come, a shadow from a glass,
Light as the breeze that fans the gorgeous rose,
And tore his tender heart to shreds, alas!
For he had worshipped when he saw repose
Stamped on her brow, and majesty withal,
And chafed his burning passion to disclose;
For youth is vain, and little recks 'twill fall
When lovely woman's smile allures it on
To the blind transports of her fatal thrall.
Freely the galling chain young Dukalon
Had gladly lettered on his life, and youth
With Orient pearls the untried way had strewn;
It was not love's unfailing charm, in truth,
But passion, fancy, equal wealth and birth,
That caused the twain to plight undying troth.
The veil withdrawn, of love a woeful dearth
Apparent was! Their thoughts and tastes unlike,
They neither could perceive the other's worth;
And discontent, like waters o'er a dike
Madly leaping, entered their loveless home,
And there abided! Law and custom strike
Dismay and fear to hearts of those who roam,
In thoughtlessness or pique, from changeless rules
Of nature, fixed. They rail in vain and foam
Who turn, in strength or weakness, the sharp tools
Of vengeance on themselves. And men will err;
For some are wise, some simple, some are fools;
Some err from over-confidence, some fear
And some because a passion to go wrong
Is bone of their bone. Wherever they steer
Their craft they find the rocks and shoals among
The breakers hid, or rashly seek them out.
Then, others, too, there are, by nature strong,
Who err from ignorance. These tossed about
Forever are, because they fell before
They learned to stand; and the cruel, heartless shout—
The fear of Scandal's tongue—forevermore
Makes cowards of them! Parents who should guide
And shape th' impulsiveness of youth do o'er
And o'er let it run wild, till, far and wide,
The seed that blossoms to a life of woe
Is sown. The poet's hopes had died
Because, before the struggling down did grow
Upon his classic lip, no parent's law,
Restraining power, was interposed to show
The man his duty. And great was the flaw
Infatuated youth had failed to see
In the picture his vanity did draw!
Young Dukalon had wed right thoughtlessly,
And dreamed a treacherous hour he loved, and well,
His blushing bride, as thoughtless as was he.
And all who loved the twain made haste to tell
How brilliant was the match, how sweet the bride,
How glowed her cheeks, how high their hopes must swell!
And thus the idle chatter ran. But wide
And turbulent the outstretched Future lay,
On whose storm-bosom they as one must ride
Forever on, through all the night and day,
Till death the farce—if farce it proved to be,
In which no love would smooth the tedious way—
Should end! Short was the dream! Then, misery
Of years was lived in hours, till bondage made
Each of them feverish—anxious to be free!
Be free! What human bondage can degrade
A man or woman as the law that binds
Unloving souls in wedlock! Nor can fade,
While life remains, remembrance from the minds
Of those so joined the everlasting shame
Of such disastrous folly; for it grinds,
Corrodes, eating the vitals as a flame
That never quenchèd is! It is a stain,
Indelible, upon fair hope and name.
He whose smile was magic against all pain,
Whose life was free as zephyrs of a morn
In Summer lands that blow o'er hill and plain,
Freighted with health, was now with doubts forlorn
And discontent made miserable, his voice
Of music and of careless gladness shorn.
The things that made him once in life rejoice
No longer could his fancy catch and hold;
Indifferent he was, bereft of choice.
The dross remained; evanished had the gold.
The world looked on, but little could it see.
To others' woes mankind are chill and cold.
He who would live in men's esteem must be
Encased in steel, harder than flinty rock,
Beyond their treacherous smile and sympathy,
Or be of every dunce the laughing stock!
And if, perforce, his grief should come to view,
He may not find his strength survive the shock!
The friends Misfortune has are always few,
And they are oft abashed by sneers and scorn,
And skulk away, too craven to be true!
Young Dukalon was proud. He would have drawn
His life-blood from his heart ere men should make
A by-word of his woe! He had been born
To scoff at jeers and scorn. Nothing could shake,
Therefore, his purpose to his pain conceal
From friends and foes, e'en though his heart should break.
He bore the torture of domestic steel,
Pierced deep into his lacerated heart,
And oft it made him faint and blindly reel,
So merciless it was! But, to his part
Assigned, he strove to be both brave and strong,
Wincing in silence from the pricking dart.
He was a child of passion and of song.
To love and to be loved, his faith repose
In womankind, to feel his friends among
No shadows dark his buoyant soul enclose,
Were parts of his young life, as much as scorn
And lofty condescension of his foes.
The poet's soul was his, a poet born;
And he was moved and felt as other men,
But in a stronger sense, as men are shorn
Of giant strength, I ween, who have not been
Endowed with giant form; and strength of mind
Was his, and weakness too; and these were seen
In two extremes, and stronger of their kind;
For all great virtues in the race are found,
Too oft, with vices just as great combined;
So Bacon great to Bacon base was bound;
So other men as great a double life
Have lived whose names through all the world resound!
Young Dukalon had lived beyond the strife
Of those who struggle from their youth for bread;
He had not felt the keenness of the knife
As some who Wisdom's thorny path do tread.
Seductive Knowledge in her richest guise
Before his eyes had her rare treasures spread;
And he had lingered 'neath the friendly skies
When the moon, and the stars, and solitude
And he were all alone, when spirit life flies
To spirit life, compelled by a kindred mood,
A sympathy, unearthly of its kind!
Then would he cease upon his woes to brood,
Lulled by the mystery sublime that twined
Itself about his life, like harmony
That soothes to rest the weary, troubled mind.
How strong and sweet the charm and force that lie
In meditation when so surrounded!
Then all things vain and crude within us die,
And all that's God-like, pure and good, doth shed
A calm and holy halo 'bout our dream;
'Tis then the human part of us is dead.
Unseen, unheard, Life's boisterous, treacherous stream,
As it rushes onward, in mad commotion,
More cruel and destructive than it can seem,
To where the dark unknown, the boundless ocean
Of destiny lies hid from human ken!
The poet felt, somehow, he was a portion
Of this vastness and this mystery when,
In the sweet silence of the voiceless night,
He tore himself apart from selfish men
And revelled in a feeling and a sight
Denied his fellows! And it was so sweet
To feel the presence of Eternal light!
But man is human. His lead-weighted feet
Will tread the earth, howe'er his soul may soar
Where angel choirs their psalms of joy repeat
Till the heav'ns' diamond-studded halls do o'er
And o'er with rhapsodies resound! And so
Young Dukalon, although he would no more
Have come to earth, oft found his classic brow
Damp with the dews of night, the stars all dead,
The moon grown pale, and feel his body grow
Alive to pain, and th' angel choirs hushed and fled—
The trance-hour vanished to its unknown goal!
Once he had cried aloud, with bended head:
"Great Ruler of the troubled human soul,
"If in Thy mandate thunders, as they sweep
"From burning tropic to the icy pole,
"A grain of hope remains for those who weep,
"Dragging a chain that causes endless pain,
"Oh, let me in its power my senses steep!
"Let me not hopeless hope, nor plead in vain!
"Oh, banish Thou the all-pervading gloom
"That erst so many trembling souls has slain!
"This earth for man is but a haunted tomb—
"Dread, fathomless—when spectre Doubt enthrones
"Itself within the mind and knells Hope's doom!
"How the vast ocean water heaves and groans,
"Lashed by the angry winds in tempest hour!
"So man, frail man, oppressed, wails long, and moans,
"Disconsolate, when Thy controlling power
"Tosts his frail life upon the storm's wild breast
"And makes him to its fury bend and cower!
"O Thou Spirit of the boundless air, if rest
"There be under the high o'er-arching sky,
"Let me the potence of its magic test!
"Let me unto its hidden treasures fly,
"That I may steep my senses in its calm,
"Dissolve my restless nature in a sigh,
"Live but one moment in its soothing balm,
"Measure one second what it is to be
"Supreme within myself, possess the charm
"Philosophers have sought in vain—be free!
"Then, when the precious moment's grace had fled,
"When nothing more in earth or heaven for me
"Remained, all spent, if Thou shouldst me then wed
"To sudden nothingness, quench the light
"Forever of my soul—where'er it led,
"I'd follow, satisfied, into the night!"
One moment man soars where th' angels abide;
The next he falls to earth, a wingless sprite!
"Oh, what is life to me?" the poet cried.
PART II.
Sophine unsuited was to Dukalon
In all that makes community of aim
And purpose—that blest singleness alone
Which melts two lives in one, with common name
And aspiration, having only eyes
That see each other's beauties. They must tame,
Who wed, their soul's desire for change; be wise
And satisfied to live apart in that
They have absorbed; seeing no other skies
Than those that canopy their home. To rate
No other love as that which is their own
Resolves the dual into th' unit state.
The man and woman must become as one
When they assume the marriage obligation;
And if, in all and all, this be not done,
A deep unrest, and even desperation,
Will make their loveless lives an earthly hell.
Young Dukalon, in vain exasperation,
Lived this, and more, which, as the Voudoo's spell,
Was as a haunting madness in the brain,
Making his heart like ocean billows swell
With vainest of resolves; each one a chain
That bound him to the life he loathed, because
He could not 'scape it, but must bear the pain
Of constant friction with it, since the laws,
And his high sense of duty, held him fast
In hated bonds! The wind takes up the straws
The sturdy mowers on the wayside cast,
And then the light twigs where it listeth blows;
How oft th' unguarded actions of the past
The present with dread terrors fill—with woes,
With burnings of the heart, with wailing hate
That dies on th' air, with curses for our foes—
Until all th' earth to us seems desolate,
In which is heard no more a friendly voice
To cheer us in the fight with adverse Fate!
Actions are mysteries we cannot poise
Upon the vain philosophies we deem
Dissolvents of our doubts. The poet's choice
Had been to bear his yoke, howe'er his dream
Had bodied forth for him companion sweet,
Whose life should melt into his own and seem
A portion of his life. His untried feet
Had stumbled in the path! His mind, oppressed,
Trembled, as one who suffers dire defeat.
His manly resolution but distressed
Him all the more as fickle Time disclosed
How much of Discontent he was possessed—
How weak the vessel was in which reposed
The first rich fruit of his impulsive youth!
A towering Trojan wall had now enclosed
His life. How could he scale its heights, forsooth,
How 'scape the tyranny himself had made?
Alas! the dangers in a hasty troth!
Him should he let this tyranny degrade
When love, content, domestic harmony,
Had all dissolved, as does a twilight shade,
Leaving him nothing but regrets? Should he
The agony prolong, all hope forswear,
Endure a bondage whose slow misery
Tortures and destroys? Must he then bear
The strain until his strength could bear no more,
And wasted nature yield to phantom care?
As a vessel in the tempest's shock and roar,
Did Dukalon's emotions move and sway
His every purpose, and would evermore,
Shutting from him contentment's genial ray,
With all its inspiration, and making
Tartarean gloom! The future—had it a day
He saw not, wherein flowers of laughing Spring
Would gladden hedge, and garden, and the field,
And birds their joyous melodies would sing?
Or would the night forever throw its shield
Of cureless woe about his life, enchain
Him to a loveless mate, his lips be sealed,
Speechless, save in regret, remorse and pain?
The sun shone forth in royal majesty;
The flowers blossomed in field and dell and plain;
But Dukalon their beauties could not see.
The groves were vocal, but escaped his ears.
Stone-blind and deaf and speechless is mis'ry
In noble men. It finds in voiceless tears
Expression, all unseen, unheard; if, too,
That source be not dried up, as oft appears.
There are, indeed, degrees of human woe,
Not visible, that eat the vital parts
As fires within the earth that burn and glow
Forever, till a spiral column darts
Into the skies, and granite mountains heave
And mankind quake in homes and crowded marts.
So Nature works. All who rejoice or grieve,
In silence or loud lamentation, feel
The pain no earthly physic can relieve.
Accursed is Adam's seed! Does Death's sharp steel,
Cutting the thread of life, destroy the pains
To which the flesh is heir, for woe or weal?
Why fill the future state with woes, with chains,
Undreamed of in the justice of the Lord,
When present time more than its share contains?
Go! "Let the dead past bury its dead" horde!
Go! Let the future its dread secrets keep!
Go! Live the present! Why dread th' unseen sword
Suspended o'er our heads? What if it leap
From its hair chain this instant that we pause
And plunge us into gloom as Styx is deep!
Our destiny is shaped by binding laws,
Irrevocable! And none can estimate
One inch of space to right the seeming flaws
That lure us to our doom. The poet's fate
Had been a pleasing thing. His days had sped
Away like dreams. The future seemed to wait,
Expectant of his coming, but to lead
Him up the sacred mount of Fame and Power,
And crown him with ambition's glorious meed.
And he had built upon the happy hour
Thus pictured to his view, as dreamers will;
Nor reeked he of the furious storms that lower
Forever o'er the Future's path. And still,
When darkness came, he hoped and trusted Time
Would yet the promise of the past fulfill;
But all in vain! He upward ceased to climb—
Stood still. The burden was too great to bear—
Despair replaced his hopes and thoughts sublime.
His nature was to furious gales of care,
In all, untempered, and Misfortune's frown
Withered his hopes, as poison in the air,
And made him purposeless. As he had sown,
So must he reap. But all unused was he
To pluck the thistle where the rose had grown;
To find the bitters where the sweets should be;
To weep where he had smiled; to hate the thing
He had adored; to sigh and long to free
Himself from loveless chains! The bird may sing,
A prisoner in a cage; but will his song
With Freedom's rapturous joy and gladness ring?
No! No! His notes, however clear and strong,
Will ring with desolation of his state,
Will plead again his mates to be among.
You have upon sweet Freedom but the gate
To shut, and bolt the prisoner within,
T' arouse grim vengeance and relentless hate.
Nor can escape this hate the man of sin,
The man of blameless life, or brave, or meek;
Desperate resolves, where Freedom ends, begin.
Young Dukalon a prison strong and bleak,
In innocence and confidence, had made;
Nor through its walls could he a passage break,
Securely caged within its cheerless shade.
And never victim of Illusion yet
Felt loveless chains his manhood so degrade!
In home, in solitude, did sigh and fret
The hapless youth, unmindful of the things
That gave him pleasure once; could not forget
The irritations of the hour. The strings
Of hope were snapped asunder. All undone
Ambition was; dried up life's cooling springs!
And Dukalon a student was, and won
The honest praise of men, and women, too,
By loftiness of purpose. His life had run
In currents smooth till now. And, as is true
Of all who matchless genius do possess,
Much in himself he lived, and lessons drew
From Nature in her fadeless loveliness;
Scorning the social smallness of the day—
Its endless gossip and the emptiness
That passed for wit amongst the thoughtless gay,
And e'en the learned few, who can unbend,
And list to those who nothing have to say.
Not so with Dukalon. To condescend,
To waste the precious hours in idle prating,
With noodles for a woman's smiles contend,
In Fashion's vacuous haunts to seek his rating—
These Dukalon a passing notice gave;
All satisfied to see them through a grating,
Standing afar off—solemn, dreamful, grave.
When there came feelings of a sober kind,
'Twas not in crowded halls, where sane men rave
And women shriek, thinking they pleasure find
In sensual waltz and babalistic noise;
But, rather, in the fields and woods his mind
Congenial freedom found. There could rejoice
In nature's grand, surpassing loveliness,
Young Dukalon, his fancy give a voice;
And he would people the vast wilderness
With pulsing form and life; and human pain
And aspiration lost their bitterness,
Under the soothing spell that oft hath slain
The genius that had trusted in its power.
But now it seemed to him that not again
Would come the rapture of such halcyon hour.
The genii of the place, his dreams, had fled,
As flies the sun before a thunder shower.
"The concord of sweet sounds" that so had fed
His thirsting soul were heard no more, and he
Had lost the mastery of song; was dead
To every feeling, save the misery
Of domestic inharmony and woe.
Of this no word was said, and ne'er could be,
Of harshness or reproach. He could not show,
Save in silence studied, the discontent
That drove the animation from his brow,
The roses from his cheeks—which may have spent
Their bloom in his dead eyes, so dull they were
And lustreless. And so, where'er he went,
Whate'er he did, a haunting shadow near
Pursued and harassed him. The young Sophine,
Unlike her lord, gave not her life to care,
But sought and found, a reigning social queen,
Oblivion of the love her home denied;
Nor was she troubled. Love had never been,
E'en when she stood by young Dukalon's side,
Before the man of God, more than a thought,
Vague and unformed, in which to be a bride,
The bride of Dukalon, her fancy caught,
E'en as the spider's web ensnares the fly;
Thoughtless that precious jewels oft are sought
A fatal vanity to satisfy,
Since death or endless trouble follows fast
Possession. But stone-blind is vanity;
It recks not of the future, and the past—
Is past. The newest toy controls its whim;
And while the fancy, satisfied, doth last,
The pleasing thing before the eyes doth swim,
Seducing to sweet but treacherous repose
The thoughtless, yet all delighted victim.
Thus with Sophine. She was a gorgeous rose,
Charming to see, but odorless and cold,
That flourished in Dukalon's wintry snows.
Shallow in all her nature, she could hold
No serious thought; yet deemed that she had made
A splendid choice. She could not find the gold
Beneath the poet's brow of gloom and shade,
Nor cared a doit, so vain she was and blind.
In priceless fabrics when she was arrayed,
With social pleasures hedged about, her mind
And soul steeped in the splendors of the hour,
The poet's moods could not her fancy bind.
She loved him not a whit, nor thought him sour,
But shunned him, since she could not comprehend
The vastness of his mental depth and power;
She left him to himself. They could not blend
Their natures, so unlike were they. Thus wide
And wider grew the path they did descend!
And she was cheerful, full of empty pride,
Finding relief in ample wealth's display;
While gloomy he, brooding o'er joys denied,
Lost in the tortuous windings of life's way.
PART III.
The noble Saint John's river murmured north,
Into the great Atlantic's heaving breast,
A giant careless of its strength and worth,
Disdaining haste and never needing rest;
A glorious stream. Upon its bank there stood
The home of Dukalon, and there caressed
His laureate brow the breath of solitude,
The fragrance of the orange blossoms, and
The tropic plants of garden, field and wood.
It was a Paradise, enchanted land,
Where the rapt mocking bird forever sings
The gladness of his soul; the curlew grand,
Spotless in the whiteness of his plumage, springs
Into the air, voiceless, but matchless in
His perfect grace, propelled on noiseless wings.
There Dukalon had lived and dreamed and seen
The sunshine and the shadow of the years;
There he had learned to love the forest green,
And diamond dews, that looked like virgin tears,
Shy nestling on the modest violet,
And wildwood rose and jasmine. And his cares,
How oft would he by that grand stream forget,
Watching its noiseless and majestic flow
Upward to th' ocean! Such a scene! And, yet—
The odorous air, vocal with song, soft, low,
Now swelling to a chorus wild and sweet,
Making the listener's cheeks with pleasure glow
And all his soul with intense rapture beat—
And, yet, young Dukalon but grieved and sighed—
For what! Some "daughter of the gods" to meet
Who would his boundless thoughts and love divide,
His aspirations stimulate; to be
In all his fit companion and his pride;
To share his gladness and his misery;
Be of himself a sympathizing part,
Unfettered by the world's dear vanity,
Content to be a portion of his heart
And hopes and home—for this he sighed and wailed,
Living within himself, from men apart,
Wasting his days, deploring he had failed
In all, since one discord had marred the whole!
Listless his footsteps grew; and his cheeks paled,
As if the fire had left for ay his soul—
So miserable he was! 'Twas in this state
Of frigid cold, numbing as th' Arctic pole,
Of gloom and discontent, that some great Fate,
Unknown, unseen of men, gave Dukalon
A taste of what he wished, to make him hate,
Perchance, himself the more. He was alone,
Surrounded by the forest wild; the stream
Before him lay. He sat upon a stone,
Wrapt in the reveries of a charming dream,
And, for the moment, lost to everything
Of earthly kind, when, suddenly, a scream
Rang out upon the air and made him spring
Erect, frightened; and, then, again! again!
Until the woodland with the cries did ring.
The dreamer to the spot did haste, and strain
His eyes to see the author of the cries;
Nor had he far to search the cause t' explain:
A small sailboat before his anxious eyes
Lay upturned near the shore, and to it clung
A maiden fair. When past his first surprise,
Forthwith into the royal stream he sprung,
For he could breast the waves with grace and ease,
And soon rescued the maiden, fair and young—
Minnette! She was a picture 'neath the trees—
The silent monarchs of the forest wild,
As gently fanned her brow the friendly breeze—
As on the gallant Dukalon she smiled,
Murmuring her gratitude in words so sweet,
So low, his wildly throbbing pulse was thrilled
Beyond control. All drenched from head to feet,
The snow-white drapery clinging to her form,
She stood erect, pale as a driven sheet,
Straight as a willow, with eyes that could disarm—
Such sympathy, such passion, they proclaimed—
The prince of skeptics by their witching charm.
She was not beautiful, as some are famed;
But there was majesty in form and face
And eyes and accents of the voice that tamed
Rebellion into loyalty. A space
Silent they stood, mute, in the scrutiny
Of kindred beings seeking to replace
Some long-lost vision they had prayed to see
In flesh, as they had seen in dreams before,
In hours that never could forgotten be:
For there are in the world, on some fair shore,
Always "two souls with but a single thought,"
And if they meet not, sigh forevermore,
Disconsolate! So Fate has for us wrought.
These two had never met, but each one knew
The other well, and more than this was naught.
"I live near by. I often sail, as you,
"Perhaps, have seen, my little craft. To-day,
"Howe'er, the wind too fiercely for me blew;
"Hence my mishap. I never can repay
"The debt of gratitude to you I owe.
"I thank you, Sir;" and then she went away,
Protesting that her savior should not go
With her, as she knew well the path that led
To her own home the river bend below.
But still he followed from afar, in dread
Some other mishap might befall the maid;
Then, from a knoll, he watched her as she fled
Till she was lost behind the ample shade
Of the tall oaks and orange trees that stood
About her home, near where the river strayed.
Then Dukalon turned back into the wood.
And stretched himself upon the moss and grass,
And closed his eyes, and dreamed his solitude
Was Paradise, in which for him, alas!
Only one face—one form—one smile—was seen
As swift the host of queenly maids did pass
Through his mad brain. She was, indeed, a queen—
Minnette! A queen of beauty and of grace,
With royal height and majesty of mien.
How long among the shadows of the place
He was—how long the dream controlled his sense—
How long he lived his life in her sweet face—
He could not say. The sun had vanished hence
When he awoke; the night had come; the moon
Rode high; the stars shone forth; vapors immense
Had settled o'er the river. 'Twas a boon
To linger yet awhile, in the still night,
Where she had been, to vanish all too soon.
And thus, alone, dreaming, the lovelorn wight
Lingered, where nature reigned in absolute
Supremacy, and where his fancy's flight
Could penetrate infinity, and, mute,
The aspirations of his soul reach where
The twinkling stars athwart the skies did shoot,
Idly disporting in the waste of air.
Guy Dukalon dreamed out his poet soul,
Enchained by the smile of a maiden fair—
A maiden fair who would in all control
His life forevermore! As strong as Fate,
Her siren power o'er all his nature stole,
And held him where he was, bidding him wait
To hear her footsteps on the sward, again
To see her face. She seemed his long-lost mate.
Then came a doubt that gave him sharpest pain:—
Was not Minnette a myth? Had he not been
The victim of a caprice of his brain?
Had it all been a dream? What had he seen?
Was it all real? It was so very queer—
The vanished hours, and all that came between!
He shuddered at his doubt. A sudden fear
Came over him. He from the stone arose
And sought the spot, the glassy river near,
Where all had passed so late that made repose
A stranger to him ever more. There lay
The tiny craft, that had o'erturned, and, close,
A dainty handkerchief, damp with the spray,
The modest moon revealed. This was a prize,
An argument to drive all doubt away.
Guy Dukalon stood there, with downcast eyes,
Deeply musing, his soul all stirred with fire;
While hope, sweet hope! ascended to the skies.
In his delirious bliss he did aspire
To-he knew not what! Her name unknown, wed
Or unwed, asked not, cared not. One desire,
A rash, o'ermastering wish, possessed his head.
His troubled life no longer seemed a waste,
Hopeless. He wished no more that he were dead!
Why? He the fruit forbidden to his taste
Had craved, the fruit in which lurked pain and woe
And lingering death! Again, he felt abased,
Revulsion came, that he could sink so low
As prove a traitor, e'en in thought, to one
He had forsworn himself all love to show!
In the dead stillness of the night a groan
Escaped the hapless Dukalon. Where turn
He would his path with shattered hopes was strown!
Into his soul despondency did burn,
Forever forcing on him gaunt despair,
From which no wholesome lesson could he learn.
He hovered near the spot until the air
Of dewy morning fanned his fevered brow,
On which gloom sat enthroned anew, and care;
Then wandered from the scene, with head bowed low,
And listless step, and trembling hand, and heart
From which the blood in sluggish streams did flow.
Henceforth his days were spent from men apart,
In solitude, and many hours of night,
Haunting the scenes that could alone impart
Some solace to his soul, some softening light
Diffuse, praying that she would come again—
And, then! He shut the selfish world from sight,
And mused and mused; and all to him was plain,
Though mad confusion reigned supreme in all
The treasured hopes that struggled in his brain.
Thus sat he, dreaming, as the leaves did fall
About him from the monarchs of the place,
When that longed presence—gracious, queenly, tall—
Before him stood, confusion in her face—
Since unsuspecting was she there to find
A living soul. But Dukalon, with grace
And easy courtesy, relieved her mind,
Calming her fears; and then, by slow degrees,
Minnette to his address herself resigned.
No one in converse could more aptly please
Than Dukalon, or hold attention more
Subservient to his will—master of ease.
The young Minnette, protesting o'er and o'er
That she must go, remained, and gladly, too,
Restrained as she had never been before
By man's persuasive voice; for it is true
That Dukalon possessed in large degree
A wondrous fascinating power, and drew
His kind, as magnet needles draw; and he
A royal host could be, or he could freeze
The social atmosphere till misery,
Without apparent cause, would replace ease
And merriment. Young Minnette felt his power
To charm, to fascinate, instruct, to please,
And yielded, e'en in that most parlous hour
When he rescued her from a watery grave.
And some had told her he was vain and sour—
Reserved and cold—took nothing—nothing gave—
Haunted the solitudes, seeking some nook
Umbrageous where to dream, or watch the wave
Not far removed, or read some favorite book—
Unsocial, morose, inaccessible;
But none of these was in his pleased look,
His brilliant eyes, his heart's impulsive swell;
As Minnette sat beside him near the stream,
Reading his soul and comprehending well
Its richness and its depth. And he did seem
In nothing strange to her, or cold, or vain,
But eloquent in all—such as her dream
Had bodied him who should not plead in vain
To share her life. And long beneath the trees
They sat, unheeding that the sun again
Had run his course, and that the gathering breeze
Was harsh and damp, until an owl's shrill hoot—
A bird of evil omen, if you please—
Warned them hence, ere the darkness should dispute
Their free egress. And many hours they spent
In this retreat, reaping the precious fruit
Of classic masters or discourse; content,
Withal, in Friendship's deferential ties,
Nor thought of else, nor more was ever meant.
All cloudless were th' ambrosial Southern skies;
All odorous was the perfume-ladened air;
Young Dukalon had what he most could prize;
Young Minnette lived, heart-free of any care.
Young Dukalon forgot the chains he wore—
Borne on the swirling tide, he cared not where.
The Winter fled away, and Spring once more
In gladness came; and Minnette woke one morn
To find her tropic dreams forever o'er.
"I go back to my Northern home," forlorn,
But resolute, to Dukalon she said,
"And we may meet no more; but whither borne,
"By wind or tide, the friendship that has shed
"So much of gladness 'round this spot I leave
"With me will live." The poet bowed his head;
He could not speak—could only inly grieve.
"Friends part to meet," she said, "and meet to part;
"But there is nothing, nothing! to relieve
"Our parting hour!" And, then, with troubled heart,
She told him, ere the Winter came again,
She would have wed. And Dukalon did start,
As if compelled by some internal pain,
And then was calm, but deathly cold and pale,
From desperate struggling to himself restrain.
It was a time for fortitude to fail,
For passion stronger is than fortitude,
However masterful, before the gale
Of vanished hopes! Young Dukalon now stood
Before the only woman he could love
Chained like a felon, in his hopeless mood,
Powerless to speak the words he'd die to prove—
If he were free! "O to be free!" he sighed
Upon the voiceless zephyrs of the grove,
In his despair. Minnette another's bride!
But he—what claim upon her love had he!
His own rash act that boon to him denied.
Nothing had he to offer her! And she—
What could she offer him! Silent they sat,
Undone! Could he, dare he, make her to see
The step that she would take was desperate,
Was fraught with desolation and with woe
And burnings of the heart, that end in hate!
For he could tell what he did feel and know,
Experience taught, of loveless wedded life;
But he could not this queenly woman show
How cuts the heart such two-edged knife,
Unasked. And Minnette had not even shown
She dreaded aught of such unnatural strife!
So he was dumb; escaped not e'en a groan
The agony he felt to indicate;
But he was sad beyond his wish to own—
Rebellious 'gainst the secret-working Fate
That snatched the woman he adored away
And left the one he could not love, or hate!
She placed her hand in his. "I cannot stay,"
She said. "I must be gone. But you, my friend,
"Think of Minnette, in secret, when you pray."
Then, o'er the hand he held, he low did bend,
And to it pressed his lips of ashen hue,
And thus resigned his more than earthly friend!
In silence thus to honor was he true,
And to Minnette! But O how much it cost!
A moment more, and she had gone! He knew,
He felt, that young Minnette to him was lost;
And earth to him became a barren waste—
In which forevermore he would be tossed,
A homeless, restless mortal, with no place
To rest his aching head—a dread expanse
Of desolation eye could never trace,
Or fancy body forth! Fixed was the glance,
And vacant, on the verdant sward he cast,
Insensible to all the "circumstance
And pomp" of earth! The hours unnoticed passed—
For what to him were hours or days or years,
When that sweet dream so short a time could last!
And long he sat; and down his cheeks the tears
Ran fast, but all unknown to him they fell,
The sacred emblems of Devotion's cares!
While there he sat a tropic storm did swell
To sudden fury; night in blackness came;
The earth and sky seemed all a seething hell
Of wild confusion, which the lightning's flame
Pierced thro' and thro'; thunders entoned afar,
Like furious cannonade, shaking the frame
Of earth with horrors on a field of war;
And torrent rains in massive sheets came down.
Unmoved was Dukalon! So deep the scar
Made by her words, no life in him was shown,
Save in the fitful breath that moved his breast.
Although to fiercer rage the storm had grown,
No terrors it for Dukalon possessed!
Prone on the earth, senseless, the young man lay,
Like one who finds in death long-sought-for rest.
The storm its fierceness spent; the genial day
Came forth again; the birds sang o'er his head;
Near by him paused a timid squirrel grey,
That seemed to wish to ask if he were dead,
But scampered off, not waiting a reply.
Young Dukalon upon his grassy bed,
Outstretched, from earthly joy and woe was free,
And love and hate; in all was crushed, undone,
A shattered reed! High in the radiant sky,
In matchless splendor, rode th' imperial sun,
Before his people sought him far and wide,
Nor sought in vain—the prostrate Dukalon!
They bore him to his home—'twas once his pride—
And faithful friends would have relieved his woe,
Had not that solace been to them denied.
Not one of all of them could hope to know
The tragic cause that in a single night
Had bleached his raven locks as white as snow,
And palsied every limb, and dimmed his sight,
And warped his mind; so that "My own Minnette!"
Was all he cried in calm or sudden fright;
For none was there who ever knew the fair Minnette,
Who ever heard before her name,
Save Dukalon, and he could not forget!
And she had gone, as sudden as she came—
As phantoms come and vanish as they pause—
Leaving behind, alas! a quenchless flame
To plead forevermore her wondrous cause.
EVERY MAN A KING.
From hill to hill let Freedom ring!
Let tyrants bend the knee!
Why should the people have a king,
When every man a king should be!
There is no law, save law of right!
All other law is made
By force of conquest, brutal might,
The sovereign masses to degrade.
Float high the standard of the free!
Loud let the welkin ring!
Each man within himself should be
No less a man than is a king.
BYRON'S OAK AT NEWSTEAD ABBEY.
Through thy battlements, Newstead, the hollow winds whistle;
Thou, the hall of my fathers, art gone to decay;
In the once smiling garden, the hemlock and thistle
Have choked up the rose that once bloomed in the way.
Lord Byron (1803)
The little twig that Byron planted here,
In manhood's hope and early prime,
The twig he gave his constant love and care
In Britain's far-famed classic clime,
Has grown to be a towering, stalwart tree;—
But Byron, master mind, O where is he!
And Newstead Abbey, where he lived and dreamed,
Still marks the sacred precincts well;
But long ago the stranger's banners streamed
O'er towers where Byron's heart did swell!
His lofty oak, with arms outstretched to God,
Speaks for the Bard—as Missolonghi's sod.
Old Newstead and its giant oak may stand
The fury of the storm and age,
But they must both decay, ere Byron's wand
Shall lose its power of love and rage!
Ere from the human heart shall fade away
The magic spell he breathed in life's short day!
I love him well, this wayward child of song,
Whose life in all was passing strange;
With mind so bitter sweet, so weak, so strong—
With power to soothe, to charm, estrange;—
Within his grasp the harp was made to flow
The sweetest, saddest notes the heart can know!
And he will live when Newstead and its tree
Have crumbled back to mother dust;
His name is linked with song and liberty,
And time such fame can never rust!
E'en Albion's glorious name must pale and wane,
While Byron's fame through endless time will reign!
THE ELSMERES.
Before the Ark on Ararat a lodgment found,
The Elsmeres dwelt in clouds of doubt and fear;
And, still, when Time has reached its closing year,
That doubt and fear the future's sky will bound.
No faith can make the hidden mysteries clear
That shroud the glories of the Eden where
Our hopes, through all the ages, circle 'round,
Like ships at anchor in a haven fair.
We fondly deem we know from whence we came,
And to what destiny at last shall go,
When vanish all of pomp and power and fame;
But, reason as we will, we do not know!
And, so, like Elsmere, many pine and die,
Victims of life's remorseless whence and why.
THE BRIDE OF ELLERSLEE.
Argument.— Florida was first settled by the Spaniards in 1565, although the first white man to visit the country was Ponce de Leon, in 1513. In 1819 the Spaniards ceded the whole Province to the United States. During the time of the Spanish occupation there was a constant clashing between the Spaniards and the Englishmen, between whom there was never any good blood.
Don Carlos Garcia y Artero was a typical Spanish nobleman—haughty, imperious, pompous, and fabulously rich. His hatred of the English people was an inherited infirmity, which the long contention of supremacy between the two peoples in Florida served to aggravate. He never could abide Ralph Bondly in any of the relations of life. He regarded him as embodying all of the objectionable and offensive traits in the English character.
This matter of racial aversion and antagonism, while very prevalent today in all parts of the world, has lost much of the bitterness that characterized it in past times. Modern inventions have brought the world into closer contact, and made men more dependent upon each other than they were even a century ago. The wars of conquest and reprisals waged between Spain and England from the earliest times would be sufficient explanation of individual likes and antagonisms wherever any two or more of these people should meet, as in Florida.
CANTO I.
Ralph Bondly was Misfortune's child;
The gods on him but seldom smiled;
Yet he possessed the wealth men crave
As greatest boon this side the grave.
Restless as tides that come and go,
In Summer's calm or Winter's blow,
Something he sought and longed to grasp,
But ever failed its form to clasp.
In every land his feet had strayed;
He 'neath Italian skies had prayed,
And scoffed beneath the Othman's sign,
And loitered by the Seine and Rhine;
Siberian snows had swept his face
Where Afric's sun had left its trace;
But nowhere what he sought for found,
Though present oft to sight and sound.
E'en Europe gave him no relief
From gnawings of his nameless grief—
From tortured Self, the worst of foes
That breed Delusion's endless woes.
Delusion! O, who has not chased
Some Phantom through Life's trackless waste!
And there were times when Bondly's hate
Embraced the world, e'en cursing Fate!
At other times he felt not so,
But free, forsooth, to come and go,
To mingle with the social throng,
And lend himself to dance and song.
Some relaxation from the law
That governs life we all must draw,
Forget in Pleasure's treasured hour,
Perhaps in Beauty's charming bower,
The speedy coming of the morrow,
With its vain hopes and toil and sorrow!
O Life! O Death! We well may cry,
Who, dying, live, and living, die!
Ralph Bondly loved the solitude
Of mountain high and leafy wood;
The dreamy silence soothed his brain
And robbed his nerves of numbing pain.
And yet he shunned not womankind,
Nor to their queenly charms was blind.
And he was learned in the lore
The seers of eld have placed in store,
From which may draw all who incline
To drink of Wisdom's thoughts divine;
And he was eloquent of speech,
Since versed in all the schools could teach;
And if the social theme he led,
Or dance, or song, 'twas never said
That he was vain. From Vanity—
The meanest thing beneath the sky!—
From vain display of Self, he shrank,
As do all men of noble rank—
The masters of the world, the strong,
The brave, their weaker kind among.
His voice was sweet as music sung
By sirens when the world was young;
And he could sing as only they
Who have been bathed in heavenly spray.
The thoughtful noted with what care
Ralph Bondly bore his earthly share;
How firm he was, how gentle, too,
In all that he did say and do—
Precise, methodical. No mask
He wore, not he, whate'er the task
Assigned him in the day's just claim,
In Duty's e'er exacting name.
He was a riddle to the few
Who dwelt about him and he knew;
But to the gossip-loving crowd
He seemed but over-lordly, proud—
So proud he could have worn a crown,
Or, on a broader field, renown
In war's brave game or walks of peace,
Snatched from the hands of sluggard ease!
And none who sought them found the flaws
That mark a break in Nature's laws—
Shown most in conduct of the fools,
Earth's dunces on their little stools,
The noisy creatures of the hour,
Who scream for honor and for power.
Yet many failed the man to read,
Who gave to them such little heed.
The idle gossips of the earth—
'Tis strange why they were given birth!
They fill a place, 'tis true. But, why?
And thereby hangs a mystery!
Action, on life's strenuous field,
To do and dare, to never yield,
A soldier's duty is, or high
Or low the place whence he may fly
The standard of humanity!
No steel of isolation must
Within the human heart be thrust
And there remain, for it will kill
The stoutest heart that hope may thrill;
Yet such had been Ralph Bondly's fate—
To love the world and reap its hate.
Many there are who deem him blest
Upon whose slender shoulders rest
The weight of birth and wealth and fame,
The well-filled purse, the titled name,
Unheeding that the wise and strong—
Warrior, statesman, child of song—
Fall, as the humblest fall, borne down
By burdens all too heavy grown,
And even in Life's glorious prime
And long ere man's allotted time!
The lowly grumble at their fate
And have but curses and fierce hate
For those who rise above them far,
The chosen leaders in Life's war,
The valiant captains in the race,
Who reap the honors of the chase!
Forsooth, the wisest men agree
That wealth and power bring misery,
Bring cares the humble poor ne'er know
In Summer's sun or Winter's snow!
"Uneasy lies the head that wears
"A crown!" 'Tis filled with cares and fears!
Likewise the head upon a stone,
Reaping the whirlwind it has sown;
The head of him who plays the fool
Is tortured, too, by Nature's rule;
The head with learning stored, though proud,
Is restless oft, in sorrow bowed,
From garnering where some other head
Has sown the seed its blood had fed.
Masters of science and of art,
And speakers to the head and heart,
And bards who make all earth their prize
Seeking sometimes to pierce the skies—
How often in the lap of Fame
Their heads lie sleepless, the frail frame
Wasting to speedy death, while yet
Uncanceled is Life's honest debt!
We seek contentment here in vain!
There are in earth but woe and pain!
Or wealth or transient power or fame
Or outcast without home or name—
Back to the dust all mortals go
And vanish as a mimic show!
What boots the place to us assigned
In matter gross or God-like mind!
What boots if rags or furs are ours
To blunt the edge of Winter's powers?
The shepherd's hut, the prince's hall—
The two extremes of earth's grim thrall—
What matters where we sleep when locked
In earth's embrace, by grim Death shocked?
When he no longer cared to roam
Ralph Bondly came and made his home
Amid the glories of the South,
Where seldom comes a blighting drouth;
The magic land of sweetest flowers
That ever bloomed in Nature's bowers;
Where songs of birds fill all the trees
That blossom in the tropic breeze,
With melody divine. Fair land
Of chivalry and song, thy wand
Has touched with more than wizard power
The pulse that ruled the Nation's hour!
A land as rich in womankind,
In royal maiden charms that blind
By dazzlement the human mind,
As ever bard of old had found
Upon Enchantment's vanished ground!
He came, but why and whence, to dwell
With strangers all, no one could tell;
He deigned no word to speak but this:
"A British Earl!" That must suffice!
Ralph Bondly's home was all that heart
Could wish, or lavish wealth and art
Combined could body forth in form
To kiss the sun or brave the storm!
A glorious mansion, where was caught
The gloom its lord so long had fought;
And you could trace a master's hand
In every line the builders planned
Through all the palace, sombre, vast,
That 'gainst the sky its shadows cast.
Rich fields and wooded acres wide
And gardens fair in flowery pride
Held fast the eye—for in design
And richness they were most divine!
Here, hidden from all prying eyes,
Beneath the fairest, balmiest skies,
Where merriment of carnival
Was never heard in room or hall,
But silent, closed against the world,
Which e'er around him surged and swirled—
Here dwelt Ralph Bondly in his prime,
As princes dwell beyond our clime,
In grand but isolated state—
A child of sorrow and of hate,
The offspring of a loveless twain
That he would never see again!
His spacious mansion, his domain,
That stretched o'er hill and dale and plain;
The thousand slaves that claimed him lord,
And breathless hung upon his word;
The pleasures of the field and chase,
The ruling passion of his race;
And piscatorial toils—he cared
For these, and in their joyance shared.
And if he loved the solitude
Of mountain peaks or leafy wood,
Where silence held eternal reign,
And found forgetfulness of pain
Therein, shall he be charged with pride
And vanity? Not so! 'Twere well
If in such scene his heart could swell,
Responsive to great Nature's voice,
Which, silent e'en, bids us rejoice!
If by some gurgling, murmuring stream
He could forget himself and dream
Of happy days sometime to be,
Why grudge him such felicity?
He worshipped Nature—'twas his god—
Worshipped the air, the trees, the sod,
And all the living things that brood
And breathe in forest's solitude.
All knew his famous country seat,
For such a man a fit retreat;
And many sighed to own the prize,
Which was a bauble in his eyes.
The country people canvassed well
All that was his or him befell.
Did they not envy him? Oh, no!
But what he owned. 'Twas ever so!
His gloom of mind they feared; and none
Desired his hermit life to share,
His seeming load of endless care!
'Tis always true that Life's hard yoke
Will e'en the stoutest heart provoke!
Do what we will, the smiles and tears
Go hand in hand with hopes and fears!
The changeless laws of Nature, Life,
Ordain in all that ceaseless strife
Prevail; so, what the world to-day
Proclaims and worships, falls away
When comes another morrow morn—
Discarded for some newer horn,
Some newer toy, more pleasing yet—
And that it, too, will soon forget!
The rich man, poor man, and the fool,
Attend alike Delusion's school!
Each fondly dreams, in some new way,
His vagrant thoughts, where'er they stray,
Will lead him to the fount of youth,
Or to the well of endless truth,
Or to the gold and diamonds hid
Beneath the earth's unyielding lid!
Like the dread sword of Damocles,
Their hopes are strung on hairs the breeze
Will strain and snap, so frail the thread,
And leave them mangled, bleeding, dead!
And many die in reaching after
That which provokes but honest laughter—
So absurd are some things men chase
Through all of Life's exciting race—
While others, without striving, find
All that they seek, and would, if blind!
Bondly was not devout in creeds;
But many knew him such in deeds.
"Ye have the poor always," He said,
Who followed where the Father led!
He knew that life is like a flower
That blooms in sweetness in morn's hour,
And droops and withers when the day
In royal splendor fades away!
He did not strive to bridge the gaps
In Nature's large and varied maps,
But left them as he found them, sure
They would be there forevermore!
The music of a brook was sweet,
As, dreaming on a mossy seat,
He watched the waters rush away
To some reposeful, land-locked bay;
He loved the odor of a rose,
The loveliest flower that ever grows,
And violets, by the dews caressed,
Sweet-scented, in their wildwood nest;
The baying of his hounds in chase,
The fox afar, would flush his face.
And what is love, but death? Although
The parent of all life, we know,
'Tis still the parent of decay—
But blood to blood and clay to clay!
And is it well to love that death
May fatten on the vital breath!
Oh, life of death! Oh, death of life!
In all of earth ye breed but strife.
Ralph Bondly often thought had he
Some queen of earth with him to be,
To share his life and wealth, a mate,
He would not ask for more of Fate;
But put the thought away in fear,
As something fatal all too near!
It could not be! His path must still
Be lone and sad! It was God's will!
'Twas his allotted share. But—Why?
So all the sons of Adam cry
When longed-for bliss the Fates deny!
Yet Bondly would have lain his head
Against a heart that ne'er had bled
Except in pity for such woe
As only noble souls can know,
When love has lit the deathless flame
That burns undimmed, fore'er the same!
But he had never loved—ne'er felt
The sternness of his nature melt
Into the tenderness that He
Showed Mary at far Bethany!
"Yes; love indeed is light from heaven,
The sweetest boon to mortals given!"
Three years had come and gone since he,
The stranger lord, at Ellerslee,
Had made his home, fair Bondly Hall—
His pride—his neighbors' pride withal;
And he a stronger man had grown,
And dreamed he might yet claim his own;
The earth became a fairer place
In all its matchless charm and grace;
A newer life was his to live,
With power to nobler thoughts to give
The active force of soul and mind,
As he had always been inclined.
A wise seaman distrusts the clouds,
Floating above, like myriad shrouds,
Although the waters of the sea
In placid slumber all may be;
He knows the storm is coming fast,
To strain his spars, to strain his mast,
Until the ship shall creak and groan,
While round him wild winds sigh and moan!
But Bondly revelled in the calm—
To him 'twas more than magic balm—
As boys disport them in the sun
When Spring, fierce Winter's season run,
Has chased the snows to Alpine heights
To glisten in the moon's pale nights!
The future was remote, unknown;
The present, ah! it was his own!
We do not estimate how much
A limb is worth until a crutch
Has ta'en its place, shattered by shell
Or shot or knife in war's fierce hell;
Nor know how dear is Fatherland
Until we tread a foreign strand,
And strangers mingle with, and hear
Words that confuse the anxious ear;
We do not prize the glorious sun
Until the frost its work has done,
In killing every flower and leaf,
And filling all the earth with grief;
The precious gem possessed, the cost
Outrageous seems, until 'tis lost;
And past misfortunes do not teach
There are some things beyond our reach.
Yes, there was balsam in the air
That gave to Bondly courage rare.
Close by his favorite silvery stream,
He sat him down to dream and dream,
While Nature's smile, pervading all,
Presaged a future bright withal!
So vigorous manhood feels its power,
When no black clouds above it lower.
And moments of depression still
Come to us all, and ever will;
But from despair a strength we gain
That makes our living not in vain!
"Life is a curse!" Ralph Bondly mused—
To whom the gods so much refused;
"Nor can the poet's gentle song,
"Of love and hate, of right and wrong;
"Nor braggart's swagger; nor wealth's joys,
"With all the ills that wealth destroys;
"Nor wedding bells, where grim despair
"Rides on a fairy in the air;
"Nor incantations of the wise,
"That rule the lightnings from the skies
"And what beneath earth's surface lies—
"Make blessings of the curse! Eden,
"Thy awful curse still rests on men!
"We laugh and sing this hour; we weep
"The next, and groan, and, perchance, die!
"And what is death—the hidden hand
"Lifted 'gainst life in every land!
"I do not know, and never knew
"One who could read the riddle true,
"The present and the future state,
"The one we love, the one we hate!
"And no man in the ages past,
"In tropic sun or Arctic blast,
"Has grown one single inch withal
"Since the dread hour of Adam's fall,
"By railing at the laws that rule
"Alike the wise man and the fool!
"Man's stature steadily has grown
"Shorter as Time has swiftly flown
"Toward the desolation of the earth
"And dread cessation of all birth!
"As life began with giants, may
"It not wind up with pigmies, pray,
"Or creatures smaller yet—so small
"That they cannot be seen at all!
"In truth, the pathway to the sky
"Runs o'er rough fields and mountains high!
"From whence we came we do not know,
"Nor to what destiny we go;
"Knowledge stops here and science gropes
"And Faith fills in the void with hopes!
"The mountain streams of ice and snow
"At last into the ocean flow
"And form a part thereof; but man—
"Whence came he and, pray, whither goes
"When o'er his grave the willow grows?
"The flesh returns to earth; the mind—
"Does it become part of the wind?
"Does Reason vanish with the breath
"That yields—resisting still—to Death?
"And so we live, and so we die,
"Victims of whence, of whither, why?"
CANTO II.
There is no clime beneath the sun
Where man predominance has won,
Can match the women of our clime
In beauty and in virtue prime,
In charms of person and of mind
In one harmonious whole combined!
They are the glory and the pride
Of all the beauteous Southland wide,
The chiefest treasure of the land
O'er which some wizard threw his wand!
Thus thought the lord of Ellerslee
While dreaming of the galaxy
That passed before his mental gaze
And made it bright with Beauty's blaze.
He had so long enjoyed a state
Of single blessedness that Fate,
He deemed, had shut his heart to all
The charms that dazzle men withal;
And, yet, of late, his thoughts had dwelt
More kindly on the themes that melt
The stubborn heart than e'er before;
And this he pondered o'er and o'er,
As now love's dream did not affright
Him as a phantom of the night,
But lured him as a beacon light.
All love—all hate—all laugh—all weep—
As through our lives the passions sweep!
The noblest passion of the breast,
Love makes a man the noblest, best,
Or meanest of the human race,
In whom the brute we well can trace.
Oft when the object sought is won
Man's ardor cools; and she, undone,
Who dreamed of love and happiness,
Is left the lips of sorrow to caress!
And love, like everything possessed,
Grows valueless, too oft, with years,
And garners naught but sighs and tears.
Thought Bondly so? He was not now
What he had been. His noble brow
Unwrinkled was; his eagle eye
No more was blurred with mystery.
Reason had come into its own,
And this in all his acts was shown.
Within the law Ralph Bondly came
That operates on all the same—
On things that breathe, on things that grow,
On things unknown, on things we know—
He fell in love! For months he felt
His sterner nature slowly melt
Into a softer mood—the mood
That shuns the haunts of solitude,
And runs from darkness of the night
Into the glamour of day's light!
He worshipped her, but from afar,
As dreamers of th' Orient a star,
New gleaming on th' enraptured sight
In the soft splendors of the night;
For she was fairest of her kind
That ever flashed upon his mind.
Just as the waters madly flow,
From mountain heights of ice and snow,
O'er rocks and sands into the sea,
As if rejoicing to be free,
Gathering from resistance force
And momentum in their wild course,
So love leaps forward—restless free—
A thing of life and mystery!
'Twill brook no curb, no counsel take,
From those who seek its faith to shake!
In ancient times its hate has lit
The flames that hoary empires split,
Or crumbled in the dust, to rise
No more to noble enterprise!
Yes, love will dare the world to arms
And glory in war's dread alarms!
The greatest dangers it will face
And thrive on shadows with good grace;
Nor cold nor heat nor hunger, pain,
Its burning ardor can restrain.
And, yet, from vulgar eyes to hide
'Twill seek, in modest, blushing pride,
If all goes well, if flowers are spread
Along the path that it must tread!
O, love is life, and life is love—
The union of the hawk and dove!
She was, indeed, a royal maid—
As all maids are, when all is said—
Whom Bondly loved, with dreamful eyes
That beamed upon you in surprise,
And face as beautiful and fair
As ever blushed in Southern air,
Or smiled from canvas, or from bust,
That survives even human dust!
A Southern beauty, whom the brave
A ready, willing, homage gave,
As well the statesman and the bard—
Who sang her praises by the yard.
From far and near had gallants sought
Her smiles, by her sweet beauty caught;
But, no; the same reply she gave
To giddy youth and aged grave.
She was heart-free; no passion's word
The damped fires of her soul had stirred.
She revelled in the gracious power
That makes the weak and strong to cower—
To humbly kneel at Beauty's shrine
And crave to own its charms divine.
Throughout the South her magic name
Had traveled on the wings of fame;
In Beauty's Court she was supreme—
In Beauty's Court she was a dream!
She traced her blood to royalty,
From noblest blood of Spain came she;
For of her house had men defied
The tyranny of princely pride
And trod the earth where prowess won,
As knights of old have always done.
So great in other days, long past,
When men were all as warriors classed,
Were men of Garcia's haughty tribe,
Whom flattery nor pelf could bribe!
Ah, glorious days of chivalry,
Too bad Cervantes' wit killed ye!
This should decide the question then:
"Which mightier is—the sword or pen?"
Still college youths will argue o'er
This settled point forevermore!
But now in Flora's sunny clime,
And had since his young manhood's prime,
Don Garcia lived in quiet ease,
Nor sighed for scenes beyond the seas;
And while he loved his native land,
Where he was born to rule, command,
He better loved th' adopted State
Where he was greatest of the great.
Good Fortune and the Kings of Spain
Had filled his coffers well; and vain
And Naughty was the little Don—
To whom the gods denied a son.
A miser with his wealth was he,
And little gave to charity.
E'en spare of words the old man was,
Economized on breath, alas!
His neighbors did not love the Don,
And ridiculed him pro and con,
But did it well his back behind,
After the nature of their kind—
Who curse in private those they hate,
Or envy, but would emulate,
While publicly they cringe and bow
And fawn—so glad the Don to know!
It has been so in every age,
And will be up to Time's last page.
A title and a bag of gold
Will make the mob grow hot and cold,
However base the owner be—
However proud and miserly!
But what cared Garcia for the blame
Or praise that from the rabble came!
What need had he to bother, pray,
About what men should think and say
Of him! He knew, but did not care;
He was supreme in his own sphere.
Was he not strong in all men crave
Beyond themselves this side the grave—
Abundant wealth and titles clear
And acres vast his soul to cheer!
He loved but one in all the earth,
And she had loved him from her birth—
The queenly daughter of his pride,
Who came when his young wife had died!
He had grown old in selfishness,
And found in it his happiness;
E'en selfish with young Nada was,
While fondly loving her, alas!
He grudged the smiles she scattered wide
O'er all the flowery country side—
For she was lavish with her smiles—
The human sunshine that beguiles—
And with her charity; so high
And low could naught to her deny
Of love and gracious courtesy.
Much time had Senor Garcia spent
In lands where lavish splendors lent
The glamour and the pageantry
Of pomp and power to majesty;
And in his castles in old Spain—
Which he might never see again!—
He much of hospitality
Had shown his noble peers—for he
Was not always the slave of gold,
Nor selfish was and harsh and cold!
These came when she who made his youth
Sublime passed as the breath of truth,
And as old age upon him crept
While all his generous nature slept—
Vindictive that his chiefest joy
Death could so cruelly destroy!
For this he left his native Spain
And went not back to it again
The social reins to Nada he
Long since resigned, and cheerfully.
The years that still were his, he knew,
And did not grieve to know, were few,
For he had drained the cup of pleasure,
And, in his hours of ample leisure,
Had learned its worth o'errated is—
As fatal as the Judas kiss!
Nothing was left to him but name
And wealth, and these had e'en grown tame—
Had lost the worth that made them dear
Before his eyes had shed a tear—
For Garcia had the gout; or, say,
The gout had him—a difference, pray,
As any victim will agree
Who has endured its misery!
In her he lived whose fairy life
Was image of his vanished wife!
The cold sod and the eglantine—
The rich grass and the creeping vine—
While Nada lived, hid not from view
This youthful love that Garcia knew.
Linked to the present was the past,
And o'er his life dark shadows cast—
The living joy—the vanished joy—
Which brooding years could not destroy!
The thoughtless world for loyal grief,
That wavers not, has no relief—
Not even sympathy—but sneers,
Too oft, it gives and ribald jeers!
True love, indeed, can never die;
It lives in spiritual form for ay!
Young Nada was an alien flower,
Transplanted to our matchless power—
A power whose Eagle yet shall be
Greater than Rome's when Rome was free!
And, though she knew the toil and care
Of those who gave so rich a share
To her of wealth and titled name,
Snatched from the field of war's red flame,
She sighed not for the castles and
The pomp, the royal splendors grand,
Of Merry Spain, which she had seen,
For she had knelt to King and Queen;
She left the pride of them and boast
To Garcia; but, e'en he, at most,
No longer prized them as when he
A young Knight was of chivalry;
For time had taught him this great truth—
Age laughs at vanities of youth!
Garcia despised the Saxon race,
And treated none with generous grace;
No word escaped his lips or pen
In praise of England, or its men.
He held this virtue sacred as
His love of Pope and Holy Mass.
He well could love, he well could hate—
This spoilt old Spanish child of Fate!
Ralph Bondly could not hope to find
Favor—if so he had a mind—
In Garcia's eyes, the pompous Don
Who thought the country was his own,
Or seemed to do so in his acts
And words, despite the living facts.
Proud of his land and of his race,
Bondly had looked in Garcia's face
With hatred and contempt and scorn—
Which suggest rapiers in the morn
When other men are sleeping fast,
Dreaming, perchance, of combats past;
And Garcia th' insult had returned,
While all his soul with anger burned,
Lighting his face with scarlet flame,
While from his eyes fierce flashes came.
'Twas mutual hate—the hate of race
Which through all history we trace—
The darkest and the bloodiest page
Writ in the annals of each age.
And are we brothers—we who hate
And rob each other—we who wait.
With murder in our hearts, to slay
Our kind in stealth or open fray?
Are we who make each other bleed
And starve all sprung from Adam's seed?
Will all the children of the Lord
E'er sheathe eternally the sword—
The black, the yellow and the white—
And banish Might and enthrone Right?
Go, get the answer from the wind
That speaks the language of the Mind
From which the universe, and all
That in it is, came forth withal!
But changes come! Sometimes they creep
Upon us in our hours of sleep—
Come as a thief with muffled tread
When slumber holds the living dead!
And what, in truth, is sleep, but death,
In all except the gasping breath!
But changes come! 'Twas even so
With Bondly of the sombre brow.
He learned before it was too late
That love can blunt the edge of hate!
Old Garcia seemed not now the same
When seen through love's entrancing flame!
It all hangs on the single point,
If all is right or out of joint.
Whether we are concerned or not
In casting here or there our lot!
Let love or greed come on the scene,
And hate of race will find a screen—
Will take itself clear out of sight—
Will vanish in the starless night!
'Twas even so when man was young—
Before the stars their psalm had sung!
We often crave for sunshine fair
When angry storms pervade the air;
Yes, sigh for objects of desire,
That may the heart or fancy fire,
Beyond our reach, and knowing, too,
This law of Nature to be true.
'Tis better with a cur to be
On friendly terms than enmity;
However high the eagle flies,
E'en circling in the cloud-fringed skies,
It must return for food and drink
To earth; we may not always think
A common beggar has a claim
Upon our pity in his shame,
But if we spurn his hungry plea,
We may provoke the hate that he
Will find a way to gratify,
To our great hurt and misery.
Ralph Bondly had not felt the need
Old Garcia's words and acts to heed;
They lived in separate worlds nor cared,
Withal, how each the other fared.
The county held them both, 'tis true,
But it was all that it could do;
Neighbors they, dwelling side by side,
Yet separate as the earth is wide!
And, no strange thing in any clime,
But everywhere a social crime!
Bondly could not the time foresee
When Nada Garcia's love would be
To him the dearest thing the sun
Beneath—whether 'twas lost or won.
So many tricks have love—sweet love!—
And caprice played, at every move,
That on few courtships have fair winds
E'er blown. The howling storm that blinds—
The rains that beat—the thunders dread,
And lightning darting overhead—
Have rocked in tempests, sweeping wide,
Love's trusting hopes! Many have died,
Dashing against the storm-hid rocks,
Too frail to stand the furious shocks—
As sea fowls in their desperate plight
Oft dash against a lighthouse light;
While others, yet, have ridden high
Upon the waves of Mystery,
And found at last the paradise
Of wedded bliss—life's dearest prize!
They had not known each other long,
And first had met in a vast throng,
Where stately dames and maidens fair
Had met to banish earthly care.
There wit and beauty claimed their own,
And joy and mirth and love alone
Held captive statesmen—warriors bold—
And country squires, both young and old;
But in the festive throng, I vow,
There was no face, there was no brow,
As beautiful, as fair, as free,
As Nada Garcia's was to see!
So mused Ralph Bondly, as apart
He mutely stood with anxious heart,
Watching the movements of the maid
In the ballroom's soft light and shade;
He had no eyes for others there,
However beautiful and fair.
To him no woman ever seemed
More to possess all that he dreamed
Of ideal womanhood—the force
That shapes the busy world's rough course;
True, one of Wisdom's sons once said,
Before his Star of Fortune fled,
"The hand that rocks the cradle rules
"The world"—savants alike and fools.
'Tis sweet to rule the social hour,
Perhaps the sweetest of all power,
To know the strong of earth, the great,
Upon a smile with pleasure wait.
Ralph Bondly lived another age
While standing on that narrow stage,
And gazing on one woman fair—
The fairest of all women there;
And all the past, by him forgot,
Was in his mind as if 'twas not.
The giddy waltz they glided through
With perfect grace and measure, too;
And through his soul there seemed to pass
A thrill of joy divine, alas!
They seemed to float upon the air,
All full of joy, all free of care,
Bewitched by some mysterious power
That ruled them in the festive hour.
The close-pressed hands, the dreamful eyes,
The rhythmic dance, the low-breathed sighs—
Assisted all the flame to light
That glows forever in the night
And in the day—the quenchless flame
That burns eternally the same!
Love's magic dream! How old—how young—
It is! How valiant and how strong!
The sweetness of the roses red,
Or violets in their wildwood bed,
Or honey in the comb, alas!
Cannot Love's magic sweet surpass!
From its excess have died in bliss
Many the world paused not to miss
When they had sunk in Time's abyss!
The wrecks that litter Time's highway
Are of all kinds—the grave and gay,
The wise and foolish, rich and poor—
Borne down and crushed to rise no more:
No record in the minds of men.
Or history's page, or why or when:
The storm just swept them down. leaving
No trace of them, and no grieving!
Or bootless love, or vengeful hate,
Or poverty, or drunkard's fate—
What matters it, for none can tell
Or when or why the weaklings fell!
The towering shaft and lettered page
Are held for those, in every age.
Who, stout of heart and strong of hand,
The forces of the world command!
"None but the brave deserve the fair;"
No coward should Love's archery dare.
'Twas even so in days of old
When all were knights and warriors bold;
If there were other sorts of men
They dodged the frenzied poet's pen;
And e'en the weavers of romance
Gave common mortals little chance
To show that they possessed the flame
Divine, just as the lord and dame;
But in the hut of old, as now,
Was breathed and kept love's honest vow!
To Bondly's touch so yielding seemed
The fair young maid. while bright lights gleamed:
She bent so willingly her ear
Each of his whispered words to hear,
Each whispered nothing, murmured low,
He felt his courage stronger grow;
For faintest heart to faint will cease
When seems not hard the adored to please!
And when the dreamful waltz was o'er,
And all deserted was the floor,
He led her from the glare and heat
Into the night; a rustic seat,
An arbor in, was their retreat.
The queenly moon in heaven rode high,
While lustrous stars attended nigh,
And roses filled with sweets the air—
Yes, flowery sweets were everywhere!
Have you e'er lingered in the night,
When moon and stars diffused the light,
In some fair summer land, and drunk,
Until to languorous slumber sunk,
The perfume of a thousand flowers
That bathed you in its soothing showers?
They paused and drank the cooling breeze
That music made high in the trees—
The giants of a distant age
That had outlived Time's stormy rage—
The breeze that swept their noble brows,
As gentle as a lover's vows!
How furiously his heart did beat
With fear and hope—ah, hope, so sweet!—
How nerveless was his tongue! Their eyes
Had met beneath the fairest skies
And told the tale that needs no word
To make its heavenly message heard!
The eyes can speak a joy or woe
The faithful tongue may never know—
Can flash a secret from the soul
While the fierce thunders rumbling roll
And piercing lightnings stifle voices,
O'erawed by elemental noises!
But, now, alone—a time that might
Not come again—silent as night
Were they, voiceless, dreading and hoping,
While through the present blindly groping!
Who can portray the thoughts that swell
Two hearts that love each other well
When first they learn that they adore,
And shall—or hope!—forevermore!
And who can tell one-half the fears
That then dissolve a maid in tears!
And how the strongest man so weak
Becomes he cannot even speak—
So overcome with nameless dread
A child may lead him by a thread!
Their love unspoken cowards made
Them in the slumberous vine-clad shade.
So silence brooded on the deep—
Heedless of those who laugh or weep—
Pervasive in its noiseless sweep!
All nature seemed in league—the sky
And earth—to fill with majesty
And awe divine the time and place
Where love had sought to hide its face!
Thus Nature works, through God supreme,
To chasten love's delirious dream!
His trembling tongue but uttered ill
The words conjured by his strong will.
"I love but thee!" he hoarsely said;
"And could I claim thee, with thee wed,
"I'd give a world, if mine to give,
"And joy alone with thee to live!
"I crave thy love! 'Tis life to me,
"Or death! Give it, and I shall be
"The happiest man that walks the earth
"Since mortals first had troublous birth!
"Refuse it, and, dear maid, I die,
"The saddest soul beneath the sky,
"For life would be a worthless toy
"That I should hasten to destroy!
"O, speak! Say I may live and be
"Thy willing slave and worship thee!"
But not a word spake she! Hushed—scared—
Th' emotions of her nature warred!
Her hand he still held in his own,
A trembling captive he had won;
It fed the flames whose violent heat
Quenched never is by rain or sleet!
The captive hand he dared to kiss!
O, bliss of life! O, life of bliss!
The seconds seemed to run to hours,
'Midst th' exhalations of the flowers,
To him who knelt in dread suspense,
While every nerve and sense was tense,
Silently pleading for a bride,
Pleading his suit be not denied!
And, when she said: "I love but thee!"
His soul dissolved in ecstasy.
He gently drew her to his breast,
Never before by woman pressed,
And they did vow—but why repeat
What they did vow? But it was sweet!
The mortal who has never known
The rapture of a kiss, alone
The token of affection true,
Course all his nature through and through,
Has missed the chiefest joy of earth
Since love in Eden had its birth!
A moment lingered they, as loath
To break the spell of their betroth;
And, then, a moment more, and they
Were borne along in circles gay,
To music's soft alluring strain,
That ne'er so sweet might sound again.
Changed were the currents of their fate,
For conquering love had vanished hate;
Th' English Earl o'er the Spanish Don
A bloodless victory had won.
Don Garcia saw them leave the hall—
Saw them return—he saw it all—
And 'twas as wormwood and the gall!
He marked the color come and go—
The tell-tale eyes—the glances low—
The looks they sought in vain to screen,
That slyly passed the two between—
He marked it all, and but too well,
And all his soul with hate did swell!
So here the two extremes had met,
Of love and hate, which oft upset
The best laid plans and hopes of men,
Earth filling with "what might have been!"
O, love! O, hate! Ye tigers are
When roused to vengeance or to war!
Don Garcia and his daughter fair
Rode homeward in the morning air,
While shook himself th' imperial sun
For the long race he had to run;
It was so still, it was so calm,
No one could dream of coming storm.
And they were silent then awhile.
Unruffled seemed as Nature's smile.
They were unlike as earth and sky
In all of life's dark mystery;
For he was peevish, gouty, old,
In whom the fires of youth were cold;
While she was beautiful and young,
And dreamed of love and of love sung,
And now the vanished night had brought
To her a happier, sweeter thought,
That made the earth still fairer seem
In which to live, in which to dream.
This was her thought, when Garcia spoke
And from the revery her awoke:
"Nada, I charge thee, mark it well—
'''Tis thy salvation or thy knell!—
"In thy mad course no further go!
"'Twill lead thee straight to endless woe.
"The man is mad! This thou must know.
"I'd rather see the willow wave
"Above thy too untimely grave
"Than have thee wed the man I scorn—
"This man with brain disordered born!
"It must not be! Let him be gone!
"I hate him, and, if you were one,
"I still should hate him! 'Twixt his race
"And mine no truce can be—no grace!
"Thou art the solace of my years,
"The object of my hopes and fears;
"There's nothing left of all my line,
"Save thee, 'round which my love can twine.
"All else has gone the way I soon
"Shall go; my life has passed high noon.
"I love thee with my life, and live
"Alone my life to thee to give.
"Make not my old heart for thee grieve.
"I feel thou wilt my warning heed."
He calmly spoke, this man of steel,
Who crushed inferiors 'neath his heel,
And all his enemies defied
To scale the ramparts of his pride;
But he was furious through and through
And his great mantle closer drew
About him, not to ward the air,
But to conceal his load of care.
There is no hate like hate of race
In all the climes of earthly space.
She spake no word; she could not speak,
For love and reverence made her weak;
But with each perfumed breath she drew
She vowed to Bondly to be true.
Could she forget the moments past,
Moments too sweet to longer last!
She closed her eyes, as if in sleep,
And plunged into Love's pathless deep,
Beginning with the vanished night
That ope'd new worlds of sun and light
To her bewildered, startled sight.
Oh, trackless was the deep blue sea
On which her bark danced merrily!
But ere it left the home port far
It ran into a tempests' war.
The present o'er the future casts
A spell that oft forever lasts;
And maidens grow reserved, whose eyes
Had been as free as heaven's fair skies,
Before love's magic wand had shown
Them life and love indeed are one;
And childish innocence may take
The wisdom of the crawling snake,
To shield it from the prying mind
That seeks its hidden thought to find.
When love invades a woman's breast,
A long farewell to peace and rest—
To days of innocence and truth—
The charming innocence of youth.
Th' expectant groom becomes a god,
Too good to tread his mother sod;
Ethereal form is his; the air
His fit abode, with angels fair;
His power the fiercest oath can break
That irate parents ever make;
Indeed, such interdict but serves
To re-enforce the lovers' nerves.
Within themselves they are supreme,
Lapped in Illusion's blissful dream,
And headlong plunge into Life's roar,
And oft fair ports see nevermore.
CANTO III.
Through all of life there runs a vein
Of mystery—of joy and pain,
Of hope and disappointment, and
Of hate and love. In every land,
In every age, the wise and good—
In cloister cell's dark solitude,
In private homes and college walls,
In humble huts and stately halls—
Have sought this riddle to unmask,
But found it was a hopeless task.
Nothing we do has made it plain—
The why of Joy, the why of Pain.
As 'twas when Father Time began—
With but one woman and one man—
So it is now, a mystery still,
To thwart the soul, to curb the will.
We need, indeed, celestial light
To read Life's darksome riddle right.
The savage chief, under the spell
Of love, howe'er he may rebel,
Pursues no more th' exciting chase,
Nor courts grim war's forbidding face,
Nor lingers by the rambling stream;
Or slumberous lake's unruffled dream;
But spends his hours the woods among,
Stolid, by soft desires unstrung;
And all his fancies colored are
By rays of Love's resplendent star;
A god or devils in the shade
Primeval, by his passion made!
His dusky choice becomes a queen,
Present to him in every scene,
Eclipsing all of womankind
In form and face and gifts of mind,
With eyes in which he clearly reads
Th' inspiration of heroic deeds.
His narrow world grows narrower still
While yielding to her gentle will;
And he is happier, manlier, far,
Than when the chase or barbarous war
Called him o'er winding dale and hill
His mission in the world to fill.
Suppose he wins the woman's love,
Ensnares her as he would a dove,
And sinks into a brute again—
A crafty, haughty, savage, vain—
Love made him for a fleeting hour
As Romeo was in Juliet's power.
So lords and princelings of the earth,
Born to luxury and ease and mirth,
Do barter often everything
That to one woman they may cling;
And, not unlike the savage, they
Too often put the wife away,
Or torture her with taunts and jeers
And base neglect, till woe and tears
Drive her to madness or divorce—
There's not much choice in either course!
The savage chief and brutal lord
Are neither bound by oath nor word;
The faithful record plainly shows
That each one gives but takes no blows,
Because the victim is too weak
Upon the brute revenge to wreak!
The object gained, the longings cease,
Too oft, for man is hard to please,
And spurious love, from friendship grown,
Returns to friendship as its own,
Or hate or desperate, bloody, crimes,
That shock the purists of the times.
But love, true love! The beggar blind,
Groping, brooding, sick of mind,
Sees, through the mists of vanished time,
Her who had made his youth sublime,
Nerved him to work, in joy and pain,
Conscious he labored not in vain!
The blackness of his sightless night
Was bright with love's all-conquering light;
A woman's tender voice and care
Were with him always, everywhere;
And though her spirit long since had fled,
With him she lived! She was not dead!
Go tell it to the moaning seas—
Go tell it to the sighing trees—
Go tell it to the whistling winds—
Go tell it to the lords and hinds—
That love is life and life is love
And rule in earth and heaven above!
Ralph Bondly built his castles high
Upon his life's new mystery;
What time or heart had he to waste
Upon his haughty Spanish grace!
And all the world for him became
A smaller sphere—in which one name,
One form, one voice, was all that made
His life of hope, of sun and shade.
The harshness of his nature fled
When love its radiance o'er him shed!
As lovers will, the lovers met,
For ne'er has law been found as yet
That could prevent two lovers true
From meeting to their vows renew.
Sometimes they met in solitude,
'Neath oaks which had through ages stood,
Where Nature reigned in solemn state,
Unruffled by man's love and hate.
Here, undisturbed, they conversed long
The forest sentinels among,
Or gazed into each other's eyes
And read, as in the open skies,
The secrets of the soul therein,
The secrets love alone can win.
He was so like a prince in all
That makes for royal rank—so tall,
So handsome, and so dignified,
He bore himself with such rare pride—
That in his presence she became
As hypnotized—held by the flame
That fills the soul with heavenly light
Or with the darkness of the night.
And happiness few mortals know,
Who love and trust the sun below,
Was hers in these brief interviews,
In twilight hours or morning dews;
For hers was faith to all else blind,
Save his o'er-mastering will and mind.
How oft we find, in woe and pain,
Our confidence reposed in vain!
The gameful trout, disporting free—
Nothing more joyous, sure, than he
In all the waters of the brook—
Thus finds himself on th' angler's hook!
Now darted he to catch the fly—
Now downward—upward—merrily—
Till danced the waters in ferment,
He was so gay, so confident!
But hooked, in seeking life, his own
He gave, his rashness to atone!
Through all of Nature runs a chord
That binds us to the common horde;
In all, the same great thread is found
Of love and hate, the world around.
They did not always coo and dream;
Sometimes the burden of their theme
Was full of weight, and sadness, too,
From which, alas! escape but few.
"And we shall always happy be,
"Forgetting in our joy," said he
"The world beside, by it forgot
"Contented with our generous lot,
"Nor sigh for other, richer treasure,
"Joy stealing e'en from Sorrow's measure!
"Life is so sweet, when love divine
"Thrills all the soul with its rich wine;
"Each stool becomes a sacred shrine,
"And constant hearts more constant grow
"Each hour that they each other know!
"Yon glassy stream, meandering hence
"Through vale and brake, beneath the lens
"Of love, assumes, I say not why,
"A thousand shapes to charm the eye;
"This rose sends forth a wealth of sweet,
"As well the violets at our feet,
"A garden might exhale; the trees,
"Low murmuring in the gentle breeze,
"Are richer in their dress of green
"While shading me and thee, my queen;
"The landscape far more grandly rises
"Against the skies in sweet surprises,
"As softly o'er the world the sun
"Diffuses light and warmth, which run
"Through all of life, and it sustain,
"With the sweet moisture of the rain;
"The tuneful birds their songs now sing
"For us! How sweet their voices ring!
"The mocking bird leading the choir—
"Now clear, now low, now soft, now higher!
"How full of joy and glad delight
"His numbers echo in their flight,
"As if all seasons were his Spring
"In which the praise of God to sing!
"He puts all carking care to shame—
"Makes love and music seem the same!
"But louder, clearer, hear him sing,
"As if more joy he could us bring!
"His care-free life is one long psalm
"To Him who rules the storm and calm!
"So shall it be with me and thee
"In that wished time, so soon to be,
"When you in word and truth are mine,
"And I, no less, my love, am thine!
"We think not now of less than joy
"That time nor sorrow can destroy—
"A perfect state, when we are one!
"And have we not that state begun—
"Our love, so holy and so pure—
"It must forevermore endure!
"All heaven and earth upon us smile!
"Soon comes the hour. We pause awhile!"
So spake the lord of Ellerslee,
And, as he spoke, e'en so felt he,
Controlled by Passion's burning fires,
And swayed at will by fond desires.
Not so the maiden at his side
He hoped so soon to make his bride;
Her wits were sharper than the man's,
Who saw no flaws in all his plans;
And this, though strange, is often true,
When with the heart we have to do;
For man is prone in his survey
To sweep from Peru to Cathay—
Measuring mountains vast and sky
With swiftest movement of the eye,
And levelling barriers in his flight
By his volition's simple might!
For mad is almost always vain
And selfish to his object gain!
The woman treasures little joys
As children do their favorite toys,
And seldom looks beyond the sky
'Neath which her hopes and pleasures lie!
Young Nada plainly saw the wrath
Of Garcia flash across her path,
And heard his protest 'gainst the suit
Of him he styled "the English brute!"
And vowing vengeance fierce and dread
Upon her young, defenceless head,
Should she persist in her mad course
'Gainst his commands and wish, perforce!
She knew his violent nature well
When he was under Passion's spell;
For she had seen his little form
Convulsed in Anger's mighty storm,
And all the vast estate, in fear,
Tremble, in awe, as he drew near;
Or thundered oaths that seemed to be
Bigger and uglier than was he—
For he would at no Beauty show
Have ta'en a seat in the front row!
Don Garcia was a ball of fire
When was aroused his Spanish ire,
For his, indeed, was martial blood
That came down to him from the Flood;
At least, that was his haughty boast,
Ere he became a living ghost,
Ere age and gout made him forget
He was a knight of Castile yet,
Or gave the fact but scanty thought,
Such as a proud Castilian ought—
For Spanish knights have always been
The proudest, vainest of all men!
Nada well knew her parent proud
Would rather see her in a shroud
Than joined in wedlock to the lord
'Gainst whom he longed to draw the sword.
No blessing on their vows would he
Pronounce, when long and merrily
The marriage bells to all should tell
That two were one and all was well!
So in the gladness of the hour
She felt his presence and his power,
Whose love, though masterful and great,
Was never stronger than his hate.
Ne'er blushless could she face again
The parent who ne'er caused her pain;
Whose life, indeed, was all her own,
In all its depth, and hers alone.
This made her sad. She loved him well,
How well, perchance, she could not tell;
She loved him with a daughter's pride,
Who loved but her in all earth wide!
From out the present there arose
A cloud, though small, like little woes,
That larger grew and larger still,
Till all the skies it seemed to fill,
As through the shadows glanced her eyes
Where the dread Future's secret lies.
And she possessed an ample share
Of amorous fire and courage rare
And hate as strong as gentleness—
She was a Garcia, nothing less!
Still, she could be, in hours serene,
As happy as a reigning queen,
Whose open heart and generous hand
Spread blessings through the grateful land.
"I love but thee, my noble lord!
"I love but thee!" she said. "Thy word
"Is pleasant law always to me,
"And joy is mine to be with thee!
"And I have prayed my patron saint
"Our future life withal to paint
"As thou hast pictured it—all fair,
"All free from sorrow and from care,
"All full of love and fond devotion,
"Life's dearest and its sweetest portion—
"But I'm suspicion-haunted still,
"And constant fears my musings fill!
"I would no cloud hung o'er the way
"Our journey leads! O, loved one, pray
"That we may find my fears are vain,
"Our love be free from woe and pain!
"O, pray with me, no curse may fall
"Upon the lord of Bondly Hall!"
Oppressed by such distressing fears,
Her cheeks suffused with scalding tears,
Her tongue refused to further speak
The thoughts, it seemed, her heart would break!
So droops the plant a boy has bruised,
Seeking alone to be amused,
All thoughtless that the tender flower
To grieve and bleed and die has power!
Nada's two loves, by tempests tossed,
Made her to feel that all was lost.
Her life had been a summer dream,
As placid as a woodland stream,
With just a ripple here and there,
With just a little bit of care;
Her father's love was all she knew
Of love, and from that love she drew
The beauty and the queenly pride
That made her famous far and wide.
She had reposed in his strong love
Confidingly, as would a dove,
As free from care, as free from grief,
As the sweet dew-drop on the leaf.
Lord Bondly's presence in her life
Had filled her soul with constant strife.
When once we hasten from the past
And rush into the future's blast;
When once the beaten path we shun
And into unknown by-paths run;
When once we leave the home port far
And confide in the Sailor's Star,
The pathless seas to brave and roam,
We may come back again to home!
"We may!" "We may!" many have sighed,
Hoping, but lost their way and died!
The wreckage, bleaching in the sand,
May still be found in every land!
A passing sigh, a vain regret,
A clinging hope that lingered yet,
Was all she to the past could give—
The past in which she longed to live!
The present held her captive still,
Obedient to a master will—
A will so strong she could no more
Resist its power than she could soar
To castles in the ambient air—
If there should be such castles there.
"I go!" she said, "but we shall meet
"Again and soon, when I can greet
"Thee in a happier, cheerfuller mood,
"But now my heart is sore and sad
"Beneath this vast o'erhanging shade;
"Not that I love not this abode,
"Through which primeval mankind strode;
"I love it, and I love thee well!
"Joy of my life, farewell! Farewell!"
Such power has love—a potion dread
That kills or cures the heart and head!
Filling the soul with glorious light
Or darkness of the fearsome night!
It lifts to heaven's fruition fair,
Or dashes down to hell's despair!
It leads through valleys where the blooms
Are ripening for the mills and looms,
By streams that oaks and cedars shade,
While wildly rushing through the glade!
It toils o'er rugged mountains steep,
Where snows in wakeless slumber sleep!
Alone, the strong man sat upon
A monarch of the woods, moss-grown,
Whose form a lightning bolt had split
And splintered as a boy would slit
A leaf, and doubt entered his mind,
Responsive to the questioning wind.
Suppose this dream should fade away,
As night engulfs the brightest day,
And leave a haunting memory—
Could such calamity e'er be?
Suppose Nada should vanish now,
Despite the beauty of her vow,
As she had come, from out his life—
What then? Grim Death! He drew a knife
From out its sheath—a dagger keen
And sharp as razor e'er had been,
With golden hilt, and o'er and o'er
Turned it, and felt the edge it bore,
With the deliberate calm and care
Which make the timid quake with fear.
"If she be false, thou wilt be true!"
Drawing the blade his fingers through.
"If she be false, thou wilt be true!
"And thou hast served me well; thou art
"My friend, cold blade! Close to my heart
"I hold thee! And, while I so hold
"Thee—sharp, keen, pitiless and cold—
"The antidote is surely mine,
"And safer, deadlier, than is wine,
"'Gainst treachery and the agony
"That woman's fickleness for ay
"Provokes! For what is life to me,
"With this love dead, but misery,
"But Death! Aye, what! Then you,
"If she be false, will still be true!"
And then his head drooped on his breast;
His limbs relaxed; his eyes expressed
Nothing—vacant—blank! O'er him fell
The potence of the old-time spell!
So blasted was the noble tree,
In lightning's rage, on which sat he.
CANTO IV.
Among the slaves Garcia did own
Was one in service aged grown,
The trusted mother of the place—
A part of Garcia's ancient race.
Nada she gave her Christian name,
And nursed her beauty into fame;
For she was present when the maid
First to earth's smile her tribute paid—
The baby nursed; she watched at play
The child through many a laggard day.
A mother she had joyed to be
To the sweet baby on her knee
And to the girl whose winsome smile
Even indulgence could not spoil,
And to the maiden—fair as morn,
When first the huntsman winds his horn,
Or when the slaves, their work begun,
Sing paeans to the rising sun—
A mentor she had been, and was—
Nada no other mother had, alas!
And many a Southern beauty fair
Rejoices in her "mammy's" care—
The dear black face, the tender heart,
Untutored in Refinement's art—
Devotion's slave, a willing slave,
With soul as good as God e'er gave
The freest, noblest, of her kind,
Of generous heart, of subtle mind!
Through all of Garcia's vast estate
Her word was law. She held the fate
Of high and low within her hands;
None dared dispute her wise commands.
Not e'en the master's curb restrained
Aunt Sara's sway. E'en he complained,
Sometimes, against her tyranny,
And, laughing, swore he would be free;
He did but jest. Full well he knew
The value of her service true!
She came and went as fancy moved her;
All feared her and, forsooth, all loved her—
A contradiction, if you will,
And, yet, a truth that hedged her still.
And many called her "Voudoo Queen"—
Perhaps their ignorance to screen.
She seldom spoke; but full of tact,
Deliberate in speech and act,
She easily controlled the strong,
And those who had committed wrong,
While timid mortals quaked with fear
Her stealthy step to even hear;
The urchins of the vast estate
Hung on her movements soon and late;
And, it is not too much to say,
Her eyes were on them night and day—
For boys are boys, or black or white—
Preferring darkness to the light,
Preferring evil to the good—
For mischief seems childhood's chief food!
No one could penetrate the source
From which Aunt Sara drew the force,
The nervous strength of soul and mind,
To rule her white and sable kind.
There was no mystery at all;
Her age and ready wit withal
Gave her the words and looks and acts—
The wit that grasps and controls facts—
That men respect and defer to,
In priests of Gentile and of Jew;
E'en as old age and clinging vines
Give to a tower its sharp-drawn lines,
That brave the flight of laggard years
And fury of the storm's mad tears!
None loved, none feared, Aunt Sara more
Than she whose life she had watched o'er,
The charming woman who had grown
From childhood as her pet, her own.
She loved, she feared, she knew not why,
This woman wrapt in mystery;
Or seemed to be, and that's the same
As being, since she had the name,
And disdained not to take the fame.
A strange freak, that, in all the race—
Earth's phantom power to love and chase,
To be distinguished from the mob,
With right of Might to rule and rob,
To grind to dust or starve and slay—
The tyrant right the fool to play.
Aunt Sara let th' ignorant think
That she could walk upon the brink
Of Life's abyss, and converse hold
With gri-gri dread of Afric old;
It gave her power and consequence
And satisfied her common sense;
If people wished to act the fool,
So well and good, was her safe rule;
If they were wise, and acted wise,
She simply sagely winked her eyes.
Nada's rich love and confidence
She gave Aunt Sara, whose good sense
Repaid her well; and, yet, with awe,
Aunt Sara's word with her was law;
She told her all her maiden woes
And joys—the hope that grows and grows
From childish joys to woman's fears,
From care-free smiles to heart-sore tears.
When Nada told Aunt Sara of
Ralph Bondly and her infant love,
She was so stunned she could not speak,
The crushing truth made her so weak.
"My dear," she said, "be not so mad!
"Forsooth, the Englishman is mad!
"A thing like that such noise would make
"That it would all our estates shake,
"Both here and in our Merry Spain!
"Indeed, we should not hear again
"The last of it! And, mark it well,
"Joy of my heart, yea, mark it well,
"Before the end, alive or dead,
"Thy father's curse upon thy head
"Would crush thee to th' unfeeling earth
"And all of thine that should have birth!
"No! No! Retrace the step, I pray,
"Retrace it, Nada, while you may!
"No error that we cannot mend,
"If we but listen to our friend,
"And with our stubborn wills contend!
"Take thou the wise, the better course,
"And save thyself lifelong remorse!
"The Fates decree," Aunt Sara said,
"That, if thou shouldst this stranger wed,
"Misfortune—lynx-eyed, fierce, and gaunt—
"Through all the earth thy life will haunt,
"Thy cherished hopes to foil and blight,
"Turning thy brightest day to night!
"Thy cup of anguish and of woe
"With sighs and groans will overflow,
"Till death shall come, thy sorrows past,
"The saddest chapter still the last!
"Be warned! Rush not to such a life
"Of vain regrets and ceaseless strife.
"'Tis written on the wall. Pause now!
"Retract thy foolish, hasty vow!
"Reflect whilst yet thou may'st, whilst yet
"The way is broad and free, nor let
"Thy evil genius of a day
"From the straight path lead thee astray!"
Young Nada shook as if a chill
Had griped her fragile form and will.
Where she had hoped for sympathy
To temper her sweet misery,
And counsel grave to do the right,
As God should give her Wisdom's light,
A warning found her hopes to blight!
The new-born woman in her cried
In anguish for the thing denied—
The wish to be Ralph Bondly's bride!
"'Tis false!" young Nada Garcia cried,
Touched in her love and in her pride;
"'Tis false! Ralph Bondly is not mad!
"And, if he be, am I not mad?
"Or sane or mad, I vow, we wed!
"I'll not recall my vow! 'Tis said!
"If that be death, to live apart
"Is crucifixion of the heart!
"Between the two my course is plain;
"Be mine the joy, be mine the pain;
"And, if I die, I'll be content,
"If all my life in woe be spent!"
Aunt Sara raised her hand. "Sweet one,
"The very ground thou treadst upon
"Trembles beneath thy feet. Beware,
"For woe and death are in the air!
"An hour of bliss for years of woe
"Is idle talk, as you well know.
"To die? For what? The thought is wild,
"And ill beseems my gentle child.
"Thou used not always thus to speak;
"Thou wast not always thus so weak.
"Life's sweetest roses grow for thee,
"And all the winds blow fair and free;
"With health and happiness they groan,
"Sweeping afar from zone to zone—
"For thee they ladened are, my own.
"Banish the idle thought of death—
"'Tis poison to thy queenly breath!—
"And conquer love, if love but lead
"To death—fair Eden's worst of seed!—
"For life is sweet; yes, life is sweet,
"While love is oft a spurious cheat.
"The wounds of disappointed love
"Will heal, my dear, as time will prove,"
"And what is life when love is gone?
"What?" cried she. "Love and life are one.
"We cannot separate the twain;
"As one they will for ay remain!
"When my sweet love—sweet love!—is dead,
"When my fond dream of love has fled,
"No more for me the royal sun
"His daily, stately course will run;
"No more the queenly moon will ride
"Triumphant through the milky tide;
"My life will go from whence it came,
"And vanish all of Garcia's name!
"Why should I live when love is dead
"And gloom through all the earth is spread?
"O, loyal, faithful, friend of mine,
"Thou ne'er hast felt the flame divine,
"Or thou wouldst plainly with me see
"That what thou wish'st can never be!
"When naught remains of all the hope
"That makes me no more blindly grope,
"But lifts my soul to Paradise,
"Where dwell alone the good and wise,
"But ashes, then, this earth would be
"A prison house, indeed, for me.
"O, let me love, or let me die,
"And, dreamless, in the cold earth lie!
"Say not he's mad! Or say I'm mad!
"It well may be we both are mad!
"Is love but madness—saneness—both?
"Is cursed or blessed love's binding oath!
"I do not know. I only know
"I love; and joy to have it so!"
Aunt Sara grieved, sincerely grieved,
To see that love such spell had weaved;
But firm in her position still,
She strove to bend the maiden's will.
"My dear," she said, "thou canst not know
"How much I share thy joy and woe;
"Thy every thought appeals to me,
"Just as it must appeal to thee;
"No hope thy gentle soul can move
"That does not rouse my constant love;
"I'd give my life to save thee pain,
"To know thee free from care again—
"The joyous, trusting child at play
"About my knee the long, long day—
"The days before Ralph Bondly came
"And fanned to fire love's smouldering flame.
"O, woe is me, in mine old age,
"With thee such angry war to wage,
"To plead with thee, in vain to plead,
"Thou wouldst preserve the Garcia seed;
"For, mark my words, thou wilt destroy
"Thy peace of earth and heaven's great joy,
"If thou shalt still persist, perforce,
"In thy unholy, fatal course!
"O, let my words persuade thee, dear,
"And swerve thee from the danger near!
"I would not have thee wreck thy life,
"Unwarned to plunge into the strife,
"For one whose mind thou canst not know,
"A changing mind as th' winds that blow!
"Remain with those whose love hath made
"Thy life all sunshine, and no shade,
"Sweet years to thee of peace and joy,
"Which one false step may now destroy.
"Remain with us! No evil wind,
"E'en from the Arctic unconfined,
"Shall fan thy face that we can ward
"By valiant act or loving word!
"Between thee and the world we'll stand,
"With love as our magician's wand,
"With tenderness to smooth thy brow—
"Where sadness hovers even now!"
All pleading was, alas! in vain—
But magnified her sense of pain—
Her isolation from the hearts
That practiced not Deception's arts,
The faithful, honest, loyal few
Who to her always had been true—
The narrow domain of the home,
We reap our chiefest pleasures from!
Her mind was set—set as the oak
Which braved the storm and lightning stroke
Of ages in their mystic flight
Into the Past's confusing night!
For, when a woman will, she will,
Or be it good or be it ill!
Persuasive words nor ugly threats
Have ever cancelled love's just debts,
Or won o'er love's young dream, forsooth,
A victory—for love is truth
And truth is love! So strangely are
The victims bound, they do not care,
They do not heed, but follow where
They hope to find a haven fair!
No warning voice, no danger feared,
Have e'er two loving souls deterred;
Still constant, true, young hearts remain—
An hour of bliss! an age of pain!
The fearful cost! The little gain!
And yet, as 'twere a fashion's fad,
The whole world seems to be love mad.
The courtship ended, life they face,
And Romance drops to commonplace;
The skies grow black, the path grows long,
The strong grow weak, the weak grow strong,
And hearts once young too soon grow old,
And hearts once warm too soon grow cold,
And beauty fades and backs are bent
And all the fires of Hope are spent;
For dreams are dreams, the real is real—
"For better or for worse"—for woe or weal!
CANTO V.
Don Garcia, with advancing age,
For he was living life's last page,
Became more headstrong and more vain,
If to that state he could attain;
More pronounced in his hates and spites,
Less careful, too, of others' rights.
The name of Bondly stirred his ire
As pitch-pine does a smouldering fire,
And, when with Nada's linked—O, shame!—
He like a crazy man became.
'Tis comical, at times, to see
How big a fool a man can be
When he allows his prejudice
To fall into a common vice.
He would not reason out the case
'Bout Bondly and the English race;
He hated them, and ever should,
And would not like them if he could;
Young Nada trembled when the spell
Of passion on her father fell.
We pity him, the brave old knight,
On whom old age had fixed its blight!
Nada to him made her last plea.
He said: "My child, it cannot be!
"Thy plea cannot prevail! I hate
"The man! I hate him! Not e'en Fate
"Can alter my unbending scorn
"Of every thing of England born.
"Vex not my patience more. No thing
"In earth I love as I do thee,
"But, on thy natal day shall be
"My curse, if thou shouldst rashly wed
"The man I hate! Mark well! 'Tis said.
"Thou art of age, and, in thy right,
"Mistress of ample wealth. 'Tis thine;
"Take it, and, soon, all that is mine
"As well. Thou wilt thy father lose,
"A husband gain—is 't hard to choose?—
"And, with him, honest prayer of mine,
"Thou be the last of Garcia's line!
"Go, then! A father's curse is all
"I place between thee and thy fall!"
"I go!" she said, with erect form
And flashing eyes, facing the storm.
"I go! A blessing asked! Instead,
"A curse thou hurlest at my head!
"So be it! I love thee well! Yet,
"I will the past—thy love!—forget,
"As thou hast willed, though it should break
"The heart thy curses cannot shake!
"I am thy daughter, it is true—
"Forget not, I'm a Garcia, too!
"Be mine the blame, if death be mine!
"And peace and joy and life be thine!
"I go! Be mine the curse—the pain!
"Betwixt ye two my path is plain!"
Don Garcia shook with angry rage,
Regardless of his gout and age,
Surprised and shocked in her to find
The fury of the desperate hind,
Rebellious 'gainst his will and word,
Who was her parent and her lord—
A thing she never dared before
And never should again, he swore.
"Then, go!" he hissed, "Why longer stay
"To vex me with thy presence, pray?
"Go—meet thy doom, thy tragic fate!
"Go—wed the Englishman I hate!
"For thou shalt reap as thou shalt sow!
"Take thou my parent curse, and go!"
And thus they parted—they whose pride
The love of years could override!
The new love bade the old love go;
And so it was, and will be so,
Till all of Adam's scattered seed
Shall cease to hope, shall cease to bleed.
Forever from the past we fly—
We know not whence, we know not why—
Out of the day, into the night,
All heedless in the headlong flight!
Don Garcia bowed his aged head
And wished, alas! that he were dead!
His eagle eyes grew dim with tears;
Remorse filled his proud breast with fears;
And desolation—awful, dread—
Settled on his devoted head!
From her all joy he long had gleaned,
Upon her as a staff he leaned—
The hope and prop of his old age,
Which he had blasted in his rage!
He well could drown his woe in tears
And sigh away his haunting fears!
The bitter words had burned his tongue
E'en from his mouth as they had sprung,
Charged as the lightning's forkèd flame,
To blast the thing that bore his name—
The only thing! E'en as he spake
Nada's resolve he hoped to break
By working on her maiden fear—
Nor was he first in that to err!
He could have won his child anew,
To his old self had he been true,
Now she had gone, and he was crushed—
While voice of love and hate was hushed!
He had the sorrow and the woe
As first fruits of his vengeful blow;
But, e'en thus weighted, left alone,
Garcia would not his error own—
Would not his heartless words recall—
Temper the wormwood and the gall.
His word was law! Who disobeyed,
Who braved his wish, was promptly flayed—
Had he the power. So, sad to tell,
The only thing that he loved well,
Committed th' unpardonable crime
For the first and the only time!
But what had been, had been! The past
Was past! The present held him fast,
And it was full of gloom—the gloom
That settles o'er a new-made tomb!
The future—'twas one ball of night,
Through which there pierced no ray of light!
He felt as one whose craft the gale
Had robbed of compass, mast and sail,
While all about him spread the sea
That soon his luckless grave might be!
And sudden fell the mighty stroke
That rent the craft of steel and oak!
Awhile upon the waves 'twill ride
Then sink—its glory and its pride!
Old age makes man a child again—
Peevish, irritable and vain,
Who thinks and plans for self alone,
Nor cares how others weep and groan—
The selfishness that fills all life
With bickerings and petty strife.
And sometimes giant wrongs and crimes
That blot the annals of the times!
We make the bed on which we rest,
Or tortured are, by grief distressed;
We hew the paths we daily tread
Towards the City of the Dead,
Or smooth or rough, just as we will,
Or through the vale or o'er the hill;
We make the storm, the sunshine make,
Our hopes to bolster or to shake,
The smiles that dissipate our fears,
Or heartbreaks that o'erflow in tears.
These are our works; and, as we sow,
We reap, a crop of joy or woe.
The havoc of a word could we,
In all its ghastliness, foresee,
Or, yet, the terror a frown may cause,
The consequence might make us pause.
We ne'er on man or beast a wound
Inflict but, in the end, 'tis found,
It hurts us too, as much somehow,
And as we least expect the blow!
A wrong to one, a wrong to all,
Comes down to us from Adam's fall,
And governs in our actions still
For woe or weal, and ever will!
Let pleasing notes escape the lyre,
Notes that uplift, enthuse, inspire,
As o'er its strings the fingers stray,
To cheer our fellows on life's way;
Nor seek in Nature, or its laws,
Or in its lord, in man, for flaws,
To serve a selfish whim of thine;
Be generous all thou may'st design.
The best of marksmen may o'ershoot
His mark—his victim man or brute!
Th' imperious judge, who, in his pride,
Refused with Bondly to divide
Affection in a lovely bride—
The daughter exiled from his breast,
Which long had been her place of rest—
Joy of his home, pride of his eye,
And hope of his posterity—
Th' imperious judge, Don Garcia, fell
So low and was so miserable,
That e'en the slave within his gate
Envied him not his poor estate!
Old age and gout, but half his woe,
And wounded pride, laid Garcia low!
A raging fever burned his brain
And rioted in every vein,
So that he raved and swore like one
That demons foul had seized upon!
The once stout heart, the once strong will,
Were mastered by a stronger still,
In the death grapple—hopeless fight!—
Or waged in darkness or in light,
Which all must wage, or soon or late,
Who live and hope and love and hate!
And all the hist'ry of the past,
All that to earth had held him fast,
The social triumphs and the wars,
The laurels won, the ugly scars,
Passed through his fevered brain again—
A grotesque and a tragic train!
AND THEN HE DIED! 
None of his blood,
That came down to him from the Flood,
Was near him in the final hour
When vanished all of mortal power;
But old Aunt Sara stood beside
The noble column's broken pride,
As she had done when he was born,
With none but slaves with her to mourn!
The age of Seers and Prophecy
Has passed, like that of chivalry!
It came out of the lap of Faith,
So record and tradition saith,
And has returned to whence it came—
The Rod divine and Bush of Flame!
Men hoped and prayed and cursed and blest,
When Faith was all that they possessed!
So Nada and Ralph Bondly found
All prophecy but empty sound—
All curses harmless as the wind
That whistles through the broken blind.
And still they live and love, while seers
And curses fill them not with fears!
YOU WILL FORGET!
You will go hence, sweetheart, and leave me,
And may forget
We ever met—
And that it is, alas! will grieve me!
And, yet, the past—
How could it last!
And could I know you would deceive me!
The fleeting hours we spent together—
The rambles far
'Neath sun and star
In peaceful calm and stormy weather,
By hedge and stream—
A Summer dream—
Our hearts as light as lightest feather—
Can you forget
That we have met!
A FALSE MAIDEN.
I.
Here is the oak beneath whose friendly shade
We spent one charming, fleeting, Summer day,
And talked the gathering gloom of woe away—
Duping ourselves that earth for us was made
A fairy land, where we might hope and pray
A path of peaceful love before us lay,
Leading to some rare spot, where ne'er could fade
The vows for which we had so dearly paid.
But all is changed! The Oak remains as then—
And I remain! But, where, O where! art thou?
Gone—vanished as a vision! Doubt I, when
I look around, if we, as I do now,
E'er stood together here, and dreamed that earth
Held other than a curse for our love's birth.
II.
Yes, changes came; and circumstance, or fate,
Hath led us far apart, and made the past
But as a memory—which, yet, will last,
Surviving all, and bidding me to wait,
And trust, and brave the angry skies o'ercast,
As storm-tossed sailors lash them to the mast,
Hoping 'gainst hope all will be well, and late,
But sure, return to me my long-lost mate!
So spreads the prospect to the anxious eye!
So stilled is Reason's cold but friendly voice!
The storm-charged clouds may hide the gorgeous sky,
But soon the sunshine comes, and we rejoice!
And love will hope when hope is bruised and dead
And all but mem'ry of the past hath fled!
III.
The dream has ended, as a tale that's told!
The past is dead—aye, dead!—and nevermore
Shall you and I be as we were before
The dream, once young, grew commonplace and old.
Whence vanished it—aye, to what blissful shore?
But, still, the love that I for you once bore
Is warm, and never, never, can grow cold,
E'en though you sell yourself for serpent gold.
A thing that I have loved can I e'er hate?
Not so! A sacred thing must it remain
While I, through sun and shadow, wait and wait,
The coming of the hour when, free from pain,
I pass away—as things of earth must do—
True, even though you are to me untrue.
IV.
Go, then! I will not, would not, bid you stay!
Go, reap the agony and pain that lower,
And ever lower, upon the fatal hour
When selfishness alone points out the way
That leads to Love's retreat, its sacred bower!
Go! oh, remember, I have not the power,
If you would go, to bid you longer stay!
Leave me in life's fierce storm to bend and cower!
True, I have loved you well and loved you long,
And followed you where'er, afar, you went,
Followed in thought and silent prayer and song—
Followed you still with hope, and discontent.
Enough! The Fates decree! The past—is past!
Know you, false one, it was too sweet to last?
IT FELL, THE GIANT OAK.
It fell, the giant oak
Around whose head the years had rolled!
The towering column broke
We deemed of most enduring mold!
No man could say when fell
The little germ from which it sprang!
Perchance the Indian's yell
Around its base for ages rang!
Or, else, in times remote,
That stalwart oak had shelter been
To tribes of whom no note
Was left to keep their mem'ry green.
But, full of years, it cowered
Before the fury of the storm!
Its age, its bulk, o'erpowered,
'Twill lapse into its primal form!
So men and nations rise
By painful, slow, and steady stage,
Fill earth with high emprise,
Until they reach a ripe old age—
And then they fall—borne down
By their own greatness, as it were—
Give back to God the crown
They wore with pride or manly fear.
All mundane things decline!
The proudest nations soon must fall!
The tendrils of the vine
But hide the breaches in the wall.
THE TOWERING CLIFFS.
Here let us pause awhile, fair one, and rest!—
The toilsome ascent hence has wearied thee,
And much, I fear, it has not rested me—
Here let us pause awhile, here rest, 'tis best.
How beautiful the scene! How fair to see!
No Eastern scene, I ween, can fairer be.
I am, at such a time and place, possessed
With joy supreme, with thee, dear one, to be.
The towering cliffs are eloquent; and so
The calm and peaceful river at our feet,
Flowing in stately measure far below,
From which the hum of voices e'en is sweet.
But what is all the world to me beside
The hope that thou wilt be my loving bride!
WORDS OF LOVE FOREVERMORE.
There is rapture in the thought,
From thy words of constance caught,
That the world contains no prize
Like the peace thy love supplies.
And I ponder o'er and o'er
Words of love forevermore,
As they come in tenderest tone
From thy heart—which is my own.
THE WILD WAVES TOSS THE DRIFTWOOD HIGH.
The wild waves toss the driftwood high
Upon the rocks or gleaming sands
And there in scattered sort they lie,
The spoils of many distant lands.
And now and then a pleading face,
In mute appeal to God, is turned,
In which we seek in vain to trace
The perished thought that glowed and burned.
And once I saw upon the sands
A baby with bright golden hair;
Clinched were the darling's little hands
And on its lips a smile was there.
BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO.
One day, 'twas long ago,
I met a maiden fair to see,
A maiden fair and dear to me—
But that was long ago.
She was so fair, I know;
How fair she was I cannot say,
But fairer than a morn of May—
But that was long ago.
And we did make a vow
That we some day would wed,
Following where sly Cupid led—
But that was long ago.
The years went slowly by—
I know not where they went,
Into what other forms were blent—
Perhaps into a sigh.
And then, we met, I know;
But all the fire of youth had fled,
And all the love of youth was dead—
But that was long ago.
And not a word, I vow,
Of that dead past by us was said—
We each some other one had wed!
But that was long ago.
TELL ME, YE SAD WINDS.
Tell me, ye sad winds sighing,
With the long night fast dying,
Whither ye go,
Halting and slow,
When the birds, sweet singing,
Come, the young dawn bringing!
THE SAVAGE DREAMER.
Nor fleeting time, nor space, can change
The nature of the savage strange
Whose heart was touched long years ago
By love fruition ne'er could know!
She seemed a fairy queen who won
His savage love, at set of sun,
Where Montauk's point looks on the sea,
That ne'er was restless as was he!
But she was daughter of the race
Who spurn the children of the chase,
And, though they loved, they could not wed—
And that was worse than to be dead!
The End.

PREFACE. 
 In coming into the literary world with the following poem, 
 1 cannot help being conscious of the seriousness of the venture. 
 I am aware that there are many faulty lines, and many 
 verses that might best be left out. Yet, feeling that there may 
 be some merit in the poem, as a whole, and unable, myself, to 
 judge what is the best and what is the worst of that, the whole 
 of which I love, I come with it into the world of letters, await- 
 ing, as many have before me, my fate, at the hands of the 
 never-mistaken critic. 
 If the people of Brown Chapel, with their pastor, will help 
 to steal away the duller hours of the reader, I shall deem the 
 task I have attempted well done. 
 Brown Chapel, its people and scenes are all, with a few ex- 
 ceptions on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, w^here I served 
 as pa'stor in the ministry of the A. M. E. connection for five 
 years. And these five years, despite their being the beginning 
 of my active work, and filled with peculiar hardships, too well- 
 known to preachers on the Eastern Shore, I shall alw^ays treas- 
 ure in memory with the fondest joy. 
 For the people of the Eastern Shore I have only words of 
 praise. There, among them of both races I found a hearty co- 
 operation in my efforts to extend the Redeemer's Kingdom, 
 and should it please God to have my lot once more cast among 
 them, I should be only too, glad to serve them. 
 Hoping that the people among whom I first labored may 
 find time to peruse these pages, and that such may be of pleas- 
 ure to them, I bid my friends farewell, till I shall again tune 
 my harp to better and nobler songs. 
 Baltimore, Aug. 27, 1903. 
DEDICATORY. 
 To mother who first taught these lips 
 To Hsp the measured notes of rhyme, 
 And bade my fancy take its flight 
 To fairy tales of olden time, 
 The offering of her only boy, 
 This song I sing. May she enjoy 
BROWN CHAPEL. 
 Canto I. 
 THE NEW PASTOR. 
 I. 
 This Sabbath morn the sun came up, 
 And looked from out a cloudless sky; 
 The dew besprinkled butter cup, 
 The gentle bluets growing nigh, 
 Smiled to behold the day and hear 
 The lark's glad song which filled the air ; 
 And, some how, there was quiet cheer 
 On hill and meadow everywhere; 
 Some unseen spirit seemed to say 
 "Behold, it is the Holy Day." 
 n. 
 The little chapel in the lane. 
 Not far from off the public road. 
 Had all her blinds thrown back again, 
 And opened windows plainly showed 
 The good old sexton's busy form. 
 The first to see that all was right, — 
 That nothing from last Friday's storm 
 Had damaged been. The morning light 
 Streamed thro' the windows; each recess 
 Beamed back a hallowed blessedness. 
8 Mown chapel. 
 III. 
 The simple color of the wall 
 Did throw a halo o'er the place; 
 Its gentle stillness might appall 
 The worldly, he with heart of grace, 
 As had the sexton, moved about, 
 In spirit of calm peace and joy, 
 With such a faith which knows no doubt. 
 That never a danger can destroy; 
 Ay, just to see this sacred spot; 
 Enough : the world was all forgot. 
 IV. 
 Here all alone the chapel stood 
 With not a cottage within sight ; 
 Northwestward sheltered by a wood, 
 Southeastward open to the light. 
 The blessed sun each morning brought 
 And poured upon it all alone : 
 It seemed as if an angel sought 
 Its sacred doors when night was gone. 
 His bright glow throwing all around, 
 Soft whispered, "This is holy ground." 
 V. 
 No wonder then the simple folk 
 Did Sabbath after Sabbath seek 
 Its portals. Who would say to talk 
 O'er what transpired thro' the week? 
 Perhaps, perhaps, but deeper still; 
 No light-fraught gossip was their quest : 
 They came that they their souls might fill 
 With fat things of eternal rest; 
 They came to sing, they came to pray — 
 But something else brought them to-day. 
The new pastor. 
 VI. 
 But something else brought them to-day; 
 They came the Word of God to hear — 
 Not that they would forget to pray, 
 (The meanest there believed in prayer,) 
 And yet another motive brought 
 These goodly people to this spot. 
 If 'twere a lower end they sought — 
 If such their wrong condemn them not; 
 They came, to be more plain in speech, 
 To hear their new sent pastor preach. 
 VII. 
 And so both old and young w^ere glad 
 To see the sky so bright to-day, 
 And maidens were as gayly clad 
 As would be well the ''first of May." 
 The lads put on their Sunday clothes, 
 And vied with each to look their best; 
 And spinsters tied on extra bows 
 To be not wanting with the rest ; 
 While all the elder men agreed 
 To show themselves of gentle breed. 
 VIII. 
 So when the young divine who had 
 The night before with Bro. Nooks 
 Sojourned, came down the road, neat, clad 
 Clerically, his very looks 
 Impressed them who about the door 
 In groups were standing all the while; 
 And if some liked him not before. 
 No sooner than they caught his smile 
 The most in doubt liked the divine, 
 And every maid pronounced him "fine." 
 IX. 
 And so with Deacon Nooks, he went 
 Straight to the pulpit. There he knelt, 
 And must have prayed : the moments spent, 
 Themselves betrayed in what was felt. 
 The simple choir, voices sweet, 
 Was there. The lovely organist 
 An anthem played the while. Each ?eat 
 Within the church was filled. If missed 
 Had many been the days before. 
 Here they were seen to-day for sure. 
 X. 
 The hymn was sung, the prayer was prayed. 
 The choir never had before, 
 (This was what Bro. Simpson said), 
 Sung half so well ; they seemed to soar. 
 That is their voices, on the wings 
 Of heavenly mission on that day, 
 As if their minds to worldly things 
 Had never a moment chanced to stray; 
 Yet sly Rosetta missed a line, 
 In looking at the young divine. 
 XI. 
 The prayer was prayed; it rose aloft 
 In adoration to the Throne. 
 At times the voice was low and soft, 
 And next it had a thundering tone. 
 Which caused old Bro. Simon Snout 
 To raise his head that he might see 
 If 'twere the same voice, then to shout, 
 And let his feelings full and free 
 Have all the range they wanted ; then. 
 At every word he cried "Amen !" 
 XIL. 
 And now the Scripture simply read ; 
 The Decalogue responded to; 
 The choir well its strength displayed 
 In bringing in a hymn or two. 
 The way is cleared, he rose to speak : 
 ''To spend and to be spent for you." 
 Such was the theme. He came to seek 
 Not his own good, but 'twas to do 
 All that was in his power to bring 
 Them to their God, their rightful King. 
 XIII. 
 He came to tell them nothing new, 
 The old, old story would be told; 
 The Holy City brought to view, 
 Of jasper walls and streets of gold; 
 The same old chart to reach the place; 
 The same old Truths on which to stand; 
 The promise of sufficient grace 
 To lead one safely through this land ; 
 And from the spirit of each text. 
 To lead him safely to the next. 
 XIV. 
 He came to make no difference. 
 The meanest of the flock he sought; 
 The Scripture was his evidence 
 That grace was for the vilest wrought; 
 He came to seek, he came to save. 
 He came to lift men's longings to 
 What Christ to every sinner gave, — 
 Ay, not himself but Christ to view — 
 If 'twere to stand there in Christ's stead, 
 It were to be Christ-like indeed. 
 XV. 
 No wonder, then, the people said, 
 When that short half an hour was o'er, 
 Commenting on the prayer prayed, 
 The sermon preached, never before 
 Had they enjoyed a better treat; 
 No wonder Sis. Lizzie Green 
 Who ne'er before had gone to meet, 
 To-day was at the altar seen; 
 And such a shaking hands, 'twas free 
 To think she'd have him home to tea. 
 XVI. 
 And Bro. Peter Scroggins said, 
 (He was the local preacher there,) 
 He thought that Deacon Nooks had prayed, 
 But Nooks wa'n't in it in that prayer.* 
 And, well, the choir sat, and sat, 
 And hung upon his eloquence. 
 Rosetta whispered, ''Now, hear that, 
 I bet you that he has some sense." 
 And spell-bound sat the organist, 
 Nor single word was by her missed. 
 XVH. 
 For her the morning service had 
 Far more than for the others there; 
 She saw in that tall figure clad 
 Clerically, another. Clear 
 It was his form, his very face ; 
 His deep, rich voice of other days, 
 His clear delivery of grace, 
 Which years ago had won him praise; 
 And yet that once all reckless youth. 
 To-day expounder of God's Truth ! 
THE NEW PASTOR. 13 
 XVIII. 
 What wondrous miracle was this? 
 ''We are his workmanship," the thought 
 Came home that morn to her. The bhss 
 Which she now feh had not been wrought 
 By what he said, but what he was. 
 Did not she feel at first surprise 
 When he had entered? — when to pass 
 He turned and placed on her those eyes? 
 One look suffice, it was to say 
 He was her once fond lover, Ray. 
 XIX. 
 And had he recognized her ? No : 
 At least it didn't seem he had. 
 The gaze spoke not of long ago 
 On his part. Some how she was sad 
 But played that morn as ne'er before. 
 And twice she thought she felt his gaze ; 
 And as she played her hands ran o'er 
 The keys as in the other days. 
 When he had at the organ stood. 
 And sung with her, as well he could. 
 XX. 
 "How one's paths cross," she sat and thought 
 While he with fiery eloquence 
 That little congregation .wrought 
 To highest pitch of zeal. Perchance 
 Her mind was too much occupied 
 With other thoughts, she might lose sight 
 Of the main points which he now tried - 
 To simplify in figures bright. 
 She felt reproved when he was through , 
 To think she had not "felt" him too, 
 XXL 
 "And you enjoyed the sermon?" said 
 Her husband to her, going home 
 *1 did ? O yes," as she betrayed 
 Her deep abstraction. "He will come,*' 
 Her husband still continued to 
 Remark, "on Thursday night to tea — 
 I had not time to speak with you, 
 So many rushed ahead of me, 
 I then and there made with him date 
 For fear that I should be too late." 
 xxn. 
 "Of course," she bit her lips and said. 
 And tried to act as unconcerned : 
 And yet she felt that she betrayed 
 The fire that within her burned. 
 But Charles, an unsuspecting man, 
 Walked on with here and there a word 
 On general topics, or some plan, 
 The half of which she never heard, 
 Till to their cottage came at last, 
 Where they soon broke their mid-day fast. 
CROSSING OF PATHS. 1 5 
 Canto II. 
 CROSSING OF PATHS. 
 I. 
 The Rev. Raymond Aldrich Stone 
 Was very tall and spare in size ; 
 A clean kept face of lightish brown, 
 A massive brow and large black eyes, 
 A sharp curved nose, a well shaped mouth, 
 And chin that argued firmness, too; 
 Large, generous ears, the marks of truth; 
 Straight, wavy hair of blackest hue; 
 A face of strong intelligence, 
 A man of clean cut common sense. 
 XL 
 He was yet young, the thread of Time 
 Around him measured thirty-three; 
 He thus had not yet reached his prime, 
 And still had many years to see, 
 And yet he older looked : perchance, 
 His love for learning was the cause; 
 Yes, there was every evidence; 
 Here he dared much on nature's laws, 
 'Twas common that they termed him such 
 "A man that studied far too much." 
 III. 
 He was not married. Somehow, he, 
 Up to this time, had led a Hfe 
 Of bachelorhood, yet seemed to be 
 Just as content without a wife. 
 Some eight years as a pastor, now. 
 With some experience, he went 
 Among his flock, nor would allow 
 A minute o'er his time be spent 
 In any visit, so exact 
 Was he in each pastoral act. 
 IV. 
 His elder brethren watched his course, 
 And wondered at his sturdy gait, 
 Seemed not to realize the force 
 That gave to him such powerful weight. 
 He all unconscious of his power. 
 Pursued his path day after day; 
 Stood at his post the darkest hour, 
 Nor in it all forgot to pray; 
 And yet, the Rev. Stone was human: 
 Once in his life he loved a woman ! 
 V. 
 Once in his life, his early life, 
 He loved a woman only as 
 A boy could love, make her his wiie 
 His only hope, but Fate, alas, 
 (Or better still, wise Providence,) 
 Saw fit to have it different; 
 A bitter blow, and yet the sense 
 0(f it he saw, knew what it meant, 
 His worldly longings sacrificed 
 Upon the altar of his Christ, 
 VI. 
 And that was o'er ten years ago ; 
 Since then all life had different been ; 
 And, women, he had come to know 
 In many ways. Ah, he had seen 
 Through different glasses, learnt to smile 
 When not a single joy he felt; 
 And with his brain hard learnt to toil, — 
 Deep in life's mysteries had dealt; 
 Had learnt ere life had half begun 
 The loss was less than what was won. 
 VII. 
 The loss was less than what was won; 
 Alone within the world, he strove 
 Not in the world to live alone. 
 But love the world in that one love — 
 That love, which, crushed, had never died. 
 Ay, though the heart had wounded been. 
 It still lived on, now sanctified, 
 It burned, now flaming pure and clean, 
 And having all its fullness known. 
 He lived that he might serve alone. 
 VIII. 
 Then with a perfect solid sense 
 Of all that God would have him do, 
 Blessed with the conscious evidence 
 Of his conversion, to pursue 
 The chosen path of duty, he 
 Found not too hard, despite the rough; 
 He went his way diligently , 
 In the firm steps of faith : enough, 
 Though he must travel on alone. 
 To know t^he Master led hjm on. ' , 
 IX. 
 This was the secret of it all ; 
 A simple boy whose only trust 
 Was God. Then if he did not fall, 
 Despite that others said he ''must," 
 Is not there reason? 'Twas that grace. 
 Of which St. Paul, so hampered, spoke: 
 This kept our hero ''in his place," 
 And by it every band he broke. 
 Wrought to entrap him. All may be 
 Sustained by it as well as he. 
 X. 
 And that was o'er ten years ago, 
 A college man, a reckless lad. 
 He met her, and he loved her so. 
 And she was lovely, but she- had 
 A horror for his reckless ways; 
 And if she loved him, would not own. 
 Refused to see him. Rumor says. 
 Went home; got married; and poor Stone, 
 Though staggering beneath the stroke. 
 From it to better things awoke. 
 XI. 
 An orphan, he had made his way 
 By his own hands into the world ; 
 Learnt by sheer force with fate to play. 
 Learnt to escape the darts she hurled. 
 He joined the church of his own choice. 
 And forthwith to her conference; 
 'Twas soon the elders heard his voice 
 And recognized his eloquence. 
 He at the Seminary spent 
 Two years, degreed, thus out he went, 
CROSSING OF PATHS. 1 9 
 XII. 
 And yet, the Rev. Raymond Stone 
 Saw nothing m himself; a sense 
 Of lowHness there was alone, 
 Which seemed to fill him with intense 
 Desire to improve, to grow 
 In grace and knowledge ; ever bent 
 To learn those things he did not know, 
 Each moment in the day was spent 
 In diligence, and when the sun 
 Went down, it left that day's work done. 
 XIII. 
 At night, the church was packed, the fame 
 Of the new pastor went abroad ; 
 And those who by misfortune came 
 Too late, stood patient in the road. 
 'Tor me to live is Christ." His theme 
 Was lofty, and his audience 
 Sat wrought up like a mighty stream 
 That rages from the swells intense 
 Of recent storms augmenting sway, 
 Might any moment burst away ! 
 XIV. 
 This was the pinnacle, he said. 
 Of Christian excellence, the place 
 Of all, who by the Spirit led, 
 Would live beneath the smile of Grace. 
 He lived in vain who would not crave 
 To reach that summit. Selfishness 
 Of such a man had made a slave. 
 That in this world would aim at less. 
 ''Life's not mere meat and drink alone," 
 The speaker said in solemn tone, 
 XV. 
 Again the service closed, the day 
 Had thus been spent; another week 
 Before the people came that way 
 Again to hear their pastor speak. 
 Around the altar now to-night 
 They crowd and firmly press his hand. 
 They speak of spiritual delight 
 In ways he could but understand. 
 He spoke just as the Spirit led, 
 Explaining, that was what he said. 
 XVI. 
 The choir, too, deserved some praise, 
 It had assisted him so much 
 Within the human way. He stays 
 To see the singers. It was such 
 As he had always done before. 
 He said, he thought they should be "one." 
 • The leader stood down at the door. 
 Yes, they had all splendidly done. 
 And then her hand he might have missed. 
 But there she stood, the organist. 
 XVII. 
 "Ah, thank you for your work," and he 
 Took her long slender hand, her eyes 
 Met his. 'Tt did so much for me; 
 I do love music." She replies 
 Some little nothing ; but the sound 
 Of that clear voice caused him to look 
 Again at her. Somehow he found 
 Himself recalling — then he took 
 Her hand again with "You-you-you- 
 Remind me niuch of one I knew !" 
CROSSING OF PATHS. 21 
 XVIII. 
 "Ah, Rev., don't forget our tea 
 On Thursday night." Her husband came 
 That moment. Thus awakened he 
 Controlled himself. ''Regard your claim 
 Brother-r-r — " ''Melville," he helped out with a smile. 
 "Yes, yes, that's so ; you see I can't 
 Just now hold names, but wait awhile 
 And I shall know you all. I want 
 To visit all your section then ; 
 And SO I'll see you soon again." 
 XIX. 
 May Melville heard, smiled, bowed and went 
 In company with her husband home. 
 . And Stone, alone with Nooks, intent 
 Upon this voice, he thought that some 
 Where he had heard it — "Bro. Nooks, 
 Who- was the organist before 
 She married?" "Mary-Mary Brooks," 
 The old man said, "Tho' I'm not sure, 
 But Betsy knows ; you see she's not 
 Just all together of our lot." 
 XX. 
 No, that did not suggest at all 
 Who she might be. "What do you mean — 
 Is this her home?" Just then a call 
 From one ahead, "Is that you, Jean ?" 
 'Twas Sis. Nooks who'd gone ahead 
 With other sisters, waiting stood 
 Now all alone, since not afraid 
 Had parted at the crossing road. 
 "Yes, hit's me, Betsy." Then he said, 
 "What was that gal's name Melville wed?" 
i± BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XXI. 
 " 'Twas Mary, Mary Brookins ; yes, 
 That was her name; she's from the North, 
 And too a hkely gal. I guess 
 She's certainly a lot of worth 
 Now to our church. She made the choir. 
 And bought the organ, taught the school, 
 And raised it up just two grades higher. 
 Then spoiled it all by turning fool 
 To marry Melville, may be though 
 For our own good 'twas better so." 
 XXII. 
 That night, the Rev. Raymond Stone 
 Sat in the room assigned to him. 
 Half dressed. The house to sleep had js:one. 
 His lamp was burning rather dim. 
 And in his hand a photograph 
 Which he had always carried near 
 His beating heart. A low soft laugfh. 
 And gazing on it, thus : "My dear, 
 'Thy sins,' 'tis said, 'shall find thee out,' 
 And here 'tis proved beyond a doubt. 
 XXIII. 
 'T might have known those eyes at once, 
 And yet, how she has changed since then. 
 Ah, well, 'twas then I played the dunce. 
 Yes, sowed wild oats like other men ; 
 And now when many years have rolled 
 Around, Mame Brookins, you and I 
 Must meet — no, neither as of old — 
 Yet gladly, I must not deny. 
 And now yotir husband asking me 
 On Thursday evening to tea. 
Crossing of paths. 2J 
 XXIV. 
 *'God give me strength to meet you here, 
 Yes, may He richly send that grace 
 Of which I preach, for it is clear, 
 I well may need it in this place. 
 These simple people all too much 
 Have fallen in love with me, so short 
 A time. I do not like it, such 
 Forbodes me ill. Let me resort 
 To God lest I be found undone." 
 So musing, prayed the Rev. Stone. 
 XXV. 
 For, on his knees that night, he put 
 Those thoughts in 'Avords. Experience 
 Had taught him when he placed his foot 
 Upon some grounds. He felt the sense 
 Of greatest need just now. He poured 
 His soul in supplication out. 
 He pleaded on the promised Word, 
 He begged deliverance from all doubt : 
 He gave himself to God to keep. 
 Then like a child, he fell asleep. 
 Canto III. 
 THE PARISH. 
 I. 
 Brown Chapel had no parsonage, 
 Though well it could afford to have. 
 Its people in a healthy stage 
 Of thriftness could easily save 
 From off their crops enough to build 
 A small neat cottage near the church. 
 However, they must be instilled 
 With the great need. And then to search 
 For men to do it, see it done, — 
 And this not long, concluded Stone. 
 11. 
 'His eight .years' preaching taught him that 
 A pastor was the best off. when 
 Left to himself, no matter what 
 The good intents of other men 
 Might be, 'twere few could understand 
 A preacher's place. Therefore, to be 
 Housed in with others when there's land 
 Just waiting to be built on, he 
 Had no intentions, even though, 
 Among them it might start a row- 
THE PARISH. ^5 
 III. 
 And so^ he brought this up at board, 
 These five men heard, two kicked, of course, 
 But all would get the people's word, 
 And this would let them know their force. 
 "A parsonage," said Bro. Brown, 
 He always thought the 'Very thing." 
 He didn't care, but he was "down" 
 O'n keeping the pastor in a "ring." 
 He thought the man was handicapped — 
 'Twas true, he cared not whom he "slapped." 
 IV. 
 And Bro. Azariah Jones 
 Considered it was, after all, 
 The only thing. He'd furnish stones, 
 And even give a team to haul, 
 If all the people would agree. 
 He was full certain that he could 
 Also obtain for them a tree 
 From "outen" Mr. Atkins' wood. 
 He, too, declared the pastor ought 
 Be where 'twas quiet for one's thought. 
 V. 
 And Bro. Johnson cleared his throat. 
 Then said "Yer know I tol' yer so. 
 Not one ob ye would gimme note 
 When I sed dis a yeah ago. 
 An' now hit's come ter pass, yer see, 
 And I se glad hit has, I say, 
 Right heah, afore yer, es fer me, 
 I'll wuk fum fus' till de las' day 
 Ter buir a fittin' house, so dah ! 
 I'll tak wid any man mah shah." 
 vi. 
 "An' now I reckon I mus' speak," 
 Said Bro. Smith, as he arose. 
 *'0b co'se, my voice is one an' weak, 
 But what we aih, now ye all knows. 
 While I don' jes' say not ter staht, 
 I reckon hit would betteh be, 
 Foh any ob us gits so puht, 
 Ter fin' out whetheh de folks '11 'gree : 
 'Tis cheap ter talk, and' we knows dat, 
 But doin' of de t'ings is w'at." 
 VII. 
 And Bro. Zechariah Sands 
 Agreed with Bro. Smith, he thought, 
 Before they got too deep their hands 
 Into the thing, of course, they ought 
 Consult the people's wishes. He, 
 If 'twas in order now, would move 
 That it be put to popular vote; 
 And if the people would approve, 
 Why, he had no objections to it, 
 And having spoken he sat down, 
 Exchanging looks with Bro. Brown. 
 VIII. 
 The move was put and carried. Then, 
 The pastor spoke; his words were clear. 
 Assured he had to deal with men. 
 Whose hearts and minds were just and fair, 
 He had no doubt their influence 
 Would all be used toward the plan. 
 He knew them men of solid sense. 
 And thus was sure that to a man, 
 Would urge the people of the need ; 
 By this no doubt it would succeed. 
 IX. 
 The people of Brown Chapel were, 
 Upon the whole, a goodly set ; 
 And pastored by a minister 
 Of sense, it was not hard to get 
 Them to do any reasonable thing, 
 According if they could afford. 
 They practiced what they tried to sing — 
 "Help us to help each other, Lord," 
 Tho' in prayer meetings they might do 
 Things funny to a stranger's view. 
 X. 
 One hundred strong, their membership, 
 This plus a goodly following. 
 With those who now and then would slip. 
 Fall back, come forward, shout and sing, 
 In big revivals cry aloud 
 For mercy, feel their sins forgiven, 
 Go on rejoicing with the crowd. 
 Declare themselves brand new from heaven, 
 Then when the heat of battle's o'er. 
 Go back into the world once more. 
 XI. 
 They were African Methodist, 
 Ah ! came of sainted Allen's clan. 
 Perhaps, they knew he did exist. 
 But very little of the man. 
 Except a few, the gifted ones. 
 Who boasted of a book or two, 
 Alluding to themselves as "sons 
 Of Allen," what they ought to do; 
 And in class meeting oft referred 
 To him, desiring to be heard. 
 XIL 
 Indeed, could one condemn the zeal? 
 For every one should love his line. 
 To hear one boast doth make us feel 
 Proud of the man, though coarse or fine 
 His manners be. A drunkard e'en 
 Will win respect when he declares 
 His loyalty to king or queen. 
 Or president, although he swears ; 
 And so with Allen's followers, 
 Tho' they may seem his worshippers. 
 xin. 
 They had six classes. Two there were 
 Which met on Sunday, one at nine, 
 The other three. Now it was clear 
 That these the young folks wished to join. 
 When asked, as custom was, the class 
 Desired, one would likely say, 
 Especiallv if 'twere a lass, 
 'The one that's led by Bro. Gray." 
 And Bro. Gray would smiling come, 
 "Yes, honey, I will lead you home." 
 XIV. 
 Gray's was the class that met at three, 
 And that which met at nine was led 
 By Melville. Quite a leader he, 
 A man of good parts, somewhat read. 
 True African Methodist, a heart 
 In which there could be found no guile ; 
 Determined e'er to do his part. 
 And for his church and wife to toil. 
 A few cleared acres, also some 
 On which was wood, he called his home. 
 XV. 
 He was not old, some thirty-five, 
 Tall, dark, with looks intelligent, 
 A disposition that could live 
 On anything and be content. 
 A man who loved not passionate 
 And yet who firmly loved; whose trust 
 Was perfect ; whom to aggravate, 
 Was hard; who deemed all men were just; 
 Would treat them so until the light 
 Revealed them different to his sight. 
 XVI. 
 This man, had Mary Brookins seen, 
 And learned his noble character; 
 Learnt, too, he loved her ; had it been 
 Aught else, he had not married her. 
 She could not love, but high respect, 
 She thought she well could substitute; 
 And being strong, she could subject 
 Herself, and yielded to his suit. 
 He, who could no conclusions draw, 
 Saw this, and thought 'twas love he saw. 
 xvn. 
 His class was twenty, old and young. 
 Both male and female who enjoyed 
 His exhortations. Well he sung. 
 And when by worldly matters cloyed. 
 They sought their class ; and when he spoke, 
 As oft with fiery eloquence, 
 It was not long the bands were broke. 
 And they were brought unto the sense 
 Of joy and peace, which none could know, 
 Except they to class meeting §^0. 
 XVIII. 
 Who contradicts? be his poor joy, 
 Let him, who will, emotion curse, 
 And stop his ears if we annoy; 
 He will do well, who does no worse. 
 My feeling may not well be his, 
 Yet the same Spirit makes us feel ; 
 Should he be silent in his bliss. 
 He must some other way reveal. • 
 What then is all this cant about. 
 If he shed tears and I should shout? 
 XIX. 
 The personnel of Melville's class, 
 To man and woman, all were strong, 
 And every character would *'pass," 
 Examined upon moral wrong-; 
 And yet mischievous, there were some, 
 Rosetta Hawkins them among, 
 Who whether at her church or home 
 Did seldom e'er control her tongue. 
 By such the neighborhood was e'er 
 Kept in a most amusing stir. 
 XX. 
 If there was anything to know, 
 Why Rosie Hawkins knew it first ; 
 Could she not say, "I told you so," 
 'Twas certain that her pride would burst. 
 And when the young folks wanted news. 
 They hung or sat on Rosie's bars. 
 Some thought she could express her views 
 On all of earth and half the stars. 
 'Twas certainly when Rosie said, 
 "The thing is," then the thing was made. 
 XXL 
 So Rosie said that Rev. Stone 
 Was quite a preacher, and unwed, 
 No body else heard this, not one 
 Would contradict what Rosie said. 
 More, she was certain that he had 
 No one in mind; and this was heard, 
 As gossip, for it would be bad 
 To doubt one moment Rosie' s word. 
 Then Rosie said he looked at her, 
 Despite he was their minister. 
 XXII. 
 Now, had not Rosie been away 
 To some repute academy, 
 They'd not believed the half she'd say; 
 But, now, being held in some degree. 
 These girls who had not had her chance, 
 Were sure to listen much to her. 
 And had he really given the glance, 
 Why, Rosie was in all his peer. 
 And, though they heard with jealous sighs, 
 They thought that she could win the prize. 
 XXIII. 
 Lord, take us from designing maids. 
 We who are wed, we who are not. 
 What can withstand their cruel raids 
 When they are fixed to take the spot ? 
 He must be fire-proof indeed ; 
 He must have eyes to pierce them through. 
 If he in battle doth succeed, 
 Despite the things resorted to ; 
 Yet one thing holds him in his place, 
 And that is God Almighty's grace. 
 XXIV. 
 Ah, they may tempt, but never draw 
 A man imwilHng in their net. 
 Ah, they may learn to meet with awe 
 The man on whom 'twas first they set 
 Their cunning wiles. And he may be 
 The means of lifting them above 
 The depths of sensuality, 
 The dangers of a carnal love ; 
 And, then, they will appreciate 
 In him alone the good and great. 
 XXV. 
 And he who stands this awful test, 
 Himself by it is nobler made. 
 That which is easiest is not best : 
 Gold's the result of pick and Spade; 
 The soldier stands the rough affray ; 
 The vessel rides the storm-tossed sea ; 
 And nothing comes except we pay 
 Its price: the price of purity 
 Is suffering and self sacrifice — 
 To bring forth fruit, the seed first dies ! 
 Canto IV. 
 THE STRUGGLE. 
 'Twas Thursday night, a crescent moon 
 Stood in the sky, and every star 
 Beamed forth, the frogs in Hvely tune 
 Kept up their serenade afar ; 
 The pine trees lumed up against the sky ; 
 A balmy breeze came from the south; 
 The maple leaves with pensive sigh, 
 Bowed to the moon in tender youth ; 
 An owl was heard to hoot somewhere 
 And winged bats skimmed thro' the air. 
 II. 
 The Rev. Stone along the way 
 Was going home from Melville's tea. 
 Yes, that had been a busy day 
 In making calls, and, tired, he 
 Walked slowly now. He had howe'er, 
 Refused to have Melville to drive ; 
 He knew the way, the night was clear. 
 And he could walk. Perhaps 'twould give 
 Him food for thought to walk that night 
 Beneath th^ mpon and stars, so bright. 
 III. 
 He thought he saw ahnost a smile 
 On Mrs. Melville's face, at this, 
 Who standing held his hat the while, 
 It was an old-time phrase of his — 
 This "food for thought" in early days, 
 When he was but a careless lad 
 And asked the world for neither praise, 
 Nor censure be he good or bad. 
 But well she was aware he sought 
 A lonely walk as food for thought. 
 IV. 
 As food for thought, especially 
 When he and she had angry been ; 
 And once it was he knew that she 
 Upon these very walks, had* seen 
 Him sauntering sadly, and had called 
 Him to her as he passed her gate. 
 And there he was again installed 
 In her sweet favor, lost of late. 
 He thought he saw her at this smile 
 There as she held his hat the while. 
 V. 
 Enough to stand there at the side 
 Of some one else, another's wife; 
 Not, too, with mocking looks deride 
 Him for his very lonely life. 
 He took the hat she held, he heard 
 The gracious voice of Melville say, 
 As quick he made his way toward 
 The gate, "Now come and spend the day, 
 We'll make it pleasant for you." Then 
 He found himself alone again, 
 VI. 
 He went there just about sunset. 
 Melville had not come from the field. 
 Then he and Mary Brookins met. 
 If aught there were 'twas not revealed 
 In Mary Brookin's face. She took 
 His hat and sweetly placed it on 
 The rack, there in the hall. Her look 
 Was such a welcome due to one 
 She slightly knew. She led him now 
 Into the parlor. With a bow, 
 VII. 
 She flitted out, and left him there. 
 "She does not recognize me," so 
 He thought; and in an easy chair 
 He glanced about the room. The show 
 Of culture met him everywhere. 
 The papered walls of polished green, 
 Threw over him a peaceful air. 
 On these, well hung about, were seen 
 Some pretty pictures, richly cased 
 In frames that marked artistic taste. 
 VIII. 
 The furniture was rich. The rugs. 
 The large square one, the Japanese 
 Screen near the mantel and the jugs 
 Of clay burned, painted, all of these 
 With many other bric-a-brac. 
 Spoke of a gentle taste refined ; 
 Showed, too, that some one did not lack 
 Love for the beautiful. A mind 
 Filled with new ideas that might be 
 Sought even by Society. 
 IX. 
 A table in the centre -^ood, 
 Which held a bronze lamp; underneath, 
 A photo album. The hot blood 
 Rushed to Stone's face. Quick came his breath 
 The moment that he saw it there. 
 She had his "photo," had she put 
 It also with her others where 
 She oft could see it ? Ah, 'twas but 
 To take it up and look it through : 
 And this he soon decided to. 
 X. 
 Ah, there was Jackson, handsome youth, 
 On the first page. He knew him well ; 
 And quite a lad he was, forsooth, 
 He used to sing Poe's "Anabelle." 
 Then, there was Dodson, faultless clad. 
 He almost spoke to him, Stone thought. 
 His eyes were large, deep set, and sad. 
 Stone passed him; 'twas his own he sought. 
 Still turning nervously, and lo ! 
 He saw himself of years ago. 
 XL 
 Yes, that was what he looked like then, 
 But that was now ten years or more. 
 He sat, looked long, and often, when 
 Unseen, unheard, 'twas through the door 
 She came and took a rocker near. 
 "It's been a lovely day," she said. 
 He turned, surprised, to see her there, 
 In a soft muslin arrayed, 
 Her hair but loosely rolled. 'Twas tru^ 
 That she was beautiful to view, 
 XII. 
 He felt it. "Did not know you were 
 So near me, madam," and aside 
 He laid the album. "Did not hear?" 
 "It seems so," smiling, he replied. 
 And she smiled too. "How have you spent 
 The day ? You have not walked too much ?" 
 "Not over much, although I went 
 To many. One to be in touch 
 With all his flock, it means to be 
 A member of each family." ; 
 XIII. 
 "And risk his life in doing it? 
 I'm sure it would not do for me. 
 My ! I prefer such days to sit 
 And idly dream," soft murmured she. 
 "But pardon me, your words I doubt. 
 You're 'made of sterner stuff,' " he said. 
 "^Were it your life you would be out 
 Like to myself to-day, and made ' 
 As many calls ; you know it not, 
 Unless it came to be your lot." 
 XIV. 
 "Which lot I would not have," she said. 
 So promptly that he started quite. 
 A pretty picture now she made, 
 Within that gown, so soft and light 
 That e'en the corset waist beneath, 
 And petticoat were plainly seen. 
 A moment 'twas he caught his breath, 
 And wild thoughts crowded in between. 
 "Perhaps you love your present life?" 
 "Indeed, an honest farmer's wife." 
 XV. 
 ''Then blessed you are, if such be true; 
 For the content are always blest." 
 ''Contented did I say to you ?" . 
 She quickly asked. 'T make the best 
 Of life, that's all. I shape my course,, 
 I watch my chances, make my move 
 For better; if I get the worse, 
 I make the best of it, and prove 
 That life is only what we make it; 
 None but ourselves can really break it." 
 XVI. 
 "True/' he assented, as he thought 
 That Mary Brookins was the same 
 Cold philosophic girl he sought 
 In former days burned by the -flame 
 Of boyish love. He thought he saw 
 A burnt out heart, a semblance but 
 Of that which years ago could draw 
 His heart from him. Words like these DUt 
 A bar between them. Fool, he knew 
 Not what such words were leading to. 
 XVII. 
 He would have spoken more, but now, 
 Her husband in the kitchen door. 
 Called to her. With a gracious bow, 
 She rose and left him to muse o'er 
 Her words, to ask himself just what 
 She meant, *T make the best of life." 
 Ah, whether, after all, 'twas that. 
 Although she was another's wife, 
 A vision of the past came up 
 To bitter make her sweetest cup? 
THE STRUGGLE. 39 
 XVIIL i 
 . 'Twas in this frame that Melville found 
 Him when into the room he came. 
 He didn't hear, despite the sound, 
 Until the latter spoke his name. 
 And as awakened from a sleep, 
 He rose to meet his gracious host. , 
 "Now pardon, if I've had to keep 
 You waiting long. You see we've lost 
 So much time since the spring begun 
 We generally work long after sun." 
 i 
 XIX. 
 Thus Melville, in explaining, said. 
 "Indeed there's no excuse to make, 
 The hours made are so much bread ; i 
 And in these days \\t must not take : 
 The time that we should be afield ; 
 To spend in entertaining guest. j 
 Your place in general has revealed : 
 The fact you take but little rest ; 
 Go on, 'tis well," said Stone, "to toil 
 To bring the best out of your soil.'* * 
 XX. 
 "I thank you. I was so inspired 
 Last Sunday by your words. To go 
 On and upward. I have desired 
 The Truth of God to plainly know. 
 So many, Reverend, there are, ] 
 That do not make the Scriptures plain : \ 
 To me they leap from star to star. 
 When here on earth they might remain. 
 And teach us who desire to know i 
 Just what our duty is below." 
 XXI. 
 " 'Tis true we make mistakes," said Stone, 
 "We don't always the Word divide 
 That it without mistakes be known, 
 Tho' I'm not sure but w^hat we've tried ; 
 Some of us weak enough might be 
 To show our learning, others zeal. 
 Some men will not sit down till they 
 In some way make their hearers feel, 
 And while I must not all condemn, 
 I do not follow most of them. 
 XXII. 
 'The simple story should be told, 
 Told so a child might understand ; 
 Told not in formal heads and cold, 
 But simplest figures at command. 
 The doctrine, duty plainly given, 
 Till every soul might know his worth ; 
 Not all the bliss we'll find in heaven. 
 But how to bring this bliss to earth ; 
 Just how to live in love below 
 Till we in love might heaven know." 
 XXIIL 
 And thus they sat and talked till tea. 
 Announced by Madame Melville, they 
 Entered the dining room. To see, 
 As in the parlor, rich display 
 Of furniture antique and grand, 
 Stone was on entering not long. 
 Nor blind to signs of dainty hand 
 Whose simple touch corrected wrong. 
 But above all, the table spread 
 A very pretty picture made; 
THE STRUGGLE. 
 XXIV. 
 A very pretty picture made, 
 With her the hostess standing there, 
 In that light muslin arrayed. 
 Displaying form of beauty rare. 
 Stone gulped a jealous sigh and bit 
 His lips just as his gracious host 
 Bade him to ask the blessing. It 
 Was very low, in fact, almost 
 Inaudible. And as they took 
 Their seats his hand for seconds shook. 
 XXV. 
 They chatted for an hour around 
 A sumptuous feast. And then they rose 
 And soon were in the parlor found. 
 May at the organ sat. She chose 
 A sacred anthem, first of all, 
 Where she her talent well displayed. 
 And then, as if she would recall 
 The past, aside the anthem laid — 
 "This is a favorite of mine," 
 She said, and rendered "Auld Lang Syne." 
 XXVI. 
 Oh, songs there are which constant preach ! 
 And songs there are which can recall 
 The past, tho' dark or bright, can reach 
 Back to the grave and bring- up all. 
 If this be true, the case with Stone 
 But emphasized the fact. He felt 
 A moment, it is true, but one. 
 Again 'twas in the past he dwelt. 
 A tell-tale tear stole in the eye 
 As closed the music with a sigh. 
 XXVII. 
 So passed the evening away 
 Till Stone concluded he would go. 
 He now decided not to say 
 A word about the past, no, no, 
 If she did not design to speak, 
 He would not. Let it buried be. 
 He blamed himself for being weak, 
 And wished that he were strong as she. 
 Since she was happy, he w^as glad ; 
 What was the passion of a lad? 
 XXVHI. 
 All this, as walking home that night, 
 Came to his mind. The stars above, 
 That filled the w^ood with silvery light, 
 Witnessed the burial of his love. 
 Ay, he was messenger of God ! 
 The Master went the lonely road, 
 And should he shun the path He trod, 
 Or shrink to shoulder up his load ? 
 No, he would not : the stars beheld 
 Him crush the heart that had rebelled. 
 XXIX. 
 He walked on slow now through the wood. 
 Disturbing here and there a snake. 
 As he his lonely way pursued ; 
 Or trod on twigs that sharp would break. 
 And now and then a rustling sound 
 Of something skurrying through the leaves ; 
 Or treading on the springy ground, 
 The earth beneath his footstep gives, 
 A^muddy pool along the way, 
 Scarce lighted by the moon's pale ray. 
 XXX. 
 Now through a large strawberry patch 
 His pathway leads, and on the air 
 The odor of the fruit to catch, 
 He lingers for a moment there. 
 The crescent moon looks from above; 
 A !^right star, which begins to set 
 Behind yon dark and sombre grove, 
 Is sending forth its streamers yet ; 
 And here and there across the sky 
 White flaky clouds are floating by. 
 XXXI. 
 At such a time, in such a place, 
 One's mind doth oft transcend this sod ; 
 And one doth find him face to face, 
 In blest communion with his God, 
 Like him of old who stood alone, 
 Then wrestled till the break of day 
 With God Himself. Thus 'twas with Stone 
 Here standing was constrained to pray. 
 There on his knees he wrestled long. 
 Arose and felt that he was strong. 
 Canto V. 
 THE HAWKINS FAMILY. 
 I. 
 To call a meeting now, of course, 
 That was the only thing to do. 
 Stone saw the logic, felt its force, 
 And thought this path well to pursue. 
 His stewards to a man agreed. 
 Class leaders thought it quite-a plan, 
 'Twas every thing there to succeed, 
 'Twas e'en begun, the gossip ran. 
 Rosetta Hawkins first of all 
 To Willing Workers issued call. 
 11. 
 'Twas the next Sabbath at the close 
 Of meeting, with good confidence. 
 The pastor in the "stand" arose 
 And called for a church conference. 
 There was a smile on every face, 
 Just as if all the secret knew^ 
 And one could in each countenance trace 
 Just what those followers would do. 
 Gossip in fact was all the rage 
 About the chapel's parsonage. 
 HI. 
 So he appointed Friday night, 
 And brought the service to a close. 
 With face all beaming with delight, 
 Now at the altar met him, Rose. 
 "Now, Reverend," she smiling said, 
 I have been delegated to 
 Invite you to our house ; and spread, 
 The table now awaits for you. 
 There, don't refuse, of course you can't, 
 Because, in fact, because you shan't." 
 IV. 
 ''He shall!" said Sister Jenkins, who 
 That moment came to press his hand. 
 "He b'longs as much to me as you, 
 Now, Miss, I'll have you understand. 
 Now, pastor," speaking soft to Stone, 
 "And won't you come to dine with me?" 
 The pastor stood and looked from one 
 Unto the other. "Well," said he, 
 "Since this young lady came ahead, 
 I am her guest, I am afraid." 
 V. 
 "Thanks," said sly Rosie with a glance 
 At Mrs. Jenkins all undone. 
 Stone did not understand, perchance, 
 What had been seen by everv one 
 O'f that small crowd of lassies, who 
 Sang with Rosetta in the choir.. 
 "And, Maggie, I dO' feel for you ; • ? 
 It is no use, you can't get by her," 
 Said one to Maggie Jenkins when 
 They from the church walked down the lan^ 
 VI. 
 Rosetta who had gone ahead, 
 In company with the minister, 
 Had never a thought of what was said 
 This moment by these folks of her. 
 "She thinks that she is very fine !" 
 Snapped Maggie as she let her gaze 
 Follow the handsome young divine 
 With Rosie at his side. ''Her ways 
 No sooner known to him than he 
 Will let her drop, now you will see !" 
 VII. 
 "Wrong, Maggie, wrong; there's nothing bad 
 In Rosie," said another maid. 
 "You must acknowledge you are mad 
 Simply because she got ahead. 
 And more than this, I think you ought 
 Remember just one year ago — 
 Before you give another thought — 
 You in the church-yard buried Joe." 
 "And what of that?" one tossed her head. 
 "Folks can't be living by the dead — " 
 VIII. 
 "When there's the living," said a sly 
 Young woman with a pretty face, 
 "And he a preacher ; goodness, why 
 I'll take my chances in the race !" 
 "You, girls, be careful !" said a dame 
 Of forty, coming up behind. 
 "I think you all should have some shame 
 To have such trash upon the mind 
 After the sermon you heard preached, 
 Surely some of your hearts was reachedf" 
 IX. 
 Most of the houses there about, 
 Were very rudely built affairs ; 
 And as a general thing without 
 A room of any size upstairs. 
 A story and a-half could boast. 
 Not more than three rooms at the best ; 
 Two down, one up, the last almost 
 A simple hole in which to rest 
 One's body when the day was done — - 
 A hole in which to sleep alone. 
 X. 
 Nor thrown aside the fire place, 
 The old Dutch oven hanging high 
 Where ''sweetenin' " pone was baked to grace 
 The table, never hard and dry; 
 And ''Jo^''^'^y~ki^^s" still on the hearth 
 Browned as they browned long years ago ; 
 Hot coals and ashes still drawn forth 
 To heat the oven of biscuit dough ; 
 In large pots hanging from their hooks 
 The chicken pot-pie slowly cooks. 
 XL 
 Some of the houses, early made, 
 One story, high pitched, gabled ends, 
 The great house, then the colonade, 
 From which the kitchen then extends. 
 And all of this facing the road. 
 These oft moss covered, silent stand. 
 Reminders of the early mode 
 When rough-heeled Thraldom ruled the land, 
 But here and there a cottage, white, 
 Yellow or green, would greet the sight, 
 XII. 
 These often had six rooms or more, 
 El-shapecl with porches front and side, 
 Great shading trees, too, stood before, 
 Them from the pubHc road would hide.. 
 A graded terrace, level sward. 
 With here and there a flowered mound, 
 C Folks will have flowers in their yard,) 
 Where stood these cottages, were found. 
 Tho' white folks owned most of these kind, 
 A Negro's now and then you'd find. 
 XIII. 
 And one of these was Hawkins' home. 
 He was the preacher's steward, strong, 
 With the best people, though by some 
 He was disliked. His only wrong 
 Was that a very thrifty man. 
 He saved his money, owned his place, 
 And mixed not with the idle clan. 
 And had some color in his face ; 
 But deep at heart, search all around 
 A better man could not be found. 
 XIV. 
 He'd raised a good, large family. 
 His baby, nine years, little Nell. 
 A man who had reached fifty-three, 
 And for these years was looking well ; 
 For, to look at him, one would say — 
 His clean cut face, his hair so black — 
 He was but forty, if a day; 
 And when one saw him jump and crack 
 His heels together, would declare 
 Him thirty, not another year. 
 XV. 
 Now Mrs. Hawkins was sedate, 
 One of the gentle kind whose way 
 Kept in an even tenor ; late 
 Or early, she went thro' the day 
 Without a worry. Having seen 
 Some fifty summers in her life, 
 And given birth to just thirteen, 
 She might be called a model wife. 
 Of lightish brown, height moderate, 
 One hundred and sixty pounds her weight. 
 XVI. 
 Of thirteen children there were ten. 
 Three girls, one married, doing well. 
 The boys but one all full grown men 
 And this one stood twix Rose and Nell, 
 Some twelve years old. The family 
 •Made up of Hawkins and his wife : 
 And this most interesting three 
 Had in that home a happy life. 
 XVII. 
 The six young men, two were away; 
 Four married, settled, with a start; 
 To own theirs. Took one another's part, 
 To own theirs. Took cne another's part 
 Nor one the other e'er let fall ; 
 But all united, watched their chance, 
 Now ''all for each and each for all." 
 And they were blessed by Providence 
 Till it was a proverbial song — 
 "The Hawkins' are very strong." 
 XVIII. 
 This is the family that Stone 
 Takes dinner with this Sabbath day. 
 He saw all things in neatness shone 
 About the house, yet the display 
 Was simple. And his steward, he 
 Found out the man that we have seen, 
 Which soon, he saw that few could see. 
 For Bro. Nooks that day had been. 
 Now, speaking not the very best 
 Concerning Hawkins and the rest. 
 XIX. 
 But Stone knew well that 'twas unwise 
 To listen to such talk. He knew 
 'Twas natural to criticise. 
 And often he had found it -true. 
 Those criticised the most severe — 
 W^hen everything had been found out— 
 Those very dispised persons were 
 The ones he had least cause to doubt. 
 While they who made the criticism 
 Were head and heels of every schism. 
 XX. 
 Now, as he at the table sat 
 With this one happy family, 
 He well enjoyed the pleasant chat, 
 And felt himself with them most free. 
 Something about it all appealed 
 To his deep sense of home, although 
 He never had a home. To yield 
 To Mrs. Hawkins' request to 
 Rest him in the hammock there, 
 And catch the cool refreshing air 
 XXI. 
 It was not hard. And so when he 
 Arose from that enjoyable meal, 
 'Twas as one of the family, 
 Which this good woman made him feel, 
 He forthwith in the hammock swung. 
 While madam and her husband sat, 
 (And Rosie in the kitchen sung,) 
 And talked of first this thing and that : 
 Betwixt the pleasant talk and song. 
 The afternoon did not seem long. 
 XXII. 
 They struck upon the parsonage. 
 Yes, what would really be the cost, 
 With lumber cheap just at this stage, 
 'Twere not eight hundred at the most, 
 One thousand dollars not too' much ; 
 Tw^o hundred from his family. 
 He knew would come : the boys w^ere such, 
 Tho' not all members, they would see 
 That nothing should be done without 
 Themselves and means somewhere about. 
 XXIII. 
 He felt the cottage would improve 
 The chapel, and it would inspire. 
 The preachers sent them more to love 
 The place, which certainly would tire 
 The best of men, accustomed to 
 A place of study, all alone. 
 Himself not learned, yet he knew 
 What should indeed agree with one ; 
 He'd do his level best to make 
 The plan a success for it^ sake 
 XXIV. 
 Meanwhile as they sat talking, Rose 
 With Nellie had the table cleared. 
 It was not that she always chose 
 To do this ; for she seldom cared, 
 But since he was their company 
 She thought 'twas well to act her best. 
 She did not wish that there should be 
 Qne little flaw seen by their guest. 
 Her mamma was surprised to hear, 
 "We'll wash the dishes, mamma, dear." 
 XXV. 
 This wild, wild Rose of seventeen 
 Took her beyond her wits that day ; 
 She could not tell when she had seen 
 Her such a cheerfulness display. 
 She stopped to gaze at her before 
 She left the dining room to join 
 Her guest, and thought, ''What has come o'er 
 This little daughter, now, of mine?" 
 But seeing nought in Rose's face, 
 Out on the porch she took her place. 
 XXVI. 
 So passed the time away until 
 Stone saw it was the hour to start 
 For Sabbath School. 'T think they will," 
 Now Hawkins said, ''all do their part." 
 In reference to the young folks' guild, 
 Of which they also spoke that day. 
 "Yes," said Rosetta, "we shall build 
 The house ourselves should they give way— 
 That is the churcli — but I am sure 
 Tliey'll all consent, if nothing more, 
 XXVII. 
 Now Mrs. Hawkins, little Nell, 
 Rosetta and the Rev. Stone 
 Went off to church. It was not well 
 To leave the cottage all alone, 
 So Mr. Hawkins thought it best 
 To stay about the place. Of late 
 Some prowling tramps, no doubt in quest 
 Of f oodj were seen about the gate ; 
 So it was best to stay on guard, 
 Despite the watch dog in the yard. 
 XXVIII. 
 The Elder walked along with Rose, 
 And Mrs. Hawkins took the lead, 
 And whether it was what she choose 
 To do or not, she did succeed 
 With little Nell to walk quite fast. 
 Or Stone and Rose to walk quite slow, 
 Ere half the distance had been passed 
 Was out of hearing distance. Low 
 In softest tones and all interest. 
 Spoke Rose to Stone with throbbing breast. 
 XXIX. 
 Was he not very lonely? was 
 Not it very hard to go 
 From place to place and just to pass 
 With different folks a year or two. 
 Then when, just when he knew them well 
 To leave them for some other charge ? 
 And was it possible to dwell 
 A longer time if it was large ? 
 Thus talking, never ceased before 
 They stood right at the chapel door. 
 XXX. 
 He did not see the cunning looks 
 On every maiden's face that day, 
 Half hid behind the singing books. 
 Nor did he hear Rosetta say, 
 ''I told you so," to Amy Wright, 
 Who whispered, ''Bully, girl, for you !" 
 No, no, 'twas hidden from his sight. 
 And little of those girls he knew. 
 Thus watched, tho' all unwatchful, he 
 Tho' full well seen, could nothing see. 
 XXXI. 
 Rosetta Hawkins was not tall, 
 Despite her stature's supple grace ; 
 Of medium height and not so small, 
 Blessed with a most bewitching face. 
 Yes, she was beautiful -And fair. 
 ' Dark eyes and chubby nose, and mouth 
 That roguish was, and glossy h.iir 
 That sometimes stra3^ed o'er brow, forsooth, 
 And chin and cheeks where dimples lay, 
 Saying the things lips dared not say. 
 xxxn. 
 Yes, eyes that often opened wide. 
 And then would also hide behind 
 Fringed lashes, there their beauty hide. 
 But leave her beauty more defined. 
 Her color, there is not a term 
 Where with that it might here be told. 
 We call it yellow, but that warm 
 Rich color shading into gold. 
 Then heightened by the flush of youth, 
 A skin all velvety and smooth. 
 XXXIII. 
 Just all she was, may not be known, 
 When we behold her in her way. 
 Which was decidedly her own : 
 One could not learn her in a day. 
 The roguish light within those eyes, 
 Might vanish for a pensive gaze, 
 From laughing lips came also sighs. 
 The half-formed smile for frowning stays. 
 The saucy look that glowered the face 
 Could oft to seriousness give place. 
 XXXIV. 
 Some said that she was wild, but here 
 The term they used was never meant. 
 If fleet of foot as any deer. 
 And always on some mischief bent, 
 A purer soul there never was. 
 As innocent as any child. 
 And though folks pointed at the lass 
 And said full often ''My ! how wild !" 
 An angel from the realm above 
 Could, all things reckoned, purer prove. 
 XXXV. 
 True, she was loved by many a lad, 
 Could Rosie help the love they bore? 
 What could she do if 'twas she had 
 Admirers numbering to the score ? 
 Could she be slandered if she sought 
 To please all with some word? and yet 
 If they went wild why was it thought 
 That she was but a wild coquette? 
 No, if broken hearts there were 
 No blame should e'er be put to her. 
 XXXVI. 
 How many for her license bought, 
 How many hcenses returned, 
 And still new comers came and sought, . 
 And Rosie laughed and they still yearned. 
 If moonlight w'alks might prompt her to 
 Say ''yes," when she had closed the gate. 
 Her laughing eyes, tlje truth to know 
 They had but the next day to wait. 
 ''Last night?" she doubting asked, "that so?" 
 To-day, well I am sorry; no." 
 xxxvn. 
 "Rose," said her mother oft, "desist, 
 Such does not well become you, child." 
 "O mamma," she would cry, "you missed 
 So much because you were iK)t wild. 
 Now there is Tom, and there is Jack, 
 Each bought for me a pretty ring; 
 Of course I'm going to give them back. 
 Pa says I must not have a thing, 
 Except he buys it for me, yet 
 Just see how much that I can get." 
 XXXVIII. 
 The mother slow would shake her head, 
 "You are too young to act that way. 
 And folks will talk I am afraid !" 
 "O fiddle-sticks on what they say? 
 My heart is just as pure as theirs; 
 And God knows that." The mother smiled. 
 "They always say we put on airs ; 
 What care I if they call me wild, 
 My Heavenly Father knows I'm pure. 
 In thought and will ; I ask no more. 
 XXXIX. 
 This was the girl with whom Stone walked 
 This Sunday afternoon. And he 
 Unconscious how the people talked 
 Found pleasure in her company. 
 He loved the frankness in her speech. 
 The open eyes that met his gaze. 
 Between those looks there seemed to reach 
 A slender hand of other days. 
 Some how, he told himself, some how, 
 His work grew dearer to him now. 
 Canto VI. 
 THE CHURCH CONFERENCE. 
 I. 
 It was a conference where all 
 Came out to see the thing well done. 
 Once started, scarce an interval 
 Of silence, since it seemed each one 
 Had much to say. And as they spoke 
 There was peculiar common sense 
 Displayed, which now and then awoke 
 Applause, that stirred up eloquence, 
 Till he who had the least to say. 
 Tried hard to make the most display. 
 XL 
 There was but one dissenting voice. 
 And that was Bro. Smith, of course. 
 He reckoned the' with little choice, 
 Against him there was too much force. 
 Then Bro. Sands arose and said, 
 He had a notion to oppose. 
 But having there been fully made 
 Cognizant of its good, now rose 
 To say it now had won his vote 
 If there were not another to 't. 
 III. 
 A move was made by Melville ; he 
 Some said had never made before 
 So fine a speech. Ability, 
 He said no man could dare ignore ; 
 And where a church w^as blessed with such 
 Within her pulpit, she should try 
 (No matter what or say how much 
 'Twould cost,) her best to satisfy. 
 He moved if it were proper stage 
 Of time, to build the parsonage. 
 IV. 
 And there were several seconds. When 
 The pastor rose the move to put 
 The women's voices 'bove the men 
 Replied their readiness to vote. 
 And when the vote was called ,en masse 
 They rose and Bro. Smith also. 
 No use, he said, 'twas bound to pass, 
 'Twas better he should with them go. 
 He never cared to stand alone 
 When anything like this was done. 
 V. 
 And when the meeting was dismissed 
 Stone was surrounded by a host 
 Of members. And his organist 
 Pressed firm his hand. Rosetta lost 
 No time in saying that the guild 
 Already met, had plans on hand 
 The moment they began to build 
 To see to grading of the land. 
 And Bro. Smith came, laughing, said 
 He, too, was willing to be led. 
 VL 
 Thus Stone, well pleased, smiled here and there 
 On all who came to take his hand. 
 He thanked them for their vote. 'Twas clear 
 They one and all would henceforth stand 
 By that night's work. He asked no more 
 Than when he set his rally, come 
 In answer valiantly, was sure 
 They'd build for him as nice a home 
 As some of them themselves possessed, 
 At any rate he'd make the test. 
 vn. 
 'Twas Mary Melville's hand that pressed 
 His own while at the altar there. 
 Her eyes sought his, he looked and guessed 
 The words that neither seemed fo dare 
 Give voice to. At that moment, Rose 
 Came forward reaching for his hand. 
 "Ah, Reverend, now I suppose 
 The guild may clear and grade the land," 
 And losing sight of Mame, he said, 
 "Of course, and will you help them grade?'' 
 vni. 
 "I help them grade? now really, sir, 
 You laugh at me within your sleeve. 
 Jokes ill become a minister. 
 Especially the way you give." 
 And she withdrew her dainty hand, 
 "As if these hands could use a spade. 
 No, no, we girls do but command, 
 And boys there are, dear sir, to grade." 
 "Those hands are meant for better things, 
 He laughed, "perhaps for wearing rings." 
 IX. 
 "How cute of you, how very cute." 
 She laughed and turned as if to go, 
 Then stopped, looked back. ''Now would it suit 
 For you to go the way I do, 
 Pa's gone and left me, and I want 
 To talk with you along the way." 
 Of course he could do nought but grant 
 The girl's request, what could he say 
 But certainly, and glad to see 
 Her home if he might service be, 
 X. 
 Mary Melville had already gone. 
 And all were hurrying away, 
 And they were now almost alone; 
 A-down the lane the young and gay 
 Were laughing, and the night air rang. 
 As shone the full moon overhead. 
 With songs the frogs and crickets sang. 
 ''And are you on such nights afraid?" 
 He asked her as her arm he took, 
 In question to her timid look. 
 XL 
 "No, I can't say I am afraid. 
 There's nothing to be 'fraid of here; 
 But Papa having gone ahead, 
 I thought of course you would not care 
 In walking on such nights with me. 
 I really love such nights, don't you?" 
 She looked up to- his face to see 
 Just how he took her words. "I knew 
 You would not see me go alone." 
 "Why certainly I'd not," said Stone. 
 XII. 
 ''And I do love such nights as these, 
 And, more, to be with such as you. 
 So let me say, you could not please 
 Me better than the w^ay you do 
 In being, O so frank with me." 
 The words were more than he thought well, 
 And he regretted that so free 
 He'd spoken. Sudden silence fell, 
 And he walked on and she walked on 
 With not a word from either one. 
 XIII. 
 And when the cottage came in sight. 
 She quietly slipped her arm from his. 
 "Perhaps," she said, "it was not right 
 For me wath you to act like this ; 
 For everything ^yas thoughtless done, 
 Yiou from the first seemed fatherly. 
 And so I took you. Rev. Stone, 
 And if you've been mistaken in me. 
 Well, I am sorry. Now good-night." 
 And she had disappeared from sight. 
 XIV. 
 Stone stood confounded there alone. 
 A weight was pressing at his heart. 
 He could not say what had been done, 
 'Twas nothing meant upon his part. 
 But this was not the maiden's mind. 
 He blamed himself for everything. 
 For being so conceited, blind ; 
 And should she speak how it would ring! 
 That all the neighborhood would know — - 
 My ! that would never, never do ! 
 XV. 
 He turned, but not for home, but went 
 Listlessly on into the night, 
 Listlessly on with no intent, 
 Except to wander in the light 
 Oif that bright moon and stars. He caught 
 The voices, now and then, of those 
 Who to the meeting came, but sought 
 To keep from them. Those words from Rose 
 Had made a deep impression on 
 His mind, and he would walk alone. 
 XVL 
 Still croaked the frogs in yonder swamp; 
 Still from the wood the owls' hoots came; 
 Still here and there the firefly's lamp 
 Burst from a leaf in greenish flame; 
 A kildee ran along the road, 
 Before him shrieking as he ran ; 
 A whip-poor-will his plaintive ode, 
 Sang for the pleasure of the man ; 
 A glow worm wabbled in the grass. 
 And shone just as he chanced to pass. 
 xvn. 
 Fool that he was, when May Melville 
 Came forward taking hold his hand, 
 And in it said she knew him still 
 With look he could but understand. 
 Why had he not detained her there 
 Until this ''fresh young Miss" had gone? 
 Perhaps, ah well, two weights to bear 
 He thought 'twas now instead of one. 
 Between two fires he must be 
 With little show for victory. 
 XVIII. 
 How long he walked, or to what place, 
 Left to himself he had not known; 
 And he had never seen the face 
 That from a window looked, where shone 
 A bright light. ''Have you lost your way?" 
 A sweet, soft, silver voice awoke 
 Him from his dreams. And it was May, 
 Who from her porch now standing, spoke. 
 And Melville who had gained her side, 
 Called to him with them to abide. 
 XXI. 
 He knew not what to say, complete 
 Surprised, bewildered and ashamed. 
 Melville came forward quick to meet 
 Him. ''Stay all night," for soon, he claimed, 
 There'd be an ugly gust. The sky 
 E'en then was clouding up. It was, 
 And Bro. Nook's home was nigh 
 Three miles away ; he'd better pass 
 The night with them ; 'twas dangerous to 
 Attempt that distance then to go. 
 XX. 
 And must he yield? and would he stay 
 In face of all the circumstance? 
 "No !" said an inner voice, "away 
 And trust thyself to Providence." 
 "Stay," said another voice, "the night 
 Will soon be dark, a clouded sky 
 Is making, danger lies in flight; 
 Besides, there is no cause to fly. 
 Stay, see? in yonder door she stands 
 And beckons thee with open hands." 
 XXI. 
 He stood half hesitating there, 
 And Melville, unsuspecting, stood. 
 Her voice again he heard, and clear, 
 ''Come, 'tis not well out in the wood 
 During a storm; don't hesitate. 
 The folks will not uneasy be. 
 And they already, since 'tis late, 
 Will think you were our company." 
 And as she spoke she came to join. 
 In stage-like voice, ''Come, friend of mine," 
 XXII. 
 She laughed, "See thine abiding place, 
 Thy bed already waits to-night?" 
 He raised his eyes, looked in her face. 
 And thought her beautiful; the sight 
 Condemned him. Melville, silent now. 
 Awaited that he might decide. 
 Where was now his sacred vow 
 A week ago? Tempted and tried. 
 No, no ; he would not stay, but go ; 
 That was his duty. Then, say no. 
 XXIII. 
 "I cannot stop with you to-night. 
 But sometime in the future I 
 Shall certainly take much delight. 
 But now I hope you'll pardon me." 
 There was an hour or two, he thought, . 
 Before the storm would likely come. 
 No danger thus in being caught ; 
 For in that time he would be home. ' 
 To stay he could not then consent; 
 So off into the night he went. 
 Canto VII. 
 THE THUNDm STORM. 
 I. 
 Around the chapel, here and there 
 Went busy workmen to and fro, 
 Their merry voices filled the air 
 As rang each hammer's constant blow. 
 The frame work was already up, 
 The weather-boarding nailed thereon, 
 And travellers on the road would stop 
 To see the sight ; and one by one 
 Would pass their comments, and reflect 
 'Twas something pretty to erect. 
 11. 
 And Stone, in overalls arra}'ed, 
 As busy as the workmen there, 
 Worked as a master at the trade. 
 And used the tools with skill most rare; 
 And when the summer day was done. 
 His was a strong man's appetite. 
 And when the hour for sleep came on, 
 His was a tired sleeper's night. 
 All undisturbed, he slept until 
 The dawn peeped o'er the distant hill, 
THE THUNDER STORM. Gj 
 III. 
 He drew the plans, he ran the line, 
 He pointed out the proper site. 
 He cut the shrubbery and vine. 
 And saw that everything was right. 
 And here while working he would dwell 
 Upon the Sabbath sermons, too ; 
 Some word dropped by the men would well 
 Bring to his mind a better view; 
 And, thus, as he would work away, 
 He'd whistle, meditate, and pray. 
 IV. 
 The month of May had gone and June 
 Had come. The busy Sabbath School 
 Was practicing; for very soon, 
 According to the church's rule, 
 It's Children's Day would come; and they, 
 True Methodist, would never fail 
 To celebrate their Children's Day. 
 So 'twas about the altar rail, 
 Each afternoon the children came 
 To practice with the organist, Mame. 
 V. 
 He saw her from a distance as 
 He was engaged about the ground. 
 He always bowed when she would pass, 
 But never an idle moment found 
 To speak with her. Rosetta came 
 Around the building often, too ; 
 But, somehow, there would always clairp 
 His mind somebody else; and few . 
 The words he said to her except 
 Explaining why he busy kept, 
 VI. 
 Now when they parted on that night 
 She straight unto her room had gone, 
 Indignant half, half in delight, 
 Half hating, half in love with Stone. 
 She told herself she acted rude, 
 His words indeed were not amiss; 
 That she herself misunderstoood, 
 That it was no mistake of his ; 
 That very night felt she should go, 
 Despite her pride, and tell him so. 
 VII. 
 One day she came mind fully made 
 To make him talk whether or no, 
 Determined that she would pursuade 
 Him to quit work and with her go 
 Back to her house to tea, to stay 
 (For ma was willing, too,) all night. 
 She came. Of course 'twas hard to say. 
 But she would say it. 'Twas not right, 
 But would he not escort her home 
 That afternoon? Ma said to come. 
 VIII. 
 He put the hatchet down, he had, 
 And looked at her most soberly. 
 To go with her he would be glad, 
 But truly then, he didn't see 
 How he could spare the time; he would 
 That very night be most compelled 
 To do some writing. Yes^ he should 
 Be very glad to go, but held 
 In this position must say no, 
 Tho' he would really like to gp, 
 IX. 
 •'You work," she said, ''indeed, too hard. 
 'Tvvere better if you took some rest. 
 And after all, 'tis small reward , 
 You'll get for all your pains, at best. 
 Come, leave the hatchet lying there; 
 Throw off those ugly overalls; 
 And brush the saw dust from your hair; 
 Leave to the carpenters the walls; 
 We wish our preacher to appear 
 Always dressed up, if you must hear." 
 X. 
 She'd said it all at once. It came 
 A rapid flow of words, and struck 
 Deep in the heart. Somehow^ a shame 
 He felt. Tho' much he praised her pluck, 
 For this outburst, he stood awhile 
 And gravely looked at her nor spoke. 
 She wistful gazed at him. A smile 
 That broadened o'er his features broke, 
 "I like your speech," he said, "enough 
 Although I think it little rough." 
 XI. 
 "O do you then?" She came and caught 
 Him by the lapel of his coat, 
 And looked up to him. "O I thought 
 You would get mad, but you don't show 't. 
 Now, won't you come, please. Rev. Stone, 
 We'd dearly love to have you there. 
 And, see, I'd have to go alone 
 Thro' that dark wood, you know I fear !" 
 She laughed. "Be good and not say, no." 
 (He smiled.) "Of course that means you'll go." 
 XII. 
 ''You witch!" he laughing said, "of course. 
 Perhaps what you have said is true ; 
 I never thought it with this force 
 Until it is brought home by you. 
 Excuse me, I must make some change, 
 And I will stroll with you awhile. 
 'Twill not take long. Miss, to arrange 
 My bad looks (laughing). Men of toil 
 Should look bad sometimes, even tho' 
 They should be preachers, don't you know." 
 Xlll. 
 She smiled as he went ofif from her. 
 "Now don't be long; 'tis hard to wait," 
 She called. She thought him handsomer 
 Just in that rig, but would not say 't. 
 She watched him till he disappeared 
 Within the chapel door. Her heart 
 With a peculiar thrill was stirred, 
 And thoughts there were which made her start, 
 And thoughts that made her start, there were, 
 That made her start in joyous fear. 
 XIV. 
 To every women comes an hour 
 When she with self stands face to face; 
 She doth most realize her power 
 And find within this life her place. 
 And when that time doth come 'tis well 
 That she should with discretion move, 
 Nor 'gainst her better self rebel. 
 But if she must, then wisely love. 
 That hour to fair Rosetta came : 
 Within her bosom burnt love's flame. 
THE THUNDER STORM. 7 I 
 XV. 
 Within her bosom burnt love's flame. 
 She knew it when she trembled most; 
 'Twas then that great truth to her came 
 '' 'Tis better to have loved and lost 
 Than never to have loved at all." 
 For she was happy in that hour. 
 The world that hitherto seemed small, 
 Grew large to her, a wondrous power 
 That thrilled her bosom, her possessed, 
 A strange deep feeling in the breast. 
 XVI. 
 "Fve kept you waiting," with a look 
 Of real pleasure, Stone returned. 
 ''Where shall we go?" Her arm he took 
 Quite carelessly. How her heart burned ! 
 Softly she answered, "Anywhere, 
 But let it lead towards my home. 
 However, do not hurry there. 
 Such afternoons I like to roam 
 Through quiet woods, by peaceful streams 
 Where one may lose herself in dreams." 
 XVII. 
 So they strolled off. Each workman's eye 
 Looked on and winked. "The parson's gone; 
 Look out, this house will by and by 
 Hold two, I think, instead of one," 
 So said the big boss carpenter, 
 As he looked at them down the road. 
 "Ah well, a single minister 
 Won't do ; it is too great a load 
 For one to carry, better tzifo, 
 An' that 'a gal I think will do." 
 XVIII. 
 And so ran gossip. Other eyes 
 Beheld the two go down the lane ; 
 Eyes that gazed on in some surprise, 
 Whose owner's heart beat with much pain. 
 Eyes, where a soul week after week 
 Had seen and listened in vain to h-ear 
 Somebody of the past to speak ; 
 And now to her these two appear 
 Not pleasant. Ay, a jealous hate 
 Doth at the door for entrance wait. 
 XIX. 
 ''She with him!" thus May Melville said 
 Between shut teeth, as on she came 
 Toward the church. Her pathway led 
 Her straight to them. She heard her name 
 Just as she met them. "For a stroll?" 
 She turned to say quite civilly, 
 ''Do let me go," and her control 
 Was wonderful beyond degree. 
 Both laughing, answered, ''Certainly, 
 There's always room enough for three." 
 XX. 
 "How mean ; you know I cannot go. 
 The children need me at this hour." 
 She stopped, slight gossiping, "Like to tho'. 
 Looks as if there'd be a shower 
 Before night fall ; pray don't be caught." 
 Rosetta answered, though they should, 
 She had this one comforting thought 
 She had the preacher, he was good. 
 Surely now Providence would spare 
 Her if the minister was there. 
 XXL 
 Thus with another word or two 
 And civil smiles, she passed them by. 
 ''Poor thing, she has a lot to do," 
 Said Rose, with sympathetic sigh. 
 ''She certainly is a Christian, sir, 
 She's done so much for us, and still 
 There's nothing that's too hard for her. 
 Oh, she has such a wondrous will. 
 I wish I was as strong as she, 
 A mighty woman I would be." 
 XXII. 
 They entered now a wood path where 
 'ihe pines, tall sentinels, high stood. 
 And cool and pleasant was the air. 
 Perfumed with odor of the wood. 
 The velvet moss, growing between 
 And crow foot, running 'long the way. 
 Showed up against them bright and green. 
 Now here, now there, a gum or oak 
 The sombre green of pine trees broke. 
 XXIII. 
 It was that early part of June 
 When in their robes the swaying trees 
 Look best. And on this afternoon. 
 There was a restless kind of breeze. 
 Which showed unsettledness ; and yet 
 One were not bothered 'bout the storm, 
 No danger there, of getting wet 
 For three hours at the most. The farm 
 Of Bro. Hawkins was about 
 One mile away. There was no doubt 
 XXIV. 
 That Stone enjoyed the stroll. To him 
 This maiden's talk for once appealed. 
 Perhaps, it was, he felt a dim 
 Small light appear upon life's field, 
 Till then not there. ''You strong as she?" 
 He asked when he had silent been 
 Some time. ''And now why shouldn't you be?" 
 Perhaps you are from what I've seen. 
 For he was thinking of the night 
 When she intO' the dark took flight. 
 XXV. 
 "She has a romance in her life" 
 She said with somewhat of the touch 
 Of confidence. "Although the wife 
 Of, perhaps, one of the best. - Yet such 
 Has been her fate within the past 
 To love another who, she said, 
 Was the most brilliant, but was 'fast,' 
 And whom she felt she dared not wed ; 
 And yet she loved him, loved him true. 
 Now does this not show strength to vou?" 
 XXVI. 
 He murmured assent. "And his name?" 
 "She would not tell his name. She said 
 That was too sacred. Some day fame. 
 She thought, would tell it, if he led 
 A different life. She never knew 
 Just what he would make up his mind 
 Within this great big wo.rld to do, 
 But she was sure that he could find 
 His place in any walk. So bright, 
 Tis pity that his faults must blight." 
 XXVII. 
 *'And do you think that such is strength, 
 To throw aside the one we love 
 And let him run to the rope's length, 
 Himself a saint or demon prove?" 
 He bit his lips. "And now think you 
 It had been better had she caught 
 This lover wild of hers, if true, 
 And him upon good terms brought ? 
 I hope if you should ever love 
 You would not half as heartless prove." 
 XXVIII. 
 ''But what is love? I do not know !" 
 She murmured,, "Could a woman make 
 The man she thought she loved just so 
 As she should wish him? Can she break 
 Him of bad habits?" "Now you ask 
 Too many questions, for its first, 
 You ask what's love. It were a task 
 To answer. Let us say, a thirst 
 Of soul for soul, one's self to seek, 
 Where only soul to soul can speak." 
 XXIX. 
 "Can woman make the man she thinks 
 wShe loves do what she'd have him do? 
 Here let me say if she but drinks 
 From the pure fountain, if but true, 
 Her life to him an influence 
 For good in every way, I say, 
 No matter what the circumstance, 
 At last she'll make him turn her way. 
 There's nothing mightier than love — 
 In woman nought more strong can prove." 
 XXX. 
 ''Suppose," she ventured, '1ie does not 
 Know of this love, and that she knows 
 Not that he loves her? Suppose her lot 
 Be but to love in vain? — suppose 
 He loves no one? is very cold. 
 Then can she make him love her? Can 
 She be excused if she be bold 
 In making the advance? A man 
 Himself not sensible, should he 
 Disdain her if more forward she?" 
 XXXI. 
 "In such a case, much may depend, 
 The whole thing is conditional. 
 The girl who has a noble end 
 In view may be excused in all ; 
 But even if the man be such 
 As you describe him, there is chance 
 To win him. Yes, to win him, much 
 Depends upon the circumstance ; 
 She must be bold and also shy, 
 Seek yet to avoid his company. 
 XXXII. 
 "Draw, yet be drawn by him ; and tease 
 When he would think the way is clear; 
 When he is overwarm, then freeze. 
 Care less for him should he most care. 
 Well thus to end it all, to do 
 Whatever prudence mip-ht allow. 
 Successful lovers, there are few. 
 And mostly all end in a row. 
 Why should you ask such things of me? 
 In love, you surely cannot be." 
THE THUNDER STORM. ^J 
 XXXIIL 
 "And if I were," she laughing said, 
 ''There's not a man in all this land 
 Who'd bother for an hour his head 
 On my account, or seek my hand." 
 She sighed. "Ma says I am too bold, 
 I should, she says, be more sedate. 
 Ah, well, you see, most men are cold, 
 And I'm afraid, it is my fate 
 To love the coldest man alive — 
 To whom I uselessly must give 
 XXXIV. 
 "My heart." "To me confession made? 
 Now don't, I shan't confessor be!" 
 He laughed, "Poor little heart, and laid 
 Down at a cold man's feet. And he, 
 And does he love you ? — never mind — 
 Don't answer." "But how do I know? 
 For that is what I'd like to find 
 Out." "Truly," he replied, "how so?' 
 "By asking, if no other way, 
 'Seek, ye shall find,' the Scriptures say." 
 XXXV. 
 "There, naughty girl, you ought not quote 
 The Scripture for things so profane." 
 "There, pardon me, I ought to know 't," 
 She said, "And yet, the thought is plain. 
 If I would know my fate, to seek 
 By asking; tell me am I right?" 
 He laughed, "Compel me not to speak 
 Just now, besides I see the light 
 Is fading. Let us hurry on, 
 pre we get home the day '11 be gone.'' 
 XXXVI. 
 "And how abrupt !" she laughing said, 
 ''You have no sign of sympathy 
 To one in trouble. I'm afraid, 
 Poor peace, if any, you would be." 
 He arched his brows and looked surprised. 
 "How plain," he said, "how very plain. 
 In the rough term, I think you've sized 
 Me up too well indeed. Again 
 Of me whatever now you know, 
 I think that we had better go." 
 XXXVII. 
 They stood near by two roads that met. 
 By-roads they were that thro' the wood 
 Cut off the main. And now they set 
 Out for her home. "I've not been good, 
 She said, "at all. I know you'll not 
 Consent to stroll with me again. 
 Now won't you let all be forgot 
 That we have said, and still remain 
 My friend, and when I ask you go. 
 Not be prepared to tell me no?" 
 XXXVIII. 
 He smiled, looked down upon the girl, 
 He saw pure sadness in her face. 
 Her hat she carried. A dark curl 
 Stole down her brow. 'Twas out of place 
 He thought and yet that one short hour 
 Had brought this simple maid so near 
 He felt she had peculiar power 
 O'er his small life. "Yies, yes, my dear — 
 D-d-aughter," he had stammered out, 
 Not knowing what he was about." 
THE THUNDER STORM. 79 
 XXXIX. 
 She smiled. ''Thank you, and you are good, 
 As good as I had thought you were, 
 But tell me, have I not been rude?" 
 Again he answered, "No, my dear." 
 This seemed to please her very much. 
 Her hand stole slyly in his arm, 
 "You don't think, do you, I am such 
 A bold girl after all?" A charm 
 Was in the maiden's very tone. 
 "No, no, dear child," soft murmured Stone. 
 XL. 
 They wend their way now leisurely, 
 She leaning lightly on his arm. 
 So sweet was all, now cared not he 
 How^ far the walk was to the farm. 
 Perhaps 'twas well that neither knew 
 The thoughts that occupied each mind. 
 Was it unconsciously he drew 
 Her hand in his ? Or was she blind 
 To that firm press ? She felt the thrill, 
 Yet on his arm she linsfered still. 
 XLL 
 She closed her eyes. He did not speak 
 He dared not. 'Twas the other night- 
 Would he forget? He was not weak. 
 Why lose these moments of delight? 
 Why should he tell this girl to-day 
 How glad he felt there at her side? 
 No. He had seen her rush away 
 And leave him with indignant pride. 
 No. Was he sure? 'Twas but a whim 
 Upon her part to be with him. 
 XLIL 
 **Must I not ask him to forgive 
 Me for my rudeness t'other night? 
 But how would he my words receive ? 
 Of course it cannot be just right. 
 Why does he press my hand Hke this, 
 And can he love me, can he feel 
 As I for him ? Should I dismiss 
 Such feeling? How can I conceal 
 The truth from him, I know he knows?" 
 Thus, as she walked along, thought Rose. 
 XLIII. 
 'Twas from the wood at last they came. 
 What seemed approaching of the night 
 Was darkened skies. The last red flame 
 Of setting sun had gone. The light 
 Of gold was banked by threatenino" 
 Black clouds which rolled portentiously 
 Out from the west. A muttering 
 Of nearing thunder. ''Mercy me! 
 A gust is coming," quick, she cried. 
 And closer drew unto his side. 
 XLIV. 
 ''Look!" She pointed to the west. 
 "Those awful clouds! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!' 
 He answered, "Let us make the best 
 Of it we can. Your home is near?" 
 "One-half of mile around the road, 
 A shorter distance through the wood," 
 She answered. "But the ground is ploughed 
 In the first field, and 'tis not good 
 To try that way. I think it best 
 To tak^ the road, 'tis easiest." 
 XLV. 
 "We'll try the road; can you walk fast?" 
 He asked. ''Of course, not fast as you." 
 ''You must," he softly said, ''the blast 
 Will break upon us." And he drew 
 Her hand still tighter. "Maybe I 
 Shall have to carry you, so come." 
 Her grasp but tightened in reply. 
 Stepped firmly, quickly. It was some 
 Moments before either spoke. 
 The wind has risen. Wildly broke 
 XLVI. 
 In screams through swaying ancient pines. 
 He felt her tremble at his side. 
 Along the horizon great lines 
 Of smoky clouds had gathered. Wide 
 The fields of grain unharvested 
 Kolled in great waves beneath the wind. 
 A farmer to the barn had led 
 His team that they might shelter find, 
 A frightened flock of sheep stood nigh 
 The bars and waited anxiously. 
 XLVII. 
 The farm is almost reached, the house 
 Stood plainly out into full view. 
 "If we get caught I am the cause 
 We had been home if left to you — 
 I am so silly," gasping she 
 Had spoken. "Come, let's get there first, 
 Ere comments shall be passed," said he; 
 And as he spoke a flash — a burst 
 Of thunder, then a crashing sound — 
 An oak nearby falls to the ground. 
 XLVIIL 
 ''Oh!" cried the girl," we shall be struck!" 
 And closer drew to him. ''No, no," 
 He said; "No, no; no such ill luck." 
 "But see" (another peal) "how slow 
 I walk ! alas !" she cried. His arm 
 About her drew most tenderly, 
 As if assurance that no harm 
 Could come to her. They now could see 
 Her parents waiting for them on 
 The porch. She quickly drew from Stone. 
 XLIX. 
 A tell-tale flush now on her face. 
 "Forgive me, I would rather be 
 Left thus, a little out of place. 
 You know." She'd spoken "hurriedly. 
 Stone heard and fully understood. 
 Nor failed he to appreciate 
 Her for it. It was for his good ; 
 Now they had entered the large gate. 
 Loud howled the wind, "Come on, come on," 
 The father called to her and Stone. 
 "We might have been here sooner, but 
 I would not come," said Rose when they 
 Had gathered in the house. "To put 
 The blame on you," spoke Stone, "I say 
 It is not fair. It was my fault, 
 For I proposed that we should take 
 The stroll, and oft took time to halt. 
 First at this place and that to make 
 Some note. I should have used more thought ; 
 We certainly came near being caught. 
THE THUNDER STORM. 83 
 LI. 
 ^'Ah well, no harm," her father said. 
 *'No," joined her mother since you were 
 Not caught, and yet I felt some dread 
 Until I saw you both appear." 
 "And when you saw us. Ma?" asked Rose, 
 Who failed not to recall the arm 
 About her waist, looked at him whose 
 Arm it had been, while blood rushed warm 
 Into each cheek. ''I felt all right 
 The moment that you came in sight." 
 LII. 
 They now were in the living room, 
 The sky was blacker growing still. 
 The clouds shapes ominous assume; 
 The wind was blowing wild and shrill. 
 And blinding dust was in the air. 
 Which blew in scuddying whirls around, 
 And peal on peal of thunder there, 
 As flash on flash of lightning wound 
 It's zigzag course the wood along. 
 ''Keep silent Rose, you know 'tis wTong," 
 LIII. 
 Said Mrs. Hawkins, as she drew 
 Far from the window. Little John 
 And Nellie there beside her, knew 
 Their mother's rule and spoke alone 
 In whispers. Mr. Hawkins sat, 
 Himself now silent, gazing out 
 The window, to the roadway that 
 Could not be seen for dust. Half pout 
 Was playing on Rosetta's lips, 
 Now biting at her finger tips. 
 LIV. 
 There from the sofa, Stone could see 
 Each of the family, and draw. 
 In study of this family, 
 Conclusions just from what he saw. 
 All now was silent there within, 
 All howling of the wind without; 
 Wild demons seemed to raise a din, 
 Rush howling all the place about. 
 And loud the thunder pealed. At last 
 Down came the rain, a fearful blast. 
 LV. 
 Down came the rain ! How dark it was ! 
 Except where lightning cleft the sky. 
 The windows shook ! each pane of glass 
 Seemed threatened as most furiously 
 The driving rain beat 'gainst each place. 
 Rose whispered '' 'Tis a cloudburst — my !" 
 A flash of lightning lit her face. 
 An awful crash, as if nearby 
 It struck. x\bove the dark a light 
 Flames in the sky, and all is bright. 
 LVI. 
 "Eire!" Rosetta screamed, and Stone 
 Rushed to the hall, and out the door 
 Upon the porch. The heavens shone 
 With flames. Perhaps a mile or more 
 He saw a stately barn ablaze. 
 The family had followed out. 
 "How far is it?" "A little ways," 
 Replied his host. "Perhaps about 
 A mile. It is the Smith estate." 
 ■ My ! my !," cried Rose, "the glare — how great !' 
 LVII. 
 "Come Rose into the house. You Nell, 
 John ! — come out now of that rain you all 
 Do know that none of you are well," 
 Called Mrs. Hawkins from the hall. 
 "Yes, it is not the thing to do 
 Myself," said Stone, "I should not be 
 A standing here." "Yes, that is true," 
 Said Mr. Hawkins, "but now with me, 
 Should there a fire be around, 
 Outside the house I'm mostly found." 
 LVHI. 
 The storm was growing less severe. 
 The rolling thunder far away 
 Began to sound. "O dear ! O dear ! 
 How frightened I have been ! To-day 
 Has been so full of happenings," 
 Said Rose when she had struck a light. 
 And Nell began to put the things 
 In order now for tea. The bright 
 Light from out that room broke on 
 The living room from which had gone 
 LIX. 
 All but Stone and his host, who sat 
 In silence. But 'twas presently 
 The latter spoke. "Well, Reverend, what 
 About our parsonage — will it be 
 Finished by fall?" "I think it will, 
 If nothing happens," Stone replied. 
 "Those workmen are good men of skill, 
 And in the work take special pride; 
 I think, however, after all, 
 We'll move into our house by fall." 
 LX. 
 "We?" said his now inquiring host, 
 ''I pray who shall the madam be?" 
 Who was full bent on making most 
 Upon Stone's speaking of the ''we." 
 ''The madam?" quered Stone. 'T mean 
 The church that is the madam now. 
 Aside from her, I have not seen 
 The woman upon whose fair brow 
 That I might place the crown of wife, 
 Herself to crown my lonely life." 
 LXI. 
 ''Tut, Reverend, tut, a man like you 
 Should have a wife by all means, sir; 
 For in this place 'twill never do 
 To have a single minister." 
 "Well, yes, perhaps all that you say 
 Is so. I shan't one word deny. 
 Still I have not up to this day, 
 Been good enough in woman's eye 
 To call one wife, though much I would, 
 But somehow I'm not understood." 
 LXII. 
 Not understood? — from out the gloom, 
 Where she was busying about. 
 He saw Rose in the dining room, 
 And on her face a look of doubt. . 
 A look of doubt, a roguish smile 
 Which plainly in its silence said, 
 "I don't believe it." All the while 
 The things were on the table laid. 
 "You are all right," his host replied, 
 "And would be better with a bride." 
THE THUNDER STORM. 87 
 LXIII. 
 ''Still that depends," observed his guest. 
 ''I'm sure it is for better or worse. 
 I'm kind of cautious in it, lest 
 I miss the blessing, get the curse. 
 Of course, a woman, I suppose. 
 To wed me I might chance to find, 
 But I don't seek for one of those. 
 Perhaps I'm choicy, and the kind 
 I want, don't want me, don't you see? 
 The kind I want will not have me." 
 LXIV. 
 "Pray, why?" his host surprised made quest. 
 "Oh, many reasons may be shown ; 
 Most of them do not think it best 
 To be a preacher's wife," said Stone. 
 Rose colored as she placed a dish 
 Upon the table. "Think you so? 
 It seems 'twould be her highest wish 
 To marry one from what I know," 
 His host replied. "From what you see, 
 'Tis not all bright this ministry." 
 LXV. 
 "Perhaps," replied his host, "conceit, 
 If you v/ill pardon me, I fear, 
 Born of a bachelor's life 's complete 
 Control of you. An old man hear. 
 I'm father of thirteen, one wife, 
 (A goodly wife as ever lived.) 
 A hard worked man, and yet a life 
 Of peace and joy I have derived 
 From union with this wife of mine 
 Tho' bitter as well as sweet my wine. 
 LXVI. 
 "You marry, 'tis a better thing 
 Than Hvnig such a lonely life. 
 Ah, yes, 'tis more encouraging 
 Than single-handed in this strife. 
 Marry 'for better or for worse;' 
 But in it trust to Providence, 
 Whatever afterward your course. 
 That both of you use common sense. 
 Get from your head that poor conceit : 
 A woman makes a man complete." 
 Lxvn. 
 ''Thanks for your sermon," murmured Stone. 
 "Tea!" cried Rosetta; "come to tea! 
 Pa, let the Reverend alone. 
 His wife's picked out, who e'er she be." 
 Mrs. Hawkins entered, and the two 
 Went to the dining room, and there 
 Up to the sumptuous repast drew. 
 The smell of chicken filled the air. 
 Said Stone, "Pd marry if I could 
 Obtain a wife who'd cook such food." 
 Canto VIII. 
 MORNING AFTER. 
 I. 
 When Stone awoke the sun was high. 
 Without a bird sang merrily, 
 As perched upon a Hmb near by, 
 ''Too weet, too w^ee! too weet, too wee!' 
 A w^asp was building in the eaves 
 Ingeniously her house of clay ; 
 From limb to limb a spider weaves 
 Her silken web in wondrous way; 
 A bee goes buzzing on the wing. 
 And there is life in every thing. 
 11. 
 A turkey gobbler struts about, 
 And drums upon the dampened sward ; 
 And puts the crowing cock to rout 
 Into a corner of the yard. 
 The cackling of excited hens, 
 A small stray chicken's ''peep, peep," 
 The grunt of pigs there in the pens, — 
 And how could Stone be fast asleep ? 
 Despite the fact, in sweet repose. 
 He dreamed the live long night of Rose. 
 III. 
 And, reader, will you think him weak. 
 If after eight long weary years 
 Of service, where he had to speak 
 To unresponsive heart:^ 'midst tears 
 ' And disappointments, if at last 
 The heart, which misery made to love, 
 Should at a pretty face beat fast, 
 And he like other men should prove? 
 And scorn the preacher if the man 
 Should love, which is but Nature's plan? 
 IV. 
 And did Stone love ? He could not say. 
 The passion of more youthful years 
 He simply knew, had passed away, 
 And in its place, 'midst hopes- and fears. 
 Came something stirring in his breast. 
 Which softened every rugged line ; 
 In lives of others see the best 
 Above the human, the divine; 
 Yea, lifted him above the human, 
 To see the angelhood of woman. 
 V. 
 He lay awhile there to survey 
 The room in which so well he'd slept. 
 Through the green blinds a flooding ray 
 Of light in every corner swept. 
 And on an easel, of life size, 
 A crayon of Rosetta was. 
 So life like, seemed to speak. Her eyes 
 Looked right at him. A roguish mass 
 Of curls stole from a pompadore 
 And down her brow came creeping o'er. 
 VI. 
 The other pictures, that around 
 The walls profusely hung, he saw 
 Not. Here, as if he had been bound, 
 He gazed. And just what seemed to draw 
 He did not know. But only this : 
 The more he gazed upon this face 
 He felt, and was he sure? that his 
 Life, somehow, must find its place 
 Along with her's whose portrait he 
 Was gazing on so earnestly. 
 VH. 
 Here as he lay enrapt, a song 
 Came from the floor below. His ear 
 Caught now and then the words which rung 
 Softly and sweet. The voice was clear. 
 'T need thee every hour." The line 
 Came to him as a morning prayer, 
 "Stay thou near by." O words divine ! 
 Were they not spoken for him there? 
 Thus he arose — no more delay 
 And fell upon his knees to pray. 
 vni. 
 What prayed he for ? He would be strong. 
 He would, whate'er the day might bring, 
 Steer to the right and clear of wrong 
 And say and do the proper thing. 
 The proper thing, the will alone 
 Of him be done who's over all. 
 Into the opening day trod on. 
 Brave hearted to the last — nor fall, 
 Nor falter when the foe comes nigh. 
 But press right on to victory. 
 IX. 
 Stone had been dressed an hour, and read 
 His morning lesson when the call 
 For rising to his chamber sped, 
 Rung from a bell within the hall. 
 And "J^s^^s, lover of my soul," 
 Sang Rosie in the dining room, 
 That hour a glowing feeling stole 
 Into Stone's heart. ''Ah, such was home' 
 And from his eyes he dashed a tear. 
 In looking at the picture there. 
 X. 
 Down stairs he went and thro' the hall 
 Out on the front porch. Standing there 
 Was little Nell. A worsted ball 
 She held about to toss it. She 
 Looked and said, "Good mocning, sir." 
 "Good morning, daughter." Fatherly 
 He stroked her long dark hair. "And were 
 You frightened last nig-ht in the storm?" 
 "No, sir. I knew there'd be no harm." 
 XL 
 "And why?" he asked with half a guess 
 What she would answer. "Tell me why." 
 "Ma bids us never fear unless 
 We have done wrong, for God's great eye 
 Doth watch o'er all, and he will keep 
 Us in all kinds of storms and things. 
 He guards us all when we are sleep 
 And thro' the darkest night he brings 
 Us safely to the light of day. 
 Then guides us all along the way." 
THE MORNING AFTER. 93 
 XIL 
 "Sun of my soul thou Saviour dear," 
 This moment from the house now stole. 
 *'It is not night if thou be near" 
 Brought sunlight to our hero's soul. 
 ''Am I not right?" She raised her eyes 
 To him, he murmured gently, *'Yes." 
 She for her age was overwise 
 Herself in such way to express. 
 "O let no earth-born cloud arise 
 To hide thee from thy servant's eyes." 
 XIII. 
 The little bird up in the tree 
 Stopped for a while to hear the song ; 
 And Stone hummed soft, "Abide with me." 
 As aloft the notes to heaven rung 
 ''Come, Reverend, catch this ball with me," 
 Said Nell, who tossed into the air 
 The ball she had, and quickly he 
 Struck attitude to catch it there. 
 "Ha, ha, and that was fine," cried Nell. 
 So passed the time until the bell 
 XIV. 
 For breakfast rung. Toward the door 
 He looked. Without Rosetta stood. 
 Neat dressed, her hair la pompadore. 
 That tell-tale curl, and rosey hued 
 Her cheeks. "Why, Reverend, you here? — 
 And Nell, you little rogue, to steal 
 Away from me!" "There, there, my dear, — 
 Good datighter," stammered Stone, "don't feel 
 Too sore if this dear miss has run 
 Away from you, much good she's done." 
 XV. 
 Nell smiled and caught behind his coat, 
 Rose looked confused, and disappeared. 
 They followed her. He cleared his throat, 
 ''Ahem! she flees without a word." 
 ''Here, Reverend," in the living room. 
 'Twas Bro. Hawkins' voice just then. 
 "Go, Nellie, tell the rest to come. 
 A lovely morning after rain." 
 He turned to Stone who took his hand. 
 " 'Twas needed badly by the land." 
 XVI. 
 In came the madam, followed now 
 By Rosie, N'ell and little John . 
 A sweet song sung, and then they bow 
 Together, led in prayer by Stone, 
 Short, mete and very forcible. 
 For still had Stone upon his mind 
 The simple faith of little Nell — 
 The words she said. He felt the kind 
 Of home this was. Thus with accord 
 Could lead this family to the Lord. 
 XVI. 
 Then out to breakfast. There again 
 To sit and eat the well served food. 
 Tho' every thing was very plain, 
 Yet everything was very good. 
 "Your own raised hams?" he asked his host. 
 "Yes, sir. We seldom have to buy 
 Unless some sickness. Y'et the most. 
 We have our own meat; that is why 
 I am always ahead, you see, 
 For nothing gets away from me." 
 XVII. 
 "Why, Reverend," said young John, ''you know, 
 You said last night — " ''Why, mother, — John," 
 Cried Rosie. "Well now," said John, " 'tis so^- 
 That you would m-m — " "Well, upon 
 My word," said Mrs. Hawkins; "Jack, 
 What ails you? Will you not be still?" 
 "Well, mama," he was crying back, 
 "Just let me finish." "No, 'tis ill 
 To speak of everything you hear; 
 I'll have to punish you, I fear." 
 XVIII. 
 Stone's host was all aglow with smiles, 
 And little Nell look frightened. Rose 
 Was trembling and her food in piles, 
 Lay on her plate untouched. "Don't lose 
 Your appetite, my dear," now said 
 Her mother calmly, "eat your food; 
 Last night's excitement, I'm afraid. 
 Regards your nerves, did you no good. 
 Well, Reverend, how did yoit rest ?" 
 "Ah, splendidly — the very best." 
 XIX. 
 Somehow Stone knew the whole import 
 Of Johnnie's words. And, now, to tease. 
 From talking other things' quite short 
 He turned toward his host. "Now please 
 Tell me who with such delicate skill 
 Prepared this breakfast — may I know ? — 
 She certainly has 'filled the bill.' " 
 Then John cried out, "I told you so," 
 And looked at Rose. "Well, now," replied 
 His host, "I think you may decide." 
 XX. 
 **Ah?" (Rose stopped eating,) said the guest. 
 *'I see — pray daughter, feel no shame 
 Unless condemned here hy the rest. 
 I can but praise the food. Your name, 
 If you continue as you do, 
 Cannot remain mere Hawkins long; 
 Some one is sure to search for you. 
 I'm certain he will not be wrong. 
 Had I some one to cook like this. 
 My home would be a place of bliss." 
 XXL 
 ''Don't flatter, Rev. Stone," she broke 
 Out sharply, "I hate flattery." 
 She seemed as as if she'd almost choke. 
 "Pray throw it not away on fne." 
 "Nay, daughter, flattery? — not at all; 
 You must not be incredulous. 
 The skill to cook a meal's not small, 
 Especially w^hen it is thus. 
 I hope you'll pardon me if I 
 Have been more frank than I should be." 
 XXII. 
 His hostess smiled, her daughter blushed. 
 His host each point of it enjoyed. 
 And even further would have pushed. 
 But fear that Rose would be annoyed. 
 John, too, looked wise, but said no more. 
 And little Nell was most precise 
 To cut her meat up o'er and o'er, 
 Which was the smallest bit of slice. 
 Thus each with his own thoughts intent, 
 The breakfast hour now was spent. 
THE MORNING AFTER. 97 
 XXIII. 
 The meal now o'er, the family 
 Began the duties of the day. 
 His host declared his work should be 
 - Down in the meadow, mowing hay. 
 ''You'll not go to the building then?" 
 He asked Stone. "Not if I were you; 
 Besides I think, sir, that the men 
 Can get along without you. True 
 I understand just how you feel 
 And all appreciate your zeal. 
 XXIV. 
 "Stay here, however, madam will 
 Take splendid care of you, be sure. 
 The Nooks, don't fear, will not think ill 
 In your abiding here. And more, 
 I'll send John to inform them that 
 You'll be with us a day or two. 
 And you may have them send you what 
 E'er there may be of need to you. 
 My house is large, my family small. 
 There is room and food enough for all." 
 XXV. 
 Thus with them all 'twas understood 
 That Rev. Stone awhile should be 
 Their guest. Said Nellie 'Tsn't he good?'' 
 To Johnnie confidentially. 
 "You bet. I'm going to Mr. Nooks' 
 For him, and when I do get bac^ 
 He'll read me outen all his books, 
 I know, or else my name's not Jack." 
 "How do you know the books will do, 
 You silly boy, to read to you?" 
 7 
 XXVI. 
 "Of course they'll do, for won't I be 
 A preacher, too, one of these days ? 
 Perhaps, a sliding elder, see? 
 So I'll get use to all the ways. 
 And when I've made the seventh grade 
 And gone from here to college, then 
 A first-class preacher I'll be made. 
 And preach just like these other men — 
 But, no, I shall not cry and bawl, 
 For I don't b'lieve in that at all.'' 
 XXVII. 
 "And will you let folks clap and shout, 
 And shake their hands as some do here?" 
 Asked little Nellie. "Not without 
 The Spirit moves them. Perhaps there 
 May be some who are not real good. 
 And yet when I begin to preach. 
 Will shout and clap their hands. I should 
 When these begin to clap and screech, 
 Jes' say to them, 'you hypercrit. 
 You jes' set there and wait abit.' " 
 XXVIII. 
 "Well, I shall be a preacher's wife," 
 Said Nellie in a manner grave. 
 "You do not know — upon my life! — 
 You've got to wait for one to have 
 You," said her brother with disgust. 
 "How can you tell that such will be. 
 You see a grown-up woman must 
 Wait for a man to ask her. See?" 
 "I see, of course," said little Nell; 
 "I had not thought of that, to tell 
THE MORNING AFTER. 99 
 XXIX. 
 "The truth, I thought that one could be 
 Just what one wanted to." "Of course, 
 When left alone with one, but we 
 Men must ask you this. To force 
 Yourself on us would not be wise." 
 And John, who had been tossing chips 
 After the turkey, to full size 
 Drew himself up. With tight closed lips, 
 His Httle sister, at his side, 
 Looked at her brother with deep pride. 
 XXX. 
 Not far away, this childish talk 
 Was heard and well enjoyed, by Stone, 
 Who having started for a walk 
 Into the meadow all alone. 
 But being attracted by the trees 
 That hung with apples, almost ripe. 
 He stopped to sample one of these, 
 And put aside his friendly pipe, 
 The talk of these two children heard, 
 Enjoying richly every word. 
 XXXI. 
 And as their talk seemed finished he 
 Continued, thoughtful, on his stroll, 
 "An interesting family," 
 He murmured. "Yea, upon my soul, 
 The last eight years I have not met 
 In all my work the like before." 
 And thus his memory he let 
 His former work to wander o'er. 
 His three appointments in these years. 
 The records of his hopes and fears. ; 
 XXXII. 
 And now his first work comes to view, 
 The one dear work of all the three, 
 Where first the pastor's trials he knew 
 And met responsibility; 
 Of how the people met him first, 
 And what they of his preaching said. 
 No welcoming, no wild outburst, 
 But doubtful shakes of many a head. 
 And then his elders' grave advice. 
 His own true style to sacrifice; 
 XXXIII. 
 And how he held his chosen course, 
 The even tenor of his way ; 
 And how it seemed a silent force 
 Was gaining for him every day, 
 Till vacant pews began to fill. 
 And anxious faces met his gaze, 
 And far and near his pulpit skill 
 Began to win the people's praise. 
 And he had raised them up to him 
 Instead of going down to them. 
 XXXIV. 
 Then those prayer meetings, how he first 
 Looked at them, and considered how 
 He might discourage them ; how burst 
 Upon him for this such a row 
 Of cruel abuse, and how he stood 
 Closed mouth, except when to defend ; 
 And how it was there came a flood 
 Of favor for him, and the end 
 Of all of it, the methods changed, 
 The comingf back of those estranged. 
 I 
 XXXV. 
 His second work. The circuit long, 
 On lonely roads, dense covered woods, 
 Which he had travelled, song on song:. 
 Had sung as he the miles pursued 
 In shaky road cart, sleepy nag. 
 To lodge at night beneath a roof 
 Where there was not a decent rag 
 To lie on ; but to be dirt proof, 
 And eat without a word the food 
 One placed before him, bad or good. 
 XXXVI. 
 His third work, an unruly Board, 
 A church half buried in a debt, 
 To which he went with drawn sword, 
 Determined fully not to let 
 Himself be beaten; how he won 
 And brought the church upon her feet, 
 And when his joy had just begun 
 And he began to taste the sweet 
 Of harvest, he was called away 
 Sent to this place for more affray. 
 XXXVII. 
 Now^ over all his work his mind 
 Has wandered, and as he recalls 
 Each scene, he does not fail to find, 
 Despite the draw backs and pitfalls ; 
 Despite the wrangles in the boards ; 
 Despite the cold dark wintry days ; 
 Despite the many adverse words, 
 The slander far outweighing praise, 
 Some people he could well recall 
 With tender feeling after all. 
 XXXVIII. 
 Some good, yes, true, parishoner 
 Who never failed him when in need; 
 Some widow, yes, he found in her 
 A constant friend in time of need. 
 Some brother, who without a doubt 
 Would do his duty, come or go, 
 When needed was always about 
 To answer to his call. Whom no 
 E'er changing wind could turn away, 
 But by him to the last would stay. 
 XXXIX. 
 Such were the men and women who 
 God always has prepared to take 
 His servants whom he sends, tho' few, 
 Enough there will be found to make 
 God's servants happy in the thought 
 That they can never be alone, 
 Who work for God, — that there is nought 
 To stop them, they may rest upon 
 God's Word which says that He will raise 
 Up friends for them throughout their days. 
THE RUMOR. I03 
 Canto IX. — I. 
 THE RUMOR. 
 I. 
 'Twas Monday after Children's Day, 
 When Mary Melville, breakfast o'er 
 And dishes washed and put away, 
 Stood idle at her kitchen door. 
 Her view was o'er a stretching heath 
 Where huckelberries richly grew. 
 Among which ran a winding path 
 That she was wont oft to pursue. 
 Clad in a rough-and-ready suit, 
 To gather the delicious fruit. 
 n. 
 Now they were ripe, she would not wash, 
 But spend perhaps an hour or two 
 Out there. She would enjoy to slash 
 About where prickly briers grew. 
 Of snakes, Mame Melville had no fear, 
 Nor squirmed to see them at her feet. 
 Just so her trusty stick was near. 
 That snake had better make retreat ; 
 For if she had to kill one, well. 
 She'd try to do it, that was all. 
 III. 
 Melville to town to-day had gone, 
 Would not be back till nearly night ; 
 And being left here all alone, 
 The morning was so very bright, 
 Her spirit longed to be away. 
 To wander over fields afar, 
 Commune with Nature thro' the day. 
 Throw to the winds dull sordid care, 
 And once more like the careless child, 
 Go bounding o'er the open wild. 
 IV. 
 And she was tired; sorely taxed 
 With training children in their part — 
 All over now, her nerves relaxed. 
 She needed change. Her throbbing heart 
 Beat for new scenes. Perhaps she stood 
 This morning at her kitchen door 
 Not in a very happy mood ; 
 And yet not sorrowful ; for o'er 
 Her features now and then would pass 
 A smile — or something like it was. 
 V. 
 For looking at May Melville, one 
 Could scarcely tell just what she did. 
 For she was seldom ever known; 
 Herself she kept completely hid. 
 And as one saw her stately form. 
 Or dared to meet her searching gaze. 
 One never thought that passion's storm 
 Beneath that heaving bosom sways. 
 He saw alone what seemed to be 
 Herself, not in reality. 
tHE RUMOR. 105 
 VL 
 Stone praised her work, he said 'twas grand, ] 
 Yes, it was all a great success; \ 
 Congratulating, pressed her hand, I 
 And murmured warmly, "Heaven bless 
 You, sister, for your noble work." 
 Then marched in company down the isle. 
 With Rosie, who with a jaunty jerk, 
 Stepped at his side. A hateful smile | 
 Which seemed as plain as day to say, 1 
 "You do the work, I get the pay." j 
 VII. 
 Marched down the isle with fresh young Rose, \ 
 She really thought he had more sense ; ' 
 And now she wondered if he knows 
 What people say of him. Defense 
 She'd offered for him oft of late, j 
 About this very thing, but she? 
 What could she do, if to his fate 
 He plunged headlong ? it seems that he 
 Had little talk for her alone, I 
 He smiling spoke, and then went on. j 
 VIII. 
 Since that bright night he had not been 
 To see them, though in homes near by. 
 She knew he'd been, for she had seen 
 Him by their gate go rapidly ; 
 Go rapidly when she had thought 
 That he would surely turn their way. 
 But, no, he passed them by, was aught ! 
 He had against her to display 
 Such coldness, that a minister I 
 Should have for no parishioner ? ^ 
 IX. 
 If he would come, she'd tell him how 
 The people tried to criticise; 
 She'd counsel him not to allow 
 Such little things as these to rise ; 
 She'd tell him that 'twas to his hurt; 
 That it was wholly out of place 
 To hang upon a woman's skirt, 
 Who merely had a pretty face, 
 A little property, but who 
 Was not his kind if all were true. 
 X. 
 Not that Rose was not pure; no, no; 
 Yet when it came to such as this, 
 She was not all she should be, tho' 
 She never saw one thing amiss — 
 The people said she kept the place 
 In constant uproar by her pranks ; 
 And such a girl, despite her face, 
 Was not for ministerial ranks. 
 She'd spoil, thought May, the best of men, 
 "And Raymond ought to know it, then." 
 XI. 
 And there was something else, also; 
 Some even went so far to say 
 The P. E. thought himself her beau. 
 And wrote her letters anyway. 
 If this was true, a base coquette, 
 The girl must be, and some one should 
 Be even kind enough to let 
 The Reverend know the girl he wooed. 
 But no, to him none -spoke a word, 
 Yet gossip on the outside stirr'd. 
 XII. 
 'Twas even at the cross-roads store. 
 The first thing the proprietor 
 Threw at Melville the night before 
 Last was that of their minister. 
 "Mel" did not like the thing at all, 
 And came straight home and made it known. 
 Told her to speak at his first call. 
 He'd great respect for Rev. Stone, 
 And did not wnsh to have it said 
 He was by Rosie Hawkins led. 
 XIII. 
 These were her thoughts as now she stood 
 This morning at her kitchen door. 
 She thought now^ if he only would 
 Come there to-day, she would no more 
 Play doubly with him, but be plain, 
 And tell him all that Gossip said. 
 And urge him after to refrain 
 From keeping company with the maid ; 
 And tho' sincere she really w-ere, 
 'Twas not well to be seen with her. 
 XIV. 
 She turned preparatory to 
 Go to the woods, when in the front 
 She heard approaching steps, and grew 
 Slight nervous, tho' 'twas not her wont. 
 "I wonder, now, who it can be?" 
 She murmured as she closed the door, 
 Tipped to the front room cautiously, 
 Looked through the blinds. And was she sure ? 
 Lo, standing with his gaze upon 
 Some distant object, there was Stone, 
 XV. 
 Already on the porch, about 
 To knock. She felt a little strange. 
 She must not let him in without 
 She made in dress a little change. 
 She could not dare to see him thus. 
 She'd call to him to wait. And so 
 She stole upstairs with little fuss 
 Just as he knocked. And with a ''Who 
 Comes?" waited for his answer ''I." 
 ''O, Reverend !" with a little cry, 
 XVI. 
 "Please wait, and I will not be long, 
 There on the porch, please take a chair." 
 Then with some snatches of a song 
 From Children's Day, smoothes back her hair, 
 Puts on a plain but pretty gown, 
 A pair of silken stockings, blue; 
 A dainty pair of slippers on, 
 Then standing at the glass to view 
 Her hasty toilet, goes to greet 
 Th^ man she most desired to meet. 
 XVII. 
 No, he preferred the porch, the air 
 Was pleasanter, his time was short. 
 He lounged back in the rustic chair. 
 He was not well at all, but sort 
 Of run down. Thought he'd go away 
 To spend a day or two, and near, 
 Decided he would call to say 
 He might be over Sunday, for fear 
 The choir'd follow suit, thought he 
 Would ask her to them all to see. 
THE RUMOR. TO9 
 XVIIl. : , 
 'Terhaps 'tis best," she said, ''if you j 
 (Herself she'd seated opposite,) 
 Are not so well, a day or two 
 To take away, but 'tis not right 
 To miss a Sabbath. People here 
 Prefer to have their minister 
 Within the pulpit to appear, 
 The least. You may be abler 
 By Sunday. If you go away 
 Where'er you are, you'll something say. 
 XIX. 
 ''Come back," she smiled, "by then and preach 
 To those who love to hear you still. 
 Who need the very truth you teach, 
 Who come each Sabbath for their fill. 
 But pardon me, I have no right 
 To talk this way, and you my guide. 
 You must excuse me, for I'm quite 
 Too forward; for yourself decide." 
 She finished, looked through half-closed eyes 
 Upon him. Most slowly Stone replies, 
 XX. 
 "Believe me, you, without a doubt, 
 Are right in giving such advice. 
 A woman sees at once without 
 The pafin of thinking over twice. 
 Qf course, I ought not leave at all. 
 But really feel at times so dull. 
 The folks are busy on whom I call. 
 And tho' indeed my hands are full, 
 I cannot study ; 'tis too warm, 
 i\n4 even Nature has lost charn^." 
 XXL 
 She pitied him. She saw at once 
 The cause of this peculiar state. 
 She gave him now a searching glance, 
 And what use was there to wait? 
 She'd speak to him at once, and tell 
 Him in the simplest way she could, 
 What was not very suitable 
 For one who stood just where he stood. 
 He lounged back in the chair and wore 
 A look most wretched. Oft before 
 xxn. 
 In other days she saw that look. 
 'The same old Raymond after all," 
 She murmured under breath. She took 
 A rose, whose vine ran up the wall. 
 And blew its petals, one by one. 
 And shook her dainty little foot. 
 Stretched careless out, her eyes on Stone, 
 Who chewed upon a sassafras root. 
 Five minutes passed ere either spoke, 
 And then 'twas she the silence broke. 
 xxni. 
 "Now, Reverend, it is useless for 
 This little farce, that we have played, 
 To go on longer. Nobler, 
 It is, if everything be made 
 Now plain between us. From the first 
 I knew you and you knew me, too, 
 And showed it in that quick outburst 
 That Sunday night. Just what to do 
 I knew not then, but now I see 
 My duty very plain to me." 
THE RUMOK. Ill 
 XXIV. 
 He didn't answer, simply sat 
 And looked at her in mute surprise. 
 He never had expected that, 
 Or he had never come. Her eyes 
 Were straight upon him. She went on, 
 "I need not tell you how I felt 
 To have you preaching, Rev. Stone, 
 In the very parish where I dwelt. 
 And I, too, married. Not to me 
 Belongs you being here to tea. 
 XXV. 
 "I never heard a word you said, 
 I only thought, 'And is this Ray ?' 
 Some one had written you were dead, 
 Died after I had gone away. 
 At first 'twas you had disappeared, 
 Left all your old acquaintances. 
 Then some time after that, had heard 
 That to a terrible disease 
 You had succumbed, some where down South; 
 Of course, I took it to be truth." 
 XXVI. 
 He laughed a hollow laugh, ''At most. 
 From all you've seen of me since here, 
 You'll think I'm quite an active ghost. 
 I wonder you had not some fear." 
 "No, no," she cried. 'T taught for five 
 Long years up North, nor wished to see 
 A soul. Alone, I tried to live 
 For others. 'Twas a blow to me. 
 Then I came here and taught two years. 
 None but my God can tell the tears 
 XXVII. 
 **I shed, and even now for that. 
 But then I met my husband. He 
 Is noble, Reverend, just what 
 A lonely sorrowing one like me 
 Needs to protect her. And he loved ; 
 I married him from pure respect, 
 And faithful to him I have proved. 
 Or tried to. I did not reject 
 His noble love. I thought it best 
 To marry. Thus I have confessed. 
 xxvni. 
 **But wait, I am not through, don't speak. 
 I fear I know what you would say. 
 After our wedding, scarce a week 
 Had gone, the preacher came* one day, 
 And looking in my album came 
 Across your portrait, and at once 
 Declared he knew you, called your name. 
 Said you were in his conference; 
 And when I told him you were dead, 
 Your name within the minutes read. 
 XXIX. 
 '*0f course I never thought to look 
 Along the ministerial list. 
 Although I always bought the book, 
 And even then your name I'd missed. 
 Not looking for you there. And so 
 Of course I thought some day 
 I'd see you, but you should not know 
 I recognized you. Now I'd play

 "Is it that makes me see?" 'Tis you — 
 Your good, or you had never heard 
 A word. Perhaps you do not view 
 It as I do. But when a word 
 Is spoken to your hurt 'twill cut 
 Me also even now, and thus 
 Excuse me, when myself I put 
 Into your matters; there's a muss 
 Throughout the parish all astir 
 Because you go so much with her."

 Stone sat and heard Mame Melville thro', 
 Now old love, now mere smypathy; 
 Knew not what she was driving to, 
 Nor understood her until she 
 Had finished. Then it was surprise ! 
 If there were aught, it never came 
 To him at all. To criticise 
 He knew 'twas common, could not blame 
 The people for the gossip, knew 
 About them all a thing or two. 
 XXXII. 
 But why this muss of which she spoke. 
 Which caused her to have gone o'er all 
 Her history? True she awoke 
 Within him much. But since a wall 
 Was reared between them, it was best. 
 He thought, to have kept back much said ; 
 Yes, let the buried ashes rest, 
 Nor kindle up the coals till red 
 They glow. No, forever, no, 
 In speaking he would tell her so. 
 XXXIII. 
 ''Mame/' he now murmured, soft and low, 
 ''You have my deepest sympathy, 
 But what occurred long years ago 
 'Tis best, I think, to let it be. 
 You knew me then, may know me now ; 
 God knows me best ; in Him I trust. 
 Not far from here I made a vow 
 Not to recall the past. I must 
 Therefore forever treat it as 
 Within our life, such never was. 
 XXXIV. 
 "You have a noble husband, true; 
 One who can love you as he ought. 
 Let such love be returned by you, 
 And give to me no further thought. 
 Look at me only as you look 
 At other messengers of Truth, 
 Sent as your pastors. Do not brook 
 To think of that once reckless youth. 
 In truth he died and rose again 
 Another, better, stronger man.

 "Your reference to musses, pray, 
 What can there be for folks to talk? 
 Am I a child ? I know the way ; 
 My head's not turned because I walk 
 With some congenial girl, a child 
 Almost to me ; that I am sure. 
 Of course, I own a little wild, 
 But from what I see, quite pure, 
 With not a measure of deceit, 
 And for my company quite mete.

 ''I like her family, because 
 They lead an ideal Christian life. 
 They try their best to keep the Laws 
 Of God, and never are in strife. 
 I know some folks don't like them, true. 
 Few folks like those who do the right. 
 All may not even like me, too ; 
 But does that matter? In God's sight 
 I 'Stand adjudged. He knows my heart 
 And sees the very innermost part. 
 XXXVII. 
 ''Believe me, I don't try to please 
 In any of my life mere man ; 
 Enough to me that Heayen sees, 
 That God in heaven approves my plan. 
 And I go on. Let people talk, — 
 Why, bless you, child, they will make ill 
 Of our best deeds, and watch our walk 
 To see a step which they may fill 
 With dirt, to show we've walked therein, 
 Then pointing shout, 'Behold his sin!'

 "Of course, I well appreciate 
 Your concern for me, but decline 
 To have you meddle ; 'tis my trait 
 To jealously guard affairs of mine. 
 I make no confidents. No, none. 
 I treat my members all the same, 
 And when from them I shall have gone 
 For 'picking' they will not me blame. 
 So, Mame, I thank you for your show 
 Of sympathy, and now must go."

 "Not yet," she said, (a smothered sigh) 
 *'Not yet, don't go and leave me thus. 
 I meant you well, you can't deny, 
 Since all around I hear this muss. 
 Yet, pardon me, if I have gone 
 Too far in all that I have said. 
 To me you shall be Bro. Stone, 
 No more, and if I have displayed 
 Aught unbecoming, I take back. 
 Pray God to give me what I lack.

 "Yet one thing you cannot control, 
 That is a lasting sympathy; 
 That, the one impulse of my soul, 
 Shall always rush incessantly, 
 Whenever you in trouble are. 
 Whenever you may need advice, 
 Whenever you are bent with care, 
 My soul, a willing sacrifice. 
 Shall live for you, shall for you live.

 He answered not, but rose to go. 
 "No, do not go; retake your seat. 
 You are not strong, 'tis true, I know ;

 Stay, you shall have a book to read. 
 I know you'll interested be.

 "Quo Vadis," as he took his seat, 
 Reached for the book she to him brought, 
 She said, "I know that it will meet 
 With your approval, for the thought 
 Is grand." And then she disappeared. 
 He soon began the leaves to turn. 
 'Twas now and then her voice he heard 
 In snatch of sacred song, but, stern 
 He drove, if came soft thoughts, away, 
 And sat and read that summer day.

 QUARTERLY MEETIISIG 
 I. 
 The Rev. Dr. Samuel Small 
 Was th^ Presiding Elder of 
 The B ]\I District. Somewhat tall, 
 Large in proportion, quite a proof 
 To the rough travel attending such 
 A District in its rural parts.- 
 A man who easily came in touch 
 With all the people, won their hearts, 
 And went among his brethren 
 As the very best of men. 
 II. 
 Quite dark, strong features, large bright eyes 
 'Neath a broad intellectual brow, 
 Which was in keeping with his size, 
 And made you in his measure 'low 
 For common sense and shrewdness full. 
 A manner quite magnetic, he 
 Could wake the dullest of the dull, 
 The gravest to a sense of glee. 
 At Brown's pronounced an orator 
 By every parishpner. 
OUARTEPLY MEETING. I tQ 
 III. 
 It was mid-summer, in July, 
 For his first ''Quarterly" he came. 
 Brown's people came from far and nigh ; 
 For quarterlies, it was their claim, 
 They made their biggest days, and so 
 The church was always crowded. Old 
 And young would never fail to go. 
 And much untruth that day was told — 
 Ah, many untruths told that day — 
 'Tis what the usual critics say. 
 IV. 
 But we have watched them at such times, 
 And heard the testimony given, 
 Poetic speeches, 'spersed with rhymes, 
 And been constrained to think that heaven, 
 Some of them had already seen, 
 And some were not so far away, 
 And some had to its borders been, — 
 For they had, oh, so much to say ! 
 And some, we thought, if they held out 
 Would enter heaven without a doubt. 
 V. 
 Then, some we've heard, but knowing them, 
 Oh, sad to hear such people talk 
 About the new Jerusalem, 
 Yet stray far from it in their walk ! 
 Such, we have often thought, were blind, 
 Or groped in darkness, failed to see, 
 What they called heaven was not the kind 
 Of place in which we hope to be. 
 From knowledge of their daily modes, 
 We've thought them bound on different roads. 
2() BROWN CHAPEL. 
 VI. 
 The Doctor's sermon might be said 
 To be a revelation quite. 
 Forsooth, the people's minds were led 
 Up to a most tremendous height. 
 If they saw heaven (some avowed 
 They did, but never stopped to tell 
 Just how it looked), they shouted loud. 
 And gave the Methodistic yell, 
 And wagged their heads and clapped their hands 
 And sung of shining silver strands. 
 VII. 
 Some swooned away, for I suppose, 
 So unaccustomed to the sight. 
 They could not stand it like to those 
 Who daily basked within its light. 
 And some got up and waltzed around 
 The little chapel. I presume 
 They thought they walked celestial ground 
 Though in the aisle 'twas hardly room. 
 But such the power of eloquence 
 Which robs a man of all his sense. 
 VIII. 
 Now, Stone had quite a different style. 
 He seldom rose at times above 
 A simple talk, all free from guile. 
 And yet such powerful truth he drove 
 Home to his hearers, they were wont 
 To feel his every word, recoil 
 Because he poured a solid front 
 Into them, causing such turmoil, 
 Till they who came to hear him preach, 
 Felt every man himself in reach. 
OUARTfiRLY MEETING. t^t 
 IX. 
 They seldom lost their heads, yet when 
 They saw the speaker disappear 
 Behind the sacred desk, 'twas then 
 They felt the more inclined to hear ; 
 Was sorry when he had sat down. 
 Their very souls would cry "Go on!" 
 For each one thought the word his own. 
 Something that he alone had done. 
 And so preached Stone ; so Bishop Payne : 
 Which of these styles the more will gain? 
 X. 
 I think somebody says, "If God 
 Is in the preaching, then all rig'ht." 
 We tread the path the Master trod, 
 And in his preaching where's the might? 
 Think you, on Mount Beatitudes, 
 He spoke unto that motley throng, 
 They heard Him in excited moods, 
 Except when being convinced of wrong, 
 They had been stabbed unto the quick. 
 And fallen over conscience strick ? 
 XL 
 And even then, now did our Lord 
 Stand up and loud His words declaim ? 
 Or sat he not while every word 
 Burned in the conscience like a flame? 
 His was the "still small voice." Go search 
 The Scriptures, read the Parables, 
 And then conclude that in the church 
 True preaching is not jingling bells. 
 Not jingling bells, however sweet 
 They sound and our approval meet. 
t^± BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XII. 
 True preaching ? Let us first convince 
 The judgment, all we say is right, 
 Is truth, though one beneath it wince ; 
 Then secondly, we must incite 
 One to perform that which he sees 
 Is duty. This is but to cause 
 His will to act. That he might please 
 His Maker, he'll no longer pause, 
 But having seen his duty, rise 
 To make a perfect sacrifice. 
 XIII. 
 Then, is a man condemned if he 
 Should be of such a nervous make 
 When preaching he excitedly 
 Should lumber, till the corners shake? 
 No, brother, if the truth he hurls 
 Straight to the mark and makes a stir, 
 Till men forsake mere rocks, seek pearls 
 O^f righteousness, live nobler. 
 Yet, if it is but empty sound. 
 For such excitement, there's no ground. 
 XIV. 
 Besides, our people need to think ; 
 To use their minds, themselves to see ; 
 At faults no longer can we wink — 
 And many a filthy fault have we. 
 Truth's searchlight must be turned upon 
 Ourselves, our public, private life. 
 This can by thought alone be done. 
 Ours is a most peculiar strife. 
 Tho' all without a mighty host, 
 We fight against ourselves the most. 
QUARtERLY MfiEtlNd. l23 
 XV. 
 These things must every pastor preach; 
 Yea, Hke the seers gray, of old, 
 Our people not forbear to teach, 
 Before them e'er the Truth to hold, 
 Then point them out a better way, 
 Show them that life is practical. 
 Religion not a great display. 
 But it is daily doing all 
 The little things which life complete: 
 This makes alone for heaven mete. 
 XVI. 
 Let every Sabbath Day unseal 
 Another roll of blessed Truth ; 
 And let God's messengers reveal 
 It not with words of man too smooth. 
 But when the vision doth appear, 
 And when the high command is given. 
 Oh, let the waiting people hear 
 The message as it comes from heaven ; 
 And should it kill and should it cure. 
 He does his duty, does no more. 
 XVII. 
 The Rev. Dr. Small had ceased. 
 The prayer chanted by the choir. 
 The chanted prayer but increased 
 The burning of the zealous fire. 
 The anthem following at last 
 Prepared them for the offering, 
 Which quite a damper o'er them cast. 
 After such mighty holloing; 
 But they, the faithful, to the table. 
 Came, and laid down what they were able. 
1^4 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XVIII. 
 And some who seldom ever came, 
 But now dressed in their very best 
 Came also up. It seemed their aim 
 Alone to show how well they dressed; 
 For hunting in their purses, gave 
 The smallest coin they could find. 
 Ah, who could faith in some folks have. 
 With all this ever on his mind ? 
 'Twere better if we never heard 
 Them in the class-room say a word. 
 XIX. 
 Ere came the service to a close. 
 In the best words at his command, 
 The Doctor smiling as he rose 
 Praised their advancement, pronounced grand 
 The building of the parsonage, 
 Their pastor who suggested it, 
 Called 'him a young man of the age, 
 (And made Stone most uneasily sit.) 
 Was confident from every sign 
 They'd prosper all along the line. 
 XX. 
 When benediction had been said 
 And he within the chancel stood, 
 O many a gracious hand was laid 
 Within his honest grasp. How good 
 His sermon was that morning, how 
 It made them feel, and all of that. 
 He'd be with them for dinner ; now, 
 If they remembered right 'twas what 
 He said when he was there before. 
 And thus they pressed him by the score.

 But, no, 'twas Hawkins he had thought; j 
 Yes, Hawkins said it surely was ; I 
 And when he had the pastor sought j 
 Who was surrounded by a mass 
 Of choir girls, they straightway went 
 With Bro. Hawkins as agreed, 
 Who' as they went was eloquent 
 In praise of Stone. There was no need, 
 The Doctor knew the pastor well. 
 Whose motto's always to excell. 
 xxn. 
 Rose, with another girl, a friend, 
 A former classmate, who had come ' 
 This year a little while to spend i 
 Vacation in this country home. 
 From city's heat, walked slow behind. 
 ''A widower, of course, you know," : 
 Said Rose, quite softly, "and now mind | 
 You girl, he wants to be my beau ! i 
 He writes, of course, occasionally, 
 And says such silly things to me. 
 XXHI. I 
 '*0f course, you'll entertain him some, 
 And that will give me little chance ; 
 With Ray. Pa fixed for him to come 
 When here last time. You see him glance 
 At me when I was in the choir 
 Just after I the solo sang? 
 Well, child, it was not my desire 
 To laugh, and I just had to hang 
 My head for I was shaking so ; 
 That look did certainly tickle tho'." 
 XXIV. 
 The friend looked at the girl. A mild 
 Reproach was on her lips. "You Rose, 
 O when will you get better, child? 
 You should not act like that. Suppose 
 He really loves you, and what then?'' 
 ''My! Love? He does not love at all. 
 He's only like the most of men 
 Who preach. A second wife to haul 
 About the country that's his aim. 
 But he won't get me, all the same." 
 XXV. 
 "Then," said her friend, "now^ wdiat about 
 The pastor ? You are surely struck 
 With him. This not a soul can doubt 
 To hear you speak. 'Tis the same luck; 
 And may be worse ; he's yet to rise. 
 And years shall pass ere he can reach 
 A paying charge, however wise 
 He be or well, perhaps, may preach ; 
 For our church has peculiar wavs 
 To try its young men nowadays." 
 XXVI. 
 "I had not thought of that," said Rose, 
 "Nor do I really know at all 
 That he loves me, yet I suppose 
 He cares a little. Not like Small, 
 He's very careful what he says, 
 And here of late avoided me. 
 Somehow I rather like his ways, 
 His quiet talk and dignity. 
 The way he treats us all. He comes 
 Just as a brother to our homes; 
QUARTERLY MEETING. 12/

 *'And yet no word suggesting ill 
 Has yet of him been said. You see 
 There are some characters you will 
 Xot help from loving, such is he." 
 "And do you know," now asked her friend, 
 That this is real or do you paint 
 Because when 'tis seen from your end 
 Of view, the man appears a saint? 
 And is it wise to love a man 
 You know not loves you ? Such a plan 
 XXVIII. 
 "Makes untold trouble in the end. 
 Your very life a wreck may be. 
 Rose, listen ; advice from your friend 
 X'ow take. Look well your way to see." 
 *'0, Dora, I know nothing; you 
 Would be like me if in my place. 
 I yet believe that he is true 
 And upright. If I have no grace 
 With him, it makes no difference. I 
 Could for him live. Yes, even die." 
 XXIX. 
 At this outburst, quiet Dora Wright 
 Looked down upon the girlish form 
 Beside her. "And, unselfish quite. 
 Your love is. Hope it brings no harm. 
 I wish that I could love as you. 
 Perhaps I would be better then. 
 To me, things have a different view, 
 I love not, am not loved by men. 
 If you do win him it must prove 
 Alone the power of pure love. 
 XXX. 
 "I trust you shall." 'Thank you so much," 
 Said Rose, as glancing up into 
 Her face. ''You can't tell how vou touch 
 Me with such words. And when from you, 
 I can hope on. Yes, I will try 
 To be less wild. I know 'tis wrong. 
 That holds him back, maybe." (A sigh.) 
 "Hereafter I will be more strong, 
 ril cease this flitting all about 
 Which holds him back, I have no doubt." 
 XXXI. 
 "Of course, that's right. You know you were 
 Too bright a girl at school to be 
 Now rushing with these young folks here. 
 There's something else in life to see. 
 Your education was far more 
 Than just to settle down at this. 
 And have you thought how many poor 
 Young girls such chance as you have, miss ? 
 Then you who have been favored, do' 
 The things the world expects of you." 
 xxxn. 
 "Ah, you should be a preacher's wife," 
 Said Rose so loud that Dora feared 
 The men had heard. "Yours is the life, 
 The nobleness that has endeared 
 You to me, makes me often long 
 To be like you, always to speak 
 As you, in all to be as strong 
 As you. But no, I'm very weak ; 
 And yet I hope to be some day 
 A little strong; do for me pray."

 *'I will," replied her friend. And then 
 They stood beside the great farm gate; 
 And now already had the men 
 Passed through. *'Now girls don't have me wait,' 
 Said Mrs. Hawkins when she met 
 Them in the hall as np the stairs 
 They went that they their hair might set 
 In shape. For women must their hair 
 Smoothe every quarter of an hour. 
 They know too well where lies their power.

 THE RUN-AWAY. 
 I. 
 'Tvvas Monday afternoon when Stone 
 In road-cart with the Rev. Small 
 Drove off to town, after they'd shown 
 Themselves in making many a call. 
 And now as on the road they chat, 
 (As only reverend brethren ca"n 
 About this matter and of that, 
 When each is every inch a man,) 
 Of what the outside world was doing. 
 The various paths men were pursuing. 
 II. 
 But first they spoke about the folks 
 On whom they'd called, and just how well 
 They lived, despite the humble walks 1 
 In which they went. 'Twas much to tell 
 Of progress since the days of thrall, 
 When for them there was not a school, 
 When ignorance hung over all ; 
 Yet with ten acres and a mule 
 Some started and in thirty years 
 Became their former masters' peers.

 "Yes, wonderful the progress made," 
 Said Small, when they a farm had passed 
 Owned by a Negro. ''Those who stayed 
 Here in the country have amassed 
 Considerable. I wish that some 
 Of those who in the city live. 
 That haven't either house or home, 
 Would take the lessons that these give. 
 This Hawkins, for an instance, he 
 Is what many of them might be. 
 IV. 
 "YouVe met the married daughter?" ''Yes," 
 Replied the younger, "Quite refined." 
 "Exceedingly, I must confess. 
 And one with quite a witty mind. 
 But Rosie, what think you of her?" 
 "I have not drawn conclusions," said 
 Quite slow, the younger minister. 
 "I really cannot say." "You've paid 
 But small attention there, I see," 
 The elder said, "from your reply." 
 V. 
 "Peihaps," asserted Stone, "'tis true. 
 One cannot always well afford 
 Too much attention upon few 
 When many need him, too." "The Lord," 
 Now held the elder, "had his friends, 
 Mary and Martha, — Lazarus." 
 "Ah, that is true, yet much depends 
 On friendship's use with one of us," 
 In quite emphatic tones said Stone. 
 '*0f course," replied the other one. 
 VI. 
 ''But since I mention her I must 
 Here say, at heart, this same, Miss Rose 
 Is one of the best girls, and just 
 Some men's ideal. I suppose 
 All men would not agree with me." 
 "No; each man has his own ideal. 
 'Tis seldom that two men may see 
 Alike, for much on how we feel 
 Depends," said Stone. There was a cough. 
 "Fie," said the other, "you are off, 
 VII. 
 "For much depends on how we see. 
 To make us feel, that is more true. 
 A woman may attractive be 
 To me, yet not at all to you; 
 For now, real beauty to be known, 
 Must first be seen. Not every one 
 Can 'see, and 'tis not always shown.

 Which could we see with natural eye, 
 And were we not inclined to strife, 
 We'd pronounced beautiful. That's why 
 We fail to feel just as we ought 
 Toward the higher nobler things. 
 We see not, and 'tis therefore nought 
 We know about them, and this brings 
 Me even to theology 
 They hate God, who God fail to see.

 "Once seen, seen as He is, 'tis love 
 That fills the bosom of our being ;

 "Thank you," said Stone, "your point is won. 
 Have it your way; I can't make void 
 Your argument." "No, Bro. Stone, 
 And your assertion is destroyed. 
 Of course I hope you will agree 
 That there is much in this young maid, 
 But only you have failed to see," 
 The Rev. Dr. slyly said. 
 "Oh, I suppose there is," said Stone, 
 With much indifference in his tone.

 "I hear," he said, "that Clay has been 
 Removed from X — and sent to B — ." 
 "Yes," said the Elder, "so I've seen. 
 He was not satisfied, you see ; - 
 And the man's family is large. 
 The work two hundred, scarce, a year. 
 I knew when first he took the charge 
 He'd not remain. In fact, I fear 
 He'll not stay at his present one 
 Unless there's something for him done." 
 XIV. 
 "What does B — pay?" "Not over three. 
 Besides, the place is most remote, 
 And Clay is young and wants to be 
 Within the city. In his boat 
 There's many another man also. 
 But country charges are the best 
 For all young clergymen to go 
 Where they may get the real test. 
 Of course for several years it's hard,

 Now what of them ? What was the line 
 By which they have been tested ? Oh, ; 
 There's some injustice in it all.

 Who tends the sheep alone for wool. 
 The shepherd's spirit is not his ; 
 For he cares nothing for the soul. 
 Since money is his main interest. 
 He seeks it where 'tis easiest."

 ''Another thing, poor charges ought 
 Be pastored by rich pastors, too, 
 And rich as well in health and thought. 
 Of course you'll say we have but few. 
 This I acknowledge, but how some'er,

 "How little it has left to meet 
 Its local debts that constant come. 
 A pastor must be most discreet, 
 For there is constantly coming some, 
 Far wiser than the rest, to ask 
 Why such and such a sum is raised; 
 And where the work is poor, a task 
 It is to do this. He's not praised 
 Too much if he has managed to 
 Raise every claim that's asked by you.

 "Suppose a man, who's well-to-do, 
 About to superanuate, 
 Should be by conference sent to 
 A charge that's poor. He need not wait 
 To have them give him what they should

 Supported. If 'twere all they could, 
 A Httle salary and supplies. 
 Well then ? They'd have a chance to grow, 
 Pay off their debts, is this not so?"

 "Well, Brother," answered Dr. Small, 
 "There are some problems, if you please, 
 Tho' we try work them, after all 
 May be concluded mysteries. 
 Just be content. Yes, be content ; 
 Put in the hands of God your cause; 
 And faithfully go where you are sent, 
 Strive to maintain the church's law^s, 
 And I predict you'll never stop 
 Until you've made the very top.'*

 "Oh, no," said Stone, "I do not fret 
 About myself. I am all right. 
 I speak for others, those who get 
 Along so badly, and who might. 
 It seems a better show^ be given, — 
 Who often have large families, — 
 These are the men I speak for. Heaven 
 Unravel soon your mysteries. 
 And let these fellows have a show, 
 Or there'll be terrible times, I know.

 "Have you not ears? Of course you hear. 
 Have you not eyes ? You surely see. 
 There's discontent, sir, everywhere. 
 The brewing of a mutiny.

 They deem past bitterness their cup ;

 Of course some man who cares no more 
 For 'little men' than for some foe 
 W^ho stood to stab him at his door. 
 Yet each quadrennial we send 
 Such fellows there. What do they do ? 
 Nothing that we might commend. 
 Elect some bishops, create some new 
 Departments, make a higher tax 
 To goad the people, now most lax. 
 XXVIII. 
 ''And every man that has the bee 
 Of bishop buzzing in his head 
 Will aim to make another See, 
 When we might now have less instead. 
 And thus to eke them out support, 
 We now must make bricks without straw, 
 When driven to the last resort, — 
 To church theatres, then the law, 
 The law, which says it ought not be — 
 What was it made another See?

 ''Well, there is much that I might say, 
 Suffice that I now say to you, ' 
 Use all your power along the way.

 By now they'd come in sight of town. 
 The tall red reservoir in sight; 
 The steeples high and smokestacks brown, 
 Now glisten in the sun's bright light. 
 The houses in among the trees ; 
 The curling smoke from chimneys tall ; 
 The smell of gas upon the breeze; 
 The winding river; and the fall 
 Of land, the buzzing and the hum, 
 Told them that near the town they'd come,

 "Straight to the depot?" ''Yes," said Small. 
 'T don't know that my horse will stand." 
 ''Just drive there, need not wait at all. 
 You will not have much time on hand." 
 And thus it was in silence thev 
 Entered the town, each occupied 
 With his own thoughts. Along the way, 
 Folks bowed to them on every side. 
 Soon to the little station came. 
 "Success," said Small, and "You the same," 
 XXXII. 
 Said Stone, and he was on his way 
 Back through the town, and Small had gone 
 To get his ticket. Three hours, and day 
 He told himself would then be done. 
 He stopped no longer than to buy 
 Some writing paper and the like; 
 And then he drove most hurriedly 
 Out of the town unto the pike. 
 A mile, a turn, and on the right 
 The little town lay out of sight.

 The road is broad, save here and there 
 A lot of sand, is very good; 
 To-day quite dusty, and the air j 
 At times is thick, especially should \ 
 He come up with a team, or let 
 Another drive before him ; then 
 His horse would uneasy get, 
 And try to run ahead. But when 
 He drove all undisturbed along 
 So far as dust there was no wrong.

 Slowly the sun sinks to the west. 
 Leaving an almost cloudless sky, I 
 Except a few with burnished crest i 
 That 'round the low horizon lie. | 
 'Twas a delightful afternoon, • | 
 Unlike the usual July, 
 But more like weather found in June, 
 When, lo, beneath a harvest sky, , 
 Men gazed upon their ripening grain. 
 That rolls in waves as doth the main. 
 xxxy. 
 The road runs through a country which 
 Is here and there marked by broad fields 
 Of golden grain which now looked rich 
 Beneath the sun. Now as stacked shields 
 Of resting army, in a row, 
 Stand fresh cut shocks, by busy men * 
 So placed, who hither, thither go - 
 All up and down the field again 
 Behind the reaper, binding, still, 
 The marvel of ingenius skill, 
 XXXVL 
 Now here a field of bowing maize 
 And there a watermelon patch ; 
 And here a field where cattle graze, 
 But now stand at the bars to watch 
 For John who with his loud halloo, 
 His old, but trusty nag astride, 
 O'er yonder hill just comes in view, 
 Galloping o'er the meadow wide ; 
 And huddled closely there's a flock 
 Of sheep near by an ancient rock. 
 XXXVII. 
 An hour has passed. The horse can make 
 Five miles an hour and five are made. 
 In dreamy mood. Stone let him take 
 His time, especially when the grade 
 Is heavy. An hour, and the sun 
 Would set, but quite a long twilight. 
 Stone did not mind ; there was but one 
 Thing he must watch. A sudden fright, 
 The horse had taken now and then. 
 But a good animal in the main. 
 XXXVIII. 
 'Twas Bro. Hawkins' horse, a steed, 
 When placed u^x^n the level road, 
 Was said to make considerable speed. 
 As his past services had showed. 
 But now Stone felt not much inclined 
 To put him on his level best. 
 In fact, now, Stone was rather kind 
 To brutes ; and thought there was much test 
 In going those ten miles and back 
 Without a break in all his track. 
THE RUN-AWAY. I43 
 XXXIX. 
 Within the west now came a glow ; 
 The clouds took on a golden crest, 
 The sun, in crimson sinking low, 
 Was leaving beautiful the west. 
 Now here, now there, familiar calls 
 Rose on the air of ''co, co, 
 Co boss, CO boss," at intervals. 
 As stretch the shadows wide and slow. 
 And now against the burnished sky 
 A flock of crows is seen to fly. 
 XL. 
 Across the road, on either side 
 The quiet wood, a squirrel is seen 
 To skip ; then sit all open-eyed. 
 Half hidden by the twigs of green, 
 Rise on his haunches to survey 
 The lonely driver in the cart ; 
 Then quickly drop and dart away 
 Into the dark with panting heart. 
 Softly as if there never was 
 A creature rushing through the grass. 
 XLI. 
 Three miles the road leads through a wood. 
 Above the dark sentinel trees ; 
 The sky is clear, and solitude 
 Reigns here. No stirring of the breeze, 
 No rustling of the leaves except 
 Here now and there, a rabbit, shy. 
 Across the shadowy road has lept 
 Just as the cart goes creaking by. 
 Of Bryant's "Thanatopsis" Stone 
 Thought as he drove along alone.

 Two things 'tis said together go, 
 Two things, and they are wed as one. 
 'Tis Love and Poetry that flow 
 By either's side until they run 
 Into each other. This is true. 
 Who ever now the subject be. 
 There have been those who never knew, 
 Or wished to know of poetry. 
 Once loving, see in simplest rhyme 
 The quality that is sublime. . 
 XLIII. 
 And those, there are, who never stopped 
 In all their life before to read 
 One bit of verse, in love, have dropped 
 Into the habit till indeed 
 They find themselves can too compose ; 
 And love-sick verse is everywhere 
 Found in their chambers, which but shows 
 We all are poets on the rare 
 Occasion of a love attack. 
 Which balances the wit we lack. 
 XLIV. 
 If Stone in love of Nature held 
 Communfon with her flowers, it was 
 Because it all had been impelled 
 By thoughts about a witching lass. 
 If he forgot to watch his course, 
 To close his eyes to all about. 
 To give the reins up to the horse. 
 There cannot be the slightest doubt, 
 The fault was due all to this maid 
 And what she had unto him sai4T 
THE RUN-AWAY. I45 
 XLV. 
 Sweet dreams of love ! Why unconcerned 
 In everything about thee man? 
 Well, dream on! Of a sudden turned 
 His horse, and snorting, stretching, ran 
 At breakneck speed right down the road ! 
 Stone awakened grabbed the reins; in vain, 
 He wxnt the faster, mettle showed, 
 Tho' Stcne held on with might and main. 
 And soon he found to his dismay. 
 The animal meant to run away. 
 XLVI. 
 He'd hold him straight within the road, 
 Thought Stone until he tired grew. 
 'Twas usually the wisest mode. 
 This rate would not keep up he knew. 
 One thing there was, two miles or more, 
 Just where the woods came to an end, 
 A high fenced field lying straight before, 
 The road came to a sudden bend. 
 To safely turn at such high speed 
 WquIcJ be a iniracle indeed. 
 XLVn. 
 Stretched out his neck, straight out his head, 
 Set back his ears, aflame his eyes, 
 With smoking nostrils, on he sped. 
 Causing the dust in clouds to rise. 
 The whirling spokes cannot be seen ; 
 The cart but like a phantom flashed 
 By oak and gum of sombre green, 
 As on along the road he dashed. 
 One seeing from the wood would swear 
 A spectre only filled the air, 
 10 
 XLVIII. 
 On ! on ! the bend is just ahead ; 
 On ! on ! 'tis faster now the flight, 
 As if the very noise he made, 
 But added terror to his fright. 
 Lines well in hand. Stone holds his course. 
 He dares not think about the end. 
 Determined but to turn the horse 
 Just as he came up to the bend, — 
 To turn him if it were that he 
 Should turn into eternity. 
 XLIX. 
 In face of danger, there is that 
 Which often makes a weak man strong. 
 If you would know it, it is what 
 Men call clear conscience, when no wrong 
 Committed stands a charge to lay, 
 And all our sins have been forgiven. 
 What though 'tis Death we meet ? the way 
 But opens unto us our heaven. 
 No fear within the breast of Stone, 
 Although his horse rushed madly on. 
 L. 
 On tore the horse. Still self-possessed, 
 Stone sat the awful doom to face. 
 He thinks of many things, his breast 
 Swells strangely as he nears the place. 
 Back from the past his whole life flashed. 
 Back the last look af mother dear, 
 Back came to him, as on he dashed. 
 His childhood and the days that were. 
 Then came a sweet young face to view, 
 One who had said, "We'll wait for you." 
THE RUN-AWAY. T47 
 LI. 
 "We'll wait for you." Her words were those 
 When they were on the porch alone. 
 That witching maid, that wild, wild Rose, 
 Who waited till her pa had gone 
 To get the horse, she stole the chance 
 To bid him back to supper come 
 W^ith such a sweet sly roguish glance. 
 He knew she waited now at home. 
 Still tighter on the reins he drew 
 And heard again "We'll wait for you." 
 LII. 
 O death is sweet when Love is born! 
 The pain of all the travail paid. 
 If but the light of Hope's glad morn. 
 What tho' one in the earth be laid ? 
 What though the heart no more may beat. 
 What though the lips may never tell 
 That love, so heavenly and sweet, 
 Oh, the incomprehensible 
 Will cast a halo o'er that love. 
 And make it far more joyous prove! 
 LIII. 
 Out of the woods. And what is that ? 
 The road, a woman's figure crossed. 
 Stone saw it as he grimly sat. 
 The bend ! — no moment must be lost. 
 He breathed a prayer, steeled his nerve, 
 Firm in the cart he braced his feet, 
 Tight held the lines. A sudden swerve, 
 He is sent flying from his seat. 
 CRASH ! — cartless speeds the horse away ! 
 A woman cries, "Oh. God, 'tis Ray !"

 May Melville stoops beside the form, 
 Which bleeding and unconscious lay. 
 Her soul is full. In deep alarm, 
 Lifting her voice, she cries "O Ray!" 
 No answer but the crimson stream. 
 That treakled down that lofty brow. 
 The shadows fall, the sun's last ^leam 
 Has vanished. Night is coming now, 
 The grass already wet with dew. 
 "Oh, God!" she cries, "what shall I do?" 
 LV. 
 As if in answer to her prayer. 
 The steps of hurried feet are heard, 
 And in the dark she listened there. 
 When soon three stalwart forms appeared, 
 Two colored and the other white. 
 "Boys, come ! For God's sake come !" she cried. 
 They come, at once take in the sight, 
 The smashed cart, form, and at its side 
 This woman, whom each of them knew, 
 And all at once, "What can we do?"

 "Ylou Charles," she to the white lad said, 
 "Go for the Doctor, quickly, please; 
 And you, John Henry, stay with Ned. 
 In yonder are some hickories ; 
 These with those shafts a litter make. 
 Quick, boys! don't stand there gaping, see?

 It is not very long before 
 A litter rude is strongly made, 
 To her it seemed an hour or more. 
 The last faint glow began to fade, 
 And darkness settled all around. 
 And damper, chillier, seemed the dew. 
 They raised the form from off the gfround. 
 ''Where shall we take him?" asked the two. 
 "Where take him?" and her voice was hoarse, 
 "\Miy, take him to my house, of course !"

 ''Come, Dora, to the kitchen; 'tis 
 An hour befrre sunset, and I 
 Will show you what giood cooking is," 
 Said Rosie. 'T have got tO' fry

 Ma's gone out calling, don't you see. 
 Of course, now I have got to show 
 My hand at cooking — laugh at me? 
 Why bless you, I'm no amateur, 
 I'm by profession, now, be sure."

 They stood there on the front porch then, 
 And looked toward the dusty pike. 
 Beyond they watched the busy men 
 Stack shocks of wdieat. ''Well as you like," 
 Said Dora, "but I laughed not at 
 Your cooking, but another thought — " 
 "Ah !" exclaimed Rosie, "I know what," 
 As by the arm her friend she caught. 
 "Yes, I expect he will be here 
 For supper, too, but never fear,

 "I think ril please his appetite; 
 Come now." And around the house they went. 
 ''John, killed the chickens? — that is right," 
 She said as John out of a tent, 
 Quite rudely made of poles and straw, 
 Came answering to her quickly, "There,'' 
 And pointed to a crock she saw 
 In the well house. ''I do declare. 
 How fat they are !" she cried when she 
 Had raised a lid the fowls to see. 
 IV. 
 Within the kitchen, blazing bright, 
 A fire now already burned. 
 A pan of rolls, already "light," 
 Was waiting. Rose the damper turned ; 
 The frying pan placed on the stove ; 
 Her sleeves rolled up, an apron on, 
 'Twas thus she stood, herself to prove 
 As good a cook as any one. 
 The kettle soon began to sing. 
 And all took on a merry ring. 
 V. 
 "There, Dora, dear, do take that chair 
 There by the door ; it is so warm 
 In here ; and it is cooler there — 
 My! how these plagued flies do sw^arm! 
 Shoo! — John! come here and bring your bush. 
 These flies are nearly taking me." 
 John came and soon began to brush. 
 "That's right ; you're good as you can be !" 
 "Your rolls should go in, ought they not?" 
 Asked Dora. "Yes, the oven's hot.

 ''John, grind the coffee; that's a man," 
 Said Rosie, ''Dora, let it be; 
 John will see to it. Johnnie can 
 Do lots of things, and will for me." 
 *'How nice," said Dora. Johnnie, proud, 
 Got down the coffee mill, and soon 
 The air is filled with notes quite loud 
 As played that instrument a time. 
 "Which pot's for coffee?" Dora, wdio 
 Could not. sit there and nothing do, 
 VII. 
 Asked as she from the dresser took 
 Two agate vessels. "That's the one," 
 Said Rosie, with a hurried look. 
 As from the pan, so crisp arrd brown. 
 She forked some chicken, all the while 
 Her mind was on one certain guest. 
 In vain, she could not hide the smile, 
 Though trying with her level best. 
 "He likes the 'pope's nose,' too," she said 
 All to herself. Alas, poor maid! 
 vni. 
 She little knew the meal prepared, 
 Would not be seen by him that night; 
 She little knew just how he fared 
 That very moment. With delight 
 In that hot kitchen now she stands 
 And bravely bends o'er that hot stove. 
 She scalds her arms and burns her hands 
 But minds it not because of love; 
 Love, which she dares not think returned — 
 Her arms are scald'd, her hands are burned.

 The sun is nearly out of sight. 
 " 'Twill not be long," herself she told, 
 "Ere he will come." The blazing light 
 Now filled the west with brightest gold. 
 "How beautiful," said Dora, who 
 Was standing at the kitchen door. 
 "Were I an artist, such a view 
 As this I'd paint. And yet 'tis more 
 Than any artist well can catch. 
 But I can only stand and watch." 
 X. 
 "Yes," Rosie said between her turns 
 About the room, "when such I see, 
 There is a fire within me burns. 
 Something, it seems a mystery, 
 A hungering to be out, away 
 Into the flaming of the light. 
 To follow it; I cannot say 
 Just what, but I have stood till night 
 Has banished every crimson hue. 
 And all the sky was bright and blue. 
 XI. 
 "What is it, Dora, can you tell?" 
 " 'Tis the poetic of your soul. 
 We all possess it, and 'tis well 
 That we should keep it in control, 
 Or we, I think, would grow insane. 
 Yet it is good, yet very good. 
 All feel it more or less, 'tis plain, 
 And 'tis the very happiest mood, — 
 This love that's for the beautiful. 
 All else in life is very dull."

 ''O Dora, were I half as wise 
 As you I should be so content." 
 ''No, child, for wisdom aims to rise;

 I stand with one small string of fish. 
 And others have ;so many strings ; 
 And theirs so large and mine so small,

 "You are too modest, Dora. That, 
 However, shows your wisdom, girl.

 I never saw you in a whirl, 
 I never saw you lose your head.

 Or said what you should not have said. 
 Or do one thing you ought not do. 
 Now, such a person, in my eyes 
 Is what I am convinced is wise,"

 "Yes, far as observation goes," 
 Replied her friend, "you may be right. 
 But don't you know, my dearest Rose, 
 There is a lot not in your sight. 
 You cannot see my mind, nor know 
 Just all I am ; you only see

 But that is not beholding mc.

 Rose took the rolls from out the stove. 
 "Ah, well, I do not understand. 
 That person's wise who seems to prove 
 To all the sense I can command. 
 Of course I may short-sighted be, 
 And cannot see it just as you. 
 Not learned in philosophy. 
 Nor do I know that it is true, 
 That what appears may not be real ; 
 This much, at least, you're my ideal !"

 "I thank you very much for that. 
 One thing, simplicity, I see. 
 You lack not. Truly this is what

 Within the barnyard from the field 
 The farmer and an elder son 
 Are feeding cattle. Half concealed 
 Behind the rick sat milking, John, 
 Who when he got his coffee ground. 
 Had stolen from the kitchen, and, 
 On seeing much to do around 
 The place, himself threw in a hand 
 By bringing up the cows, and now 
 Sat carefully milking cow after cow. 
 XX. 
 'Tather!" cried Charles Hawkins, "look!" 
 And pointed to the public gate. 
 'Twas but a glance the father took. 
 There stood a horse, which seemed to wait 
 For one to open. "Is it Jack?" 
 The farmer questioned, as he strode 
 Toward the gate. The handsome black. 
 All trembling, stood out in the road, 
 With only shreds of harness on. 
 "What has become of Rev. Stone?" 
THE TWILIGHT-SEARCH. 1 57 
 xXi. 
 The farmer murmured, drawing back 
 The gate to let the animal in. 
 It yet was frightened. "Whoa, Jack !" 
 He coaxed. He w^ould not make a scene. 
 He caught the bridle, yet intact, 
 And led him back toward the barn. 
 The girls he'd try not to attract, 
 And was about his sons to warn, 
 When from the house Rose came along, 
 "O, papa! papa! what is wrong?" 
 XXII. 
 She cried when she beheld the horse 
 With the torn harness and no cart. 
 Too well she knew the matter, — worse, 
 There was a jerking at her heart. 
 "Speak, papa! Where is Rev. Stone?'* 
 The father answered not a word 
 But gave the animal to his son. 
 Then started for the road. He heard 
 His daughter screaming "Let me go 
 And find him !" Dora's gentle, "No." 
 XXIII. 
 And down the road upon a run 
 He went that he might find a trace. 
 The night was on him, for the sun 
 Sometime had set. And now his pace 
 He quickens every moment, though 
 His limbs were aching, full of pain. 
 That day he'd shocked row after row 
 Within his field of golden grain. 
 And yet in the dim twilight, on 
 P^ rushed to fine} same trace of Stpn^. * 
 XXIV. 
 'Tis here and there he can discern 
 Some parts of traces or of rein. 
 Then on he staggers, here a turn 
 And there, he stops, he looks again, 
 He staggers on. And now the night 
 Is fully on him, but above. 
 The stars are sending down their light 
 To guide him in his quest of love. 
 The fire-flies with their greenish flare 
 Are all about him in the air. 
 XXV. 
 He hears the owl hoot — hoo ! hoo ! — 
 The bats fly zig-zag o'er his head. 
 It seems a million demons, too. 
 Run with him croaking, "He is dead ! 
 Dead, dead, and yonder lies." 
 And now in every foot of space, 
 In staggering on he strains his eyes ; 
 But nothing sees in any place. 
 Amidst the frogs incessant croak, 
 ''You zvill not -find him," something spoke. 
 XXVI. 
 He was not superstitious, but 
 The air seemed haunted all about. 
 He scarce knew where he placed his foot. 
 Hark ! He thought he heard a shout. 
 'Twas but imagination, sure. 
 Ay, what was that off to the right ? 
 Some pile of brushwood, nothing more. 
 Look yonder in the woods a light, — 
 Ah, yes, but 'tis that ghoistly lamp 
 Which usually glides about the swamp. 
THE TWILIGHT-SEARCH. 159 
 XXVII. 
 That road which he had oft before 
 Gone over, seemed so strange to-night. 
 For every bend had now in store^ 
 It seemed, an object to affright. 
 A long-eared animal like a dog 
 Ten feet away as he went on 
 Sat crouching on an ancient log, 
 Sprang up, snarled fiercely, and was gone. 
 But now at last with beating heart, 
 He comes where lies the broken cart. 
 XXVIII. 
 'Twas dark, he could not make all out; 
 The merest outline could but see. 
 As best he could he searched about. 
 No signs of Stone there seemed to be. 
 He'd shout, he'd make a noise, he might 
 Have simply fallen further down; 
 Had not been hurt, but was all right. 
 Or, maybe, all occurred in town. 
 And Stone e'en now was on his way, 
 Somebody bringing him. To say 
 XXIX. 
 These things at once came to him, no; 
 But there about the broken cart. 
 More quiet now, it was that slow 
 These things came to him. And his heart 
 More hopeful now, his voice rang out, 
 ''Hello-o-o !" Back upon the night, 
 He almost thought another shout, 
 ''Hello-o-o!" rang; but very slight. 
 'Twas but his echo, something said — 
 No, 'twas another voice instead. 
l6o BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XXX. 
 *'Hello-o-o !" now again he bawled, 
 This time far louder than before. 
 "Hello-o-o !" back somebody called. 
 'Twas some one else he now was sure. 
 "Who is that calling?" some one cried; 
 And now it was he knew the tone. 
 " 'Tis me, Melville," he then replied. 
 "Know what's become of Rev. Stone?" 
 And Melville from the woods soon drew 
 In sight. Ah yes, too well he knew. 
 XXXI. 
 "Come to the house," he turned and said, 
 "It can't be fatal is it, Mel?" 
 Don't know," he answered, as he led 
 The way, "the doctor would not tell. 
 He's still unconscious, you may know- 
 It's very 'serious accident. 
 It certainly seems an awful blow 
 Upon the head. He's hardly spent 
 Three months with us," and here a choke 
 Rose in his throat. No more he spoke. 
 XXXII. 
 And as he walked the father thought 
 Of that young voice, "O, let me go 
 And find him !" Ay, all night he'd sought 
 That he the very truth might know 
 Rather than back to her have gone 
 And said he could not find a trace. 
 No, no, though tired had gone on. 
 And hunted, yes, in every place 
 That he might satisfy the child 
 fie lovecl, despite her being wild.

 Canto XIII. 
 THE VISION. 
 I. 
 *Twas early morning and the sun 
 Played on the bright green papered wall 
 Through slatted shutters ; one by one 
 The many rays danced over all ; 
 A picture of the Last Supper hung 
 Just opposite the white iron bed ; 
 A vase of flowers was among 
 A lot of bottles at the head ; 
 When Stone awoke in 'wildered mind 
 Himself within this room to find. 
 11. 
 A stiffness in his side, a pain 
 About his head. Though somewhat blurred, 
 'Tis now that he recalls again 
 The accident that had occurred. 
 His head is bandaged, and also 
 His right arm seemed severely sprained. 
 And here he lay, he did not know 
 Just where, but that he ached and pained 
 All over. Then he tried to turn. 
 His brow began to throb and burn. 
 II 
1 62 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 III. 
 Where was he, and who brought him there? 
 What gentle hands had placed those flowers? 
 Why did the sun's bright rays appear 
 To dance about the room ? What powers 
 Those figures in the picture had ! 
 They all were moving up and down. 
 This he was sure : he was not mad — 
 Sure as he was his eyes his own — 
 Yet e'en the flowers in the vase 
 Were not inclined to keep their place. 
 IV. 
 In fact the whole room seemed to toss 
 Since he had tried to turn a bit. 
 The rocker seemed to m.ove across 
 The floor, yet no one moving it. 
 The door was bobbing to and fro ; 
 The printed figures on the wall 
 Were bowing to the sunbeams now 
 And yonder wardrobe, grim and tall, 
 Was swaying every moment like 
 The mantlepiece it soon would strike. 
 V. 
 A laugh he scarcely could control, 
 Though either added to his pain. 
 He felt the bed most graceful roll 
 Across the floor and back again. 
 The whole thing seemed so ludicrous 
 That he could not refrain a smile. 
 He could not tell what made it thus, 
 But he enjoyed it all the while. 
 And thus it was for hours he lay 
 Till all began to fade away. 
 J 
THE VISION. 163 
 VI. 
 And so he slept. When he awoke 
 Mame Melville in the rocking chair 
 Sat sewing. But he never spoke , 
 Just lay and gazed upon her there. 
 She did not seem to know that he 
 Was now awake. Intent upon 
 Her sewing, she sat silently 
 That hour beneath the gaze of Stone. 
 And he felt so comfortable 
 He did not wish to break the spell. 
 vn. 
 'Tis all a dreani. The woman there 
 Is no real woman, surely not. 
 He's dreaming. See, her face is fair, 
 And he lies in a heavenly spot. 
 The counterpane is w^hite as snow. 
 The walls are of a magic cast ; 
 Just where he w^as he did not know, 
 Not- cared, just so the spell would last. 
 The woman in that snow-white gown 
 Was one that he had never known. 
 VIII. 
 To him the woman in the gown 
 Was not Mame Melville sitting there. 
 Despite her smooth skin's lightish brown ; 
 Despite the full dark suit of hair; 
 Despite the quiet, earnest face ; 
 The neck and shoulders' gentle curve ; 
 The heaving bosom's tapering grace: 
 'Twas not Mame Melville come to serve 
 'Twas not the petite form of Rose 
 Who in that rocker quietly sew^s. • 
 IX. 
 Stitch after stitch, stitch after stitch, 
 Her well-shaped hand doth sweep the air. 
 As same as clock work ; without hitch, 
 Her needle works the cotton there. 
 Comes from without the hum of bees; 
 For now the day is bright and warm. 
 And yonder in the apple trees 
 From early morn till eve they swarm. 
 So comes into this room the sound 
 Which throws a dreamy spell around. 
 X. 
 And thus in semi-conscious state 
 For three whole days the sufferer lay. 
 From early morn till very late,, 
 \\'as in that rocker seated. May. 
 He does not know just who she is. 
 He feels a soft hand on his brow, 
 A gentle voice oft says, ''Take this 
 And it will make you better now." 
 A woman's lips once pressed his own 
 But, oh, the woman seemed unknown. 
 XL 
 Sometimes folks crowded in the room, 
 He wondered why they seemed so sad. 
 And once a sweet small form had come 
 And stood beside his bed, and had 
 Soft pressed his brow, while from her eyes 
 Great tears were creeping. But he knew 
 Not who she was, though with deep sighs. 
 Her from the bed another drew. 
 And then it all grew dark and he 
 Reached out, but ah, could no one see. 
THE VISION. 165 
 XIL 
 Reached out, and reaching out stood on 
 A high and rocky precipice. 
 The room in which he lay had gone ; 
 Up from a chasm doth arise 
 A cloud of smoke as well as blaze. 
 Behind him was a towering wall 
 Of rocks that rose in mist and haze. 
 And that'on which he stood as small, 
 And sharp, and pointed as 'twas steep; 
 The smoking chasm wide and deep. 
 XIII. 
 Beyond, another ledge there was, 
 On which another figure stood, 
 A fair, a beautiful young lass. 
 And just behind her was a wood, 
 A quiet pleasant spot to rest, 
 A cottage white that stood within. 
 She was thin robed, and bared her breast. 
 She pointed to the grove, so green. 
 And cried across the chasm deep, 
 'T wait for you, come quickly — leap!" 
 XIV. 
 The smoke that from the chasm rose, 
 Oft shut her lovely form from view; 
 In curling wreathes would round her close. 
 Then circle off in airy blue. 
 Still beckoned she to him, and cried, 
 ''The cot is ready, come, O come!" 
 "I can't," he called. ''The chasm's wide. 
 The fire rages^ get thee home. 
 I cannot come; I dare not leap; 
 The chasm's wide, the chasm's deep." 
l'^*^^ BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XV. 
 'Tear not," she cried, "the way is clear; 
 Thou wilt not in the chasm fall. 
 Even the rising smoke will bear 
 Thee up; thou wilt not sink at all. 
 Be not faint-hearted, come away. 
 A cot doth ready stand for thee; 
 A breast where on thy head to lay, 
 Doth rise to share thy company. 
 Leap ! leap ! that dreary cliff desert, 
 And join thee with a loving heart!" 
 XVI. 
 Enough, he saw that pleading gaze. 
 He caught the light within those eyes ; 
 And now, despite the smoke and blaze, 
 He leaps, leaps out, begins to rise, 
 Then fall upon thin clouds of smoke. 
 The vision fades, the chasm's gloom, — 
 And springing up in bed, awoke, 
 To find himself within the room, 
 Where Mame Melville with startled cry, 
 Sprang up from rocker sitting by. 
 xvn. 
 First like a frightened fawn she stands. 
 Her lovely arms above her head ; 
 And he with bandaged brow and hands, 
 Is sitting up within the bed. 
 Into each other's eyes they gaze, 
 While in Stone's mind the dream, still clear, 
 He saw the smoke, the fire blaze. 
 Felt how he leaped into the air, . 
 The woman on the other side. 
 And back to him 'twas still she cried, 
 I 
The vision. 167 
 XVIII. 
 ''Leap, leap!" and when he dared to leap, 
 When he had dared with her to be, 
 He had awakened from his sleep, 
 Mame Melville at his bed to see. 
 "Mame." That was all he said. Suffice, 
 She dropped her hands, came quick beside 
 The bed. No need to call her twice. 
 ''O Ray ! O Ray !" she fell and cried. 
 Her head there on the counterpane. 
 He stroked her hair despite his sprain. 
 XIX. 
 He stroked her hair as there she knelt. 
 Just as a father would a child. 
 Oh, happiness ! what bliss she felt ! 
 What passion stirred her bosom wild ! 
 How she had sat and longed for this. 
 That she might be the first to hear 
 His voice, and lo, her name, O bliss! 
 His voice, in softness sweet and clear, 
 Had called her name, her old pet name. 
 As in the former years, his "Mame." 
 XX. 
 And thus he asked : ''Where am I, Mame ?' 
 So gentle was his voice, and sweet. 
 When she had heard him breathe her name. 
 She raised her head his eyes to meet, 
 "You are with me at my house, Ray. 
 We brought you here some nights ago. 
 And 'Mel' has not been long away. 
 I came to sit by you, you know. 
 But when you rose so suddenly 
 You frightened, greatly frightened me." 
I^'H feROWN CHAPEL. 
 XXI. 
 He smiled and lay back in the bed. 
 I didn't mean to frighten you." 
 *'Of course," in covering him she said, 
 And I was very foolish, too. 
 But you are weak, you must take care 
 And spring not up that way again — 
 My ! Ray, you gave me such a scare ! 
 Tell me was it .some sudden pain?" 
 "No, no, it was a dream, that's all. 
 I thought I was about to fall." 
 XXII. 
 "Yes, yes, poor boy, it was severe," 
 (She spoke about the accident.) 
 "I found you there and brought you here, 
 A young man for the doctor -sent." 
 "You, then, it was that crossed the road?" 
 (About the dream no more he spoke.) 
 "To you, dear child, my life is owed," 
 He said as soon as he awoke 
 To all that had occurred that night. 
 The woman that had stood in sight. 
 XXIII. 
 "I tried to stop him, Ray. I tried 
 To wave my hand ; of course, you know 
 He came so fast I stood aside. 
 He swerved, you fell, and then that blow.' 
 Upon his brow she gently pressed 
 That long and slender shapely hand. 
 Her touch a magic stroke possessed ; 
 And this she seemed to understand, 
 For smiling, she continued to 
 Smooth his hot face. Yes, yes, she knew. 
tH£ VISIOI^. 169 
 XXIV. 
 He closed his eyes a moment now. 
 He felt at rest despite his pain. 
 Then caught the hand that smoothed his brow 
 And kissed it o'er and o'er again. 
 His eyes are filling fast with tears, 
 His breast, in strong convulsions, swelled. 
 And she for once his passion bears, 
 When she those flooding tears beheld. 
 Why not? Could it be sin to let 
 Herself and him for once forget? 
 XXV. 
 For once forget, when many years 
 Had robbed her of her coveted joy? 
 She happy felt to see those tears, 
 'Twas Ray once more, her long lost boy. 
 She felt the beating of his heart. 
 She thought he heard her's throbbing, too. 
 That moment, nothing then should part 
 Her from him; this with joy she knew 
 She does not draw herself away. 
 But sat there by him, this was Ray. 
 XXVI. 
 Judge her not wrongly. Reader, no, 
 I bid you think of neither wrong: 
 Their characters I yet must show 
 Within the measure of this song. 
 She sat, 'tis true, another's wife. 
 She at a former lover's bed. 
 And yet most hard had been her life, 
 Her love for all but him was dead. 
 True love can never, never die. 
 Though smothering for long years it lie.

 XXVII. 
 Across the bar we dare not run 
 Our vessels in such seas as this, 
 And yet to drive our barks upon 
 Such surging billows, what a bliss ! 
 Tho' dangerous we know 'twill bt. 
 And much we court an awful wreck, 
 Despite the raging of the sea, 
 We would not give our course a check, 
 Until plunged deep into the trough. 
 We find too late we have enough ! 
 XXVIII. 
 Was this to be Mame's Waterloo? 
 Shall she throw prudence to the wind 
 When all the consequence she knew? 
 Ah, love, when long imprisoned, is blind. 
 Ah, when two hearts are kept apart, 
 When there's the arrow e'er to pierce, 
 When there's Fate's rancor e'er to smart/ 
 To make the passions e'en more fierce. 
 When once united are, those two 
 Will almost any folly do. 
 XXIX. 
 She does not draw from him a\vay, 
 But there upon his bed she sat ; 
 She was his Mame, he was her Ray 
 For once ; she made the most of that. 
 For once, she'd dream life's happy dream, 
 For once, she'd feel the happy thrill. 
 What if ''things are not wdiat they seem?" 
 Could she not love and serve him still. 
 She told herself, one hour she'd sit 
 And let the moments heedless flit.

 Canto XIV. 
 THE VISITORS. 
 I. 
 One August afternoon when hot 
 The sun beat down upon the earth, 
 And there was scarce a pleasant spot ; 
 The air was dry, the water dearth ; 
 The corn was burning 'neath the heat. 
 The once fresh blades had, drooping, lain ; 
 The cracking earth w^as baked complete; 
 And every soul was crying rain, 
 Near by the cottage, 'neath a tree. 
 Sat Stone in Melville's company. 
 II. 
 The 'spot in which he sat was strewn 
 With papers, telling him the news, 
 Which he had read the whole forenoon, 
 And after dinner, Melville, whose 
 Devotion led him to remain 
 From work, now chats with him awhile. 
 About his place, about his grain. 
 About the quality of soil ; 
 Of everything he talks, in fact 
 In order that he might attract 
1?2 6R0WN CHAPEL. 
 III. 
 Stone's mind from off his work, which had 
 Been worrying him incessantly. 
 There was no cause for feeling bad, 
 For all went well 'twas plain to see. 
 Brown Chapel people, it was said. 
 Stuck by the church far more than e'er, 
 Despite the great attraction made 
 By big camp meetings far and near. 
 'Twas seldom that they missed the Wye. 
 This year it seemed they kept close by 
 IV. 
 Camp meeting. Reader, have you been 
 To one, a real camp meeting, say, 
 With tents and pulpit 'neath the green 
 Tall spreading trees in great 'display? 
 With long rough planks for benches placed 
 On driven stakes into the ground, 
 Twelve inches high, so as you faced 
 The stand, from which in thundering sound, 
 Some strong-lunged messenger would tell 
 How man was perfect, how he fell? 
 V. 
 Have you not seen the motly crowd 
 That never has been known to miss 
 These meetings? Some with voices loud 
 To shout of one eternal bliss. 
 And others just to meet with friends. 
 And some alone for selfish gain. 
 And yet whatever be their ends, 
 They seldom from the place remain, 
 But come in thousands far and near 
 That they might have a good time here? 
THE VISITORS. 173 
 VI. 
 Brown Chapel had its annual camp, 
 But this was usually later on, 
 When days were hot, nights cool and damp. 
 Their only reason was this one :— 
 Then all the camps ten miles or more 
 That could at all attraction be, 
 By such a time would then be o'er. 
 And they would have more people, see? 
 And thus they argued, having more. 
 The revenue would be quite sure. 
 VII. 
 Of course 'twas not the revenue 
 For which alone the camp was held. 
 'Twas for a spiritual purpose, too ; 
 But, all declared, they were compelled 
 To gather finances also; 
 And this was but the proper time, 
 Since folks would to camp meetings go, 
 'Twas reasoned that a half a dime 
 Paid at the gate would be no harm, 
 Nor take away religion's charm. 
 VIII. 
 Stone had heard all of this before 
 He had met with his accident. 
 And now that he was up once more, 
 It was no little worriment. 
 'Twas early August, still the days 
 Were slipping quietly along; 
 And yet he here at Melville's stays 
 Because, 'twas said, he was not strong 
 Enough to do his work just yet. 
 Of course, he had some cause to fret. 
 IX. 
 For that was natural, of course. 
 He ought to feel an interest in 
 All of his work. He had that force 
 Of character which worked to win. 
 He felt when absent from the place 
 Of battle, there could never be, 
 Without his own encouraging face. 
 For him a glorious victory. 
 Thus Stone tho' talking with Melville, 
 Was thinking of his church work still. 
 X. 
 The building of the cottage, how 
 Was work progressing? And to him, 
 'Twas said, they were on the inside now. 
 That very day begun to trim, ' 
 And everything looked excellent. 
 The house thus far attractive stood. 
 May ispoke of hours to be spent 
 Next summer in the quiet wood. 
 In fact she so poetic got. 
 She made an Eden of the spot. 
 XI. 
 The brethren for official board 
 Now met him there since well enough. 
 'Twas funny how they used each word. 
 For fear they were considered rough 
 By Mame, whom they with reverence 
 Respected, tried their best to act 
 As men full of good common sense, 
 And made each utterance exact. 
 Whether reporting of the class, 
 Or something they had wish to pass. 
THE VISITORS. I75 
 XII. 
 These informed their pastor, they 
 Were carrying his instructions out; 
 Had good turnouts each Sabbath Day ; 
 And he should have no cause to doubt 
 The safety of the work, so long 
 As they had health and strength to be 
 About the place; there'd be no wrong 
 To happen to it. They were free 
 To say the church stood by them more 
 Than it had ever done before. 
 XIII. 
 And all they felt was rightly due 
 To his own presence, them among. 
 They saw it in every service, too ; 
 The hymns they found were better sung 
 Dues were kept up more than before ; 
 More strict attendance to the class; 
 And members loved each other more ; 
 Less cider drinking seemed to pass 
 Among them. They could readily see 
 The marks of spirituality. 
 XIV. 
 These things were certainly pleasing to 
 The pastor. Yet he longed to be 
 Where he could something better do 
 Than sit and read beneath a tree. 
 To make his visits as he had, 
 Among their homes to sit and talk 
 Of Christ, till he and they were glad. 
 He longed for now his daily walk 
 From house to house on goodness bent, 
 In that, God's willing instrument. 
 XV. 
 The camp, they told him if he made 
 Committees, would go on the same ; 
 And thus accepting of their aid, 
 Committees felt compelled to name, 
 And these, from what he constant heard, 
 Performed their duty, to a man. 
 Did as directed, to a word, 
 According to the pastor's plan. 
 And now he had alone on hand 
 The preachers who would fill the stand. 
 XVI. 
 May acted secretary to 
 Him, and wrote each letter he 
 Desired to be written. So 
 He sent his fellow ministry 
 The invitations thus to fill 
 On such a day and such a date. 
 But some he had not heard from. Still 
 He felt that it was not too late, 
 And hoped by then if possible. 
 Himself to be full strong and well. 
 xvn. 
 May was this moment fast asleep, 
 A custom of the people here, 
 Just after dinner, which to keep 
 In all warm places, 'tis quite clear, 
 Would be a very goodly rule, 
 And one these people seldom break. 
 *Tis only when it gets quite cool 
 The people in such places wake. 
 And all refreshed, can do the more, 
 For hours given to sleep before. 
THE VISITORS. ' 1 77 
 XVIII. 
 This does not now apply to men, 
 Tho' men might take the dinner hour 
 To sleep a little while, and then 
 Arise, 'tis said with better power 
 To go about their w^ork beneath 
 The scorching sun, whate'er it be, 
 When one is longing for a breath 
 Of pleasant breeze most anxiously. 
 Which comes sometimes, tho' these are few, 
 Some where about the hour of two. 
 XIX. 
 ''Your yield was wdiat, you said this year?" 
 "Six hundred bushels, sir, I guess. 
 Somewhat increased, despite my fear. 
 Last year I had considerably less." 
 "What will you do w^ith it?" asked Stone. 
 "Oh, sell it, 'cepting that I use," 
 Said Melville. "I shall wait upon 
 The market — ^by the way, what news 
 The papers give of them to-day? 
 Please look and see just what they say." 
 XX. 
 Stone took a paper, at his feet, . 
 And scanned the columns steadily. 
 "Well, I declare!" up from his seat 
 Sprang Melville, "Now w^ho can they be?" 
 Stone dropped the paper, turned to look 
 Toward the gate. And down the drive 
 Two persons came. He slightly shook 
 From nervousness. Arose to give 
 Himself a better sight, and there 
 He made out now just who they were. 
 12 
 XXI. 
 "Now don't you know them, Bro. IMel?" 
 He asked. ''I don't believe I do. 
 If you will be so kind to tell 
 Me who they are, then I'll tell you." 
 "Why, you have seen them both before. 
 And one of them you ought to know." 
 He looked again. ''Well, I'm not sure, 
 The short one walks like Rose, altho' 
 The sun somewhat confuses me, 
 I never could a distance see." 
 XXII. 
 "That is Miss Rosie and her friend 
 Who's with her from the city. I 
 Must get my coat, I can't pretend 
 To meet them in this fix." Vet fly 
 Into the house he could not. Stood 
 And watched them coming nearer still. 
 "Oh, bother, Reverend, this is good 
 Enough to meet them," said Melville. 
 "Don't think of coat, the weather's warm. 
 And there's yet danger to your arm." 
 XXIII. 
 He felt his hair. "Oh, that's all right," 
 Said Melville, "nothing wrong with you; 
 And 'tis not well when in their sight 
 To run; see, I am shabby, too." 
 "Ah well," said Stone, "my ground I'll stand/ 
 And as the ladies now drew near 
 He forward stepped with outstretched hand. 
 And in a voice of right good cheer, 
 Said, "Glad to see you, ladies, come 
 And share my temporary home." 
THE VISITORS. 1 79 
 XXIV. 
 They came all smiles. Rose gently pressed 
 His hand and anxious looked into 
 His face. He saw her throbbing breast, 
 But turning to fair Dora, who 
 Came smiling forward, had her meet 
 His host, who tho' despite his boast, 
 Because he was not looking neat. 
 Felt hardly fit to stand as host, 
 Held out his horny hand to take 
 The lady's, giving quite a shake. 
 XXV. 
 He soon had brought them each a seat. 
 As they preferred the pleasant shade. 
 '*Ah," said Miss Wright, ''what a retreat!" 
 And down upon the grass she laid 
 Her great sun hat. ''Oh what a life!" 
 Stone smiled. "Y|bu like it, then, I see." 
 *T would prefer it to the strife 
 One finds in town society." 
 She gave her head a pretty jerk. 
 'Tn town there's too much rush and work." 
 XXVI. 
 Now, feeling too much out of place, 
 Despite the advice given Stone, 
 Melville excused himself with grace. 
 And left the pastor there alone. 
 Straight to the house he went and crept 
 Up stairs to where Manie sleeping lay. 
 He ne'er disturbed her while she slept. 
 But he must break the rule to-day. 
 He called her gently ; she awoke, 
 And then he told her of the folk. 
l80 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XXVII. 
 It was yet warm, but she would try 
 If possiSle to look her best, 
 And she looked o'er quite hurriedly 
 The many pretty gowns possessed. 
 Mel. would go for Aunt Tildy Payne, 
 Who would get supper for her, so 
 She'd have the time to entertain. 
 And thus at once she had him go, 
 While she before the glass arranged 
 Herself till she'd completely changed. 
 XXVIII. 
 Robed in a muslin gown, her hair 
 Thrown up, all dazzling with pins, 
 Light slippered, sauntered down the stair; 
 With a sweet look that ever wins, 
 She lightly crossed the sward where sat 
 The three beneath the sycamore, 
 Engaged now in a lively chat 
 About the scenes of Eastern Shore. 
 With bow most gracious, ''How dye do?" 
 (Now seated.) "Warm enough for you?" 
 XXIX. 
 ''O yes," (to Stone) "I've met Miss Wright. 
 Am glad also to have you call. 
 You find it warm?" (to Dora.) "Quite. 
 We didn't mind it, tho', at all." 
 "Love walking?" "Yes, good exercise. 
 It is my only medicine." 
 "I see," said Mame, "and very wise; 
 I only wish that it were mine." 
 "Doctors and I seldom agree," 
 Said Dora, "Exercise for me."

 XXX. 
 And thus they chatted. Dora Wright 
 Began at once to fall in love 
 With Mary Melville, whose delight 
 Was such as Dora seemed to prove. 
 And so absorbed in talk became, 
 No notice gave to Rose and Stone, — 
 A little stratagem which Mame 
 Thought that she managed all alone, 
 When Dora had herself conspired 
 To do just what poor Mame desired. 
 XXXI. 
 "You suffered so, I know," said Rose 
 In the most sympathetic tone. 
 "Just how I felt, nobody knows, 
 I came to see you, Rev. Stone." 
 "You came to see me, tell me when, 
 It seems I don't recall at all." 
 "Of course not, you were in such pain 
 And fever, you cannot recall. 
 They took me from you, tho' I could 
 Beside your bed all day have stood." 
 XXXII. 
 "Somehow," he said, " 'tis like a dream. 
 I do recall you coming here, 
 And now that you have spoken, seem 
 To bring back something else, — 'tis clear !" 
 He istopped, he looked upon her now. 
 She was the maiden he had seen 
 In that strange vi'sion, which some how 
 Had forgotten by him been. 
 "O/li, tell me, what is clear," she said. 
 He smiled and simply shook his head.

 "Don't be contrary, Rev. Stone, 
 For you have been too sick, you know/' 
 She whispered in a pleading tone, 
 ''Do tell me, do not treat me so. 
 \Miat is it clear?" He shook his head. 
 'Terhaps Til tell you all some day, 
 But now, I dare not, I am afraid, 
 And do not urge me now, I pray." 
 He was so earnest in his plea. 
 She felt she ought to let it be. 
 XXXIV. 
 ''Please pardon me. I am so rude; ' 
 It seems I have such little sense." 
 "There, there, 'tis only that you should 
 Desire me to tell you, hence 
 Your spirit; think of it no more; 
 I am too glad to have you here. 
 Instead of having you fret o'er 
 One single thing. It's been so drear 
 Away from church and all of you, 
 I've hardly known just what to do." 
 XXXV. 
 "You miss us then ?" "W' hy certainly, 
 How could one help from missing you?' 
 She smiled, "But really missed you me? 
 Me, little Rose? now tell me true." 
 "I missed you all, why further press 
 For that which you well know I feel, 
 You rogue? but I will not confess 
 That which I think best to conceal." 
 "Poor one you are, in that," she cried, 
 *' 'Tis in your very words implied." 
THE VISITORS. 183 
 XXXVI. 
 He looked all ruffled. '^Did I say 
 I missed you ? Well, I do declare, 
 In roles like this, I must display 
 My ignorance. You are not fair — " 
 ''Therefore not false," she laughing said. 
 " 'You're fair but you're false,' so goes the song.'' 
 "You've a lot of nonsense in your head." 
 ''Nay, it is simply on my tongue." 
 He smiled to see how quick she was, 
 And felt himself drawn to the lass. 
 XXXVII. 
 As long as they sat bantering. 
 No serious talk could occupy. 
 'Twas true, both thought of many a thing, 
 They fain had said, but passed it by. 
 But passed it by, but to recall 
 Some other time they knew not when. 
 Thus drew a curtain over all. 
 And covered it — "What might have been." 
 Enough, just now to be together, 
 Why test the feelings of each other? 
 XXXVIII. 
 Yet, some how, both felt satisfied 
 That soul had found its other soul ; 
 Each felt while seated side by side 
 Their two lives made a single whole; 
 Yet neither told the other so, 
 And yet each knew the other knew. 
 There was glow answering to glow, 
 And each in spirit closer drew 
 Together, though they sat apart. 
 Heart answered to the other heart.

 THE CAMP MEETING. 
 I. 
 September, and has come the day 
 When all the country spread around 
 Shall to Brow n Chapel wend their way 
 To gather on the camping ground. 
 Nor better weather could they have. 
 The dawn looked o'er the sleeping earth, 
 The eastern sky its roses gave, 
 And soon athwart the field leaped forth 
 The golden harbingers of light 
 As rose the mighty king in sight. 
 II. 
 O'er marsh and meadow vapory sheen 
 Began to rise and melt away, 
 Disclosing rush and bush of green, 
 Where hidden muskrats safely lay. 
 Trailing the worm-like fence along. 
 The golden-rod lifts high its head ; 
 Or with their purple flowers among, 
 Throughout the fields the sages spread. 
 And darting in and out the bee 
 Already hums his ministry. 
tHE CAMt» MEETING. 1 85 
 III. 
 Brown Chapel's grove transformed has been. 
 The uninviting stand no more 
 Beneath the spreading chestnuts green 
 Looks lonely. Round about, five score 
 Of rude constructed benches spread, 
 With lanterns hanging here and there, 
 And pine torch-stands, but lately made, 
 To give at night their smoky glare ; 
 And rude made boarding tents of pine 
 On either side the spaces, line. 
 IV. 
 The squirrel deeper into the wood 
 Hath at this transformation fled. 
 In search of richer solitude. 
 Where freer life might safe be led ; 
 And birds high perched in tallest trees, 
 Look down in wonder on the scene ; 
 And sing their trouble to the breeze, 
 How peaceful days ago have been ; 
 And rabbits but a three months' old 
 Now think it time to be less bold. 
 V. 
 None hold their once undisturbed sway 
 But yonder nest of hornets, high 
 Above the ''horse pound" hid away 
 Within the green from mortal eye. 
 These looked with dire threats upon 
 The changes that have taken place. 
 And seemed to've stood their ground alone, 
 And watched aloft with mute grimace, 
 As tent, on tent, erected stood 
 Within this once sequestered wood. 
[^6 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 VI. 
 Perchance a yellow- jacket came, 
 As chicken odor filled the air, 
 To see if he had right to claim 
 A portion of it for his share. 
 And flies in swarms that were immense 
 By some intelligence having found, 
 (I cannot comprehend what sense,) 
 The tents that with much food abound, 
 Swarm in and out with ceaseless hum. 
 Too glad such happy times have come. 
 VII. 
 The now completed parsonage 
 Looks on surprised at such a scene. 
 For days wnthin its walls the rage^ 
 Brown Chapel's annual camp has been. 
 And lusty maidens as they ran 
 Within and out to make complete 
 The furnishings, or stopped to plan, 
 'Twas only that they might repeat 
 What they on such a day would wear. 
 How such and such a one would stare. 
 VIII. 
 The chapel stood in silence now. 
 Closed for a fortnight from the light. 
 From that time should no sacred vow 
 Be made therein by day or night ; 
 But yonder in the airy grove, 
 Beneath the oak and chestnut green, 
 Should men vow^ all their sacred love. 
 Or testify of dangers seen, 
 Or great conflicts thro' which they passed 
 Since they had been assembled last. 
THE CAMP MEETING. 1S7 
 IX. 
 'Tis early yet, and but a few 
 Within the grove astir are seen. 
 These are the good tent-holders, who, 
 There all the whole night long have been. 
 And these were getting now prepared 
 This morning for the hungry crowd, 
 Who must be necessarily cared 
 For by them. For when shouting loud, 
 Or strolling in and out the wood, 
 Would breed great appetite for food. 
 X. 
 The house completed, Stone, now well. 
 The host of two good clergymen, 
 Has slept there most comfortable; 
 Nor woke till five, and only then 
 To roll back on the bed again. 
 As sweet the breath of rose perfume 
 Which Rosie, it was very plain, 
 Had seen to filling all the room, 
 Anr^ slept and slept till it was seven, 
 W^hile preaching was to. be 't eleven. 
 XI. 
 "Rise, Elder, rise ! Don't sleep all day," 
 Thus Rev. Skinner, at the door. 
 Called in to Stone. ''Get up, I say; 
 They're nigh five hundred folk or more 
 Already on the grounds and we 
 Not yet at breakfast." Stone looked out. 
 And saw what was a sight to see, 
 OfT here, of¥ there, around about, 
 In swarms they stood as thick as bees 
 Or leaves upon the swaying trees. 
iS^ BROWN CHAPElL. 
 XII. 
 Here, there, they surged, youth and old age, 
 Both men and women gayly dressed. 
 To Stone, it seemed the parsonage 
 By them was even now possessed. 
 And, then, far down the winding road, 
 Far as the mortal eye could see. 
 They came in hack and wagon load. 
 In one unending company. 
 And as this number came along. 
 The silent wood was filled with song. 
 XIII. 
 Red, yellow, white and blue and green 
 And brown and gray and other shades 
 In great profusion now are seen 
 In hats and gowns w^orn by the maids. 
 And different styles in cut of coat 
 And trousers, eagerly the men 
 Vied with each other for the note 
 Who might the most attention gain. 
 All this was from the window seen 
 When Stone from sleep had awakened been. 
 XIV. 
 "No need to worry," he replied. 
 'The brethren have all things in hand." 
 (His pajamas he threw aside.) 
 "The breakfast serving has been planned." 
 But Rev. Skinner now had gone 
 With Rev. Snowden down the stair, 
 And in his room with leisure. Stone 
 Stood dressing, after fervent prayer, 
 In which he gave to God the day. 
 His guidance through it all the way.

THE CAMP MEETING. 189

 He stood before the bureau, where 
 On a pretty scarf was spread. 
 Its needle work was very rare, 
 Of lovely roses in silk thread. 
 One thought them painted, at first sight ; 
 Might think them natural roses, laid 
 Upon the bureau, if the light 
 Were strong enough, so finely made. 
 And as he dresses, it is oft 
 With an expression, sweet and soft, 
 XVI. 
 Upon this scarf he gazes now. 
 And in his heart of hearts, he feels 
 A tenderness ; and there, isomehow, 
 A spirit in its chamber steals 
 And takes possession, full control. 
 Love and religion once combined. 
 Alone give life into the soul. 
 Alone give pleasure tO' the mind. 
 This love Stone has this Sabbath morn 
 With deep religious feeling born. 
 XVII. 
 Ah, not a piece of furniture 
 But what has tenderest interest; 
 For every thing was placed by her 
 Who caused this feeling in his breast. 
 Indifference makes a woman love. 
 But gentle kindness, it is said, 
 Doth sometniie make a strong man prove 
 The willing lover of a maid. 
 Such gentle acts, in truth, discover 
 Unto the man he is a lover. 
 XVIII. 
 No woman need of love despair, 
 If she herself can loving be. 
 But loving means a kindness rare 
 To whom she loves, a sympathy 
 Which flowers into words and deeds 
 Of gentle interest wherein 
 Herself is lost. Ah, such succeeds 
 When every other fails to win. 
 Man loves, and loves that woman best, 
 Who loves him for herself the least. 
 XIX. 
 Man loves that woman best of all 
 Who loves him for himself the most. 
 Such love he knows cannot be small 
 And is beyond the greatest cost. 
 Such love when he at last has seen 
 It stand the very greatest test, 
 He honors, lets nought come between 
 Him and that love, and learns to rest 
 Upon that love for strength secure : 
 Thus seeks that love, nor craves for more. 
 XX. 
 A love like this is born in heaven, 
 But God in His wise providence 
 Unto the gentler sex hath given 
 The privilege of its use. But since 
 So few behold the privilege 
 And do. not know it doth exist, 
 They let the looser passions rage 
 And learn to hate what they have missed, 
 While still the golden crown of love 
 Waits for their crowning just above. 
THE CAMP MEETING. I9I 
 XXL 
 Stone soon had dressed and down the stair 
 Went to be greeted jovially 
 By the two clergymen down there 
 About the happy company 
 Of people running all about. 
 In full possession of the place. 
 And here and there, a lusty shout 
 Breaks from some strong-lunged of the race. 
 The sisters on the table had 
 A very sumptuous breakfast spread. 
 XXII. 
 And as they there at breakfast sat, 
 The Love Feast having long begun. 
 They heard them liinging betwixt their chat, 
 Or loudly speaking one by one. \ 
 "A very good start," Skinner said. 
 "Most piomising now," Snowden joined, 
 *Tf all in here their fare have paid, 
 A goodly sum please bear in mind. ) 
 What is the number, think you now?" ' 
 'Twelve hundred I should most allow." \ 
 XXIII. ; 
 'T preach this morning, Elder Stone?" 
 "As scheduled, I believe you do." 
 "And I?" asked Skinner, as upon ' 
 Another egg his fork he drew. 
 "To-night I have you scheduled, sir." 
 "Ah, good. I'm glad it is to-night, 
 Though very few the night prefer. 
 But hearing you will get me right." 
 "Well, most any time for me," ! 
 Said Stone most absent-mindedly. 
192 BROWN CHAPEI^ 
 XXIV. 
 ''Good morning, brethren," from the hall 
 Cried Melville as he passed to go 
 Into the kitchen. ''N^ooks is all 
 Afire," in a voice quite low, 
 He said to Sister Hannah Brown, 
 Who in the kitchen o'er the stove 
 Was busy cooking. ''Call 'im down," 
 She said most sharply. "Oughter prove 
 His life by wuks an' not his voice. 
 I don't see how he kin rejoice." 
 XXV. 
 ''Do stop, Aunt Hannah, charity !" 
 "Oh, yes, I know that is all right. 
 But when so many things I see — 
 Well I can't help what's in my sight. 
 One's bound to think." "Yes, not to speakJ 
 Then you believe in hiding dirt? 
 You'll have me thinkin' you's as weak 
 As he is !" and she shook her skirt 
 As if disgusted. Melville went 
 Out and toward a boarding tent. 
 XXVI. 
 Meanwhile our ministers are through 
 Their breakfast and are making w^ay 
 Toward the stand. The great crowds drew 
 Aside at their approach. The gay 
 Young maids with most coquettish wiles 
 Are trying hard to catch Stone's eye, 
 And many are the winning smiles 
 And witching bows in passing by. 
 And so with here and there a shake 
 And press of hands, their way they make 
THE CAMP MEETING. IQJ 
 XXVII. 
 Towards the preaching stand, around 
 Which now a mass of people sat. 
 Enthusiasm doth abound, 
 And one by one, said something that 
 Inflamed another one to speak, 
 Inflamed somebody else to sing. 
 No voice was fearful, none was weak. 
 Some in the richest tones could ring. 
 Some pitched to highest chords, break forth, 
 But all told of God's wondrous worth. 
 XXVIII. 
 Yet while all this was going on, 
 Beyond in circles far apart, 
 There gathered others there alone 
 That they might some mischief start. 
 On these Brown Chapel officers 
 Kept watch that was most vigilant. 
 And where the least bad act occurs, 
 'Tis there these watchful brethren went; 
 And when persuasion failed its course. 
 The men resorted to brute force. 
 XXIX. 
 Thus kept them down. But hour by hour 
 The mighty concourse was increased. 
 Except the Law, these brethren's power 
 Was very small. But man, like beast. 
 Is cowered by the punishment. 
 He knows is meted by the Law ; 
 And they who stand to represent 
 He learns to look upon with awe; 
 Stands fearful lest entangled, he 
 Might lose bis cherished liberty.

 XXX. 
 Thus while there was an element 
 Which in the place could do much harn\ 
 Kept now beneath the right restraint, 
 'Twas no occasion for alarm. 
 So as the thousand swelled to two, 
 And there was scarcely standing room. 
 All quiet kept, and there were few 
 Who had to wish they had not come. 
 If any discontented were, 
 'Twas not because of trouble here. 
 XXXI. 
 Now when the great Love Feast was o'er 
 Then has arrived the hour to preach, 
 The Rev. Snowden stood before 
 One thousand within speaking reach. 
 A Methodistic hymn he read, 
 In swelling notes the people sang. 
 Then Rev. Skinner bowed and prayed 
 Throughout the place loud ''Amens" rang. 
 Or "Hallelujah," "Praise the Lord," 
 Or "Blessed be unto His Word." 
 XXXIL 
 Stone read the Scripture firm and clear. 
 Himself must have been keenly stirred 
 In lictening to that fervent prayer. 
 He felt new force in every word. 
 Of Israel in the wilderness. 
 Of dwelling in the booths he read. 
 Of Nehemiah's great success. 
 And how he to Jerusalem led 
 The remnant of the church of God 
 Which had bent beneath the rod. 
THE CAMP MEETING. I95 
 XXXIII. 
 And then 'twas Rosie's voice that rang 
 In mellowed richness on the air. 
 As she the *'Holy City" sang 
 Men seemed to see the vision there. 
 In all that sea of faces was 
 The use of handkerchiefs, so sweet 
 That young voice filled the great compass, 
 And brought men to the Master's feet. 
 She ceased, a sacred hush fell o'er, 
 Till Stone's clear voice was heard once more, 
 XXXIV. 
 To introduce the speaker, now, 
 To call for closing of each tent, 
 He hoped that no one would allow 
 One moment of the time be spent 
 In inattention to the Word 
 That from the speaker's lips should fall. 
 And not the man, he warned, the Lord 
 Spoke in that hour unto all, 
 And every one should feel that he 
 Received the message personally. 
 XXXV. 
 And thus the speaker of the hour 
 Came forward to the desk where lay 
 The Word of God. He said, if power 
 At all were given him that day 
 'Twould be alone because of prayer, 
 Sent by the concourse up to heaven. 
 He was convinced power came from there, 
 Could from no other source be given. 
 He, therefore, asked the people pray, 
 That power be given him that day. 
 XXXVI. 
 The ''Dignity of Man," his theme, 
 And thus in flights he strove to show 
 How man upon a downward stream 
 Had tended ; yet how checked the flow 
 By Him who came man's cause to take; 
 How upward he was moving now ; 
 How hell's strong bolts could never shake 
 The man that held to Jesus ; how 
 Each day his spirit was renewed 
 By feeding on the heavenly food. 
 XXXVH. 
 The people prayed, and 'twas sincere, 
 The Power came down from on High. 
 All knew it, no mistaking here,^ 
 The Holy Ghost was very nigh. 
 Though simple were his words, he spoke 
 With mighty unction, and that host, 
 Like as a pent-up flood, then broke. 
 Each sentence, felt the Holy Ghost. 
 And hardened criminals who came 
 Just to be there trembled for shame, 
 xxxvni. 
 And thoughtless maidens, dress-arrayed, 
 Who never had one moment given. 
 In thinking over what was said 
 About their chance for hell or heaven, 
 Hung on the words that seem to fall 
 Alone for them to think upon. 
 They who had never thought at all 
 Were thinking that the words alone 
 Stood as a knocking at their door. 
 To open now or never more, 
tHE CAmP MEEtlNd. IQJ^ 
 XXXIX. 
 Needless to say when Stone arose 
 The invitation to extend 
 To any one, yes, one of those 
 Who felt that it was time to end 
 His downward course, that forward came 
 A number to the Mercy Seat. 
 Too sharp the sword, too great the flame, 
 And rich the table spread to eat; 
 For when they cleared for them the place, 
 Two hundred sought for pardoning grace. 
 XL. 
 And now another scene began — 
 The Praying Bands from everywhere 
 Draw around these seekers to a man, 
 To lead in singing and in prayer. 
 Well trained they are in isiich an art — 
 In leading of their doleful chants ; 
 But more the ear and less the heart, 
 It seems, which is not what one wants ; 
 Yet years have been, and still may be, 
 Ere they give up such ministry. 
 XLI. 
 Now high, now low, now women, now men. 
 Their hands, their feet, their bodies swayed ; 
 Their faces leering as in pain, 
 ■ They sing and clap — thus noise is made. 
 Some leader pointing to the skies, 
 Or here, or there, or down below, 
 Amidst the penitential cries, 
 And thus the chanting on must go, 
 Till he who leads has ceased to think, 
 And then exhausted down all sink. 
J 9^ BROWN Chapel. 
 XLII. 
 Then one with strong lungs makes a prayer, 
 I dare not say he does not pray, 
 I cannot say he prays it ; there 
 Is so much doubt along the way. 
 And then they all join in with this, 
 As the excitement doth increase, 
 All crying in a frenzied bliss, 
 But when the leader stops, they cease, 
 And then, who ever has the gift. 
 Another doleful chant doth lift. 
 XLIII. 
 Thus singing, clapping they've forgot 
 Even the seeking souls that cry; 
 For having tired of the spot, 
 They leave the altar frenziedly, 
 And all about the ground they go. 
 The whole compass encircling, 
 As Joshua circled Jericho; 
 Instead of blowing trumps, they sing, 
 But in their frenzied happiness, 
 They carry all things to excess. 
 XLIV. 
 These things saw Stone who in the stand 
 Stood with his brother clergymen. 
 He called one captain of a band 
 And bade him call his followers in. 
 That Jiere was work for them to do, — 
 Pray for the seekers kneeling there. 
 And so, he got them one or two, 
 And fell upon his knees in prayer. 
 Then others seeming more inclined, 
 Drew 'round him of one voice and mind. 
THE CAMP MEETING. I99 
 XLV. 
 It seemed this was the proper move, 
 For suddenly the row along 
 The fervent spirit 'gan to prove, 
 And upward sprang in praise and song 
 A host of new converted men 
 And women, jumping in the air. 
 Then Stone thought of Ezekiel's slain, 
 In gratitude sent up a prayer. 
 In all the place excitement reigned, 
 And none their spirit now restrained. 
 XLVI. 
 But it is said when sons of Grace 
 Are fighting on God's battlefield, 
 O'ld Satan's somewhere in the place. 
 And leaves some wounds ere made to yield. 
 So when the flag was waving high, 
 Yes, held aloft victoriously. 
 Then Satan had his wicked eye 
 Upon those hornets in the tree. 
 The horses all stood in the pound 
 Most peaceful till those hornets found 
 XLVIL 
 'Twas time to get, too, in the ring. 
 Just as the Band that we have seen 
 Came near the place, a buzz, a sting, 
 Down from the leaves of maple green 
 They came a swarm, a buzzing host ! 
 And horses reared and broke away. 
 Men, women rushed, their reasons lost; 
 In all directions in dismay. 
 Thus in a moment on them fell 
 The diabolic hosts of hell. 
20() BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XLVIII. 
 Stone stood up in the stand to see 
 The great rejoicing going on. 
 When lo, the mighty company- 
 Was surging, pushing one upon 
 The other, crushing, screaming loud. 
 Nor could he then divine the cause. 
 He held his hand up to the crowd, 
 He bid them in their rush to pause. 
 ''Stop ! stop !" he cried, an answered yell 
 Like demons just broke loose from hell. 
 XLIX. 
 His brother clergymen, ah, they? 
 He looked in vain to find them there. 
 (No, early they had made their way 
 Toward the parsonage. ) Nowhere 
 Out in the crowd could they be seen. 
 But there was one he did behold. 
 She came, the surging crowd between, 
 She fought her way, his heart grew cold. 
 For there, in all that rolling mass. 
 Pressed Rose her way to where he was.

 OCTOBER NIGHT. 
 I. 
 October, and the day is fair, ] 
 This afternoon the sky is blue, I 
 With just a touch of frost the air ' 
 Gave to the trees each varied hue. | 
 The sombre pines, the maple, gum, j 
 The chestnut, walnut, hickory, oak, 
 Since mild October days had come. 
 Into new robes of beauty broke. i 
 Here touch of crimson, splash of gold, I 
 The work of nightly fairies told. 
 n. , \ 
 How beautiful the golden sage, i 
 With purple flowers yet in bloom, j 
 Stretched wide before the parsonage. 
 Where upstairs in his cheery room, 
 Looking from the window far away [ 
 Across this waving sea of gold, - ; 
 Stone sits and dreams this autumn day, , 
 Dreams that he would blush to have told. j 
 He dreams, not studies, ah, he dreams j 
 That life is more than what it seems. ! 
^02 feROVVN dHAfEL. 
 III. 
 And why this dreamy spell of Stone, 
 A man who deals alone with facts? — 
 A man who deals in facts alone^ 
 What is it that his mind attracts 
 That he should dream? October days, 
 Can they not weave o'er one a spell? 
 Who hath not felt beneath their haze 
 Emotion that's unspeakable? 
 Who hath not in such seasons known 
 The thrills, the raptures felt by Stone? 
 i ■ , 
 IV. 
 Down stairs Aunt Hannah Brown's astir, 
 Just in his supper to prepare. 
 He surelv does not dream of lier. 
 And is it one more young and fair? 
 Ah, Stone has dreams, he must not tell ; 
 Dreams which he strives to put away ; 
 He does not like them very well, 
 And yet with him they seem to stay. 
 Whate'er he says, where'er he goes. 
 There are these dreams of little Rose. 
 V. 
 Now ever since that Sabbath day. 
 Through that mad howling, surging crowd. 
 To him she nobly fought her way, 
 He has been feeling of her proud. 
 Yes, even more. What brought her there. 
 When trembling at his side she stood, 
 Rose-colored with dismantled hair? 
 She came, she said, because she could 
 Not see him standing there alone 
 In that wild mob, his brethren gone. 
DCtOBfiR I^ICJhT. ^^ 
 VI. 
 He pressed her hand so tightly then 
 When she had made him this reply, 
 It certainly must have caused her pain, 
 But she refrained of course the cry. 
 And when good order was restored, 
 And they had to the parsonage gone, 
 She came to him without a word, 
 And showed his finger-marks alone. 
 He gazed upon her hand and smiled, 
 ''Knew not what I was doing, child." 
 VIL 
 A hundred little things since then 
 Had drawn him closer to the maid. 
 And yet though try he would, in vain. 
 The words he should say were not said. 
 Oft when Aunt Hannah busy was. 
 She came that she might her assi'st ; 
 'Twas then he'd gaze upon the lass 
 With thoughts that neither could exist 
 Without the other; tell her? No, 
 He could not go and tell her so. 
 VIII. 
 The feeling he once had for Mame, 
 The passion of a thoughtless youth, 
 Was dead. And in its place a flame 
 Sprung from the embers of pure truth. 
 Was kindled. Yet for Rose he had 
 A deep warm feeling such as made 
 Him in her presence blithe and glad, 
 And absent from her still was stayed 
 In joyous thrills as if there were 
 Some thing that still whispered of her. 
i64 BtlOWJJ CllAPftL. 
 IX. 
 Or rather, though they were apart, 
 Her spirit kept him company; 
 And her own heart now with his heart 
 Did beat in perfect unity. 
 If at his studies, she was there, 
 A chair beside his occupied, 
 Or standing with dismantled hair. 
 Looked love upon him at his side, 
 And something whispered "Throughout life 
 We'll journey on as man and wife." 
 X. 
 And there were times when he could see 
 Into the future; and he smiled 
 For there, what blissful reverie ! 
 He saw a mother and her child 
 Sit, listening to him preaching on 
 The Sabbath, or around the board, 
 Glad feasting — ah ,what dreams had Stone, 
 Who had not even said a word. 
 Or made one move to learn his fate, 
 Yet dreaming of his wedded isitate. 
 XL 
 Such men can dream. Love knows no bounds. 
 Imagination winged goes 
 Up to all heights, into all grounds, 
 And touched with love, the future shows. 
 Sweet are the dreams that fancy gives 
 Though short lived they may be at best ; 
 Oflie in imagination lives 
 Another life above the rest, 
 Enjoying sights and scenes where they 
 That live in fancy cannot stray. 
OCTOBER NIGHT. 205 
 XII. 
 Love and Imagination once 
 United, to the lofty height' 
 Beyond the realms of mere sense, 
 Are ever known to take their flight. 
 And men live on in such a state, 
 Still in their youth, though old they grow ; 
 But let these ever separate, 
 Men look upon their lives and know 
 The ills of life, the sordid care, 
 The sorrows that must claim a share. 
 XIII. 
 To Stone this bright October day 
 Was the most perfect ever seen ; 
 Just why it was, he could not say, 
 Perhaps some previous days had been 
 To others just as perfect, but 
 This day, this bright October day 
 To him within the parsonage shut 
 Unto himself, was stealing away 
 In such a calm, sweet, heavenly peace, 
 He felt his happiness increase." 
 XIV. 
 How long he mused, he did not know, 
 Already had the sun gone down. 
 And left behind the ruddy glow 
 Of twilight. Where the wood rose brown, 
 Dark shadows stole across the road, 
 And over in the field of sage 
 The Jersey to Aunt Hannah lowed, 
 Just opposite the parsonage, 
 And Stone soon saw Aunt Hannah go 
 In answer to her gentle low, 
 XV. 
 And let her through the bars into 
 The side gate, leading to the rear. 
 And then it was that Stone well knew 
 That supper time was drawing near. 
 He rose, ishook off the dreamy spell. 
 And left the -now dark growing room. 
 Down stairs he went, out to the well, 
 Drew up a pail of water. From 
 The stable he could hear just now 
 Aunt Hannah talking to the cow. 
 XVI. 
 *'Stan' ovah heah! What ails you, Sue? 
 Y|ou bettah min' what you's about ! 
 Ain't that there feed good 'nouf for vou ! 
 Then you will hafter do without. 
 You's mighty dainty now ter night, 
 And very restless, too, I see — 
 Hey ovah. Sue, can't you stan' right ? 
 Why don't you stop that botherin' me?" 
 Dipping into the pail a gourd 
 He drank, amused at every word. 
 XVH. 
 Stone stood upon the side porch when 
 Aunt Hannah from the stable came. 
 Bearing a pail of milk. ''Well, then, 
 I think it is an awful ^shame. 
 That cow done kicked ovah ha'f her milk," 
 She said as she discovered him. 
 *Tt certainly seems she likes to bilk 
 Me in my aims, up to this rim, 
 I usually git it ; now I'm put 
 Back in what I had on foot." 
OCTOBER NIGHT. 20/ 
 XVIII. 
 "Ah, well, no matter," solaced Stone. 
 ''We can't have everything we want ; 
 Just dO' with what you have alone. 
 What you can't do, of course, you can't,' 
 "Laws, Bro. Stone, you is the mos' 
 Good natured man I've eveh seen. 
 You don't seem worried by no loss, 
 I must ow^n up you's certainly been 
 A sample for us all, in grace, 
 Since you is been about this place." 
 XIX. 
 Into the house Aunt Hannah went. 
 "Ain't gettin' lonesome now, I hope?" 
 *She asked, as o'er the table bent, 
 A jar of peaches tried to ope. 
 "Oh, no," said Stone, "but somehow I 
 Would like to take a stroll to-night. 
 So calm the time, so clear the sky, 
 I think beneath the half moon's light 
 I shall enjoy a mile or two 
 Of walking, that I think I'll do." 
 XX. 
 "Ah, Bro. Stone, I think I see ; 
 You's gittin' lonesome staying heah. 
 You wants some un else besides me; 
 An' I don't blame you, for I feah. 
 This house without some loving w^ife 
 Is most too large for any man ; 
 An' that's what you all need in life. 
 You cannot hoi' it a good plan 
 To live without a wife, kin you? 
 Now answer, Bro. Stone, mos' true?" 
 XXI. 
 "Why, Sister Hannah, are you not 
 Sufficient to see to the place?" 
 *'La\vd, yes, but that ain't all. The spot 
 Ain't filled by me. Another face 
 'Sides mine, I think, should be heah, too, 
 To help you in your work, you see. 
 Of course I do what I can do ; 
 A wife could even bettah be. 
 Besides, when Fs away at nights, 
 You's heah alone, now is that right? 
 XXII. 
 "S'pose you git sick an all alone. 
 Who's heah to tend you — thought o' that?" 
 This certainly had not come to Stone, 
 And it was something to look at. 
 "No, I confess I have not thought," 
 He said, "but such may never be." 
 "Can't tell at all," she said, "It mought. 
 What's coming none of us can see." 
 "Of course,^ said Stone, "that's right, of course, 
 And yet we look not for the worse." 
 XXIII. 
 "And still you get it often, tho'. 
 Mo' then you do the bettah git." 
 She won her point, he let it go, 
 And didn't coax another bit. 
 And now his supper she began 
 Into the dining room to take. 
 And Stone, a very hearty man. 
 To the occasion doth awake. 
 She set in tastely way each dish 
 Which ere he tasted roused a wish. 
OCTOBER NIGHT. 209 
 XXIV. 
 "Yer supper's ready, Bro. Stone." 
 ''Ah, thank you," and 'twas in he went. 
 Now from a pretty lamp there shone 
 A bright light 'round the room. Intent 
 In thought, Stone sat in silence down 
 To eat the supper rich prepared. 
 Say it in truth for Sister Brown, 
 'Twas well she for her pastor cared. 
 No dainty that her fertile brain 
 Suggested which she'd not obtain. 
 XXV. 
 And when she saw him satisfied, 
 Eating the meal most heartily, 
 She to the kitchen went with pride, 
 Happy such appetite to see. 
 And Stone with visions of a form 
 Just yonder on the opposite 
 The table, sees in life a charm 
 Never before beheld, — to-night 
 A woman petite, blushing, wild, 
 A woman yet to him a child ! 
 XXVI. 
 Then Sister Brown stood in the door. 
 'Tt do look lonesome heah for trufe." 
 And now his little dream was o'er 
 "I'm sure," he said, ''there is no proof." 
 *T see it tho," the woman said, 
 Her arms akimbo, standing there, 
 A great red kerchief on her head. 
 Her sleeves rolled up, and elbows bare. 
 "Well, I suppose so," Stone replied, 
 Eating as if well satisfied.

 XXVII. 
 '*Bro. Hawkins passed the lane to-day," 
 She said in way of Httle news. 
 'That so? He turned not in this way," 
 Said Stone, not over-sad to choose 
 Just such a theme. ''No ; went on by. 
 Was driving, he and Rose, I b'heve." 
 "In what direction?" carelessly. 
 "To town, I think; she's 'bout to leave." 
 "To leave?'' asked Stone, now all surprised, 
 Of such he had not been advised. 
 XXVIII. 
 "Oh, don't you know she was to go?'' 
 Aunt Hannah asked in surprised tone. 
 "To go?" Stone answered, "certainly, no; 
 Have not been told by any one." 
 "Strange," said Aunt Hannah, "very strange. 
 Las' Sunday — did you see her then?" 
 "Yes, but 'twas only to exchange 
 A greeting, for some brethren 
 Called my attention from her, and 
 I simply stopped to grasp her hand." 
 XXIX. 
 "When was you there to make a call ?" 
 "Not since two weeks, I think, ago; 
 And things were just as usual, 
 That is, so far as I could know. 
 But where is Rosie going to?" 
 "Now really, pastah, I can't say. 
 It's to the lady's that, you know, 
 Has been heah with her. 'Twas away 
 She went I think on Thursday las'. 
 I also seen her when she pass." 
OCTOBER NIGHT. 21 I 
 XXX. 
 Stone ate in silence, dared not speak; i 
 And Sister Hannah now went on, ] 
 "May Jane, she tol' me 'way las' week j 
 That Rose was goin' to some town, I 
 The name, I disremember, but 
 'Twas where this lady lived, I know. 
 I s'pose she's been down here and put ' 
 Some notions in her head to go." 
 Stone without answering, rose and went j 
 Upstairs, his heart most sorely rent. 
 XXXI. I 
 He made no light, he wanted none, 
 A half-moon cast her silver light 
 Into the room. And there alone > 
 He sat, looked out into the night, 
 Hard ty the window. Far away 
 Now on the frosty air he heard. ^ 
 Rise mournfully, the plaintive lay, I 
 Sung by the whip-poor-will, sad bird, — J 
 Seemed singing now in sympathy 
 With him, e'en sadder far than he. 
 XXXH. 
 Even the owl's quick hoo ! hoc! 
 Which joined the whip-poor-will's plaint song, 
 Seemed as this bird his sorrow knew. 
 And passed it through the woods along ; j 
 And told the maple trees and gum, * 
 The walnut and the hickory. 
 The cloud that o'er his life had cume. 
 And bade them bow in sympathy ; i 
 And all the pines in sombre green 
 Low whispered of ''what might have been." 
 XXXIIL 
 The moon, half sad, looked down to-night 
 And told it to a passing cloud; 
 A shooting star went out of sight; 
 The sage field wrapped it in a shroud 
 Of vapor; and the stars looked down 
 And twinkled o'er it knowingly, 
 As if the universe with Stone 
 Was in the deepest sympathy. 
 'The whole world loves a lover." Yies, 
 And mourns in his unhappiness. 
 XXXIV. 
 And there he sat, the night sped on. 
 He heard Aunt Hannah shut the door, 
 And knew that she at last had gone. 
 Now silence reigned the cottage o'er, 
 Save now and then a candle-fly 
 Beat, frightened, 'gainst the window pane; 
 Or bat, in zig-zag route go by 
 And graze against the roof again. 
 And he within a ghostly glare 
 Of moon light, crushed and sore, sat there. 
 XXXV. 
 Gone, and without a word to tell 
 Him that she had a mind to go. 
 Gone, not one look to say farewell. 
 No word to tell him "yes" or ''no" 
 To what he long had questioned her. 
 To what he full believed she knew, 
 Which every act proved whisperer, 
 Which every look of hers well drew, 
 Gone, spirited from him away. 
 For what ? Alas, he could not say, 
OCTOBER NIdHt. 21^ 
 XXXVI. 
 And was it of her own sweet will ? 
 No, she Had told him of it then; 
 Would not have left the place until 
 She had the chance to make it plain. 
 Was there some secret enemy 
 At work against his happiness? 
 He thought of Mame, no, no, not she ; 
 She would have aided him, ah, yes. 
 He thought of Dora Wright, of Small, 
 He let his mind run over all. 
 xxxvn. 
 But there was nothing to suggest 
 That there was one him to oppose. 
 The whole community, at best, 
 Looked with deep favor upon Rose, 
 And many marked about the change 
 In her behavior there of late, 
 And many said it was so strange 
 She was so gentle and sedate; 
 And many said it openly 
 'Twas owing to his company. 
 XXXVIII. 
 Nor did her father once object 
 To his attention to the maid. 
 And all looked on it as correct, 
 Tho' he had nothing to her said. 
 Yet everybody who beheld 
 The two when out in company. 
 From their fond actions, was compelled 
 To think they must bethrothed be. 
 Thus who was there that might oppose 
 Him in his love for gentle Rose. 
J\/\ BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XXXIX. 
 And thus he sits there pondering 
 The cause that took her from his side. 
 He could not think of any thing-. 
 Or any one that might divide 
 Their feehng. WHiat? What had he done 
 To show her that he truly loved ? 
 What word had said to her alone 
 W'hich had his deep affection proved? 
 Had he not trifled with her heart 
 Which cau«'?d them now to be apart? 
 XL. 
 Does he recall how once she stood 
 There at the gate one lovely night, 
 When the moon in silver slashed the wood, 
 And threw o'er all a halo bright, 
 Her trembling hand now pressed in his ; 
 Her eyes uplifted to his own; 
 Lips almost asking for a kiss ; 
 He'd said in ordinary tone, 
 "Good night," and simply dropped her hand 
 And seen her turn to leave him ; and 
 XLI. 
 When on her porch, look back and wave 
 Her hand to him as if to say, 
 "I give the kiss you never gave," 
 Then disappear, he turned away? 
 And that he mused was the last time 
 They were together. Was it, then, 
 The moment in his life sublime. 
 He should have spoken. Other men, 
 He told himself, had ta'en the chance 
 To bring theirr love to evidence. 
OCTOBER NIGHt. ^1$ 
 XLII. 
 What held him back? Ten years ago, 
 And he had spoken in a flood ; 
 And he had let his passion flow 
 In all the ardor of his blood ; 
 But then, the mask accustomed to, 
 The mask which ministers must wear. 
 Kept his real nature from her view, 
 And made him cold and heartless there. 
 And, O the words he fain had said. 
 He never uttered to the maid. 
 XLIII. 
 Perhaps, he reasoned, time enough ; 
 Perhaps, he told himself, "Not now;" 
 Perhaps, though in the very trough 
 Of passion, yet would not allow 
 It to o'erwhelm but manned the bark 
 Beyond the breakers of his soul ; 
 And laughed because he missed the mark. 
 Because he could himself control; 
 But now, he sees how foolish he. 
 In all of this, turned out to be. 
 XLIV. 
 And now his laughing turns to sighs, 
 The mask is wrenched from off his brow; 
 He wishes he might have those eyes 
 Uplifted to his own just now; 
 He wishes that those lips were there 
 That he might press them to his own ; 
 She would not list in -vain to hear 
 His words, which he in loving tone, 
 Would speak to her about his he«rt ; 
 But now, alas ! they are apart. 
2l6 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XLV. 
 Apart ! A demon in the sage 
 Re-echoed back the words to him; 
 Enveloped was the parsonage 
 In clouds, and all about was dim ; 
 ''Apart !" A yelling company 
 Of imps danced in the chamber there. 
 The night refused her sympathy, 
 And all was howling in despair. 
 "Apart! apart! apart! apart!" 
 Vain were the words about his heart. 
 XLVL 
 We never know how much we miss 
 Our loved ones till at last we've lost; 
 We never learn to value bliss 
 Till sorrow hath our pathway crossed. 
 We lightly tread the flowered walk, 
 Nor think to drink the odor in, 
 Some careless conversation talk 
 And never breathe the things we mean ; 
 And let a fortune slip away 
 That might have been our own for aye. 
 XLVII. 
 The half of us have had our dream 
 And wakened ere we found it out. 
 Then say ''Things are not what they seem," 
 Take consolation in this doubt. — 
 Oh, happy he who sees his chance 
 And knows just what to put it to, 
 To make the best of circumstance, 
 But once he'll have the thing to do. 
 That moment idly passed, 'tis then 
 To him it comes not back again. 
OCTOBER NIGHT. ^if 
 XLVIIL 
 At last the mist has cleared away, 
 And reason doth itself assert. 
 Stone falls upon his knees to pray, 
 In that dark ro9m, to pour his heart 
 Out to his Christ, who said ''Commit 
 Thy work unto the Lord, and He 
 Will by His power establish it. 
 And thou needst not uneasy be." 
 The cloud was lifted, cleared the gloom, 
 Once more light streamed into the room. 
 XLIX. 
 Once more the whip-poor-will w^as heard, 
 Once more the owl's quick hoo, hoo. 
 Came back to him ; but neither bird 
 Brought sadness by its 'Song. The blue 
 Bright heavens with the stars gazed down, 
 And sent to him the words of hope. 
 And from the trees to him was blown 
 The words "Arise, thy doors shall ope." 
 And he arose and went to bed, 
 In some way strangely comforted.

 Canto XVII. , 
 A STRANGE STORY. 
 I. 
 Some things there are we do not know, 
 Some things there are we cannot see, 
 Some things as mysteries must go, 
 And so unsolved shall ever be. 
 No man can fathom every thing, 
 Within his life some things appear 
 Which with them such vague shadows bring. 
 Nothing about them seemeth clear; 
 Ay, at our best we but surmise. 
 Surmising, think that we are wise. 
 II. 
 "Behold, we know not any thing," 
 So sang the singer, sweet of eld; 
 Sang as none but himself could sing, 
 And who disputes the truth he held? 
 "We have but faith ; we cannot know. 
 For knowledge is of things we see," 
 And thus he sang long years ago 
 In that lament most plaintively, 
 As drifting far into the dark, 
 He strives to man his tossing bark. 
A STRANGE STORY. ^l^ 
 III. 
 Life is one endless mystery, 
 Despite what we might say of chance ; 
 Despite of our free agency, 
 And all we say of circumstance. 
 One seems at times a child of fate, 
 A toy within a ruthless hand; 
 For things there are which are too great 
 For mortal mind to understand. 
 One, like a poor despised worm, 
 Becomes the creature of the storm. 
 IV. 
 And yet where Reason fails to guide, 
 Faith takes the helm from his hands; 
 And as we stem the ruthless tide, 
 Hope, as our look-out, forward stands. 
 What tho' the vessel labors on; 
 What tho' the night is long and black; 
 What tho' the last faint star be gone, 
 And demons howl upon our track; 
 Hope forward stands. Faith at the' wheel, 
 No unseen rocks can graze the keel ! 
 V. 
 No unseen rocks can graze the keel. 
 No lone bleak shores or crags await. 
 Hope forward stands, Faith at the wheel, 
 We are not in the hands of Fate. 
 The hands of Fate we are not in, 
 Tho' reason failed to guide us out : 
 That was the echoing of sin, 
 The rancor of a lingering doubt. 
 Man need not subject be to chance, 
 Is not the child of circumstance. 
2^6 feROWN CHAPEL 
 VI. 
 And yet, O mystery, the same ! 
 Not now, but in a future day, 
 Some future, better clime will claim 
 Attention. When we re-survey, 
 O when we look upon the track. 
 The track that we have made in pain, 
 O then, it is, in looking back 
 The way shall be both clear and plain. 
 That unsolved then no more shall be. 
 Which we now call a mystery. 
 VII. 
 Stone was absorbed in study, deep, 
 Next morning in his chamber bright, 
 In which he early woke from sleep. 
 When first the sun sent forth his light. 
 Already he had breakfast had. 
 And now within his room alone, 
 In hi'S brown smoking jacket clad. 
 He sat in study, busy on 
 Next Sabbath's sermon, here and there 
 Forming a head with fervent prayer. 
 VIII. 
 Despite what e'er his troubles were, 
 However sore his life had been, 
 He'd never let aught interfere 
 With this, his sacred work. Here clean 
 Forgot the world now stood when he 
 Approached his desk in order to 
 Prepare his sermons. Earnestly 
 He labored, often going through 
 The greatest mental strain to bring 
 A message worthy of his King. 
A STRANGE STORY. 221 
 IX. 
 I 
 And thus as through the shutters green " 
 The sunlight of that autumn morn 
 Streamed silently, with placid mein, 
 No signs of suffering inward borne, 
 He sat his mind on things divine. I 
 His thoughts in messages of Truth J 
 Flowed, as he wrote line after line 
 Gn white note-paper neat and smooth. 
 A bird is singing in the grove 
 A song of his last summer love. 
 X. 
 The breeze is stirring thro' the trees, 
 And gently now the branches sway; 
 A song comes floating on the breeze 
 From merry buskers o'er the way. 
 The scent of cider, newly made, ' 
 Comes with it from the distant farm, i 
 To which he no attention paid; 
 And if such had for him a charm, 
 'Twas that which only helped to fill , 
 Him with absorption deeper still. . ' 
 XL : 
 Aunt Hannah turned her here and there 
 About the house, downstairs, that she 
 A sumptuous dinner might prepare, , 
 Nor minute late with it to be. • \ 
 This dish and that with gentle croon, ] 
 With thoughts of him she doth devise. 1 
 She knows he'll not be down till noon, | 
 And then she'll spread before his eyes \ 
 Some dainty, which she heard him say i 
 He liked. What joy he would display! | 
 XII. 
 And thus absorbed, she does not hear 
 The gentle steps of one who stands 
 There on the porch; and 'twas with fear 
 At last she turned, threw up her hands 
 As Mary Melville hallowed ^'Boo !" 
 And she beheld her standing there. 
 "Why howdy, gal ; go long wid you ! 
 How^ could you gimme sich a scare?" 
 "O dear. Aunt Hannah," Alary said, 
 "I didn't think you that afraid." 
 XIII. 
 And when she'd kissed Aunt Hannah, who 
 Led her into the dining room, 
 Herself into a rocker threw. 
 ''So glad, I really is you's corhe," 
 Aunt Hannah said, "So lonesome heah." 
 "Where's Rev. Stone?" "Up starhs, I believe. 
 He studies mos' too hard, I feah. 
 Some one I think should make him leave 
 His books alone, awhile at leas', 
 An' take a little res' and peace. 
 XIV. 
 "Well, what's the news about the place." 
 "O nothing much, that I can hear; 
 They're matching for a big foot race 
 To-day two weeks ; a dancing bear, 
 Some one that day, they say, will show, 
 And lots of other things, I guess. 
 There's little that one ought to know 
 A going on, I must confess. 
 Of course you heard about how Jake 
 Found in his house the copper snake." 
A STRANGE STORY. 223 
 XV. 
 '*Ah, yes," said Sister Brown, "an' you, 
 You've hearn about Rose goin' away?'' 
 *'I heard it, did not think it true." 
 "Oh, yes, she went on yestiday." 
 ''Poor silly girl," now Mary said, 
 *'Her father better'd kept her here." 
 **Well, that a gal's got in her head 
 Some foolishness." "Too bad; I fear 
 She will not 'mount to much away. 
 This is the place for her to stay." 
 XVI. 
 "Don't know, I liked Rose very well; 
 Of course she was the lively sort ; 
 But if the trufe we might now tell, 
 She warn't so bad as folks report. 
 Now, since that gal came Rose jes' quit 
 Her running all the place about. 
 I'm not the onliest noticed it, 
 But several others also mought. 
 O, yes, she is a lively gal. 
 In fact, I like her arter all." 
 XVII. 
 "Well, yes, I nothing saw in Rose. 
 Perhaps, we all have judged her wrong. 
 And since she's gone aw^ay, who knows. 
 But what 'twill make her even strong. 
 I somehow^ liked this young Miss Wright, 
 She such a sweet way 'bout her has, 
 I loved her almost at first sight. 
 She comes, I'm told, of the best class : 
 If 'tis to her home Rose has gone 
 I'm sure 'twill be her good alone." 
 XVIII. 
 And thus they talk. Aunt Hannah who 
 Now in the kitchen constant phes 
 Her energies, now there were two 
 Instead of one to dinner, tries 
 To get a goodly meal ; and so 
 Manie rocking lazily doth talk 
 Of everything she chanced to know 
 About the parish or the folk. 
 So passed the time along, and soon 
 The hour was pushing close to noon. 
 XIX. 
 "I'll set the table," Mary said. 
 ''O, by the way. Aunt Hannah, I 
 Forgot to tell you, I have made 
 The best preserves, and have set by 
 A gallon jar for Rev. Stone; 
 You think he likes them ?" 'That he do ; 
 He eats all kinds of sweets ; he's done 
 Clean clahed his yaller peaches thro'." 
 ''Then, if you have not any, I 
 Will give you some from my supply. 
 XX. 
 "Mel. said he thought the flour out." 
 "Not quite," Aunt Hannah said, "Thah's moah 
 Then quahtar barrell; now you mought 
 Jes' look yo' se'f thah in th' stoah." 
 "O that's all right. You know when 'tis, 
 Mel. says he'll bring 'Some to you, as 
 There has not been much call for his; 
 And he would never let it pass 
 Without he did his part, so he 
 Told me on coming here to see.

 *'How was the cottage cheese I sent ?" 
 '*0 that was elegant, indeed. 
 He ate an' ate, nor was content 
 Untel I tol' by who 'twas made." 
 *'Ah, so?" laughed Mary, ''yet I told 
 You not to say who made the cheese. 
 Poor one, I think you are, to hold 
 A secret." ''Yet I had to please 
 So tol' him all about it, see?" 
 "O yes, but that's not minding me." 
 XXII. 
 And as they talk, upon the air 
 The farmer's bell is heard to ring. 
 "And twelve o'clock, well I declare, 
 How does the time go hurrying!" 
 "Huh ! 'Time an' tide waits for no man.' 
 I's got my dinner ready to 
 Put on the table. It's my plan 
 To do on time all that I do," 
 Triumphantly Aunt Hannah said. 
 As she upon the table laid 
 XXIII. 
 Her meats. "You ring that bell thah, please," 
 And Mary reaching took the bell 
 And rang it. Now a thought doth seize 
 Her just to hide. So not to tell, 
 She warned Aunt Hannah, then she fled 
 Into the living room where she 
 Soon heard Stone walking overhead, 
 Move down the stairs most leisurely. 
 "Aunt Hannah, heard I not someone?" 
 On entering the room asked Stone.

 *'I do not know as ef you did," 
 Aunt Hannah said, as he sat down, 
 And from the room where she was hid 
 Mame warning looked at Sister Brown. 
 He noticed not the extra plate 
 Or hat that she had not removed. 
 In study deep he silent sat. 
 Perhaps he thought of her he loved; 
 Perhaps his sermon's last brief head; 
 Perhaps, but nothing now he said. 
 XXV. 
 He does not hear Mame when she tips 
 And at his back mischievous stands ; 
 He's all surprised when quick, she slips 
 Around his brow her soft brown hands 
 And holds them o'er his flashing eyes; 
 But still he does not struggle much. 
 "Guess who it is !" she gayly cries. 
 He knew when first he felt the touch. 
 *'0 Madam Melville, now how rude! 
 Of all, I thought that you were good." 
 XXVI. 
 "Of course," she laughed as at her place 
 There at the table now she sat. 
 "Too good to come to-day and grace 
 This table for you, that is flat. 
 But since I had some work to do 
 Here at the church, I came to see 
 Aunt Hannah, never dreamed that you 
 Would not enjoy my company. 
 Of course though, if you do not. then 
 I'll never force myself again,

 "And now, sir, there, take that will you?" 
 She laughed and passed him o'er his plate 
 Helped to potatoes. As he drew 
 The plate toward him, she would wait 
 To see what he would say ; but Stone 
 Was eating with his usual smile 
 A playing o'er his face alone; 
 And she sat waiting all the while. 
 At last, "You'd better eat," he said. 
 "Do try some of Aunt Hannah's bread." 
 xxvni. - 
 "Well, I was waiting just to see 
 If you enjoyed my being here." 
 "Believe me, ma'am, your company 
 But raises ten degrees my cheer," 
 Still smiling, mildly, Stone rejoined. 
 "Ah, thank you, then, I guess I'll eat. 
 Of course, you men are so unkind. 
 You seldom know just how to treat 
 A woman when she tries to do 
 A thing, she believes, please you." 
 XXIX. 
 "You had some work you said to do," 
 (As if he heard not what she said.) 
 "O, yes, most of the music's new, 
 And on the organ must be played, 
 So I came here awhile to play." 
 "Have you been over there as yet?" 
 No ; after walking all the way, 
 I seemed so very warm to get, 
 I simply got as far as here ; 
 And here I sit, it does appear,"

 "Well, really glad to have you, too." 
 "'Oh, so 'tis really this you mean?" 
 ''1 think that all I say is true; 
 There's nothing in my words, you've seen, 
 Untrue," he said, arching his brow. 
 ''There, don't, it does not suit your face," 
 She said, 'T must acknowledge now 
 You make me feel quite out of place." 
 "One of my 'ways' you used to say," 
 He murmured, "once upon a day." 
 XXXI. 
 She sighed. He noticed it and stopped. 
 " 'Twas foolish, very foolish," she 
 Now murmured, and her clear, voice dropped 
 Down to a whisper. 'Twas then he 
 Looked up and caught her tender gaze. 
 "O, Ray!" she murmured under breath, 
 Those happy, happy, HAPiPY days 
 Shall bright before me be till death — " 
 "Now do us part," he laughing said. 
 "Why, chase such nonsense from your head! 
 XXXH. 
 " 'Twas very foolish, now I own, 
 That I should then to it advert. 
 I hope, however," added Stone, 
 "That it has caused no serious hurt. 
 'Tis time that we should both be strong; 
 Besides, I need your counsel now. 
 By coming here you did no wrong. 
 The fact is, you once made a vow 
 To which I have a mind to hold 
 You, tho' the making was quite bold."

 She paused in cutting up her food, 
 Looked at him with wide opened eyes, 
 And really she was of some good 
 To him at any rate. She tries 
 To hide the glow that spreads her face. 
 The tremor of that gentle mouth. 
 'Twas now she did feel out of place, 
 When she was most in place, in truth. 
 Her look was questioning, ''Not here," 
 He said, 'T'll see you over there." 
 XXXV. 
 And now they talked of other things, 
 Of plans of church work, this and that. 
 Aunt Hannah in the kitchen sings 
 In minor key and pitch B flat, 
 And Mary, though the meal was good. 
 Had lost, it seems, her appetite. 
 And sparingly now ate the food 
 At which she started with delight. 
 What was it he would have her do? 
 She dared not guess, she thought she knew. 
 XXXVI. 
 He was so strange, that Raymond Stone, 
 So cold at times, so very 'Stern, 
 It seemed he loved himself alone ; 
 And yet one knew him but to learn 
 To love him ; loving him to do 
 What e'er he might desire one. 
 She dared not guess, she thought she knew. 
 But Rosie Hawkins now had gone. 
 She dared not guess she thought — but oh. 
 Was it not best to wait and know.

 The dinner finished both arose. 
 "Then you will to the chapel go 
 With me?" she asked. "Oh, I suppose — 
 But stop," he added, "I don't know." 
 He paused. "I cannot go just yet. 
 There is some work I am not through. 
 I'll finish it and then — now let 
 Me see — I may go home with you." 
 She smiled, "Oh do ; that will be fine. 
 I dared not think that pleasure mine." 
 XXXVIII. 
 He did not hear all that she said. 
 He left the room, and up the stair 
 She heard him nervously now tread. 
 She was alone, left standing-there. 
 Abrupt indeed, but that was "Ray." 
 She turned to Sis. Brown who came. 
 "Is Bro. Stone done gone away?" 
 "O just upstairs," now answ^ered Mame. 
 "And now, Aunt Hannah, won't you please 
 Just let me have the chapel keys." 
 XXXIX. 
 "Yes, chile; you fin' um hangin' thah 
 Upon that nail aside the doah. 
 It ain't too high, well I declah, 
 You's tall as Bro. Stone I'm suah." 
 Mame saw the keys and took them down, 
 Went out and hurried on toward 
 The chapel. Maybe Sifter Brown 
 Saw not the tears which Mame found hard 
 To keep from creeping down her cheeks. 
 The little chapel there she seeks 
A STRANGE STORY. 23 t 
 XL. 
 To cry, as she has oft before, 
 In thinking of the days that were, 
 Days, happy days, forever o'er, 
 Yet bright in memory to her. 
 Why had he come into her hfe? 
 Why should he still have poWer o'er 
 Her, though she was another's wife? 
 Ah, did she love him as of yore ? 
 And if she did was he to blame? 
 No, 'twas herself alone, thought Mame. 
 XLL 
 But, as before the organ she 
 Sat to run o'er the music, sweet. 
 Beneath her touch the melody 
 Came to her, and when one complete 
 She'd played, the passion just before 
 Had vanished and left nought behind. 
 When Rev. Stone passed in the door 
 And hither at the organ joined. 
 She merely turned and at him smiled 
 As sweet and simple as a child^ 
 XLH. 
 Then went on with her playing. He 
 Stood by as in the former days 
 And turned the leaves most gallantly. 
 'Twas once she turned to find his gaze 
 Straight down upon her. It was so queer 
 She trembled but continued still. 
 Just stopping long enough to hear 
 His praises of her magic skill, 
 Until at last her work was through. 
 She'd know now what he'd have her do.

 XLIII. 
 Thus on the organ stool she wheeled. 
 Close to her side a chair he drew. 
 She was excited, but concealed 
 As best she could her feeling. ''You 
 Made me a vow some time ago." 
 ''Yes," 'she assented, calm and soft. 
 His voice was measured, grave and slow. 
 "A vow which I have thought of oft." 
 She nodded, restlessly her foot 
 Into a dozen postures put. 
 XLIV. 
 "A vow, you know, of sympathy." 
 "O, yes ; go on, don't linger, Ray," 
 'Twas now she said impatiently. 
 "I will, but please don't hurry me, May- 
 You said, whenever I should need 
 Advice or counsel you would give." 
 "I did, and meant it then, indeed, 
 And now," she said, "long as I live.'* 
 "You know," he said, "I'm here alone." 
 There was a sadness in his tone. 
 XLV. 
 She nodded, "Certainly, go on." 
 "You are the only one that knows. 
 Or that I know full well," said Stone. 
 "Mame, I am deep in love with Rose !" 
 She did not speak, she did not move; 
 She sat erect as statue there. 
 To hear him say he was in love, 
 Was not so strange .to her, 'twa-s clear ; 
 But why should he in her confide? 
 She waited long ere she replied. 
A STRANGE STORY. 233 
 XLVL 
 ''I did not think that when 1 made 
 The vow that such as this should be; 
 I did not think that my small aid 
 Should in this channel run," said she. 
 ''How can I help you if you are, 
 You've let her go from out your grip ; 
 From what I heard she is too far, 
 Except, perhaps, you take a trip 
 To where she is — that would not do, 
 Except, some one invited you." 
 XLVII. 
 He sat there like a great big boy. 
 His face no longer drawn and stern. 
 She really felt a thrill of joy 
 In seeing things take just this turn. 
 She knew not what was coming; he 
 Had but apprised her of his love 
 For Rose. Upon her sympathy 
 Had wished that she his aid might prove. 
 ''What part in this am I to play?" 
 *'Find out how long she intends to stay." 
 XLvni. 
 "Why, that is easy ; why not you ?" 
 "I do not want it to be known 
 That I have missed her, since 'tis true 
 I did not know that she had gone." 
 "But as her pastor can't you know ?" 
 "Yes, as her pastor, but, you see, 
 I fear I've made her even go ; 
 I was so stupid. List to me, 
 Mame. You must help me out of this 
 Or the acme of my life I'll miss. 
 XLIX. 
 "Now, find out where she is and write; 
 Say anything you wish to say, 
 Write in a manner to excite 
 Her to return. You'll do it. May?" 
 He pleaded. "What I can," she said. 
 I think I have Miss Wright's address, 
 If somewhere I have not mislaid. 
 You know, Ray, that your happiness 
 Despite of everything 'shall be 
 My own; don't you think that of me?" 
 L. 
 "I do," he said and pressed her hand. 
 "I do, may heaven bless you, Mame. 
 And now we better understand 
 Each other, do we not? Our aim 
 To make each other happy — thus?" 
 "Yes, Ray, as long as life shall last — 
 Ah, heaven, it was that guided us ! 
 I now can see, within the past 
 You did not love me as you do 
 This girl. I knew it Ray, I knezv!" 
 LI. 
 She rase, and tears welled from her eyes. 
 He caught her hands in his again. 
 "There, Mame, don't, don't, it is not wise; 
 And would you have me thus remain ?" 
 "No, no," she said, "that selfish were. 
 'Twere better that you had a wife, 
 A woman gentle and sincere 
 To brighten up your lonely life. 
 But, Ray, have you not, you not heard 
 What others say — not that a word

 LII. 
 *'Is true," she hastened then to add, 
 As on his brow she saw the frown. 
 "I do not think at all she's bad, 
 But people try to drag her down, 
 By talking. Do you care for this?" 
 "I do not," now he answered, stern. 
 ''About her I saw nought amiss. 
 Had all the chance I wished to learn. 
 'Tis all a pack of jealousy 
 That follows the whole family." 
 LIII. 
 "The same way with her sister, too, 
 Before she married," Mame now said, 
 ''But after that as Rosie grew, 
 'Twas at her door the talk was laid." , 
 "Yes, so I understand," said Stone, 
 "And I'm disgusted with it all. 
 These folks must let this child alone, 
 Or else a halt I'll have to call." 
 And here he thought 'twas time to stop. 
 And therefore let the matter drop. 
 LIV. 
 "I guess," said Stone, "but here, 'tis four. 
 I promised to accompany you. 
 I'm glad you came to-day, I'm sure. 
 This talk has made me feel brand new." 
 "A different man, I guess," 'she smiled. 
 "Well, yes, perhaps, I'm somewhat so." 
 "You look just like a great big child. 
 The child you were ten years ago. 
 They say love makes us young again." 
 "Then henceforth I shall young remain.'* 
 LV. 
 She sighed, ''O Ray, do you not know, 
 I've wished I had a brother, and 
 To-day I feel that it is so. 
 Somehow, when you took hold my hand 
 I felt a thrill so very strange — 
 No, not like what I used to feel. 
 'Twas different, a sudden change, 
 And now my soul doth too reveal 
 That thrill, must be the tenderness 
 One mother's children may possess." 
 LVI. 
 She stopped, her hand ran o'er her brow. 
 She seemed as if she would recall 
 Some secret of the past. "And now," 
 She quickly said, "Ray, now that all 
 Is clear between us, to my mind 
 There comes a dream that I have had 
 At least three times, in which I find 
 Myself a child, and there's a lad 
 With whom I played, I thought my brother. 
 But foolish, why should I now bother 
 LVIL 
 "You with such superstitious things? 
 'Twas but a dream, a dream that's all. 
 Despite the longing that it brings, 
 'Tis folly that I should recall 
 It at this instant. Let me, Ray, 
 Be your true sister, anyhow; 
 Just always call me 'Sister May,' 
 Then I can better keep my vow. 
 I am so lonely here, you see. 
 Could you not brother be to me?" 
A STRANGE STORY. 237 
 LVIIL 
 She gazed up at him where he stood. 
 His eyes were watery, look was grave. 
 To her he never seemed so good, 
 So noble, princely and so brave. 
 "Yes, Ray," she whispered, ''all alone, 
 Except my husband, nor kit nor kin. 
 My brother, could you not be one, 
 Were it too much love to win?" 
 *'No, no, my child," he tenderly said. 
 And gently on her shoulders laid 
 LIX. 
 His hand. "Mame, I a story might 
 Relate to you if you will hear, 
 But as 'tis getting toward night 
 I cannot tell it now, I fear. 
 We'll slowly walk along the way * 
 And I w^ill tell it briefly then. 
 Somehow, I feel like it to-day, 
 And I may ne'er feel so again. 
 I'll go and tell Aunt Hannah, see? 
 To-night she need not wait for me." 
 LX. 
 "All right, Mel. will be glad also 
 To have you with us there at tea. 
 Of course, to-day he had to go 
 To town, and, may be, late 'twill be 
 Ere he returns, but how some'er. 
 He will be glad when he gets home 
 To find you there, you need not fear. 
 He's always glad to have you come. 
 He's always asking if I've been 
 And all about your larder seen." 
 LXL 
 They left the chapel, locked the door, 
 And Stone unto the parsonage went. 
 She waited for him, and when o'er 
 Five minutes waiting had been spent, 
 'Twas then he in appearance put, 
 But not as he had left her there. 
 For now dressed in another suit 
 Of lightish gray, slick brushed his hair, 
 A heavy walking stick, he came 
 All smiles to where stood waiting, Mame. 
 LXII. 
 *'How foppish!" she exclaimed, "and then 
 To leave me waiting here for you." 
 He smiled. They started dowji the lane. 
 Aunt Hannah stood to see the two, 
 There on the porch, and waved farewell. 
 As Mary shook her slender hand, 
 She holloed gayly, "Now, don't tell; 
 Just keep it mum, you understand." 
 And with one last mischievous look, 
 'Twas at Ray's side her place she took. 
 Lxni. 
 ''Your story, Ray." ''O yes," he said, 
 ''The story is my history. 
 Somehow, your words to-day have made 
 It all come back to memory. 
 You know I was an orphan, but 
 You never knew my life in full. 
 For years a seal I've ever put 
 Upon it. Yet when hours are dull 
 I often think of one beside 
 Whose bed I stood until she died, 
A STRANGE STORY. 239 
 LXIV. 
 'That was my mother, Mame. I was 
 But eight years old when that occurred. 
 I felt, however, all, alas, 
 A boy could feel, and with no word 
 To tell it. Father went away 
 Somewhere, I do not really know. 
 It was a year up to that day, 
 And mother had been very low. 
 Beside her sister stood with me, 
 My only sister, scarcely three. 
 LXV. 
 ''And sister was a wee small thing, 
 Just like my father, so they said. 
 Ma sang until too weak to sing; 
 And that day, lying on the bed. 
 She called us to her. Tenderly 
 She told us that she 'Soon would leave. 
 That we should both good children be, 
 And after her w^e should not grieve. 
 Of course w-e could not understand, 
 But stood there as she pressed our hand." 
 LXVI. 
 He paused, and tears w^ere in his eyes, 
 And slowly coming dowai each cheek. 
 Mame glanced up to him, felt arise 
 A choking, but she did not speak. 
 Her slender arm slipped into his 
 A handkerchief stole to her face. 
 To her this silence sacred is. 
 Beside him she kept equal pace 
 And waited till he should resum^e 
 His story of those hours of gloom. 
 LXVII. 
 *'She said that father might return/ 
 He went on, as they walked along. 
 ''If not, that I should try to earn 
 Something for little sister. Strong, 
 I had been picking here and there 
 A coin or two at jobs at times, 
 And these had helped along to bear 
 Expenses. Carefully hoarded dimes 
 Had bought a many a pound of meat 
 For her and Sister Kate to eat. 
 Lxvni. 
 **We lived in such an humble place, 
 A short street in two dowdy rooms 
 Where never a decent person's face 
 Was ever seen, and deadly fumes 
 Of gas oozed up from sewers so 
 That weak lunged people could not live. 
 Fve often thought, but do not know. 
 This was the very thing to give 
 Mother her death. But how some'er 
 It was not long she lingered there. 
 LXIX. 
 "When father went away we did 
 Not live in such a place, but when 
 All of our means were spent, and rid 
 Of our best furniture, some men 
 Came and told us that we must go, 
 Because ma could not pay the rent. 
 Of course we had to, since, you know, 
 We had used up our every cent, 
 And mother looked in vain to hear 
 From father, so we just moved there. 
A STRANGE STORY. 24 1 
 LXX. 
 ''In turn she pressed irs to her breast, 
 And Sister Kate began to cry. 
 Then mother whispered, 'God knows best. 
 Trust Him, my children, now good-by.' 
 And then she hummed in whisper low, 
 A look of sweet peace on her brow, 
 'If my Lord calls me I must go 
 To meet Him in the promised land,' and now, 
 She sang, as she stretched out her hand, 
 Til away, I'll away to the promised land.' 
 LXXL 
 "I did not know that 'she had gone. 
 I thought she simply went to sleep. 
 We stood beside the bed alone, 
 Too young to understand or weep. 
 She did not speak to us again. 
 Tho' still we lingered at her side. 
 I called her, called her louder then, 
 And little sister sobbed and cried. 
 Some people from the next house came 
 And led us from the bedside, Mame." 
 LXXII. 
 He stopped a moment as to take 
 A breath for strength, his arm she pressed, 
 But spoke not, did not need to speak, 
 That movement sympathy expressed. 
 "Somebody had her laid away, 
 A decent burial, they said. 
 I never knew who came to pay. 
 But all expenses soon were paid. 
 And sister, never could I tell 
 Who took her, but they said 'twas well.

 LXXIII. 
 "1 ? Well, I had no where to go. 
 Folks said that I was no account, 
 And thus I drifted, drifted so 
 None ever thought I would amount 
 To much at all. From that time on 
 I never saw my father or 
 My sister, such a wee young one. 
 I know not what became of her. 
 Sometimes I really think I shall 
 Meet her somewhere, yes, after all. 
 LXXIV. 
 ''Of course I was too hard to die. 
 I slept in whate'er place I could ; 
 Sold papers, learnt all trickery. 
 Was everything, I guess, but good. 
 And yet, it seemed, I got along. 
 Went through life like a little tough; 
 And yet, I fought against the wrong, 
 And, altho' others thought me rough, 
 I tried to be what mother said, 
 A good boy, 'spite the life I led. 
 LXXV. 
 "Of course, I was not all the time, 
 Mine a peculiar circumstance. 
 'Twas as one who must live in slime, 
 Who never had been given a chance 
 To get from out of it, you see. 
 Nobody thought me any good, 
 I found nobody's company 
 Except the rudest of the rude. 
 And I just could not live apart, 
 I had a kind of social heart, 
A STRANGE STORY. 243 
 LXXVI. 
 One day when I was seventeen 
 I stood on look-out for a job. 
 A lady, marketing had been, 
 I saw a man attempt to rob. 
 I knew not how it all was done, 
 But ere I knew it, I was there; 
 The fellow from one blow alone 
 Lay stretched out flat. Around us were 
 A crowd, and they all praising me 
 For quickness, strength and bravery. 
 LXXVII. 
 *'Unto this lady, Mame, I owe 
 My education. She it was 
 First gave me means and bade me go 
 To school. This lady ever has 
 Kept me in correspondence e'en 
 Since I've been in the ministry, 
 And she my constant friend has been. 
 From her large gifts of charity 
 Have come to help the poor I have 
 Upon my work. To all she gave. 
 LXXVIII. 
 • " 'Tis true, ten years ago, well, I 
 Was not the man I should have been. 
 You knew me then. Well, I 'lived high,' 
 As runs the phrase. You might have seen 
 Just how I lived, and thought, I guess. 
 My folks w^ere rich, but no, 'twas she. 
 Who even now would give no less 
 If I one hour in need should be. 
 These fifteen years she's followed me 
 Wherever I might chance to be.

 *'My life has been a rugged one, 
 And yet God's hand in all I've seen. 
 I've not been perfect — always done 
 The good thing. What I might have been. 
 Have often failed to be; and yet 
 I've tried since I have had the Light 
 To do my duty, never let 
 One moment find me from the right. 
 How much I have 'succeeded, well, 
 God knows, and He some day will tell." 
 LXXX. 
 *Toor Ray," she sighed. Again she pressed 
 His arm to her fast throbbing side. 
 He felt the sympathy expressed 
 And tried in vain his tears to hide. • 
 *The story of my life I, too, 
 Will tell you if you wish it, Ray. 
 I see why I've admired you. 
 You were so 'strange in every way. 
 Now proud I am to have you be

 LXXXII. 
 ''My sister — yes, I would you were 
 The wee small sister taken away." 
 He turned and gravely looked at her. 
 "I am, don't you believe it Ray?" 
 She laughed. "God gave you unto me 
 To be the brother I have seen 
 Within that dream, so can't you be? 
 Whatever now there might have been, 
 I am your sister now." And they 
 Into the gate turned from the way.

 The sun had set, the 'sky was red, 
 And dark against it rose the wood. 
 ''How beautiful the twihght," said 
 Mame, as for a while they stood 
 Inside the gate. "God's light it is. 
 No artist such can execute," 
 Said gravely Stone. "I would not miss 
 This sight for aught." "It seems to suit 
 My mind also, but gracious me, 
 You know I must get ready tea. 
 LXXXIII. 
 "Let's to the house or 'twill be late." 
 "O pshaw ! and how abrupt you are ! 
 My sister must not have that trait; 
 She must poetic be by far," 
 He said. She laughed as now toward 
 The house they went. "Well, let it be ; 
 Somebody will be thinking hard 
 If when the time comes there's no tea; 
 Betwixt the two I think I'd take 
 The tea just for the stomach's sake."

 MAME'S STORY. 
 I. 
 Two rivers, from the self >same source, 
 Divided on a mountain ridge, 
 And down the vaUeys rushed with force, 
 Spanned here and there by many a bridge. 
 On, on they wound, sometimes their flow 
 As gentle as a level lake, 
 When through the valleys gliding slow. 
 Their courses oceanward they take; 
 And many a hamlet they passed by 
 While onward flowing to the sea ; 
 II. 
 And many a creaking wheel they turned ; 
 And many a miller's corn they ground; 
 By rriany a wind their waters churned ; 
 And many a wTCck on them was found. 
 When miles by them have traversed been 
 Through many a valley broad and deep ; 
 Through many a marsh land low and green, 
 Where lazy alligators sleep, 
 Ere either reached the boundless main 
 Their waters meet, unite again.

 "Now, Reverend, make yourself at home; 
 Excuse me, I must haul to-day. 
 I'm always glad for you to come. 
 And hope you will not rush away. 
 The madam, she will treat you right, 
 Make up for what I fail to do," 
 So Melville said next morning bright, 
 To Stone out in the barnyard, who 
 Had offered to go out that day 
 And help him get his corn away. 
 IV. 
 *'No ; go into the house and read, 
 Or take it easy while you can. 
 I don't believe that I have need 
 To-day for any extra man. 
 Besides, I fear, the work we do 
 You never would have power to 'stand. 
 'Twould kill you in a day or two," 
 He smiled. "You see, to till the land 
 I do not think God called you, see? 
 Your general build is proof to me." 
 V. 
 "I'm not afraid of work, you know." 
 "Of course you're not, but Bro. Stone, 
 You see, it don't become you, though. 
 'Tis best to let such work alone." 
 "Come, Reverend. Yiou're not strong enough," 
 Called Mary from the kitchen door. 
 "I know you think yourself quite tough, 
 But you are not, now I'm quite sure." 
 She smiled and shook the table cloth. 
 "Come, or I'll have to Svhale' you both." 
 VI. 
 *'Go, Reverend, she will care for you," 
 Said Melville as he drove away. 
 ''So be it," Stone replied, ''since you 
 Have no need of my help to-day," 
 And in the barnyard there he stood 
 Until Melville, his honest host, 
 Had disappeared behind the wood, 
 In deepest kind of revery lost. 
 Until a sweet voice from the door — 
 "Pray, now, what are you dreaming o'er?' 
 VII. 
 He turned to see Mame standing there. 
 The picture of fond sympathy. 
 "What is it now? Do come in here 
 And tell .your secrets all to me." 
 He smiled, "I thank you, but I need 
 To burden none with woes of mine. 
 You are, I own, a friend indeed. 
 But pardon me if I decline 
 To run to you with all my woes. 
 Whatever thing wrong with me goes." 
 VIIL 
 "Come in the house; don't stand out there 
 And brood," she said impatiently. 
 "I've ^something I would like you hear. 
 If yofi w^ll only list to me." 
 She waited till he crossed the yard 
 And came and stood there at the door. 
 "Come, Ray, for it is very hard 
 For me to keep what I am sure 
 With interest you will listen to. 
 You know last night I promised you 
mame^s story. 249

 "The story of my life I'd tell." 
 (Him to the dining room she led.) 
 "There, make yourself comfortable — 
 You'll find it ver}^ long, Fm 'fraid. 
 Be seated." And herself she threw 
 Carelessly into the rocker there; 
 And for her feet a hassock drew, 
 Then pointed to a Morris chair. 
 He took the chair. In silence he 
 Sat there to hear her history.

 "When I recall my childhood days. 
 Within the little village B — , 
 There comes a gentle woman's face, 
 Fresh now upon my memory. 
 This was my mother, Ray, and one 
 Sweet as an angel from above. 
 Whose gentle heart, it seemed, alone 
 Was made that it might beat in love. 
 Here in a cottage near the sea 
 My childhood days passed merrily.

 "My father was a man as kind 
 As any father e'er could be : 
 It seemed he ever bore in mind 
 The things that pleasure were to me. 
 And there was never a girl in town, 
 However rich her people were. 
 That ever wore a better gown 
 Than I. Nor ever did occur

 *'You see, there was but me alone, 
 No other that great love to share ; 
 I lived, as the swift years rolled on. 
 The only object of their care. 
 Perhaps, 'twas true that I was spoiled, 
 Was somewhat selfi'sh in my way, 
 But since I was the only child, 
 No fault can one against them lay. 
 They loved me far beyond my worth, 
 I was the happiest child on earth.

 ''My father was a fisherman. 
 He made his living from the sea. 
 And often for long weeks was gone 
 Far, far beyond the quiet bay 
 To seek the oily cod. 'Twas then 
 I often sat on the white sand 
 And watched day after day again 
 For his return. Along the ^strand 
 I gathered pebbles, or the shells 
 Strewed o'er the beach there by the swells. 
 XIV. 
 "Glad was I when there came in sight 
 Most plainly 'gainst the eastern sky 
 My father's craft, her sails so white. 
 Spread to the breeze with colors high. 
 And never a heart like mine could beat 
 As when I holloed 'Boat ahoy !' 
 Or with affectionate ki'ss would greet, 
 In the heat of childish joy. 
 O happy days they were when we 
 Dwelt in the cottage by the sea.

 " 'Twas true, when fearful storms came up, 
 And father was out on the deep, 
 And mother hoped against all hope, 
 At night for us was little sleep. 
 Once I remember how the wind 
 Had blown the breakers mountains high. 
 Along the beach the spray would blind 
 As dark and angry grew the sky. 
 We walked that beach that live-long night 
 To see each moment loom in sight 
 XVI. 
 "My father''s vessel rent apart. 
 The sun came up, the storm had fled, 
 And there we stood with fearful heart 
 To see the dying and the dead. 
 There with the anxious company 
 Of fishermen's wives down on the sand, 
 As now and then the rolling sea 
 Brought broken mast heads to the land, 
 'Twas hard to hold our grief in check 
 When all beheld had been a wreck. 
 XVII. 
 "But O the joy when cross the blue 
 And heaving waters was aspied 
 My father's ves'sel, staunch and true, 
 Sail homeward on the flooding tide! 
 And O the cheering cry that went 
 Up from that little crowd that stood 
 There on the beach, necks seaward bent^ 
 All eyes upon the vessel glued ! 
 O joyous was the hour when 
 My father landed with his men!

 'Tather believed in learning, though 
 He was a simple seaman, rough, 
 Who had but little chance to know 
 The letter, yet he knew enough 
 To man a vessel, and could sail 
 Those waters on the darkest night ; 
 Nor feared to weather any gale. 
 He held that it was only right 
 That I 'should educated be 
 Off his snug living from the sea. 
 XIX. 
 ''And I learnt fast. The school to which 
 I went was mixed, of course, you know, 
 With white and black, the poor and rich. 
 Yet none a difference would show. 
 I soon passed out the common grade, 
 And father of me very proud 
 In seeing all the marks I made, 
 And hearing others praising loud. 
 Thought I should finish in some place 
 Built and conducted by our race.

 "So I wa's just fifteen, you know. 
 Quite strongly built and athlete. 
 I really did not wi'sh to go 
 Into new places, there to meet 
 Strange faces, learn new manners, but 
 'Twas father's wish and I obeyed. 
 I held my peace, his plans he put 
 In operation. Soon were made 
 Trunks full of clothing, trinklets, all, 
 To make me quite comfortable.

 "Ma grieved to see me go, but she 
 Too held her peace, nor said a word. 
 Of course, it was all plain to me, 
 I felt how deep her heart was stirred. 
 And noticed how she oft would sit 
 And look at me with such a gaze : 
 I knew not what to make of it. 
 Until it was in after days 
 That look came back to me and I 
 Had partly solved the mystery. 
 XXII. 
 "Why tire you ? I took my leave 
 Of parents, cottage and the sea; 
 Of loving friends, I left to grieve, 
 Yet hoping best of things in me. 
 My father, smelling still of salt, 
 Down at the train to see me off. 
 He did not cry, 'twas not his fault ; 
 He said good-by and only coughed. 
 And kissed me as the warning bell 
 Bade him that he must 'say farewell. 
 XXIII. 
 "That morning at the station there 
 Was the last time I saw him, Ray. 
 One day, they said, when all was fair. 
 In his staunch craft he sailed away.. 
 And then, it seems, that very night 
 A storm came up, an awful storm. 
 Folks on the beach swore that in sight 
 They saw the craft, my father's form. 
 Perhaps a phantom it had been, 
 But father never more was 'seen. 
 XXIV. 
 ''Nor was the craft, nor was the crew, 
 Four brave young men with him went down 
 In those dark waters deep and blue, 
 The sturdiest fellows in the town. 
 You may remember when I went 
 Home from the school, well it was then. 
 Ma had the tidings to me sent 
 How he was lost with craft and men.

 Who with herself sustained a loss. 
 Each morning after that, arose,. 
 Calm and serene, to take her cross :

 wShe went out on her mission, Ray, 
 The sick, the lowly, every one, 
 That needed consolation, there, 
 She was, with kindly word or prayer.

 '* 'Return to school,' she said to me. 
 'It is his will, that we should keep. 
 I wish that he had lived to see 
 You graduate. Let us not weep,' 
 She added as the tears rolled down 
 My cheeks, as I recalled the day, 
 I saw him hardy, beaten, brown, 
 Just as the train had pulled away. 
 'God knows just what is best for us. 
 His will be done, it must be thus.'

 "So I returned to school. You know 
 My little life within those walls. 
 You were my first, my only beau. 
 Tho'se happy moments one recalls, 
 The walks from chapel, and the teas. 
 My boarding mistress gave for you; 
 The pleasant nights when autumn breeze 
 In southern climates balmy blew. 
 Ah, you know all about them, Ray, 
 But let it buried be, you say. 
 XXVIII. 
 "And when I graduated, I 
 Of course unto my home returned, 
 And there I taught, though privately, 
 And quite a little sum I earned. 
 We owned our cottage, and beside. 
 Pa left us quite a snug amount 
 In the town bank. I could provide 
 By teaching all that we should want 
 To spend for food, and so I spent 
 Two years within my home content. 
 XXIX. 
 "But some how, Fate had marked me for 
 Her own ; when I was happy, then 
 Another sadness must occur 
 To make me feel I lived in vain. 
 One day ma called me to her side, 
 Calm and serene as she had been 
 All through her life, so true and tried, 
 Through all the sorrow she had seen. 
 'My child,' she said, 'don't frightened be, 
 Your father calls me from the sea, 
 XXX. 
 ** 'And I must go to him.' I heard 
 The words as I have heard the knell 
 That sounded in the fog as 'stirred 
 By tossing waves, the buoy bell. 
 'No, mother, 'tis a dream,' I said, 
 'You need to leave this place and go 
 Down south with me a while. I'm 'fraid 
 You think too much of things,' but 'No,' 
 She answered, 'It is all too plain. 
 He calls, I must not here remain. 
 XXXI. 
 " 'There is a pain about my heart, 
 A pain which soon shall bring me to 
 Your father. Do I hate to part. 
 My dearest, dearest child, from you? 
 Don't ask me. I would go to him. 
 I've lived to see you graduate. 
 To realize your father'^s dream. 
 Why should he longer for me wait? 
 Yet daughter, ere I from you go, . 
 There is a secret you must know.-*

 "Within the sitting room we were, 
 Where opened a window to the sea ; 
 The day was beautiful and fair. 
 'Twas spring, the birds sang merrily. 
 On a large sofa ma reclined, 
 A downy pillow 'neath her head. 
 Calm peace was in her face outlined. 
 Her eyes half closed. 'Twas soft she said 
 'Forgive me if I cause you pain. 
 Yet 'tis my duty to explain.' 
MAME S STORY. 257

 "And then she went on to relate 
 How I when but a child was brought 
 To her by father. That his mate 
 Within a Southern State had sought 
 Him with me, stating I had been 
 An old friend's daughter wdio was dead, 
 A struggling w^oman who had seen 
 Much better days. And thus he prayed 
 That I be cared for. Thus it came 
 To pass pa took me, called me Mame.

 ''So as their child they reared me, since 
 God had not blessed them with a child, 
 And sought no farther evidence 
 As to my parentage, but toiled 
 To make me happy. This 'same mate 
 Soon after disappeared, 'twas thought 
 Went back into this Southern State 
 And gave up sailing. I was brought 
 Up in the knowledge that alone 
 These were my parents. She was done.

 ''On that same night my mother died 
 Just as the hour of twelve drew on, 
 And roaring flooded in the tide 
 That joined me sobbing o'er her gt)ne. 
 So I was all alone. Just where 
 We used to sit and watch the sea 
 In all its rollings, 'twas out there 
 Within the church yard 'neath a tree 
 We buried her, her friends and mine. 
 Her body, for her soul must shine

 "Before God's bright and glorious throne. 
 Thus as she Hved, it seemed she died, 
 Calm and serene, my mother, none 
 But her I knew, and, Ray, beside. 
 None could a better mother prove. 
 She nourished, cherished me, what more? 
 Could any show a deeper love? 
 No ; never was a mother bore 
 A greater love for child than she 
 In her calm life bore, Ray, for me." 
 XXXVII. 
 She ceased, arose and knelt beside 
 The chair, her arm upon his knee. 
 She gazed up to him wistful eyed, 
 In a childlike simplicity. 
 He looked and met her wistful gaze. 
 He took her trembling hands between 
 His own strong ones, as in the days 
 When they to each had different been. 
 "O, Life ! how strange, who understands !" 
 He murmured, pressing close her hands.

 '*0h, take me as your sister, Ray!" 
 In pleading tones she softly cries, 
 **The tiny sister taken away 
 From you." But nothing he replies. 
 He simply sits and looks at her, 
 And tries to read the long ago. 
 He saw how strange their two lives were, 
 How much alike. Ah, could he know 
 The truth? — the truth alone to see, 
 To penetrate this mystery.

 THE WINTER NIGHT VISITOR. 
 I. 
 O night of nights in the winter cold, 
 When how^ls the north wind thro' the trees ! 
 And snow Hes thick in field and wold, 
 Who dares to face the chilling breeze ? 
 Who is it, when the ram and sleet 
 Transform the trees in icy sprays. 
 By some warm hearthstone scorns a seat 
 To watch the leaping of the blaze? 
 Cold comfort his on such a night 
 Away from such a fire bright. 
 II. 
 To-night will Farmer Jones bring out 
 The walnuts, gathered in the fall. 
 And Sam and John and Jim^ no doubt, 
 Will try their best to crack them all ; 
 Or better still, the corn will pop. 
 Held over reeking coals of fire ; 
 Then eat, and eat, and never stop 
 Until they get their soul's desire; 
 Or roast large chestnuts by the quart, 
 'Midst stories that must cheer the heart, 
THE WINTER NIGHT VISITOR. 26 1 
 III. 
 To-night the back-log lately rolled 
 Into its place, is blazing bright; 
 Altho' without, 'tis sleet and cold, 
 Wi-thin, 'tis warmth and cheer to-night. 
 If Farmer John goes to the door, 
 Looks out into the cold and dark, 
 And hears the whistling rush and roar 
 Of wind and rain, 'tis to remark 
 In catching breaths of the chilled air, 
 The morrow would be hardly clear. 
 IV. 
 Before the fire-place to-night, 
 Contented with the ruddy glow. 
 And wishing for no other light. 
 As loud and wild the wind doth blow, 
 Within the living room sat Stone, 
 And watched the fire's fitful leap, 
 As burns the logs down, one by one. 
 Before he goes upstairs to sleep ; 
 And as he watched the dying blaze, 
 His fancy images portrays. 
 V. 
 Who has not sat on such a night. 
 Before just 'such a blazing fire. 
 By Fancy's cunning aid caught sight 
 Of fort and castle, moat and spire ; 
 Of cliffs and grottoes, ancient piles 
 Of architecture, rising walls; 
 Or with their broad and spacious aisles, 
 Interiors of great cathedrals? 
 And so sat Stooe on such an hour 
 In the embrace of Fancy's power.

 The wind blows cold, ah, cold without. 
 He does not know it, warm within. 
 He hears alone the trees about 
 Creak with the ice, the fall of rain. 
 He simply hears the doleful moan, 
 And thanks his God that he is there, — 
 There, yes, altho' he is alone. 
 With none his little home to share ; 
 There sheltered from the wintry blast, 
 With food and fuel, too, to last. 
 vn. 
 Brown Chapel members for him cared. 
 They would not let him be in want. 
 With him each one his larder shared, 
 And there was wood to great amount. 
 His lonely life they tried to cheer"; 
 No day within the week went by 
 Except some one of them came there 
 To find just what he needed; aye, 
 If e'er a people did di'splay 
 Love for their pastor, surely they. 
 VIII. 
 Three times that week had Hawkins been 
 To see him ; and the^e times had brought 
 Some dainty, or substantial, — seen 
 That he such times was out of nought. 
 And Melville, Gray and others came. 
 All with their little offerings, 
 A large fruit-cake sent him by Mame, 
 And many other dainty things ; 
 And so, despite the storm without, 
 Stone felt deep gratitude, no doubt.

 And Rose, oh, where was Rose? Away 
 Attending school another year. 
 'Twas Dora's urging had her stay; 
 And country hfe had been so drear. 
 'Twas easy to get pa's consent, 
 And mother thought it very wise; 
 For, well she saw what Rosie meant, 
 And at her turn had no surprise; 
 Thus sent her what she wished them to, 
 And bade her well her course pursue. 
 X. 
 And Stone, he bore it bravely ; all 
 In silence went along his way; 
 Approved the acts at his next call 
 Upon them, and took lunch that day. 
 Still when 'twas from the house he came 
 He did not turn into the lane. 
 But hastened that he might see Mame. 
 And when he left her house again 
 His heart was full of hope and cheer, 
 And deemed both women doubly dear. 
 XL 
 To-night, as he sat here alone, 
 His feet against the fire-place, 
 That old-time grave, stern look is gone. 
 He has a calm but hopeful face. 
 When Christmas comes, himself he tells. 
 When Christmas comes, in two weeks' time. 
 Amidst the ringing of the bells. 
 Amidst the holidays' glad chime, 
 A letter written to Mame shows 
 That he should once more see his Rose. 
2Ch\ BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XII. 
 That he should once more see his Rose? 
 He dared not call her his as yet. 
 Three months, a girl so quickly grows 
 Indifferent, he must not let 
 Himself too much presume when, too, 
 He had not written her a word ; 
 If anything at all he knew, 
 'Twas through Mame's writing he had heard. 
 A letter seldom came but spoke 
 Of him in some kind, playful joke. 
 XIII. 
 One said, 'T trust our minister 
 Will not forget the wild, wild Rose 
 He plucked. Perhaps he might prefer 
 One that within a hot-house grows, 
 But strange, you'll say, quite 'strange, dear Mame, 
 If you should think of it alone, 
 However a wild rose became 
 To grow supported by a stone. 
 Poor nourishment I think, don't you? 
 Don't fail to write me soon, adieu ;" 
 XIV. 
 Or in another, *T have thought 
 To-day so much about you all. 
 It seems within my life there's nought 
 But what I can this hour recall 
 Some sweet, bright moments I have spent 
 Right there within the parish, Mame. 
 And I have thought I'd be content, 
 If such again were mine to claim. 
 But, Dora, says, I should aspire 
 Unto a nobler desire.

 ''And yet, what's nobler than to be I

 Thus ran the letters one by one, 
 These letters which Mame to him read. 
 These are the thoughts he dreams upon 
 To-night, as oak coals smothering red, 
 Make fancy's pictures in the fire, 
 As howl's the wind in puffs w'ithout, 
 And makes the fiame within leap higher. 
 Hark, did he hear just now a shout, 
 Or was it but some cracking limb 
 Which at that moment startled him? 
 XIX. 
 *'Hello-oh !" what, a human voice — 
 A. traveller out on such a night? 
 And yet the wind doth make such noise 
 He can't believe he hears aright. 
 Yet to the door he goes at last. 
 And opening looks into the dark. 
 Sharp rushes in the wintry blast. 
 At first 'tis nothing he can mark. 
 "Who calls? Who is it calls?" he cried. 
 "Here, here we are," a voice replied. 
 XX. 
 *Ts this the parsonage?" Again, 
 "It is." He caught the dark outline 
 Of a sleigh down in the lane. 
 Just where the light began to shine, 
 Two figures. One is getting out 
 And coming now with bag and grip. 
 "Good night," he heard the other shout, 
 Of sudden give the horse the whip, 
 Dash off. The chime of bells was lost 
 Within the howling of the blast.

 The other figure onward came 
 In slow step to the parsonage, 
 A man it seemed of stalwart frame, 
 But bent by either weight or age. 
 Stone, simply with his slippers on, 
 Stood till the man came to the door. * 
 ''Sir, and is this the Rev. Stone?" 
 "It is," said Stone, who looked him o'er. 
 '"Come in," the door he opened wide, 
 And bade the stranger step inside. 
 XXII. 
 "Ah, thank you, sir," and in he came 
 And set hi's baggage in the hall. 
 While from the hearth the ruddy flame 
 Cast a bright cheeriness o'er all. 
 He smiled to -see the inviting glow. 
 And when Stone took his coat and hat. 
 And brushed from off his boots the snow, 
 Strode in and there contented sat 
 Before it, rubbing through his hair 
 His horny hands as he sat there. 
 XXIIL 
 He was quite tall, of massive si*ze. 
 And his complexion, lightish brown, 
 A lofty brow, a pair of eyes 
 Beneath thick shaggy eye brows shone. 
 His nose was sharp, slight aquiline. 
 His lips, which were somewhat close pressed, 
 The sign of will, were rather thin. 
 He wore no beard, was bald, and dressed 
 Somewhat becomingly ; he wore 
 Such clothes which showed him far from poor. - •

 Stone who had been accustomed to 
 Such happenings, and kept prepared 
 A pot of tea or bowl of stew, 
 For istrangers, soon the stranger fared. 
 With a large cup of steaming tea. 
 ' "Take this, perhaps 'twill stimulate?" 
 'Thanks," said the old man gratefully, 
 "Am sure that such will get me straight. 
 XXV. 
 " 'Twas very cold out there, my lad," 
 He said slow measured gulps between. 
 "Despite the fact that I am clad 
 In o'er thick flannels. I have seen 
 Cold weather — stormy weather, but 
 This beats me in some forty years. 
 Yet 'tis a promise of much fruit. 
 Should it continue thus. One hears. 
 However, in this climate of 
 Such sudden, changes, 'tis small proof." 
 XXVL 
 "You are a stranger here?" asked Stone. 
 "O, yes, was never here before; 
 However, thirty years agone 
 I dwelt there on the western shore." 
 "Some 'pressing business brought you here, 
 I'm sure on such a stormy night. 
 Your mission may I ask?" " 'Tis clear 
 Your supposition is quite right ; 
 Ah, it is pressing business, son," 
 He said, and gravely looked at Stone.

 XXVII. 
 "You ask to know my mission, well, 
 I can't say it does not concern 
 Your parish, for the truth to tell, 
 I came to you to-night to learn 
 Where dwells a lady who was known 
 As Mary Brookins, who, I'm told 
 By many in your neighboring town 
 Taught school here. She w^as two years ola 
 When last I saw her ; thus you see 
 Should not be recognized by me." 
 XXVIII. 
 Stone looked the stranger o'er. Perchance 
 This was the mate of whom she spoke. 
 Back to him came each circumstance • 
 Of that strange story. He awoke 
 From his long dreaming to reply, 
 *Vl think I know of whom you speak. 
 She now is married, lives quite nigh; 
 Iler husband has been here this wxek." 
 "So near, and married ? Well, of course/' 
 He chuckled in a voice quite hoarse. 
 XXIX. 
 "And may I ask what you should be 
 To her?" asked Stone, his mind made up. 
 The stranger having drank the tea 
 Upon the table placed the cup, 
 And tilting back within the chair. 
 Gaped, rubbed his eyes and looked at Stone. 
 "My son, to tell you this much, there 
 Is quite a story, such a one 
 Which, maybe, lyou would never care 
 To listen to. But since you share 
 Your bed with me this stormy night, 
 Somethings, of course, you ought to know. 
 So, if you give me leave, I might 
 As well make known. Some years ago," 
 He went on, having Stone's consent, 
 ^^I left home on my fortune bent, 
 XXX. 
 ''And sought to rough it in the west. 
 T left my wife and children two, 
 And one a babe upon her breast, 
 With some small savings well to do, 
 Till they might hear from me. My wife, 
 A lovely woman, good and true. 
 Accustomed to a better life, 
 Unw^illing saw me go. 'Twas two 
 Weeks or after that I wrote 
 To her that she might have some note 
 XXXI. 
 ''Of how I fared. At first there came 
 Sweet letters full encouraging, 
 Av/akening in me the bright flame 
 To love and duty, firing 
 The husband's love, the father's pride; 
 And I was happy on the ranch, 
 Or the wild mustang's back astride, 
 Because of letters sweet from Blanche.' 
 What more? I must but send for her. 
 And that would make me happier. 
 XXXII. 
 "I sent a new crisp note, hard earned, 
 With loving messages to come. 
 And back tO' me her w^ord returned : 
 'No, I can never leave my home. 
 If you cannot return to me. 
 Then right here let the matter drop. 
 Despite our children, you are free. 
 Thanks for the money. You may stop 
 Your writing, lead your western life 
 Without me once for all. Your wife.'

 ''Such, parson, were the words that came 
 To me, a man whose love was pure. 
 Such water, cold to quench the flame, 
 To make disease time could not cure. 
 No more across the western plain 
 Happy, I rode my wild mustang; 
 My heart was crushed, it suffered pain. 
 No more the happy songs I sang. 
 Life seemed a dreary waste to me. 
 And still how different could it be? 
 XXXIV. 
 "Perhaps I should have sought my home, 
 And seen my wife and family, 
 But had she not there told me come. 
 These were her words, yes, 'you are free,' 
 I did not go. I never prayed 
 Till then to God. 'Twas then I bowed, 
 And all my tribulations laid 
 Before Him. If it were His rod, 
 I asked for patience thus to bear. 
 And silent worked with all my care. 
 . XXXV. 
 God blessed me. Soon I had secured 
 Enough to enter partnership 
 In cattle business. Still He poured 
 Upon me blessings; for each trip 
 Made to and fro but to me brought 
 A larger income and my hands 
 At last from growing fortune, bought 
 Broad stretching acres of farm lands, 
 And I became within the place 
 The richest ranchman of my race.

 That she for many a year was dead. 
 My boy and girl were well to do, 
 Though separate they lived, to each 
 Unknown, yet either I could reach. 
 xxxvn. 
 'That letter, lad, she never wrote. 
 The money never to her came. 
 'Twas intercepted, some one sought 
 To separate us — in the aim 
 Succeeded. 'Twas a blow to me ; 
 And yet within my heart I felt 
 Thankful to learn her constancy. 
 Despite the blow some one had dealt. 
 One thought alone took hold of me. 
 Come East and seek my family. 
 xxxvni. 
 "I came, my lad, and high and low 
 Have hunted, and it seems success 
 Has come to me, for now I know 
 A loving father's happiness. 
 She is my daughter, whom I seek, 
 This Mary Brookins." All at once 
 Stone rose, looked at him, tried to speak, 
 But failed, sat down. Each circumstance 
 Was their two stories o'er Lgain. 
 A sudden flash, and all was plain, 
THE WINTER NIGHT VISITOR. 273 
 "W!.o are you?" 'twas at la^t he broke; 
 The sleeping passion of his years 
 Within that manly breast awoke, 
 And waiting now, 'twixt hopes and fears. 
 To hear the answer. In a tore 
 Pathetic the old man replied, 
 *''My name, my son, is Raymond Stone." 
 "My father !" springing up, Stone cried, 
 And rushing there in tight embrace 
 Pressed face against his father's face. 
 XL. 
 The night wears on, the back log low 
 Burns to the hearth in living coals. 
 Without moans wind, and falls the snow, 
 ' All through the wood the tempest rolls. 
 Yes, night of nights, in the wanter cold, 
 When howls the north wind thro' the trees, 
 And snow lies thick in field and wold. 
 Who is it dares to face the breeze? 
 A father searching for his son. 
 He bids the angry blast blow on.

 Canto XX, 
 WINTER MORNING CONFESSION. 
 I. 
 And 'twas one of those ''candy days," 
 So often in the winter seen, 
 When trees are decked in icy sprays 
 Instead of robes of summer's green. 
 \\^hen only snow birds hopped about 
 The yard in anxious search of crumbs ; 
 And he who dares to walk without, 
 Somewhat an acrobat becomes. 
 Unless he has been roughly shod 
 To stick into the icy sod ; 
 11. 
 When cattle, huddled near the barn, 
 Beneath the hay and fodder ricks. 
 Slow crunching on the shucks of corn. 
 Or greedily the rock salt licks. 
 The horses waiting in the stalls. 
 For feed or water neighing shrill ; 
 Nor whit behind them in their calls, 
 The donkey's bray the air doth fill ; 
 And lustily the chanticleer 
 Doth crow that he himself might hear. 
WINTER MORNING CONFESSION. 275 
 III. 
 Behind the leaden clouds, the sun, 
 But two hours high strives to be seen. 
 Tree, roof and, sward, the ice thick on, 
 Now glistens in a silver sheen. 
 Down from the eaves in crystrals bright 
 The huge icicles melting hang, 
 But as the sun attains more height. 
 They fall in a tremendous bang, 
 And break in glittering gems below 
 Upon the deep hard frozen snow. 
 IV. 
 The Melville cottage is astir. 
 Last night had been so terrible, 
 Mame found but little sleep for her. 
 This morning she is feeling dull. 
 But up she was, her work about. 
 Melville the fires, long had made, 
 The house well heated, now was out 
 There in the barn. The cattle fed 
 And watered, to the house he came 
 To see what he could do for Mame. 
 V. 
 Thus was his wont. He loved his wife, 
 He had no wish to see her slave. 
 That he might pleasant make her life, 
 Such help as this he always gave. 
 "You don't look well this morning, dear," 
 She stood preparing biecuit dough. 
 Mame smiled, somehow 'twas sweet to hear 
 Him speak like that. She answered, *'No ; 
 Last night was such a terrible night 
 I did not rest well as I might." 
2^6 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 VI. 
 "I noticed vou were restless," he 
 Replied, '*in fact, I was awake." 
 "And you awake, too?" questioned she, 
 *'I did not know a thing could break 
 Your rest. It could not be the storm?" 
 ''Somehow it was, though not for me. 
 I wondered if 'twould any harm 
 Do to the parsonage. You see 
 The Reverend's up there all alone," 
 He said in somewhat anxious tone. 
 VII. 
 "O no, I guess not," she replied. 
 "The house, of course, is staunch and tight. 
 It's sheltered from the stormy side, 
 There by the woods, so it's all right." 
 "And yet I had such funny dreams !" 
 "You funny dreams? and Mel., how queer, 
 I also had strange dreams, it seems, 
 That you and I were both up there, 
 And some one else was there also. 
 Someone it seemed I used to know." 
 VIII. 
 "My dream was that the Doctor came 
 Down here," her husband slowly said, 
 "And ere I knew it kissed you, Mame." 
 "Kissed mcf she on the table laid 
 The pan she held surprisedly. 
 "Well that is certainly queer, I'm sure." 
 Her husband smiled. "Of course, tO' 'see 
 Him kiss you I could sleep no more. 
 So I awoke, as loudly blew 
 The winci, and lay there watching you." 
WiNtEiR MORNING CONFESSION. 2^f 
 IX. 
 She gazed down on him as he sat 
 There at the table. "As you lay 
 There watching me, dear husband, what 
 Was in your mind about me, pray — 
 And could you think the dream was true?" 
 "No, wife, I could not," he replied, ' 
 "For as I lay there watching you. 
 Indeed I took the deeper pride, 
 And felt a few like me possessed j 
 A wife like you, were truth confessed." j 
 X. 
 "And yet," she stooped and kissed him then, 
 "Could you believe me capable 
 Of hiding ought from you?" Again 
 She kissed him. "Now, what if I tell 
 You something I have never told, 
 Something, I think, belongs to you, 
 And would your love for me grow cold ? 
 And would you think I w^as untrue?" 
 "I know not wife," the husband said, 
 "To know the facts I must be made." 
 XI. 
 "Then when we've breakfast had I'll tell 
 You one thing I have, from you kept ; 
 But don't feel disagreeable; 
 Enough that neither of us slept. 
 What I shall tell you now, believe, 
 Is caused because I love you more; 
 Because I will no more receive 
 Your own affection, firm and pure, 
 In happiness until I make 
 Confession to you — for love's sake." 
 XII. 
 He smiled, "O, well, do as you please, 
 You women I don't understand. 
 Don't think that I will ever tease 
 Myself about such. I demand 
 No more than I have seen in you; 
 And that is always pure and straight; 
 I shan't be questioning if true 
 Or false, 'twill only be my fate ; 
 And we will make of it the best 
 We can, so there, just let it rest." 
 XIII. 
 He rose, went in the dining room 
 To stir the fire, blazing bright. 
 ''No, dear, don't go," she 'said. ''Do come 
 And sit down here; it is all- right. 
 YiOu wait till after breakfast, see? 
 And you will make me happy then." 
 He came back. "Yes, you do love me, 
 And sweet, you do not love in vain. 
 Somehow to-day I feel that I 
 Could not live long were you to die." 
 XIV. 
 And never had Melville before 
 Heard words like these come from his wife. 
 He looked at her surprised far more 
 Than ever yet since married life. 
 It was a revelation. Yes, 
 Contented he had been to see 
 Her in his house. His happiness 
 Was only that : to know that she, 
 This lovely woman was his wife, 
 To walk along with him through life. 
Winter morning confession. 279 
 XV. 
 She never was affectionate, 
 Her words she never seemed to waste. 
 Sometimes if he was very late 
 In coming home from town, she placed 
 Some dainty for him on the stove, 
 Some little token in this way, 
 Which he had always thought was love; 
 But here was something else to-day. 
 It was a revelation, yes. 
 Another phase of happiness. 
 XVI. 
 And now when breakfast time was past, 
 Into the dining room they came, 
 Determined to tell all at last, 
 Sat close besides her husband, Mame. 
 There on the sofa with her arm 
 Thrown over his broad shoulders, she 
 In voice that failed not now to charm. 
 Told to him her whole history. 
 And he in silence sat and heard, 
 In silence sat, without one word. 
 XVII. 
 Told him the 'story as to Stone, 
 Nor e'en left hid their love affair; 
 Then of Stone's own strange life, when done, 
 And as he as one lost sat there, 
 "And now," she said, ''if I've done wrong 
 To've kept this secret, Mel., from you, 
 Forgive me, that will make me strong. 
 Save this, and I've been always true. 
 'Twas he who said that I should prove 
 To you a noble woman's love." 
-'^O BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XVIII. 
 "Wife," said the man, '1 thank you for 
 The truth that you have given me. 
 To me you now are nobler, 
 I higher place your purity, 
 And only hope it may turn out 
 That you, my dear, and Rev. Stone 
 Are one man's children. There's no doubt 
 But what to some one it is known. 
 Some one Avho yet may be alive, 
 The precious truth you seek to give." 
 XIX. 
 And as they speak the merry ring 
 Of sleigh bells coming down the drive 
 Doth both to the front window bring, 
 Where there before them doth arrive 
 The Rev. Stone, and with him, too. 
 Another gentleman unknowm. 
 Quick to the hall, wide open threw 
 The door, Melville met Rev. Stone. 
 "Good morning; leave the horse to me; 
 Go in the house," to both said he. 
 XX. 
 Around the drive the horse Mel. drove 
 As Stone and the old gentleman 
 Into the house now went. The stove 
 Was bright and cheering. Mary ran 
 Into the hall to meet them. "Oh, 
 Come in, am very glad to see 
 You safe and sound to-day, to know 
 That you are still alive. Dear me, 
 Last night was such a stormy one, 
 We both thought of you. Elder Stone." 
Winter morning confession. 281 
 XXL 
 She gave no notice now as yet 
 Unto the old man save to point 
 Him out a seat, and went to get 
 Some coffee for them ; 'twas the wont 
 Of th2 whole parish thus to do 
 In times like this. Thus soon it was 
 With gracious smiles she came into 
 The parlor. "Gentlemen, just pass 
 Into the room now, if you please, 
 And take 'some coffee. Did you freeze 
 XXII. 
 "In coming here?" "No," answered Stone, 
 Who with his father, for it was, 
 Arose to enter, "but I own 
 I got quite cold. The weather has 
 Been quite severe. Excuse me, Mame, 
 This is my father," as they took 
 Their seats. That moment Melville came 
 Also into the room. A look 
 Upon the stranger, and at once 
 Mame sees the strong resemblance. 
 XXIII. 
 "Your father, Doctor, can it be?" 
 She asked in animated tone. 
 "My father, now come back to me," 
 Most joyfully now answered Stone. 
 "Your father, Doctor?" Melville 'said 
 As he toward the stranger came, 
 "Am glad to see you, sir, indeed." 
 "Of course we are," assented Mame, 
 For so surprised she knew not what 
 To say. Down at the table sat 
282 teROVVN CHAPEL. 
 XXIV. 
 All four, for Melville never knew 
 The time he coffee would refuse ; 
 So joined his cup in with the two 
 And asked to know the outside news. 
 Snow storms, trains blocked and crimes galore, 
 And Congress there at Washington, 
 Small-pox astride in Baltimore, 
 Hard times the cry of every one, 
 Such were the news that was made known 
 To' them by the good elder Stone. 
 XXV. 
 ''You may be anxious just to know 
 How father found me," ventured Stone, 
 Just as they ceased and rose to go 
 Into the parlor. ''To you 'tis' known 
 (To Mame he turned) about my past. 
 Perhaps, if father would, 'tis well 
 That he relate the story. Last 
 Night, though it was terrible. 
 He came to find his long lost son. 
 And found him dwelling all alone." 
 XXVI. 
 "Because he will's it to be so," 
 Laughed Mame and Melville. ''Let us hear, 
 I'm sure we both would like to know," 
 The former added. "Doctor, dear, 
 Just take that seat, and Mr. Stone, 
 Draw near the fire. Melville, do 
 Not leave ; just let the corn alone. 
 And take your rest. I fear that you 
 Will never rest until, until 
 You must get sick. Sit down, Melville." 
WINTER Morning confession. 283 
 XXVIL 
 Such were her words upon one breath, 
 And Mary Melville saw her guests 
 Well seated. Hassock underneath 
 Her dainty feet, lay back to rest 
 Within her willow^ rocker. Stone 
 Unto his father made a sign, 
 The old man cleared his throat. His tone 
 Was deep and grave. " 'Tis not my line 
 At story telling, but I see 
 That Ray will have it all from me. 
 xxvni. 
 "So I'll begin." And he went o'er 
 The story, with but little change. 
 He told his son the night before; 
 And more than once Mame murmured, ''Strange/' 
 For he was telling how the child 
 Was taken by a fisherman, 
 A mate he was, a fellow wild. 
 Who along the coast his vessel ran. 
 "He gave her to his captain, who, 
 He heard, was lost with all his crew 
 XXIX. 
 "Years after that. This fellow came 
 To me when but a pauper and, 
 Of course I could not know his aim, 
 But helped him, now a favorite hand 
 Out on my ranch. I followed up 
 The clues he gave me, and I see 
 He told the truth. I find the cup 
 Of blessings overflows for me. 
 I have not only found my son, 
 I've found my daughter. She was known — " 
2^4 BROWN CHAPEL. 
 XXX. 
 (Mame, who had heard him up to this, 
 Began her own hfe to recall; 
 How well it would compare with his 
 Strange story of the mate. O'er all 
 Quick as an instant doth she go, 
 And now as he doth this declare 
 It seems that daughter she must know. 
 And in the old man sitting there 
 She saw, could she her senses gather,) 
 *'As Mary Brookins." 'Twas her father! 
 XXXI. 
 Joy hath its sobs as well as grief, 
 For oft emotion is the 'same 
 In demonstration. 'Tis relief 
 The pent-up feelings seek. The flame 
 Was once the smouldering ashes there. 
 But fanned by sudden breeze doth spring 
 High up into a fearful flare, 
 A fierce, a threatening, dangerous thing. 
 Behold such scenes ! But let us stop 
 And gently let the curtain drop.

 CHRISTMAS EVE SURPRISE PARTY. 
 I. 
 The sleigh bells rang quite merrily, 
 And all along the public way. 
 In voices of hilarity, 
 Sped the light-hearted, young and gay; 
 For every lad and every lass 
 Must speed them o'er the frozen ground, 
 And let their voice ring as they pass. 
 Re-echo all the wood around. 
 With far and near the joyful strain 
 Of Christmas times now come again. 
 11. 
 Ay, ''Christmas comes but once a year,'' 
 So listen to the rhyme he makes, 
 "And every man must have his cheer," 
 Do witness now the ale he takes; 
 Or as they speed along the snow, 
 Do see the laddie ki'ss his lass. 
 As 'round the bend they shouting go, 
 Hard bent some other team to pass. 
 Aye, "Christmas comes but once a year, 
 And every rnan rnusj; have his cheer.*' 
 III. 
 Hark, to the blowing of a horn, 
 But to be answered by a toot ! 
 No heart this Christmas eve forlorn, 
 For lass and lad will trip the foot, 
 For lad and lass the foot must trip. 
 Aye, ''trip the light fantastic toe," 
 As whirling 'round the room they go. 
 While love be told by lash and lip, 
 Then early morning off to church 
 There as the best of saints to perch. 
 IV. 
 "No harm except you cross your foot!' 
 Alas, what difference does it make? 
 It cometh from the self same r,oot, 
 'Tis all at heart for dancing's sake. 
 But better let the question pass. 
 And leave it to each man alone. 
 As long as there be lad and lass 
 Thi's dancing surely will be done. 
 Despite our rulings and our creeds. 
 Men do as they see fit their deeds. 
 V. 
 Brown Cliapel parish all about 
 Is filled with high hilarity, 
 As one may tell by every shout 
 That rings from some gay company. 
 And lovers who have disagreed, 
 To-night are being reconciled ; 
 And they will now the cake-walk lead, 
 Made up of antics queer and wild. 
 There're bowls of egg-nog, cider sweet, 
 All kinds of cake and nuts to eat. 
CHRISTMAS EVE SURPRISE PARTY. 287 
 VI. 
 And turkeys, but few days ago 
 Had proudly 'strutted in the yard, 
 Are hanging thither in a row 
 Well picked to figure on the card. 
 And the 'possum, lately treed. 
 Outside some cabin door to freeze, 
 On the spread table takes the lead 
 In all the serving, if you please. 
 Ay, sweet potatoes from the pit 
 Are brought to go along with it. 
 VII. 
 The parsonage streams forth its light 
 And might be seen from the highway 
 By merry-makers, as to-night 
 They speed along in many a sleisfh. 
 Aunt Hannah in the kitchen sat 
 In company with her daughter, w^ho 
 Was now engaged in idle chat 
 Upon the little that 'she knew. 
 Within the living room before 
 The blazing hearth, conversing o'er 
 VIII. 
 The past, Stone and his father sat. 
 The old man telling of the home 
 That he had left out West, how at 
 His hearing all the truth had come 
 To seek his son and daughter East. 
 The weary searching in five years. 
 How all his trouble had increased, 
 But how pressed on 'twixt hopes and fears 
 Until he got the proper clue, 
 Which led him here, where least he knew 
 IX. 
 That he should find them living near 
 Each other all unknown. To know 
 That they were lovers ; seemed so queer 
 That she should jilt Stone years ago. 
 *'But, ah!" he said, ''God ruled it, son. 
 'Twas just as he intended it." 
 "Yes, father," gravely answered Stone, 
 His eyes with tender light now. lit, 
 '*He guided us on every side, 
 And wisely all we wished denied." 
 X. 
 ''But, son," the old man gravely said, 
 ''Think you that you should married be?" 
 "I married?" Stone replied, "What maid, 
 My father, now would marry me?" 
 The old man looked at him in pride. 
 "Who would the chance I reckon miss. 
 Ay, there could be no luckier bride, 
 And even in a place like this. 
 But what's this talk with Katherine? 
 I'm sure the secret is not mine." 
 XL 
 And Stone now blushed. "I may not tell. 
 I trust you'll know ere many hours." 
 "Then, boy," he said, "I'll watch you well. 
 I vow you have some winning powers." 
 *'Not many, father, rather slow, 
 But at my heart I love the gay. 
 I used to live it years ago, 
 But 'tis my life no more. I may 
 But turn my back on't, say, 'Thy will 
 Lord, be done and lead me still,' 
 f n 
CHRISTMAS EVE SURPRISE PARTY. 289 
 XII. 
 ''And yet," his father said, ''you long 
 Not for the Hfe that once you led?" 
 "No, no," 'Said Stone, "that were all wrong. 
 I long for holiness instead. 
 But in me, father, sometimes are 
 The feelings of rebellion still; 
 And these against me daily war, 
 But by a consecrated will, 
 Through God Almighty's grace I crush 
 Them out when they upon me rush." 
 XIII. 
 "So struggled Paul, am I not right?" 
 The old man asked. "From what some say," 
 His son replied, "Yet there''s small light 
 Upon such texts, it seems, to-day. 
 Men still are found to disagree. 
 Some say the man of which Paul wTote 
 Was not himself, and could not be, 
 Since he was free from sin. They note 
 That he of whom Paul wrote was still 
 Sold under sin, despite his will."* 
 XIV. 
 "His Thorn, and how about that then? 
 Surely somewhere that is brought in," 
 Hi's father asked. "What say these men 
 On this, referred it not to sin?" 
 "They are not sure e'en in this case. 
 'Twas an affliction, some would say. 
 Which followed Paul from place to place, 
 But no temptation. Others lay 
 It to his body ; some his mind, 
 But none its true place seem to find." 
 *See Clark Cam, on Rom. 7ia4' 
 19 
 XV. 
 "Then, what's the use to preach, my son, 
 If there must ever be this rout 
 And contradiction to leave one 
 Forever in the pale of doubt?'* 
 The father asked in seriou's tone. 
 ''O that, my father, does not rest 
 Our preaching," quickly answered Stone. 
 "Some things there are, be it confessed, 
 We may not know, yet every place 
 Makes known to us God's love and grace. 
 XVI. 
 "And such we preach to dying men. 
 We tell them of the Christ who died. 
 We tell them He is risen again. 
 And there upon the right hand side 
 Of God, the Father, intercedes 
 For those who come to him in faith ; 
 That he who would be saved, but needs 
 To come in merit of that death ; 
 Here everything is clear and plain; 
 And thu's our preaching is not vain. 
 XVII. 
 "No man has cause to hesitate. 
 Despite the arguments he hears; 
 But learn to labor, watch, and wait. 
 Do as God's Truth to him appears, 
 Work out his own soul's destiny, 
 Scattering through life the precious seeds; 
 Have faith, all things he may not see, 
 But knowing that the Master leads, 
 Let him go on what e'er men say, 
 That much before him, plain the way." 
CHRISTMAS EVE SURPRISE PARTY. 29 1 
 XVIII. 
 The father heard the son with pride, 
 Gazed fondly at him sitting there. 
 "I see, I see," he now repHed, 
 And brushed away a creeping tear. 
 Restrained the lump that fain would rise, 
 ''Religion's more than simple talk." 
 *'Yes, father, 'tis self-sacrifice. 
 'Tis seen in all our daily walk. 
 The only way that we can prove 
 Religion is to be filled with love." 
 XIX. 
 And now they spoke of other things — 
 Of when he purposed to return. 
 Which gentle remonstrances brings 
 From Stone who did not wish to learn 
 He had a father, but to see 
 Him dwell in lands so far away. 
 And Katherine, his sister, she 
 Was always happy since the day 
 She found that she a father had : 
 To see him go she would be sad. 
 XX. 
 But business would, of course, demand. 
 His farms were let to^ strangers now. 
 They did not seem to understand 
 The soil as he did. Then to allow 
 His cattle interest to stand still. 
 Without his presence there 'twould be 
 Unfortunate, and brood him ill. 
 Thus he must go. He'd like to see 
 Stone, Katherine and her husband, too, 
 All settled there some day, 'twas true. 
 XXI. 
 And as they talk within this 'strain 
 Without the stars are shining bright. 
 Along the road and up the lane 
 Come teams of merry-makers light. 
 Each lad, his lassie, snuggly wrapped 
 In heavy robes, warm from the wind ; 
 And they, stout-coated, w^ell as capped, 
 Nought but the sweetest pleasure find ; 
 But not the young alone, the old 
 Do not to-night fear facing cold. 
 XXII. 
 And merrily the sleigh bells rang, 
 The sleigh bells rang quite merrily. 
 Thus mingled with the songs they sang, 
 As up the hill this company, 
 In single file now drove along 
 Over the hard, firm frozen snow. 
 Each taking up some favorite song. 
 Along the way they swiftly go. 
 And at the parsonage alight. 
 Whose windows now are streaming bright. 
 XXIII. 
 "Rose," some one whispered, 'President, 
 We think you'd better take the lead." 
 There is a conference. When spent. 
 Rose is decided to be head.' 
 "Now, fellows, let us all divide. 
 You, Maurice, better take the boys, 
 And enter on the kitchen side, — 
 Hush! Cease tbnt making so much noise! 
 We girls shall enter at the front. 
 When in, make all the noise you want." 
CHRISTMAS EVE SURPRISE PARTY. 2C)^ 
 XXIV. 
 This said the members of the guild, 
 The other members sHght behind, 
 Now came. The little grove soon filled 
 With these marauders, of one mind. 
 Here were the leaders of each class; 
 Here were the stewards and trustees ; 
 Here was each laddie with his lass, 
 Here were the faithful stewardesses, 
 And trampling o'er the frozen groimd. 
 The parsonage they now^ surround. " 
 XXV. 
 "Did we hear voices?" the elder Stone 
 Now from his conversation turned. 
 "Perhaps 'twas, father. Every one 
 Who has a little money earned 
 Is frolicking to-night, I guess," 
 Said Stone, "about the parish round. 
 I do not blame them. Happiness 
 Should now in every place abound. 
 I heard them singing 'while ago. 
 They take advantage of the snow." 
 XXVI. 
 And now they sit and gaze into 
 The fire blazing on the hearth, 
 Each left his own thoughts to pursue 
 As how to celebrate the birth 
 Of Christ. And thus in silence they 
 Are 'sitting in the living room. 
 Aunt Hannah and her daughter, May, 
 Who had not yet, it seemed, gone home. 
 Sat in the kitchen, when without 
 Was heard the most ear-piercing shout. 
 XXVII. 
 Then from the front and from the rear, 
 With lads and lassies of the guild, 
 Just as the men sprang up with fear, 
 The little cottage now is filled, 
 And singing, shouting, laughing, thus 
 They take their pastor by surprise. 
 But as they vie in making fus's 
 They struggle with their great supplies. 
 So as they shouted loud and wild. 
 The table is with presents piled. 
 XXVIIL 
 There was everything one wished to eat, 
 Most everything one wished to wear. 
 Which one had in a Christmas treat 
 From such as only lived to cheer. 
 A great fat turkey, ready dressed, 
 And everything with it to go; 
 Then fruits and nuts and cakes, the best. 
 Those bundles on that table show. 
 Aye, many things, too great for thought. 
 These kindly people to him brought. 
 XXIX. 
 Shirts, underwear from head to foot, 
 In several pairs in bundles came; 
 Two suits, a heavy overcoat, 
 The present from his sister Mame. 
 A set of commentaries, rare. 
 Without a doubt to- go, it shows. 
 That no one thought about him there 
 Except it was that 'sweet maid Rose, 
 Who from the Guild, in language terse. 
 Presented him a well-filled purse.

 XXX. 
 Then Melville for the classes spoke 
 To the chief leader in a tone 
 Which an enthusiasm awoke 
 Within the breast of every one. 
 And Hawkins for the stewards made, 
 Beyond all doubt, a glowing speech; 
 And at the close of it he said, 
 *'Sir, since you here the Gospel preach, 
 Here you shall never be denied 
 What by our hands may be supplied." 
 XXXL 
 To represent the Trustees, there, 
 In all his force stood Bro. Brow^n. 
 He stood to give the trustees' share, 
 These men all loved the Rev. Stone. 
 They hoped this Christmas would not be 
 The last that he w^ould with them spend; 
 "And," he concluded, *'as for me, 
 I've found you, sir, a brother, friend, 
 A grave, a noble counsellor, 
 A high-toned. Gospel minister." 
 XXXII. 
 Then Mrs. Hawkins, who was there, 
 Spoke for each faithful stewardess. 
 Her voice, as usual, calm and clear. 
 They hoped the pastor happiness. 
 They found in him a man of God; 
 Nor feared to follow _ where he led. 
 He went the path the Master trod, 
 And pointed to the living Head. 
 The women of the church would prove 
 How nobly Christian women love.

 XXXIII. 
 Then after speeches made by each, 
 Arose the pastor tO' respond. 
 He must confess, there was no speech 
 To manifest his feeHngs ; found 
 This was too much ; their words, their deeds, 
 Had overwhelmed him, — alone, 
 In answering, he but succeeds 
 In saying in a choking tone, 
 Whatever had been done in th' past 
 Continued would be to the last. 
 XXXIV. 
 Then falling on his knees he prayed 
 That God might bless these servants here,- 
 The gifts that they before him laid, — 
 That they have success everywhere. 
 And asjie prayed 'tis many an eye 
 Is filled with tears, and wet the cheeks. 
 And even among the young and shy, 
 A tremor of emotion breaks. 
 And when they got upon their feet 
 All felt they had their spiritual treat. 
 XXXV. 
 And now 'tis for a feast they spread. 
 From baskets that had hidden been 
 They bring it on ; and there are laid 
 All kinds of dainties ever seen. 
 Aunt Hannah, who before had known, 
 Had each leaf in the table put; 
 And thus her good forethought had shown. 
 For ladened with cakes, nuts and fruit, 
 'Twas little space that there should be 
 When crowded by this company.

 And now they feast, and then they sing, 
 As fly the hours merrily. 
 The elder Stone could scarcely bring 
 Himself to think that this was he — 
 Mame was his daughter, Stone his son. 
 And here he sat with all this folk. 
 'Twas some wild dream, it must be one. 
 And as they eat and as they talk, 
 He turns from one then tO' the other, 
 And thinks about his childrens' mother. 
 xxxvn. 
 And Stone, he occupied the head, 
 And Rosie, bless her little soul. 
 Was on his right. Few words he said 
 But 'twas a battle to control 
 His feelings. Now and then his eyes 
 Would meet hers. Once their feet had met. 
 If spoken to, her soft replies 
 About her school life seemed to set 
 His heart abeating more, and he 
 Longed for her separate company. 
 XXXVIII. 
 At last they rose, and he was glad. 
 'Twas soon exchanging here and there 
 Some little word. ( Slight time he had. 
 If he her company would share.) 
 He went to find her occupied 
 By several young men whom she held 
 In conversation at her side. 
 And finding this he was compelled 
 To seek his sister's kindly aid, 
 If ever be would see the maid.

 "You goose!" said Maine, or Katherine. 
 *'In such things you must bolder be. 
 Why, look at her ; 'tis plainly seen 
 She does not want her company." 
 He looked, he saw her furtive glance 
 O'er to the corner where they sat. 
 "She's only watching now her chance," 
 Said Mame, "tO' get where we are at — " 
 "O, Katherine! Such grammar, dear," 
 Stone laughed, "forgive me, call her here." 
 XL. 
 "I ^han't, now just for that, big boy!" 
 She said and pushed him half away. 
 "No, dear," she cried, "I can't destroy 
 Your joy to-night, so there, you may 
 Not look like that ; and don't be sad," 
 She beckoned c[uickly now to Rose. 
 "She comes," she whispered, "are you glad?" 
 Now see that you no moment lose." 
 All blushing unto them Rose came. 
 "You wish to speak with me?" to Mame. 
 XLI. 
 "We both would speak with you," she 'said, 
 "But brother here, I think, the most. 
 Come let us go upstairs (she led 
 The way) for pa will play the host; 
 Already he is talking to 
 The leading people of the place. 
 I'm sure they will not look for you, 
 E'en if they chance to miss your face." 
 Her arms around Rose's waist, she led 
 The way upstairs, as this she said.

 Within the room a dim light shone. 
 ''How cozy now it feels up here," 
 She whispered in a coaxing tone. 
 "This is the room you furnished, dear." 
 "O, yes," said Rose, a little sigh, 1 
 ''I well remember all to-night." | 
 She looked at Stone, who stood near by, 
 But turned to brighter make the light. 
 ''Sit down," said Mame, "and tell us how 
 You 'spent your hours in school." And now 
 j 
 XLIII. ' 
 All seated. Rose calm and sedate, ^ , 
 Yes, even more than e'er before, 
 Began her school life to relate. 
 And went on till there was no more 
 To tell. Somehow Mame disappeared 
 Within the next room where she'd sleep ' 
 That night, as it had been declared 
 By Stone that she next day should keep 
 With him, she and her husband, too; 
 Thus this her to the next room drew. 1

 There is a time when left alone 
 With those wdiom we mo'st dearly love, 
 No long draw^n sigh, no tender tone 
 But what our feelings then must prove. 
 But oft the glance outspeeds the word, 
 The sudden grasping of the hand. 
 No need of sighs or tones be heard, . 
 The sight, the touch w'ill understand. \ 
 Love needs no heralds more than these . j 
 To set its beating heart at ease.

 What tho' some word most commonplace 
 Them for a moment occupy, 
 Look on the glowing, blushing face. 
 Look at the soft light in the eye, 
 The heaving of the bosom, see, 
 The anxious feeling ill concealed, 
 The vain attempt just to be free 
 In voice and subject is revealed; 
 And all declare they speak not on 
 The subject they would fain have known. 
 XLVL 
 Sometimes a silence may precede. 
 An awful silence, too, to bear, 
 A silence from which to be freed 
 One oft has found him in despair. 
 When nothing w^ill itself suggest 
 And each goes floating on the sea 
 Of thought with not a place to rest. 
 No land in sight, alone the sky 
 And water as each floats around 
 One little circle set as bound. 
 XLvn. 
 And thus with Stone. These two alone, 
 A silence for awhile ensued ; 
 A silence now which seemed to Stone 
 Too painful far for any good. 
 He tried to speak, in fact he did. 
 He told her of his life since when 
 She left the place, but well he hid 
 From her that night of fearful pain. 
 However, he would ask her why 
 She had not stopped to say good-bye.

 "I did on Sunday," she replied, 
 ''But you were 'so engaged, you know, ; 
 I had to leave, although I tried ; 
 To Start in time in order to , 
 Stop on the way, but 'twas in vain. 
 In starting it was that I found | 
 I'd but short time to make the train ; ' 
 And father, he, of course, was bound - 
 To count for mishaps on the way. 
 So you can judge my plight that day." 
 XLIX. . ' 
 "And then you really tried to get 
 A chance to see me ere you went?" 
 He whispered, and 'twas then he let 
 His voice fall low. " 'Twas my intent, - 
 After my pleasant times with 3^ou, 
 And all your noble advice given, 
 I felt it was my duty to. 
 And pa can tell you how I'd striven 
 With him to turn into the lane. 
 He was afraid we'd miss the train. i 
 L. 
 "He did not tell me," Stone replied. 
 "Well, he forgot it, that was all. 
 Not that he meant to," and she sighed. i 
 "He wondered why you did not call 
 The day before." "I wish I had," 
 He said in a regretful tone. ; 
 "And I would certainly have been glad. i 
 You should have known that. Rev. Stone." \ 
 "Why should I ?" he now questioned low. \ 
 "Because my actions told yow so." ] 
 LI. 
 He stopped, she stopped. Below the stair 
 Still, voices of the folks they heard. 
 At last, "They pleasure have down there," 
 She whispered, "should it not be shared?" 
 "Not yet, not yet," he quickly said. 
 "My daughter, I have words for you. 
 Too long already I've delayed 
 In speaking; now I'm ready to 
 Let you know all, and learn my fate. 
 I but upon your answer wait." 
 LII. 
 'Tis said a woman generally knows 
 When comes that hour, her greatest prize. 
 An honest lover will propose 
 By the deep flashings of his eyes ; 
 And be she young, or be 'she old, 
 Be it the first, or be it not. 
 And be he timid, be he bold. 
 When e'er it falls unto her lot 
 To sit alone with such a man, 
 She knows as none but woman can. 
 LIII. 
 I've gazed upon the feathered throng, 
 And wondered how they understood 
 Love's language; listened to their song, 
 And sat entranced in lonely wood. 
 For when the time arrived, I found 
 Them side by side, and watched them build 
 Their cozy mansions, saw them bound 
 By tender ties, which but instilled 
 Them so to labor, and to rear 
 A brood to fill the world with cheer. 
CHRISTMAS EVE SURPRISE PARTY. 3O.3 
 LIV. 
 Who mated them? Or did they find 
 By their own skill each other out ? 
 Or did they fall together ? Mind, 
 As to their reason, there is doubt. 
 I simply ask, was it direct 
 Decision, while within a throng. 
 Which caused them seeking to select, 
 And know each other's love? Let song 
 Express that love? Enough to see 
 They seem to love — enough for me. 
 LV. 
 "Do you remember our first walk?" 
 "I do," she whispered as her breast 
 Began to rise and fall. "Our talk?" 
 "Yes," softly, "it must be confessed." 
 "And the advice I gave you then?" 
 "I can't forget one word," she said. 
 "Then how the storm came up?" Again, 
 "Yes, all remembered," said the maid. 
 To her he closer drew his chair. 
 Her eyes half closed, she still 'sat there. 
 LVI. 
 And now a roguish smile stole o'er 
 Her features. With a quick sly glance 
 Into his face, which more and more 
 Burned in deep passion's eloquence. 
 She said, "But such a wild, wild girl, 
 Now tell me wdiat you thought of me." 
 And he recalled that same dark curl. 
 The eyes that danced mischievously. 
 He said, "I thought 'so much that day 
 I never shall have words to say." 
 LVII. 
 ''You thought that I was very bold," 
 She said, and gave another look. 
 "I thought that you were very cold." 
 (And here it was her hand he took.) 
 ''You thought that I was what, they say. 
 So senseless, wayward, and so wild — 
 You have those very thoughts to-day — " 
 "Rose," he broke forth, "there, there, my child! 
 The only thought I have, God knows, 
 Is that I madly love you, Rose !" 
 LVIII. 
 She heard, and turned her head away, 
 She heard, and drew her hand from his. 
 O artful woman, at thy play. 
 None but thy self can do like this ! 
 She knew her heart went "pitter-pat ;" 
 She knew her bo'som rose and fell ; 
 She knew that they too closely sat 
 Together, that each sign must tell; 
 Though even now about to yield. 
 She'd prove him smartly on the field. 
 LIX. 
 "No, do not turn away from me," 
 He said, and gently took her hand 
 Again. "Y'ou cannot fully see. 
 You cannot fully understand 
 How all these months since here I've been 
 Your form, your image filled my mind. 
 Speak, Rose, to me, have you not seen 
 Some little sign of this? Be kind, 
 And tell me, little one, that I 
 f^oye nof in vain. Speak, make replyr'^

 She does not draw her hand from his; 
 She does not look into his face; 
 She sits in silence; but it is 
 A silence sweet, a golden grace. 
 She loves him, deeply loves him, but 
 Can she give up her rights at once? 
 Herself 'neath his protection put? 
 Again into his face a glance 
 So quick he does not see it, and

 He held, which he fails not to feel, 
 Which thrills his very -soul, and he, — 
 "Speak, Rose, ; one word ; you can't conceal 
 The truth I long to know, from me, 
 You love me don't you, little one?" 
 And now she jerked her hand away, 
 **Do let me leave you. Rev. Stone. 
 It is not right for me to stay 
 Up here so long. Will you permit, 
 Or must I longer with you sit?" 
 LXII. 
 She arose as if about to go. 
 ''Be seated just a moment," he 
 Now interposed. ''My child you know 
 I love you, why not answer me?" 
 Again she took the chair, and sat. 
 Her head bowed down upon her breast. 
 She knew her heart went "pitter-pat;" 
 She dared not look up at him lest 
 He saw how much she loved him. No, 
 At last in voice, calm, swe^t and low,

 She said, ''Love me? It cannot be." 
 (A tear was stealing down her cheek.) 
 "No, Rev. Stone, you can't love me, 
 For some one nobler you should seek ; 
 An older, w^ser one than I." 
 Enough, his arms around her thrown, 
 Her head was resting happily 
 On his broad breast. In gentle tone, 
 "And you will be my wife, my child?" 
 "Your Rose," she murmured, "tho' so wild.' 
 LXIV. 
 The sleigh bells rang out merrily. 
 As from the parsonage that night 
 Depart the merry company 
 Who'd spent such hours of delight. 
 And Christmas had already come 
 Ere many coaxing sleep had sought ; 
 Ere many reached an humble home 
 Where Santa Claus his work has wrought. 
 But lingered up, still Katherine, 
 Till she her Brother Ray had seen. 
 LXV. 
 "Go, dear," she said to Melville, low, 
 "I wi'sh to speak with Brother Ray. 
 He has some joyful news I know. 
 His very countenance doth say." 
 "And now, what is it?" as they stood 
 Before the fire on the hearth. 
 Ray kissed his sister, "Good, ah, good ! 
 I am the happiest man on earth." 
 "She loves you then? Of course she do^s. 
 I saw that long ago in Rose."

 "The time draws near the birth of Christ, 
 The moon is hid, the night is still," 
 Love's ministry hath sacrificed; 
 The incense all the air doth fill. 
 Again on far Judea's plain 
 The vision suddenly appears, 
 And sounds from heaven that joyful strain 
 Which all the hearts of mankind cheers — 
 Hark ! hear it ringing once again, 
 "Peace, peace on earth, good will to men."

PREFACE. 
AS to whether or not it is wisely or timely done, I have put my leisure time and many lonesome and weary hours of the past nights in preparing* this little volume for the ' 'Public, " and my purpose for so doing is: that it may be a help to the  thousands of teachers who are to-day struggling so hard and faithfully to rise from supine and bring out from behind the dark veil of life the thousands of young ''Afro- Americans" who can be made useful to-day and are much needed. And, too, that it may help them to close their proogressive schools with happy, pleasant and cheerful concerts. 
 Whether or not the contents of this little volume will suit you I can't tell. But I have put forth my best efforts to compose something to please everybody — 
 The Saint and the sinner, 
 The looser and the winner, 
 The great and the small. 
 The low and the tall. 
 So I have pulled wide the throttle to let it go, and ask you to keep your eyes upon the rails that it may be widely and publicly circulated. And I truly hope that it will find a useful field of labor instead of filling an early grave in the cemetery of forgetfulness. 
 The Author. 
 THE AUTHOR'S OPEN LETTER TO THE YOUNG 
 AFRO-AMERICANS. 
 Montgomery, Ala., 1906. 
 My Dear Young Friends: 
 We are the generation being reared up in this country to succeed those gone and going on before us. We must prepare, and we can't prepare too early. 
 The first place for us to begin is at home, by loving and giving our aid to take care of it, and doing our best to make it pleasant. Home is the place where all foundations must be laid whereupon prosperity can be built and energy forever stand. Home stands inviting where all others are denying. So a home well cared for will prove a success for the builder. 
 The next place is in the school-room, the source of knowledge, and knowledge is the key to honest and rapid success. Some of us have better chances to secure an education than others. But I believe that every parent of this "black race," in this * 'enlightened" age have and are doing their best to educate their sons and daughters. And I feel that I speak the desire of every one when I say that they want to see us "famous." These dear ones that are with us to-day carrying on these great works, trying to save us from hell and destruction; those who are laboring so faithfully to save us from life's ruin and desolation, and to show us a brighter day in the future, that we may see our welfare, so that we may win for ourselves a seat upon the highest stage of life, will some day pass away. Their places must be filled and we must fill them. Since we are to succeed them we should and must do greater works than they have done. So it behooves us to get ready for the work, as this is a day of big things. Don't forget to be a true Christian, and ask the Lord, the creator of the world, to help us in our struggles. For we have associates that must be called from the field of ruin, who need to give the saloon-keeper a vacation, and need to let the "dice, the pool and billiard ball" be still, and come and do something to uplift this long down-trodden race that will bring knowledge and "fame" in the future. 
 After a struggle of over two years, when at the midnight hours, with nothing to accompany me but the crowing of the roosters, the hooting of the old swamp owls, or the singing of the crickets in the fruit trees (in the garden) , I have managed to hand 
 to you the test of my talent. And I hope, among you, it will make hours of pleasure and sunshine. Let us pull together, with this our motto: ''Envy no man who progresses honestly, but earnestly strive 
 to oppose those who oppress. " 
 I pray God's blessings upon you. 
 Yours, known and unknown, 
 Julius C. Wright. 
GOING TO THE PICNIC. 
 1 
 There is a large crowd of young folks 
 Hurrying down the road; 
 They are going to have a picnic now, 
 And spread the news abroad. 
 2 
 They are wearing beautiful boquets, 
 And carrying bright tin dippers; 
 New straw hats are waiving high, 
 And patent leather slippers. 
3 
 Their hats are made of fine chiffon, 
 And decorated too. 
 There will be plenty of goodies 
 For your friends and for you. 
4
 They will have a big barbecue. 
 And a lot of other stuff. 
 They are going to eat and drink 
 Till everybody puff. 
5
 They will have cakes and candy by the heaps, 
 And ice cream pressed in cake; 
 Peanuts parched fresh and hot, 
 And a lot of fine milk shakes. 
 6 
 They will have fish croquets by the bushels, 
  And cocoanut jumbles too; 
 They are going to feed their friends and foes 
 And have enough for you. 
 7 
 They are going to have a big dance 
 And have a jolly time. 
 They want to show their handsome looks 
 Because they look so fine, 
 8 
 One barrel or two of lemonade, 
 Mixed all through with ice;^ 
 Lemons cut and thrown therein^ 
 Gee ! it's awful nice. 
9 
 Of all the fun and jolities, 
 And all the places of rest, 
 Just go to an old picnic ground; 
 They tell me that's the best. 
 GLAD TO SLEEP. 
 1 
 (Have a pallet made near and sitting in a chair, 
 God bless the man who invented noble sleep; 
 Bless his noble eye. 
 Bless him that he didn't keep 
 His wonderful invention, nor try* 
 May the Lord bless him; yes, I say, 
 Lord, bless his soul. 
 Invented almost the greatest thing. 
 And was never told. 
 2 
 (He stretches and cries, 0, ho! ho!! ho!!!) 
 We must make him up a handsome sum, 
 And I declare we must, 
 And give him for his noble work. 
 For in his sleep we trust. 
 So we might bring up a lot of cash 
 And give this noble man 
 Letting others sleep while he went around 
 Telling of his plan.  
3
 (Throws his head about in a sleepy condition. ) 
 I hate to see the sun come up. 
 I am glad to see it set. 
 I know it's almost sleeping time, 
 And I am glad, you bet. (Nods his head. ) 
 When the sun is setting I am awful glad, 
 The time for sleep is coming. 
 I declare I'm feeling awful good. 
 That bed keeps on compelling. 
 4 
 (Stretches again and cries, 0, ho! ho!! ho!!!) 
 When the sun is down I am getting glad, 
 And I feel proud, you bet; 
 I'll soon be on that good old bed (points to it) 
 Where I will sleep and never fret. 
 'Tis sleep that makes a man feel good: 
 'Tis joy, peace and rest. 
 5 
 Of all the pleasures that I have. 
 Old sleep is the best. 
 I just can't bear to sit and look 
 At that good bed any more; 
 So I am off to sleep. One, two, three ! 
 Look and see me go. (Jumps on the pallet. ) 
 MY QUESTIONS. 
 1 
 I accompanied my father once 
 To a railroad station near: 
 It was the greatest joy to me, 
 Those funny things to hear. 
 2 
 I stood in the office door a while, 
 And what to see and hear? 
 I heard some clucks and clicks; 
 I wondered without fear. 
 3 
 Then to my father I quickly ran 
 To find out what it was. 
"'Tis telegraph/' he answered, "son. 
 And then my courage rose. 
 4 
Who made it, papa? then I asked 
 In a low and trembling voice. 
 Then he quickly answered, "Son, 
 'Twas Samuel F. B. Morse." 
 5 
 Then to a city with him I went 
 And saw many attractive things; 
 Into a little fellow's mind 
 Many wonders bring. 
 6 
 To see the street cars dashing by, 
 There my attention laid. 
 "What's that pa ?" my question was.  
 "An electric car," he said. 
7
 "Are those lights electric too?" 
 I quickly asked of him. 
 He quickly answered, saying "yes." 
 That filled my heart with vim. 
 8 
 "What did they make them with ?" 
 Was my question next.  
 He said, "Franklin caught the hghtning, son; 
 Now listen to my text." 
 9 
 "Men took it and put it in 
 The use of many things. 
 Here, too, the men of our land 
 Brought many attractive things." 
 10 
 They put it in those moving cars, 
 And in those pretty lights, 
 And brought to the world and men 
 Many wondrous sights."
 LET DOWN YOUR BUCKET, DRAW UP AND 
 DRINK. 
1
 When you are dissatisfied and can't be pleased 
 Going around with very little ease,  
 Only stop, take time and think, 
 Let down your bucket, draw up and drink. 
 2 
 Drink things that fill the heart with cheer, 
 And make you say I am glad I am here. 
 Catch the idea from a wink, 
 Let down your bucket, draw up and drink. 
3
 Thirsty people can always find 
 Something somewhere to fill their mind, 
 They find a well and without a blink 
 Let down their buckets, draw up and drink. 
4
 Some will drink of evil^ things, 
 Afterwards no good it brings, 
 See what you want, take time to think, 
 Let down your bucket, draw up and drink. 
 5 
 Let down for good, then bring it up, 
 Be sure to get full, a brimming cup, 
 Then before in a chair you sink, 
 Let down your bucket, draw up and drink. 
 6 
 Whenever 3^ou drink of evil things, 
 Send them from you as if they had wings. 
 And if they try to make you sink 
 Just let down your bucket, draw up and drink. 
 7 
There was never a man who arose for good, 
 What evil didn't hinder him if it could; 
 And every time it tries to make you sink 
 Let down your bucket, draw up and drink. 
 FAREWELL TO THE FARM. 
 1 
 I am going to leave the dear old farm 
 It is so rich and firm, 
 I am going into the world so wide 
 Perhaps to never return. 
 Farewell to the green, shady grove, 
 You have comforted me so much, 
 I may never see you again, 
 It's only a chance for such. 
 2 
 I am no longer here a farmer's son. 
 Tilling up the dust, 
 I'll drag the old plow under the shed 
 And lay down my hoe to rust. 
 Be still old hoe and rest. 
 You have cut the choking weed, 
 You have killed the serpent under my feet,, 
 0! you are valuable indeed. 
 3
 My hunting dog now you may rest^ 
 My gun lay in the rack, 
 My book of game laws I will hang 
 Up with my hunting sack, 
 You have done your work for me 
 And I will let you rest; 
 You guided me in time of sport,, 
 And you have stood the test. 
 4 
 I will walk down the long and Ionesom,e lane, 
 Down to the neighboring creek, 
 And there to my old fishing place 
 A farewell I will greet. 
 Good-bye to the adjoining fields 
 Where I used to plow and hoe, 
 I am going away I can not tell, 
 I may never see you any more, 
 5 
 Other boys will till you up 
 For I am going away, 
 I may chance to see you again 
 In some future day. 
 'Tis sad to leave my old, old home, 
 But I declare I must, 
 Farewell old home, farewell old farm, 
 I am gone in God to trust. 
 THE SCHOOL HOUSE ON THE HILL. 
 1 
 I went to .school in my 'childish days 
 And went on later still, 
 But where I learned my alphabet 
 Was in the school house on the hilL 
 2 
 T'was a shabby little cabin 
 With a chimney of dirt and sticks. 
 Not only our lessons were we taught 
 But learned many tricks. 
 We had no one to bring us word, 
 And the weather was very cold; 
 We went out in the fields for it 
 Just as we were told. 
 4 
 Our teachers were so good and kind 
 Our hearts with joy did fill, 
 0! if I could spend a day 
 In the school house on the hill 
 5 
 We played all up and down the brook 
 And would run base over the fields. 
 To bat the ball to the foot of the hill 
 We would €heer like thunder peel. 
 Over the hills we played around, 
 Sometimes to Kelley's mill, 
 But we always got back in time, 
 To the school house on the hill 
 7 
 We gathered flowers from the fields. 
 We chased the rabbits around, 
 Just hear us break out through the woods. 
 It was a jolly sound, 
 8 
 boys and girls that used to play 
 Over to Kelley's mill, 
 We would be happy to meet again 
 In the school house on the hill. 
 9 
 Our dear teacher is cold in death, 
 The school house is torn down. 
 The plowman labors over the spot 
 Breaking up the ground. 
 10 
 T'was sad to hear the news go around 
 That our dear teacher was dead, 
 Just think how kind he was to us. 
 But gone to his dark, low, bed. 
 11 
 The scholars now are scattered too 
 Into the world so wide, 
 Some have left the school. 
 Gone away and died. 
 12 
 1 want to see my dear schoolmates. 
 And yet perhaps I will. 
 If not I never will forget 
 The school house on the hilL 
 THE OLD MULBERRY, 
 1 
 There is a mulberry over the well. 
 Has stood for many years; 
 It shaded me in time of need, 
 And watched my many tears. 
 Day after day the old tree stood 
 To shade the old wash place. 
 It seemed to comfort those it could, 
 And give a smiling face, 
 3 
 Many play houses did I build; 
 Decorated them with its leaves. 
 I'd played I was farming 
 And bringing in the sheaves, 
 4 
 The plow boys from the fields would come 
 To get water from the well, 
 And fall beneath the pleasant shade 
 And stories begin to tell. 
 Many times was dinner served 
 By fishermen under the tree; 
 They boasted of the pleasant shade 
 Furnished cool and free, 
 6 
 There never was a shade so pleasant 
 And so satisfying to me 
 In ail the days of my childhood 
 As that of the mulberry tree. 
 WASH DAY. 
 They would meet at the neighboring wash place 
 On Friday set apart, 
 They gathered there bright and soon 
 To be the first to start. 
 2 
 Then all day long a noise is up 
 Handing jokes around, 
 Adding more than it is 
 Just to make it sound. 
 When one would say "Pll beat you through, 
 The others say "you shant." 
 Then the one that started first 
 Gives out a bold "you can't." 
 The wash day seems jolly, 
 With scrubbing, rubbing and tugging. 
 All day long busy work, 
 Just see the water blubbering. 
 As the sun sinks fast you hear them sing 
 Most done in the evening cool; 
 Hanging the clothes out on the line 
 Finished by a rule. 
 The clothes get dry, they take them in^ 
 The day is almost done. 
 "Who got through first?" they asked around 
 The wash day race she won. 
 THE DISSATISFIED FARMER, 
 1 
 Things are getting peculiar, 
 Man is hard to please, 
 No matter what kind of a season comes 
 It gives but very little ease. 
 2 
 When it starts to raining 
 There is some fault to find, 
 For there is not a day 
 He is satisfied in mind. 
 3 
 When he has one thing he wants another, 
 So he's sure to complain; 
 Just let it be dry for a week 
 He is wondering, "Will it ever rain?" 
 4 
 When the crop is grassy he wants it clean, 
 So his family can rest, 
 He is tired of seeing them work so hard 
 And looks out for their best. 
 5 
 When the crop is clean he is displeased. 
 Go hobbling on a crutch; 
 He wants his folks to be at work. 
 They are around the house too much. . 
 6 
 "When it's dry he wants it wet. 
 When it's wet he is sure to fret, 
 When it's cold he wants it hot, 
 Always wanting what is not." 
 7 
 "My cotton is in the field" he says, 
 *'My corn I must haul up," 
 When this is done, then he says, 
 "J wants a new-ground cut." 
 8 
 Hell and destruction is never full, 
 Take the "Bible" and decide; 
 So are the eyes of mortal man 
 Never satisfied. 
 THE OLD HOME ON THE SWAMP. 
 1 
 'Tis where I spent my childhood days. 
 At the old home on the swamp; 
 You never saw a happier boy, 
 More pleasure I never did want. 
 I went to fishing on the brook, 
 And on *'Eufauba" creek, 
 All up and down the "hedge rows" 
 Upon little birds would sneak. 
 I used to carry breakfast 
 To my brothers in the field, 
 As I nearer to them got 
 I am coming! I will yell. 
 Sometime I would carry my hook along 
 Or whatever I did want. 
 For I was living a happy life 
 At the old home on the swamp. 
 3 
 To hoe and plow was my crave, 
 But I was rather small, 
 The answer that they gave me was, 
 ' 'Wait, grow strong and tall. ' ' 
 I desired to learn of many things, 
 But that I sure did want 
 To aid me in my pleasure 
 At the old home on the swamp. 
 4 
 When a little larger I wanted a gun^ 
 But father said "too poor;" 
 The consolation that he gave. 
 Was 'wait a few years more, 
 "Then I will get a gun" he said 
 "For that is what you want, 
 "T'will be a lot of service son 
 "At our old home on the swamp." 
 Not many years had past 
 Before a gun I owned. 
 And every time I got a chance 
 Away I went to roam 
 With gun and dogs across the hills, 
 For game I sure did want; 
 That was my chief delight 
 Hunting on the swamp. 
 6 
 Now the old home I have left, 
 But goes back now and then, 
 No more ideas of living there. 
 If sol can't tell when; 
 No matter where in the world I be. 
 To see it I will want, 
 I never will forget the days 
 I spent down on the swamp. 
 THINK, GET UP AND DO. 
 1 
 Never was a thoug-ht any g-ood 
 Unless it was put to use, 
 No prisoner ever was so glad 
 As the day he was turned aloose. 
 2 
 Some people never realize 
 What it takes to carry them through, 
 Always can be a thinking 
 But never get to do. 
 3 
 Standing still and gazing- 
 At the distance far away„ 
 Never makes you reach it 
 Nor gives you any pay. 
 But only strive to reach it 
 That's the best for you, 
 Never be still a thinking 
 But think, get up and do. 
 5 
 While you are thinking do some. 
 That's the best for you; 
 While you are sitting idle around 
 Think, get up and do. 
 BE KIND, SPEAK GENTLE. 
 1 
 Be kind to everybody. 
 Speak gentle to every one, 
 To make our lives loving and happy 
 These things must be done. 
 Be kind and j^ou will be treated 
 In likeness of the same; 
 Speak gentle, you will be honored 
 For the goodness of your name. 
 Gentle words addeth honor. 
 Kind deeds addeth love; 
 You will always be happy 
 With blessings from above; 
 Never was kindness shown in vain, 
 Nor a gentle word spoken 
 That some weary soul didn't cherish it 
 And used it as a token. 
 3 
 There is always something to be done 
 And in the kindness way; 
 Gentle words need to be spoken 
 In life day by day. 
 No matter how stony the heart may be. 
 No matter how deaf the ear. 
 Some kind deed it will feel, 
 Some gentle word 'twill hear. 
 4 
 Kind deeds will touch the hearts of stone. 
 Gentle words will make it feel, 
 Twill touch the heart of the vilest man, 
 Though hard as flint and steel; 
 'Gentle words settled the greatest quarrel. 
 Have called the laborer to rest, 
 Have brought peace in time of war, 
 Gentle words have stood the test. 
 5 
 Kind deeds are the foundation 
 Upon which stands the wall, 
 Gentle words are the helpers 
 On which broken hearts can call. 
 Gentle words will cheer them up, 
 Kind deeds will mend them back, 
 They will kelp the wounded upon the field, 
 The weary racers on the track. 
 6 
 Scatter kindness along the path 
 As you travel day by day, 
 That may help some weary soul 
 That struggles along the way, 
 Speak gentle to the kind, 
 To the cruel speak the same; 
 So those of the future can say, 
 You aided them to fame. 
 WHEN I WERE A CHILD. 
 When my recollection came to me 
 I was living on a farm; 
 I didn't try to do any good, 
 Nor to do any harm. 
 Soon I was running all about, 
 Me in mischief you would find. 
 Or you would find me asleep 
 Or doing something kind. 
 2 
 How my two brothers would take little me 
 And ramble over the fields 
 To pick wild berries and see the birds, 
 How jolly I would feel. 
 To play among the green-growing grass 
 And over the farm so hilly, 
 Rambling over the meadows green 
 My brothers George and Willie. 
3 
 Down where we used to fish 
 On the Httle neighboring brook. 
 When the fishes didn't bite to suit 
 I would stop, stand up and look 
 When they began to catch them 
 I would put my hook back in. 
 Then to renew my luck 
 To see if I could win, 
 4 
 As the day dawned from the east 
 I would rise to meet the light, 
 Greeting the sunbeams as they danced 
 Merrily in my sight 
 Then I would go to the sandy yard. 
 There to begin my play, 
 While the sun beams merrily danced 
 And cheered me on the way, 
 5 
 And afterward I went to school 
 But I didn't like it well, 
 Because I couldn't be at play 
 And school-news I couldn't tell, 
 I was not in any way suited 
 'Twas a place I didn't like, 
 Among those strange boys and girls 
 Always ready to fight 
 6 
 But soon I got familiar 
 And was a jolly boy, 
 Learning all my lessons 
 As if they were a toy. 
 We would play our merry game 
 With always one debater, 
 Just wait awhile and let me think, 
 I'll tell you more later. 
 THE DOLLAR, 
 Just a small piece of metal 
 With letters and dates thereon 
 Can do a lot of good 
 And then a mighty harm. 
 2 
 The dollar can be invested 
 In a thriving little place; 
 It will boom a business 
 To gaze in future's face. 
 3 
 The dollar shines so bright. 
 Its power is so great; 
 Here among these earthly things 
 The dollar is in the bet. 
 4 
 The dollar has got the world running. 
 And all that man can start; 
 And then to keep up with it 
 A fellow must be smart. 
 The dollar can do wonders; 
 Mighty debts 'twill pay; 
 Has caused men to be prison bound; 
 Led many beings astray. 
 6 
 There was never a business started 
 Without the dollar in it; 
 And if you are not intuitive, 
 The dollar is sure to win it. 
TRUTH. 
 1 
 Truth is the foundation 
 Upon which character stands. 
 Speak the truth and mean it; 
 It is our God^s command. 
 Truth is what shines 
 In all the heaven above, 
 And the one that tells it 
 Is in our father^s love. 
 Be true to all your friends 
 As through life we plod, 
 And the best thing we can do 
 Be true to trust in God. 
 He is the one that made us 
 And put us in the world: 
 He is the one that spares us 
 While through time we whirl 
 If we want God's blessings 
 In all things we may do, 
 Do what is good with kindness 
 And always be true. 
 WHISKEY. 
 1 
 Whiskey! Whiskey!! Whiskey!!! 
 Drink after drink. 
 Leads a man to ruin 
 Before he stops to think. 
 Whiskey is not a friend 
 To any true lover of honor. 
 To use it in a disgraceful manner 
 Will bring a shameful rumor. 
 3 
 Whiskey has made the rich man poor. 
 Has made the high come low. 
 And taken awajr some dearest friend 
 To never return any more. 
 4 
 Whiskey has caused men to die; 
 Whiskey has caused men to He, 
 And has caused men to perish, 
 And forever groan and cry. 
 Whiskey has hurled men to ruin, 
 In that dreadful lake to burn. 
 Because he clung to the damnable cup 
 While conscience bade them turn. 
 Whiskey has caused men to swear; 
 Whiskey has caused men to bear 
 The lowest name of all the earth 
 That rings out through the air. 
 Whiskey has caused men to pay 
 Dollars in the most lavish way: 
 Because they let it guide them 
 As they travel day by day. 
 8 
 Watch! Watch! For the cup is coming! 
 Keep it far away from you. 
 Never be beguiled by it, 
 Then you will make it through. 
TUSKEGEE. 
 1 
 Though small in population 
 In our Southern land, 
 Tuskegee stands up for herself 
 In the education band. 
 2 
 She holds her noted institutes 
 For both her white and black; 
 When all the towns are boasting, 
 Tuskegee is in the pack. 
 3 
 Let her stand the pride of the South 
 In these progressive years; 
 Let all of her people gladly talk 
 Of the noble name she bears. 
 4
 Hurrah! Hurrah! Tuskegee, 
 Where education lies! 
 Of all the rulers and noble men, 
 Tuskegee has caught their eyes. 
 5 
 She has sent out her noble ones 
 To spread her fame abroad. 
 To tell of her noble work 
 In the South, and her reward. 
 6 
 Among the smart, noble workers, 
 You will find her competent sons, 
 Teaching and showing the noble work 
 That great Tuskege'se done. 
 7 
 Long may she survive, 
 Her sons and daughters live. 
 That they teach the useful things 
 That noble Tuskegee gives. 
 A FOOL'S AUTOBIOGRAPH. 
 1 
 I once had had opportunities 
 To build me lasting fame. 
 But now the golden chances have passed 
 And here I stand ashamed. 
 Opportunities by the hundred 
 That I let pass me by. 
 Now all the world does laugh at me 
 And upon me the burdens lie. 
 2 
 In all my years of learning 
 I loafed from place to place. 
 Now all those opportunities 
 Doth stare me in the face. 
 Now I must lie here under foot 
 Of all those that surpass 
 Me in the days of my youth 
 And have got beyond my class. 
 3 
 On the street corner day after day 
 So merrily there I stood, 
 Into all tricks and funny jokes 
 And all that wasn't good. 
 I would not be instructed 
 About anything 'twas good; 
 Whenever one would try for such 
 I would scorn him all I could. 
 4 
 I would not read a book or paper, 
 I would not go to school; 
 Now all I have to offer 
 Is a history of a fool 
 It breaks my heart now to think 
 Of chances that went by. 
 Now the on\S thing that I can do 
 Is live a fool and dia 
 5 
 I must leave this world some day. 
 What can I leave behind? 
 Not one good deed that I have done 
 In all of my life time, 
 I only have a life of shame, 
 A blemished character through; 
 No good example have I laid: 
 My savings are of few. 
 6 
 What can I offer to the world? 
 What example can I lay? 
 I can not show one life progress 
 To travelers on the way. 
 No one will take my advice. 
 "Look at his life," they say, 
 I could not tell one to come, 
 For I have not prepared the way. 
 The whole world laughs at me 
 And points a finger of scorn, 
 To see me grown up a heathen 
 And all opportunities gone. 
 Young friends, be ever watchtul, 
 Be willing to go to school. 
 And when you give don't let it be 
 A history of a fool. 
 8 
 For I now ask you earnestly, 
 And for your noble name; 
 And don't live as I have lived 
 And have a life of shame. 
 1 spent my life in folly, 
 In places of disgrace; 
 Now all my sins and worthless deeds 
 Come before my face. 
 9 
 When one of my old friends 
 I would chance to meet, 
 Nothing then would please me more 
 Than set him up a treat. 
 0, take a drink on me! 
 I would beg him in my name. 
 Then into the next saloon 
 I would go and do the same. 
 10 
 My life is far spent, the world gaze on me, 
 Man excuse me not; 
 How sad it is for me to think, 
 Must die, be buried and forgot. 
 There is a mighry time to dread, 
 When I will be numbered with the dead; 
 To hisaven or hell then I must go, 
 And for which place I have laid my store, 
 11 
 Strive to be useful, 
 For many chance there be; 
 I ask you, for heaven's sake, 
 Live not a fool like me. 
 Work for God as well as man, 
 And keep yourselves from sin; 
 When you die the world will mourn, 
 And God will take you in. 
 WE WILL. 
 We are moving on upon the stage of life, 
 The down-trodden race are we; 
 Still stniggling as we journey 
 On a higher seat to be. 
 Unfit for citizens, 
 The talk is ringing stilly 
 But let us get what is due, 
 And by our works we will 
 2 
 We are climbing up the ladder. 
 Reaching for success, 
 Some we have, but yet we are 
 Trying to get the best. 
 Let us join together 
 And keep on climbing still. 
 Still advancing round by round, 
 By each others help we will. 
 3 
 Let us move by next mile stone. 
 We are up from supine. 
 Not a day to tarry here, 
 Must move on with the time. , 
 Glad the day has now approached 
 And we are progressing still, 
 Uniting as one living the same, 
 By noble deeds we will. 
 SOME TIME. 
 1 
 Sometime the world is fuM of joy 
 And then gets full of strive, 
 It makes a fellow laugh sometime 
 And then cry out his life. 
 2 
 Sometime a fellow's home's all right, 
 Sometime a quarrel is up, 
 Sometime the wife wears loving- smiles, 
 Sometime she turns things up. 
 3 
 Sometime a fellow is living fine. 
 Sometime he's all in tough, 
 Sometimes the road is straight and smooth, 
 . Sometime 'tis crooked and rough. 
 4 
 Sometime the weather is warm and dry. 
 Sometime 'tis cold and wet, 
 Things are sure to turn around 
 So a fellow needn't fret. 
 Sometime a fellow is happy. 
 Sometime he is very sad, 
 Sometime he is feeling very good^ 
 Sometime be is feeling bad. 
 Sometime a fellow goes courting. 
 Having the swellest of swells, 
 Sometime his sweetheart turns him off. 
 Then he does fairly welL 
 7 
 Sometime a fellow is living high, 
 Sometime he is living low. 
 Sometime he has the best of health. 
 But things must change you know. 
 THE OLD PLOW. 
 1 
 An old plow lays under the shed, 
 Covered with ruin and rust, 
 The farmer has put it aside, 
 No longer in it to trust. 
 It served it's term years past and gone, 
 Turning up the soil, 
 As the plowman stoutly held 
 It in it's daily toil. 
 3 
 Good work the plow did do, 
 Suitable to the farmer's sight; 
 While he merrily plowed along, 
 Singing with delight. 
 The old plow did the noble work. 
 That brought the farmer's grain; 
 All things must change we all well know 
 So there it couldn't remain. 
 By and by the useful tool 
 Began to give away; 
 The iron wore out, the wood-work broke 
 And could no longer stay. 
 It was dragged up to the house, 
 And placed under the shed; 
 Ruin had caused its decay. 
 And rust has turned it red. 
 7 
 It has served its term of labor 
 And now must lay to rest. 
 Others now must do the work 
 For it has stood the test. 
 AROUND THE DEAD 
 1 
 The evening- was still and cool, 
 The wind had ceased to blow; 
 Around the home was still and quiet. 
 All in the valley below. 
 The twinkling- stars were shining* bright. 
 The silver moon hung low; 
 In all the neighborhood around 
 Was the saddest eve of yore; 
 And up the lonesome road that led 
 To the silent home of the dead. 
 2 
 The weeping- friends sent abroad the news 
 That their dear friend was gone; 
 A veil of sorrow was over them. 
 That they must grieve and mourn. 
 The friends around the fireside sat, 
 The night was calm and sad; 
 O, if the deceased could just return 
 They would be only glad. 
 3 
 Still hours of the night passed on, 
 The hour of midnight went, 
 As about the loss of a friend by death 
 The sad news had been sent. 
 The day dawned as with sorrow 
 And seemed to sympathize. 
 Oh, if they only could 
 Bid the deceased arise! 
 The clouds were drifting slowly by. 
 The sun shone dim and pale, 
 And seemed to mourn for the home 
 Where sorrow did prevail. 
 SHARE IT. 
 1 
 When sunshine fills the heart with joy 
 When you feel as gay as a lark, 
 Share it with some lonely friend ) 
 Whose path seems cold and dark. 
 Don't keep all good things for yourself, 
 You can't enjoy them right; 
 But let them shine in lonely homes 
 Brighter than radium light. 
 2 
 When pleasure is your occupation 
 And others are toiling hard, 
 Share with them and they with you 
 And get the great reward. 
 Care not for the proud who laugh. 
 Care not for the sluggards who rest, 
 But speak cheering words to some broken heart 
 In deep and dark distress. 
 3 
 If your house is filled with plenty, 
 And some friend is destitute. 
 Share then your plentiful store 
 And greet the warm salute. 
 Share what you think will help. 
 And will be pleasing too; 
 'Tis God's blessing that you have it. 
 And all wasn't meant for you. 
 4 
 Share with the sick, share with the poor, 
 Share with the humble, share with the low; 
 God smiles on him who will divide, 
 For the cheerful giver God will provide. 
-3g- 
 The Master gave you what you have; 
 In a moment He can take it; 
 No matter what is your lot, 
 'Tis your duty to share it. 
 THE FIREMAN OF THE G. &amp; A. 
 'Tis very shocking when we think 
 How well a man can be, 
 But next he is cold in death's embrace. 
 We wonder, where is he? 
 The fireman of the G. &amp; A. 
 Left home on duty soon, 
 Not aware of things ahead. 
 But in life's full bloom. 
 He left his home in his spirit's pride. 
 He bade his wife adieu: 
 He did not know that death was near. 
 Nor know his hours were few. 
 He stepped upon his engine 
 As he had done before, 
 Kindled a fire in the proper place 
 And put coal in the door. 
 5 
 Soon the steam was rising high. 
 The time was coming on 
 When he must move on to death 
 Without a sign or warn. 
 The time came on, the train moved off, 
 Thundering on its way; 
 .No man ever worked more cheerful than he. 
 The fireman of G. &amp; A, 
 7 
 The train moved on at rapid speed, 
 He singing on the way; 
 -But in the jaws of death he was. 
 The fireman of the G. &amp; A, 
 S 
 He speeded over iron rails 
 And over trestles deep; 
 Left all at home full of joy, 
 But soon they all shall weep. 
 9 
 Nearing a curve just ahead, 
 The speed wasn't checked: 
 But soon the dreadful shock of all 
 'Twas in a dreadful wreck. 
 10 
 The fireman made efforts to escape. 
 But his chances were of few; 
 The engine caught his body 
 And cut it right in two, 
 11 
 The rest of th-e crew escaped death. 
 Left him the debt to pay; 
 Let us remember the one who died 
 Was the fireman of the G. &amp; A, 
 THE FIRST DAY IN THE CHRISTMAS. 
 (on the farm.) 
 1 
 'Twas the first day in the Christmas all over the place, 
 A smile was on every body's face; 
 The pigs jumped and hopped, the calves ran and played; 
 Everybody in the neighborhood had got up and prayed ; 
 Thanked G^>d that they were living and were not 
 taken away 
 To the everlasting beyond, the debt of death to pay. 
 Glad to see the morning dawn with the Christmas 
 light. 
 Thanked God for His mighty power that kept them 
 through the night. 
 'Twas the first day in the Christmas; they couldn't 
 frolic much, 
 For 'twas surely Sunday and the people went to 
 church. 
 There they sang and prayed; to sin they never dared; 
 Giving praises to their God, glad they had been spared. 
 * 'Good morning! Christmas give!" the sound could 
 be heard 
 Ringing over the neighborhood like the song of a bird. 
 The chickens all seemed gay, the turkeys all seemed  glad 
 That they had missed the Christmas pot that every family had. 
 The dogs played with glee and barked out the same. 
 Even the milk cow seemed proud of her name. 
 'Twas the first day in the Christmas; every body seemed glad; 
 Things went on lovely and nothing happened bad. 
 Fire crackers shot seldom, Roman candles laid still. 
 Everything was gay from the village to the mill. 
 The children all were merry and talked of Santa Claus, 
 Showing all their presents, telling of their joys, 
 For he sure had been to see them and left them many things; 
 There they had toy birds, some had little wings; 
 Different kinds of goodies, all things that were sweet; 
 Some had pretty dolls dressed nice and neat, 
 Some riding ponies, some on bycicles, 
 Some crying "funny boys! 0, how it tickles!" 
 'Twas the first day in the Christmas; every body was merry, 
 Every little tot's face seemed bright as a cherry. 
 Some went to church, some visited friends, 
 Some w^ent to weddings, some just coming in. 
 Good news coming from everywhere; 
 Good things scattered here and there. 
 The happy holidays passed so bright; 
 Left every one's heart full of delight. 
 Some journeyed far away, some stayed at home, 
 Some went to come again, some went to roam; 
 Said they would return after the holidays, they bet. 
 It still must be Christmas, for they haven't got back yet 
 'TIS CHRISTMAS. 
 1 
 The morning dawns so bright and fay% 
 The greeting of Christmas goes through the air. 
 'Tis Christmas to-day in every land; 
 'Tis Christmas to-day w^ith every mam 
 2 
 'Tis Christmas to-day where the Eskimos dwell; 
 'Tis Christmas w^here the fairies live in the delL 
 To the wilds of Africa far away, 
 All over the land, 'tis Christmas ta-day. 
3 
 "Tis Christmas where the fruit grows sweet and fine, 
 Tis Christmas where the people are cruel and kind; 
 'Tis Christmas in the land of war and peace, 
 Whether a poor man's lamb or a rich man's feast. 
 4 
 'Tis Christmas in the land where the snows never melt, 
 'Tis Christmas in the land where it is never felt; 
 'Tis Christmas all over the Ashman's bay; 
 In every home 'tis Christmas to-day. 
 DEATH. 
 1 
 Death is a mighty monster 
 That passes through every land; 
 He has no certain place to go, 
 No fear for any man. 
 2 
 The desperado stands out bold. 
 The sheriff fears to go near; 
 But death without a sword or gun 
 Goes tripping without fear. 
 3 
 With one touch of his dreadful hand 
 Lays man cold and still; 
 He fails to resist and knows it not 
 While death does a will. 
 4 
 He creeps into the "palace" of kings 
 And takes the Prince away; 
 He goes to the homes of the humble 
 And glooms the brightest days. 
 5 
 Into the homes of the milHonaires, 
 Who lived and hves to-day, 
 He stole and steals the precious souls 
 Of mortal men away. 
 6 
 He visits the homes of the high and low, 
 He visits the homes of the rich and poor. 
 He stands not off for silver nor gold, 
 Nor for pity and woe. 
 7 
 He robs parents of their darling babe. 
 And children of parents dear; 
 Kindred of kindred all over the world, 
 Without a sign of fear. 
 8 
 Upon the dreadful battle-ground. 
 Among the shot and shell, 
 And there he does his mighty work 
 For heaven or for hell. 
 MAIN ENTRANCE. 
 "Main Entrance!" Yes, the sign reads plain; 
 "Main Entrance" to what? It don't explain. 
 But it hangs over the door of a licensed saloon. 
 Where boys hang out late and men gather soon. 
 "Main Entrance" to the table where the billiard balls 
 roll, 
 Where the card-decks are cut and swearing untold. 
 The "prides of life" enter before they will heed. 
 Then some mother's heart is made to bleed. 
 3 
 "Main Entrance!" But it seems that few understand 
 That it is the pathway to poverty of man. 
 Where King Alcohol reigns with a smile on his face. 
 Inviting some youngster to a pit of disgrace. 
 4 
 "Main Entrance." Alas! But it don't half tell 
 How dreadful the destiny, so miserably in hell. 
 Some dear mother breaks down in despair 
 When she hears that her darling son entered there. 
 5 
 "Main Entrance" to the throne of the Whiskey God; 
 That means your heart will soon cease to throb. 
 If dead ones could teach, and living ones could learn, 
 The sign would explain "Main Entrance" to ruin. 
 6 
 "Main Entrance" to disgrace, where few return, 
 Swept away by the tyrant before they can learn. 
 If those who have entered could now tell it right, 
 'Twould explain "Main Entrance" to an endless 
 night. 
 THE PRAYER OF THE AFRO-AMERICAN. 
 Help us Lord is our daily plea. 
 Bless us Thy people, Thy people free! 
 Help us Lord, this African race, 
 Down trodden, but to Thee we give our case. 
 Help us to learn the way of Thy Cross. 
 Least, by millions we are lost; yes, yes. 
 Help us show to our young men 
 The path of the righteous, they who walk in sin. 
 Before our young women let our lights so shine. 
 That they be won, and ever be Thine. 
 Help us to conquer the loafer by trace, 
 That he bring not upon us shame and disgrace. 
 Help us to gain him for Thee in Thy name, 
 And ever be Thine, for himself make fame. 
 Destroy the drunkard's appetite we pray; 
 Alas! Some wife is perishing to-day. 
 May he throw away that, from the Devil it came. 
 Or his poor children will sink into shame. 
 We pray a friendly co-operation 
 With every race and every nation. 
 Help us to help each other we pray, 
 And fulfill our promises along the way. 
 Help us to lift up this down-trodden race. 
 With noble hearts to fill the place 
 That now stands open for the capable man 
 Willing to receive whosoever can. 
 Help us in this struggle to win 
 We earnestly ask of Thee. Amen! 
 THINKING OF THE LAST DAY, 
 1 
 If the Lord would summon me to-day 
 To the judgment bar, what could I say, 
 But Lord here am I? 
 Trembling with fear before his face. 
 Pleading for pardon by His grace, 
 Or forever left cry. 
 I wonder when this soul of mine 
 Will be forever snatched from time? 
 Can I say. 
 Lord, with Thy infinite power 
 I am ready at this hour; 
 Take me away? 
  
 3 
 Will my soul ascend its heavenly flight. 
 Or share the gloom of an endless nighty 
 Where the wicked only trod? . 
 Shall I dwell in heaven above, 
 Or with the demons who have no love? 
 I will trust in God. 
 JUST BE USEFUL WHERE YOU ARE. 
 Don't lose time to stop and wish 
 That you were away up high ; 
 Only strive by honest toil 
 To get there by and by. 
 Don't wish to be the greatest, 
 Or in some famous land afar. 
 But decide to do your best 
 And be useful where you are. 
 When time comes to decorate. 
 The cedar upon the hill won't do; 
 So they go down into the valley 
 And get the lily too. 
 So 'tis not always the high 
 That leaves the door of hope ajar; 
 'Tis those who work with courage 
 And are useful where they are. 
 Since time and tide wait for none, 
 Man has not a moment to loose; 
 Duty always calls him on 
 To win the goal if he choose. 
 The journey is hard and easy, too, 
 With difRcults to mar. 
 If you mean to meet success. 
 Just be useful where you are. 
 HOT WEATHER. 
 1 
 Hot! Aint it?" is the question asked 
 By nearly all who meet. 
 Every body mingles where the air do stir 
 And seldom on the street. 
 2 
 ^'Hot! Aint it?" says the teamster, 
 As his panting team walks along. 
 He throws perspiration from his face 
 And chants his merry song. 
 3 
 "Hot! Aint it?" says the merchant 
 "Yes," they all agree, 
 "This heat has withered my vegetables up 
 And hardened my green peas," 
 4 
 "Hot! Aint it?" says the butcher, 
 "Things don't work so nice; 
 For the past few days I use 
 Double my daily ice," 
 5 
 "Hot! Aint it?" says the farmer. 
 "Aint seen the like since I been born; 
 The heat has killed my melons out 
 And parched my upland corn," 
 6 
 "Plums and berries aint fit to eat. 
 No honey from the bees; 
 Since this hot weather has set in, 
 Green leaves are parching on the trees," 
NOBODY KNOWS. 
 1 
 When the babe first sees the hght of day, 
 Nobody knoWvS 
 Whether he will die young or Hve to be gray- 
 Nobody knows. 
 Be great or small, 
 Low or tall, 
 Make friends or foes. 
 Nobody knows. 
 2 
 He plays around his mother's knee; 
 Nobody knows 
 What his future years will be, 
 Nobody knows. 
 Be good or bad, 
 Make glad or sad, 
 Or share with the heroes, 
 Nobody knows. 
 3 
 As his childhood days pass swiftly by 
 Nobody knows 
 Will he respond to the needy cry, 
 Nobody knows. 
 Will poverty or prosperity 
 Be his lot, 
 With joy or woes? 
 Nobody kno'ws. 
 A SUMMER MORNING ON THE FARM. 
 1 
 Day is breaking from the eavSt and driving away the night; 
 The sun is rising warra and clear, bring things to light. 
 2 
 Things almost the same every day in the week. 
 The raccoon do^* is barking all mp and down the creek 
 S 
 How the rooster crows, and the setting hen do cluck. 
 The old turkey gobbles at the quacking of the duck. 
 4 
 The old man wakes up and clears up his throat 
'Time ter git up now, day is don broke." 
 5 
 Gets up and gets his hammer, goes to knocking on 
 the tools, 
 "Hi dar, git up boys, go and ketch dem mules." 
 "De sun is risin, time yawl wuz in de feal; 
 jit dat smok house key dar honey, go and git some 
 meal. 
 7 
 Birds are singing with the rising of the sun, 
 "Hu rah dar honey, ain't you got datbreakfusdone/' 
 LIFE, 
 1 
 Life is as sweet as sweet can be, 
 So let us live it right; 
 This time will soon pass away, 
 These days be changed to night 
 2 
 Let us do something here in life 
 And mark the stone of time, 
 To aid those who struggle 
 With earthly toil and mind* 
3 
 Let us live when we are deacL 
 Let those who survive us say,. 
 They were so honest and noble 
 We wish for them to-day, 
 4 
 Let our Au-to-Biography be 
 Upon the hearts of men, 
 That they may help for our Lord above 
 Some precious soul to win. 
 5 
 Life is but a stage of action, 
 Then man must pass away; 
 Others succeed and so it goes 
 From the creation ^till to>-day. 
 6 
 There are deeds that we can do- 
 To heJp soul's along the way, 
 Only a short time here in life, 
 Then man m;ust pass away. 
 PUSH. 
 1 
 When chances for honor come, 
 Push them. 
 When chances come to strike sin d'umb5^ 
 Push them. 
 Everything must be pushed, 
 Whether good or bad. 
 Can't suit all by an act; 
 Some left glad and some left sad^ 
 When detrimental things appear, 
 Push them. 
 To some dark and forgotten rear, 
 Push them. 
 Push everything that appear. 
 Be sure to push them right. 
 Push all good things to success; 
 Push bad ones out of sight. 
 3 
 When knowledge gets in front of you, 
 Push it; 
 When the evil mind begins to woo, 
 Push it. 
 With infinite vigor push them all; 
 Push all where they belong; 
 Push energy to highest point, 
 Push hard against the wrong. 
 4 
 Push enables men to be wise; 
 Push helps men to realize 
 The great fortune of the future day, 
 Gained by pushing through the right way. 
 Push puts start to success, 
 Push puts better into best. 
 TIME. 
 1 
 Only a measure of duration. 
 Then it will be blotted out; 
 To be no more forever. 
 No happenings brought about. 
 2 
 And during- time things will change
 Time passes men away; 
 Time carried yesterday. 
 Time brought to-day. 
 Time allows storms to rise, 
 Then allows them to cease;' 
 Time allows wars to break out^ 
 Then time to sign for peace. 
 Time allows nations to rise, 
 Time allows them to fall; 
 Time is the cause of happenings. 
 Time is the cause of all. 
 Time allows improvements. 
 Better and better still ; 
 Time allowed men with sense 
 This whole round world to fill. 
 With knowledge and with skill 
 That almost impossible seems, 
 But still 'twas done in time by men, 
 And thought of as midnight dreams. 
 7 
 There have been some noble inventions 
 That came in human's mind, 
 Nothing allowed it but 
 The measure we call time. 
 THE COLORED HEROES IN BLUE. 
 1 
 Uncle Sam says they are useful. 
 That's why he holds them fast. 
 In the hottest of the battles 
 They stood until the last. 
 They fought; they charged to the front; 
 Their excelsiors were of few. 
 Uncle Sam gave honor 
 To the colored heroes in blue. 
 2 
 From the Revolution to date 
 The colored heroes stood stout. 
 No advancing foe 
 Has ever turned them out. 
 Ever since when war broke out 
 Uncle Sam said they would do. 
 Honor to the noble sons — 
 The colored heroes in blue. 
 3 
 In Uncle Sam's uniform, 
 To aid him in his fate, 
 Marching bravely to the front, 
 And braver still of late. 
 Dying and trying, killing and spilling, 
 Ever brave and true; 
 Honor to the undefeated 
 Colored heroes in blue. 
 Every body speaks high of them. 
 How they mingled with the band 
 When they sheared the Spanish-American 
 And charged at San Juan; 
 How they saved the Rough Riders. 
 The Spaniards they withdrew 
 When they saw the angry faces 
 Of the colored heroes in blue. 
 BOOKER T. WASHINGTON. 
 1 
 Born a slave under the lash of the whips, 
 Not a word of protection could fall from his lips; 
 Full of ambition and childish vim, 
 Wondering if there was any freedom for him. 
 Days came and went, time passed away. 
 Until the joyful news was heard," 'tis freedom to-day!" 
 Up from slavery he bounded like a flash. 
 Educated himself and gave ignorance a crash. 
 Let welcome cry from every land. 
 To greet the coming of such a man. 
 The great and small have made the confession, 
 No other black man with such a possession. 
 Praised by the old, boasted of by the young. 
 Now deemed honorable by every tribe and tongue. 
 The driving-wheel of education swift 
 Stooped down his brother to uplift. 
 The greatest black man under the sun. 
 The rulers and noblemen greet him when he come. 
 Willingly helping his people free. 
 We feel proud of Booker T. 
 His teachings can't fade from human mind, 
 His works will last as long as time. 
 He well deserves the name he has won. 
 Honor to the greatest Washington ! 
 PAUL LAWRENCE DUNBAR. 
 1 
 Give ample time and ample space 
 To mention the greatest poet of the race. 
 With his poetic talent no joys to mar. 
 We praise the noble Paul Lawrence Dunbar. 
 2 
 Proud of a man with a boon like him. 
 Once stricken with poverty, but infinite vim^ 
 Proud of our poet and the work he has done, 
 Now upon human hearts like diamonds in the sun, 
 3
 His writings have covered his native land, 
 He wrote something to please every living man; 
 Over oceans deep in lands afar, 
 They read the books of Paul Lawrence Dunbar. 
 4 
 Dropped from his pen, caught like a whirl. 
 The poems of Dunbar have covered the world. 
 Loved his talent, and the world did show, 
 Like the faithful Paul of long ago. 
 5 
 Plucked from nature's woes 
 By the hands of the monster death 
 Our poet went 
 His pen winds no more in his feeble hand, 
 But we hope he has joined the heavenly band 
 For which he was sent. 
 KELLY MILLER. 
 1 
 Honor to our Philosopher, 
 Of noble deeds he is a tiller, 
 We praise the honored and noble hearted 
 Professor Kelly Miller. 
 2 
 Every black man who knows of him feels encouraged. 
 How he brightened up the blots 
  
 When he answered Thomas Dixon (Jr.) 
 As to the Leopard's spots. 
 3 
 He defends well his race, 
 Fills well his place, 
 And don't hide his face, 
 But stands bold for the rig-ht. 
 He held up our fame 
 When the down-trodders came, 
 And didn't deny his name. 
 So he made our future bright. 
 4 
 God bless him! may he live 
 Long such answers to give. 
 To cast prejudice its lots. 
 All intruders he can fix 'em 
 Like he did Thomas Dixon 
 When he wrote the Leopard's spots. 
 HUNTUN POSSUMS ON DE FARM, 
 1 . 
 Three farmers' chaps. Bud, Babe an Hunn,

 BE THANKFUL. 
 (Written for Thanksgiving Day. ) 
 1 
 The land to*-day is full of peace, 
 And still no talk of war; 
 On this Thanksgiving Day we have 
 Everything to be thankful for. 
 2 
 Be thankful to-day for the bread we eat; 
 Be thankful to-day for our portion of meat; 
 Be thankful to-day for the clothes we wear; 
 Be thankful to-day for our Saviour's care. 
 3 
 Be thankful that we are spared to see 
 Our people advancing, our people free; 
 That we have been left by the mercies of God 
 A few more days this earth to trod. 
 4 
 Be thankful for this enlightened day, 
 That we can send missionaries far away 
 To the wilds of Africa to tell of Christ, 
 Be thankful, be thankful, be thankful thrice. 
 AIM HIGH. 
 1 
 Aim high on the road of life. 
 Though your station be low; 
 Strive hard to win the prize 
 That nature has in store. 
 2 
 Let your ideal be the Lord, 
 Your aim His Kingdom to eoffie. 
 In coming days you can smile 
 Upon your work well done. 
 Aim high; work for noble things; 
 Struggle to gain the same; 
 And in the future days rejoice 
 Over a high and accomplished aim. 
 4 
 Aim high to be with noble men 
 Who national reputations have won: 
 Labor to sit with the famous 
 Who noble deeds have done. 
 HE WAS COMING THROUGH. 
 (Written on the day after the visit of President 
 Roosevelt to Montgomery in October, 1905. ) 
 1 
 Montgomery looked uncommonly nice 
 In red, white and blue, 
 To warmly welcome the President 
 As he was coming through. 
 2 
 From the Union Station to the old State House 
 The flags waved thick and true, 
 As if to smile upon the President 
 While he was passing through. 
 Cannons thundered when he arrived; 
 His greeters were not of few; 
 Just to m.ake him happy 
 As he was passing through. 
 School children got hold of flags, 
 To greet him they did do. 
 To honor the nation's chief 
 As he was coming through. 
 Farmers came from far and near, 
 They wanted to see him too; 
 The long heard of Roosevelt, 
 As he was coming through. 
FAIR EASTER. 
 1 
 Fair Easter, so warm and bright. 
 We greet thee with untold dehght. 
 We love thy name; 
 We love thee for our risen Lord, 
 Thy noble name we spread, 
 Let nature repeat the same. 
 Fair Easter time has fixed it so, 
 That you were here one year ago, 
 Met nature's welcome voice, 
 We have waited patiently but not in vain. 
 And time has brought you back again, 
 Let us rejoice. 
 Fair Easter, with spring and flowers sweet, 
 You challenge us this day to meet 
 Let us say; 
 Happy hearts that long for thee, 
 Now rejoicing here are we 
 This blessed day. 
 4 
 Fair Easter, with our risen Christ, 
 With happy hearts we greet thee twice, 
 Listen to this; 
 Cheering with our earthly power, 
 We celebrate thee at this hour 
 With life-long bliss. 
 EASTER IS HERE. 
 1 
 Happy Easter, joy for all, 
 Bright spring time of the year; 
 Mothers and fathers merrily sing 
 With joy glad Easter is here. 
 2 
 The children throng the busy streets, 
 The farm boy sings it clear; 
 The infant in its mother's arms 
 Smiles happy Easter is here. 
 3 
 The sunbeams dances round about, 
 The forest seems to cheer; 
 The birds in the tree-top sings away, 
 Welcome Easter here. 
 4 
 It makes us think of long ago, 
 When the grave gave up its dear; 
 Now thanks returns from every source 
 Glad with Easter here. 
 THE TUNELESS WHISTLER. 
 1 
 He whistles as the morning breaks, 
 Arising from his bed, 
 Whistling as the sun comes up, 
 And shakes his thoughtful head. 
 2 
 The day grows old, he whistles still, 
 Perfect in his boon, 
 Whistling on this, whistling on that, 
 All without a tune. 
 3 
 He whistles at the noonday. 
 The sound continues drizzling: 
 Almost forgot what he is about. 
 But still he keeps on whistling. 
 4 
 He whistles in the evening late, 
 Upon his gift he is feasting; 
 He whistles as the sun goes down, 
 And still no sign of ceasing. 
 The evening shade steals slowly on, 
 His task is finished soon; 
 While he continues whistling, 
 Still without a tune. 
 LIVING AND PASSING OF MAN. 
 1 
 As man breathes the breath of life, 
 He dreams of joy, he dreams of strife. 
 And wins what he can; 
 Death leaps out an invisible form, 
 Passing amidst the raging storm. 
 To get the son of man. 
 2 
 Born to die, though to sin he yielded, 
 Death awaits him on the battlefield 
 While fighting the foe; 
 As his body falls lifeless upon the ground. 
 Death so greedily upon him bounds; 
 Man must go. 
 3 
 Drifting like leaves before a mighty wind. 
 Hasting to a land where he knows no kin, 
 Ever to stay; 
 Passing through this mortal age. 
 Caught in snares like birds in the cage 
 And borne away. 
 4 
 Goes from time to never return, 
 In heaven to rest or in hell to burn, 
 Gets justice for all; 
 Going from friends, going from foes, 
 Passing from nature's troubles and woes, 
 Answers the call. 
 THE LAST CHANCE. 
 Dream no longer, sons of men; 
 If you are not righteous, why linger in sin? 
 Why hold to your folly? Do cast it away; 
 Death is ready for your summons to-day. 
 Turn like a flash, your sins down-cast. 
 Or the demon will whisper your chance has passed. 
 While death creeps upon the mortal being, 
 Life like a flash from it is fleeing; 
 Life is the past, 
 'Tis judgment at last, 
 Then to Eternity the soul must go. 
 Then death with pride ends his trace, 
 Man sees the last of human race; 
 'Tis come at last. 
 His chance has passed. 
 MY PLEA. 
 As we struggle against the coming tide, 
 Time will soon make us nature's pride; 
 We who labor for our people free. 
 Must say what the coming negro will be, 
 May we labor through faith and grace, 
 And show to the world a well made race. 
 BECAUSE. 
 1 
 Because my Savior loved me 
 He spoke me into time, 
 And because he loved me still 
 He gave me a poetic mind. 
 2 
 Because I love my gift 
 I have begun to write; 
 The same I mean to cheerish 
 Till my day is changed to night. 
 3 
 Because I love my people, 
 The race of the Africa man, 
 I hand out this little volume 
 To every greeting land. 
 4 
 Because I thank my Redeemer 
 For the talent that He give, 
 I will hand out my poetic bliss 
 So long as he lets me live.

PREFACE 
In compliance with the wish of many friends, I have consented to the publication of these products of my heart and pen, the reading of which, I hope, may lead many to feel the emotions that prompted me to their production.
It has been said, "Necessity is the mother of Invention." I say that Solitude is the mother of Poetry. I speak of solitude in a special sense. I do not intend to imply that one must necessarily be apart from mankind, but I speak of that secluded, quiet communion with the imagination such as the heart often enjoys regardless of environment. In such times of solitude and re- flection my heart has often been moved to overflowing, and the trifles of this little volume are the deluges that have found expression in words.
My selections are all brief. Just faint touches upon the heartstrings of Human Nature. They all bear my own originality. Not one is an imitation. Though, doubtless, many of the chords have been sounded before, since "there is nothing new under the sun," and we must all harp upon the same strings; yet, there are as many different "touches" as there are players, and the melody of each harper bears a certain unique characteristic. This little book is "touched" with the will of my ardent desire to reach the thought-centers of humanity, and, that these may find here motives tending toward the illustrious influences of good thoughts and deeds. Should this result be obtained, in any degree, I shall not have striven in vain.
L. B. W. Chicago, 111., February 5, 1907.
AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
"Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips." We who are inclined to speak overmuch of ourselves seem to feel in these words an open rebuke by the wise Solomon. Yet it seems if one can. only resist the impulse to soar away upon the evil winds of egotism into the vain clouds of auto-laudation, he may be permitted to walk cautiously about the peaceful valley of truthful simplicity.
I have no reasons to offer in defense of present assumption as an autobiographer. I feel that my life has been insignificant and, upon my part, void of much good. But the vernal years of man's allotted "three score and ten" have just passed over my head, placing thereon — even in their swift flight — many of the silver threads of life's autumn. Should there be the blessed visual realization of life's summer in store for me, I hope to grow into a life of real usefulness.
My father's name is Henderson B. Watkins. The maiden name of my mother was Emeline Brooks. Humble, praying, Christian parents from the lowly log cabin of slavery. "Joined together" in those benighted days of servitude, and, subsequently, legally confirmed. Both of them secretly learned to read print, and were devoted readers of the Bible. Neither of them learned to write. My father became a successful miner. My mother was an acknowledged efficient cook and a competent nurse. Upon the summit of industry, perseverance, fortitude, goodness, kindness and womanliness my mother's life rises before me — an amatory personage.
According to the "birth record" of our family Bible, and the unquestionable statement of my parents, I was born May 25, 1878, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, at a small settlement called Otterdale, about twenty miles from Richmond. I am the youngest but two of the family of fifteen children. Soon after I became seven years of age my parents gave me a McGufifey's Primer, and one bright Monday morning I was sent with my older brothers and sisters to the first school that I ever attended. I shall never forget how proud and happy I felt that "first day in school." My older sister had taught me the alphabet. I could read and spell quite well.
This school was taught by one Mr. Gray, a man who was kind in disposition, noble, magnetic and impressive in his bearing, and a worthy teacher. My young heart was drawn toward him with the tender liking of true friendship. My studies became a pleasure; thus my launch upon an educational sea was replete with pleasures that I am always glad to recall. I do not think I gave my teacher much trouble with my studies, as I found myself at the end of my first session in school ready for the Third Reader, with other studies accordingly. For three suc- cessive sessions I attended the same school, with the same teacher. The next session I attended the same school, but had a lady teacher, one Miss Tucker, who had been an advanced pupil of Mr. Gray's school during my preceding school days. The following three sessions I attended another school, taught by my older sister, Leora, the one who taught me the alphabet, and to whom I dedicated "The Household Queen," of this volume. Sister Leora was also formerly a pupil of Mr. Gray's school, but afterward graduated from the Summer Normal Course of "The Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute," of Petersburg, Va.
In December, 1891, my mother died. I was then thirteen years of age. I think I was my mother's favorite. O! those thirteen years in the sunshine of mother's love ! I now look back through the dim mists of years and see the smiles! hear the voice! feel the caresses of MOTHER!
Soon after my mother's death I began to study crayon portraiture and automatic shading pen work. Having made fair progress with these studies, I made a portrait of my mother. From this portrait I received the impulse that led me to write "My Mother's Picture." This was my first attempt at verse-making, and was written when I was thirteen years of age.
About this time my older brother presented me with an organ and I began to study music.
My parents had early talked of sending me to college some day, and in September, 1892, I was sent to "The Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute," Petersburg, Va. My sister, Leora, bore the greater part of my expenses ; a portion I paid by doing janitor work at the school. My entrance examination at this school was creditable, and I found it comparatively easy to keep up with my class. This session at college having been in every way favorable, and my desire for an education being awakened, I endeavored during the intermission from the close of school in May to its re-opening in September, to earn enough money to return to college. In this I failed, but earned enough money to buy the books sufficient for the class in which I would have been had I returned.
I had heard a college professor tell how he at one time, while obtaining an education, found himself with insufficient means to return to college ; and that he bought books and pursued the studies of his class, personally reporting and successfully taking each examination, finally graduating with his class. This I endeavored to do. I succeeded in this to a great extent but, unlike my hero, I did not report to take the examinations; whether I would have graduated with my class or not is one of the untried things that must ever be unknown.
About this time I received my inspirations of Christianity, and joined the Baptist church. Soon after this I wrote mv second selection, "The Vale of Solitude." Then followed "The Beauties of Woman," "The Flower at My Window," "The Faded Leaves," "The Frozen Rain," "Uncle Ike's Opinion of Winterpock's College," "A Winter's Sunrise," "The Household Queen," "Retrospection," and others.
In my life there is one love. This is manifested in the selections: "A Divided Love," "The Treasured Curl," "To the Sighing Winds," "Love," "I Love You, Too," and " Ever Faithful to You."
In the summer of 1897 I passed successfully the examination for public school teacher. I taught school the following two sessions.
May 25, 1900 (my twenty-second birthday), I left home, in company with a cousin and two other young men, for the Chamberlin Hotel, Old Point Comfort, Va., where we had been promised engagements as waiters. Being the least experienced of the four of my company, I soon became discouraged in my attempts at waiting, despite the fact I was treated kindly and assured that I would become a successful waiter. But my despondency increased daily, until I, at length, left that hotel and went to Baltimore, Md., in which city one of my brothers lived. In this city I was engaged as waiter at the "Old Town Hotel." One month's work at this hotel gave me new ambitions for hotel work. I afterward served as waiter at the "Florence Hotel," Philadelphia, Pa.; lastly, at the "Queen City Hotel," Cumberland, Md.
Led by the love of adventure and travel, coaxed by the hope of experience and the ac- quisition of knowledge, driven by the pangs of a seemingly hopeless love, August i6, 1900, I enlisted in the service of the United States Army. I was assigned to the Tenth Cavalry. For my first soldierly training, I was sent to Fort Clark, Texas. A few months later I was assigned to Troop " F" of the Tenth Cavalry then stationed at Fort Mcintosh, Texas. The next day after joining my troop I was detailed as clerk at the post Adjutant's Office. Later I was detailed troop clerk.
April 15, 1 901, I embarked with my troop, at San Francisco, Cal., for foreign service in the Philippine Islands. We arrived at Manila May 13, 190 1. I served in the campaign against the Philippine insurgents on the island of Samar, May, June and July, 1901. After about one year and four months service in the islands we were surprised by an order directing our troop to return to the United States. After returning to the States, we were stationed at Fort Wash- akie, Wyo. (a post then about one hundred and fifty miles from any railroad). This being an Indian reservation I learned many curious and interesting facts in regard to the customs of this race of people. During school session while serving at this post I was assistant teacher of the post school. While here I wrote the military record of the First Sergeant of my troop. It was published in the February number of "THE COLORED AMERICAN MAGAZINE," then published in Boston, under the title of "The Life Story of a Typical Fighter." By request, I also contributed articles and poems to "THE ARMY AND NAVY UNION JOURNAL" of New York. Among them — "A Recruit's Resolutions," "Fort Washakie," "The Man With the Gun," and "To One of the Brave." I remained at this station until the expiration of my term of enlistment (August 15, 1903), at which date I was given an honorable discharge, showing for me an "excellent character and absolutely temperate habits." During this service in the Army I completed a course of "Advanced Bookkeeping and Business," with the " National Correspondence School," Washington, D. C.
December 21, 1903, I re-enlisted for service in the Hospital Corps, Medical Department, United States Army, and was sent to the " Hospital School of Instruction," Washington Barracks, D. C. Meanwhile, I attended night school at the "ARMSTRONG MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL," Washington, D. C, and pursued a course of stenography and typewriting. Having completed the prescribed course at the "Hospital School of Instruction," I was sent to Fort Assinniboine, Mont., for duty.
October, 1904 (nine months and a few days after having entered the Medical Department), I passed successfully the examination for Hospital Sergeant. November, 1904, I received the appointment.
January 25, 1906, by special request, I was again sent to the Philippine Islands. During this service I was engaged in much actual hospital work in the field. This was during the pulejanes insurrection on the island of Leyte, July, August, September and October, 1906. Deciding to leave the army service, I was returned to the United States and received my second discharge January 3, 1907.
"VOICES OF SOLITUDE" breathes all that is dear to me in life. Every good emotion of which my heart is capable is 'in each line, and is a part of me.

INTRODUCTION 
INTRODUCTION 
Dear Readers: —  In my heart abides
Fond Hope, who has a little son —
His name is Wish, and more besides
He seems to be a pleasant one.
He seems obliging in his way —
Although he is a little lad —
He comes and offers me to-day
A service — but his face is sad.
He says he'll bear this little book
And place it in your busy hand ;
Perhaps, you'll, by his honest look,
His earnest motives understand.
The little fellow cannot talk
(This I forgot to say before),
A mute from birth ; but he can walk
And look the things he would implore.
He always tries his best to please,
And make you smile approvingly;
For by this act he always sees
You take his faults excusingly.
But when you've learned his noiseless speech,
Indeed, this peaceful little elf
Will well explain this book, and each 
of all his signs is truth itself.
He'll tell you of the mournful day,
In th' early morning of my youth,
When mother went from me away
Up to the heavens above, forsooth!
He'll tell you of the day I wrote 
"My Mother's Picture" when I stood
Before her photograph to note
This noble view of womanhood.
He'll tell you of my Christian birth
Down in the Vale of Solitude ;
And of the friends of noble worth
I've met in life — so kind and good.
He'll tell you of the girl I love,
And how her love has helped me live ;
How all the pretty stars above
Have lent me songs to sing and give.
He'll help you see in every way
The many things that bid me write;
How hard I try to do and say
What e'er may give the brightest light.
You'll treat him kindly, now, I know
And please this little bearer's heart;
Then in his little bow he'll show
Another well accomplished art.
VOICES OF SOLITUDE 
THE VALE OF SOLITUDE 
Sweet, silent, Vale of Solitude! 
         Secluded, quiet, rest! 
Oft thee I seek with serious mood 
         Of thought within my breast. 
Thou beaut 'ous plain amid the hills 
         Where sunlight's dancers play; 
‘Tis here a fragrant odor fills 
        The air with breaths of May. 
A dreamy breeze here gently blows, 
        As if from angels' wings; 
The sweetest songs that Fancy knows 
        Here in this vale she sings. 
The flowers here all seem to know 
        A heart when it is glad; 
They seem to laugh when one is so, 
        And weep when one is sad. 
The chymings of its gentle streams 
        Bear beauty's imagery 
Of wasted loves, wars' blood-stained dreams — 
        Sad trophies for life's sea!
 Its lifeless stones lie motionless, 
        Yet preach their sermons, too, 
Of dead souls that no Life confess, 
        Though e'er so near the true! 
Great sentinels of massy hills — 
        With summits' golden heights —  
Vale's jew'led thoughts rich luster fill 
        While in their upward flight.
The spirit of this dreamy plain  
        Harm'nizes with each heart;  
Each pleasure, sorrow, joy or pain 
        It seems to share a part. 
The Savior sought this quiet place
        (Gethsemane was there) 
A seriousness was on His face 
        As here He lay in prayer. 
Then all the flowers closed their eyes 
        To check their tears of grief, 
A gloomy shade was o'er the skies. 
        And breathless every leaf. 
A guilty sinner once I lay 
        Upon this sacred ground; 
All gloomy shadows cleared away 
        When peace — sweet peace — I found!
 With sighs of grief and songs of joy 
        This spot I oft have sought; 
For nothing here seems to annoy 
        While I am wrapped in thought. 
Oh, let me in this vale seclude, 
        For 'tis a place I love ! 
The sweet, sad Vale of Solitude
        Leads all my thoughts above.
MY MOTHER'S PICTURE 
Oh, if thou could' st speak to me, 
My mother dear! 
Silent are those lips I see — 
No voice I hear! 
Mother dear — oh ! dost thou know 
How my heart yearns for thee so? 
When from earth I'm called to go 
May I not fear. 
Thy dear love — oh, I do miss, 
Beloved one! 
Now I never feel thy kiss 
When day is done! 
Thou art gone now as a dove, 
Gone to realms up above, 
But, now longing for thy love 
Is thy dear son. 
Mother, since thou left me here 
Some years ago, 
Oft this world seems dark and drear 
Down here below. 
Mother dear, farewell! I trust 
When to leave this world I must, 
When my body lies in dust 
Then thee I'll know! 
LOVE
O, Love! Love! Love! mysterious strength! 
Weak e'en is death to ever quench 
Thy glowing, pure, magnetic light. 
The strongest heart hath not the might 
To e'er resist thy entrance there. 
Thy reigning force ne'er fails to bear 
Its fruitfulness. Thou art the true 
Essential of the heart; and through
Thy inclination's kingly will, 
Is blended with another, still, 
And now the twain become but one — 
Thus is thy happiness begun — 
And though thy days seem oft so bright, 
Thou sometimes casteth shades of night; 
And in these days of seeming gloom 
The dregs of thy sweet cup assume 
The taste of pain and cruel ache! 
But these dark days dost only make 
The bright ones brighter; and the bad 
And bitter dregs — so truly sad — 
Dost make the sweets but sweeter still. 
And thus thy joyous spirit fills 
Thy hearts with all thy peace's refrain. 
Sweet happiness dwells in thy pains! 
The blessing of a dreamy bliss 
Is centered in thy magic kiss! 
I fain would have thee dwell with me 
Through life and death — eternity!
THE BEAUTIES OF WOMAN 
O, woman of virtue! sweet woman of love! 
As heavenly manna sent down from above 
Your wonderful actions are thus to the world; 
Then may your love's banner — no never be furled, 
But gently waving through ages of time, 
May e'er it be seen in its motions sublime. 
Affectionate woman of truth and pure light! 
You ease many pains and dear homes you make bright; 
And often your tender, sweet voice may be heard 
Consoling the sad with an angelic word, 
And tenderly soothing the weary through life, 
Thus lovingly cheering his pathway of strife. 
Sweet woman, you wept o'er the Savior, of old, 
And washed His feet with our tears, we are told; 
You wiped them dry with the hair of your head — 
Put on them a costly sweet ointment, 'tis said; 
Kind woman, then may your dear ministering hand 
Ne'er cease noble actions o'er all of the land.
 Good woman of beauties so noble and true! 
The hearts of this world will ne'er cease to love you, 
But always will cherish your name while on earth — 
Through sickness and sadness or pleasure and mirth; 
And when time is over and all things must die 
I know you will rest in the "home bye and 
Bye."
THE SIREN 
Fond mistress o'er the very dreamy treasures 
Of Fairy's love, your shining golden wand 
Each wave e'er summons captivating pleasure 
That don your form and luring jeweled hands. 
The smiles of stolen sweets play in your dimples, 
And at your will fling bright, delusive plights — 
A silv'ry web — invisible and simple — 
To do your bidding — capture vain delights. 
To please you now the colors of the roses 
Glide o'er your cheeks; and those of lilies fair 
Rest on your brow. Fair Nature even poses 
And brightest sunshine lingers in your hair.
Your teeth e'en seem fair sisters to pure whiteness; 
Your eyes with diamond twinkles seem to speak 
Beneath their silken lashes' veiled brightness — 
A pictured love of trueness, kind and meek. 
The magnetism of your presence only 
Invites your victims to their certain fate, 
For with your fatal weapons false you fondly 
Insnare the hearts for which you lie in wait.
Slaves to your charms of winsomeness' devising, 
Rejoicing with each kiss of loveless love 
That plays upon your ruby lips, disguising 
Your wit's sweet Falsehood's cooing of the dove.
Love's noblest monarchs tangle in your webbing, 
Each counts your heel a blessing on his head 
Each fairy day, until the cruel ebbing 
Of your affections shows the husks you've fed! 
Dark, blighted lives! great bleeding hearts! 
lamenting — 
Cursed with your sinful life, and with a night 
Dark as the tomb! — Your left hand these resenting, 
Next victims now you're greeting with your 
right! 
World's noblest hearts are but your tiny toys 
To baffle, fling aside — forsooth, you can! 
Yea, e'en the tender love of thoughtless boys 
Oft count amid your conquests of the man.
Your days will end! Your fairy wand will perish! 
We shudder at the fate that 'waites you then! 
Oh ! while the breath of fleeting life you cherish 
Consider! turn! and view a happy end!
 THE MANLY MAN
O, Manly Man! born of Perfection's Hand 
With all the beautitude of soul-blown purity! 
O, Noble Man of blessing to your land, 
Filled with Love's magnetism of sincerity! 
O, Gentle Man! Aye! go where e'er you can 
You'll always find a welcome sweet of loyalty! 
O, Knightly Man! your presence seems to fan 
The glowing flames of worth and royalty. 
O, Honest Man! a little lower than 
The angels is your place of usefulness! 
Yea, Godly Man! e'en when the world began 
There was prepared for you a peaceful rest!
THE LIBERTINE 
Monarch over weakness, 
Emperor o'er the fair; 
Conqueror of the helpless — 
Falsehood's artful snare. 
Forceful magnetism — 
Willing all you crave — 
Forcing brows of innocence 
In your false love's grave. 
But, this grave is darkness — 
Though the guise be light — 
What may seem day's brightness 
Is but, in truth, a night. 
Into eyes of seeming 
Maidens look and read 
Truth where lies are lurking, 
Love where only greed. 
Soon the cruel moment 
Comes when they do know 
Falsehoods such as dreaming 
Makes a blinded show.
 Broken hearted victims! 
Saddened lives of sin! 
Weep your tears repenting, 
Better lives you'll win. 
Libertine reveling, 
Will you thus enthrall 
While you hear appealing 
Reason's earnest call?
THE FLOWER AT MY WINDOW 
WRITTEN FOR A LADY FRIEND 
 O! my heart now feels so cheerful as I go with footsteps light 
In the daily toil of my dear home; 
And I'll tell to you the secret that now makes my life so bright — 
There's a flower at my window in full bloom. 
It is radiant in the sunshine, and so cheerful after rain; 
And it wafts upon the air its sweet perfume. 
It is very, very lovely ! may its beauties never wane — 
This dear flower at my window in full bloom. 
Nature has so clothed it in such glorious array, 
And it does so cheer our home, and hearts illume; 
Its dear mem'ry I will cherish though the flower fade away — 
This dear flower at my window in full bloom.
Oft I gaze upon this flower with its blossoms pure and white.
    And I think as I behold its gay costume,
While through life we all are passing may our lives
            Be always bright
    Like this flower at my window in full bloom
THE HOUSEHOLD QUEEN 
She looketh well to the ways of her household; and eateth
not the bread of idleness.   Her children arise up and 
call her blessed, her husband also, and he praiseth her. 
— Prov. xxxi., 27-28 
DEDICATED TO MY SISTER, MRS. SALLIE L. BRANCH 
Let other poets sing about the queen that wears the crown, 
And sits upon a shining throne with dignity's renown; 
But my song to queenly woman is to her who comforts home 
With a cheerful heart of sunshine, by industry with her broom. 
By the pure and wholesome dishes that her careful hands prepare, 
By the rocking of her cradle, with contents so precious there; 
By the love she sheds around her, making life so gay and bright 
For those of her dear home circle who at home feel pure delight.
 Thus to her I sing in glory, for to her 'tis justly due; 
All through life may many blessings rest on her so kind and true. 
In the bright celestial city, glowing with sweet love serene, 
When ends here her earthlv mission, there will 
        rest the HOUSEHOLD QUEEN.
THE MAN WITH THE GUN 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER 
AT FORT CLARK, TEXAS 
With a look of stern demeanor, "duty" 
        stamped upon his brow; 
Every muscle of his body seeming conscious of 
        his "vow; " 
There we see beside him Justice — ("Only right 
        is right," quoth he) 
At a distance near her lover we behold sweet 
        Liberty. 
Meek and queenly Peace is poised on his head, so 
        brave and true — 
There it sings sweet songs of dreamland, where 
        'tis joy and comfort, too; 
Thus he stands with e'er the pressure of the 
        world against his breast — 
Do you wonder why he never wearies — never
        sighs for rest? — 
See his mother, sister, father, brother, friends 
        and sweetheart dear 
‘Mid the multitude behind him — looking to him 
        from the rear! 
Then he must not — cannot falter, for whene'er 
        he coward grows
Justice dwells no longer with him — strikes for 
        him no other blows; 
Liberty, his pride — his dear one, then from him 
        is torn away —
(Death to him is far the sweeter than to live as 
        worthless clay) 
Peace now hushes songs of pleasure, lifts its 
        light, fantastic wings 
With a song of sad heartbreakings — lo, a fare-
        well song it sings! 
Hark ! what sounds are those of wailings strike so 
        mournfully his ear 
Like the weird notes of night-birds from some 
        woodland brown and sere? 
Ah, alas! 'tis those behind him, now oppressed 
        and full of fears — 
And with confident assurance they have looked 
        to him for years! 
O! we cannot view such horrors! from this dream 
        let us awake. 
View the patriot now nobly standing for his 
        country's sake. 
He is earnest, true and faithful, he will face all 
        dangers there; — 
When you're in your secret chamber breathe for 
        him these words of prayer
"Thou, O God, who art his Captain, grant him
        strength — this noble one 
‘Til Thy order— 'Blow the Trumpet; faithful 
        man, lay down thy gun.' "
TO THE SIGHING WINDS 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER 
AT FORT MCINTOSH, TEXAS 
O, sighing winds! now in thy journey over hills 
        and far away, 
Wilt thou bear a message for me — whisper what 
        I bid thee say 
To my many friends and kindreds far away in 
        distant land, 
Thinking of me in my sojourn on the banks of 
        the Rio Grand? 
Wilt thou whisper — murmur softly, while thou'rt 
        passing oft the way 
Where now dwells my dear old father with his 
        head silvered with gray. 
Fan his venerable forehead with thy calm, sweet, 
        breath of life
Tell him I am gently passing through this world 
        of toil and strife ? 
Tell him though the fatal bullets of some battle 
        wild and fierce — 
While they strike the marks of marksmen — 
         one this heart of mine may pierce
 Bid him — oh! if this should some day be the 
        tidings of his son 
Only lift his voice to heaven crying — " Lord, thy 
        will be done!" 
Then there is a dear and fair one — wilt thou 
        grant this earnest plea — 
As thou passeth in thy journey pause and speak 
        to her for me ? 
Surely, surely, thou must know her, such a sweet 
        and charming one, 
With a head of silken tresses, smiles as bright as 
        yonder's sun; 
Eyes of dark and sparkling beauty, face so 
        picturesquely fair. 
And her merry peals of laughter fill as silv'ry 
        bells the air. 
Surely, thou dost know I love her, and she loves
        me just the same, 
And I have her dear sweet promise that she'll 
        share with me my name. 
Wilt thou calm and gentle zephyr, put my silent 
        thoughts in words ? — 
I know thou canst bear them for me faster than
        the fleetest birds. 
‘Mid the many things thou beareth, with a 
        whisper soft and low. 
Tell her I will come back someday, if God wills
        it to be so. 
Tell to all my friends and kindreds that I'm 
       striving to be true.
 Hoping that I may with honor wear this uniform 
        of blue.
Gentle breeze so calmly passing, softly whisper 
        all I've said;
In my sojourn should death take me, gently 
        bear the news, "He's dead."
ONE OF EARTH'S FEW 
DEDICATED TO MISS R. L. WILSON, 
OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS 
Written While a Soldier at Fort Mcintosh, Texas. 
 White as are the whitest hues — lo ! thou art as pure!
Bright as are the brightest jewels thus thy life is seen;
As the brightest gleam of sunshine enters any door,
Just so welcome is thy presence, truly ideal queen.
Nobler moral standard never this vain world e'er knew;
I am forced to say thou, really, art one of earth's few.
Kindest words of sweetest music, such thou hast in stow.
Cheery smiles of sunny brightness dost thou daily wear;
Many lives thou maketh lighter through this world of woe,
Many hearts exclaim, "God bless thee" in this life of care.
In the day of separation of the false and true
I believe thou wilt that morning be one of earth's few.
ONLY A LITTLE CURL 
WRITTEN FOR A LADY FRIEND 
While a Soldier on the U. S. A. Transport, "Logan” 
En Route to P. I. 
 Only a little curl of darkest hue!
Only these silken strands that are but few,
Cut from amid companions where they grew
     A woman's glory.
Bright glossy curl! dear little silken tress!
Fond memento! no king can e'er possess
A greater gift; nor ever words express
     A sweeter story.
Ah! I received thee from the faltering hand
Of one I knew in far and distant land,
When distant journey was the stern command
     To "boys in blue." 
Only a little curl, was my request —
"I know not whether it be wise or best."
She said, "but with this token may there rest
     A friendship true."
ROCKED ON THE WATERS OF THE DEEP 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, ON THE U. S. A. 
TRANSPORT "LOGAN," EN ROUTE TO P. I. [Philippine Islands]
Rocked on the waters of the deep, briney blue,
Oft I am tossed by surging, foaming billows, too;
When drear skies are 'bove me, with the wind's 
        thrilling sound,
Loud roaring waters then I hear all around.
Rocked but not gently with a mother's lulaby —
Oh, for such rockings oft my heart heaves a sigh
Deep as this ocean! Ah, this loved one is dead!
On the Pacific I am rocked now, instead.
Rocked on the waters of the blue briney deep,
Sometimes the streaming moon and stars seem
        to weep,
As over shining waters there seems a bright
Flowing stream of silver tears reflecting the light.
Rocked now amid the beauties of Nature's 
        scenes; —
Sunrise's bright golden colors with shades be-
        tween,
 Bright streams of golden glimmers of setting sun,
Dark shadows of the evening when day is done.
Rocked 'mid sweet dreams of dreamland o'er 
        waters' wave,
Bright shining visions of the dear One who saves ;
His tender care and presence on the wide deep
Give all who know His mercy sweet, peaceful 
        sleep.
Rocked 'mid the pleasant and sweet dreams of 
        the past,
To my interior vision they come so fast
O'er these dark waters from the land far away —
Sweet dreams of Hfe when it was one cloudless 
        day.
Rocked, and each moment as the time passes by,
Thus I am moving on between land and sky;
These weary rockings take me far, far away
From many friends and kindreds — sad, sad to 
        say!
Rocked o'er these waters for it is the command,
And I have pledged obedience with "upraised 
        hand;"
Far o'er these waters there is work to be done
By many soldiers — of which I am one.
Rocked while the saddest hearts repine, but in
        vain —
 Sighs and emotions from the hearts that remain
Far, far behind me, yet their love I can feel
Bound ever 'round my heart as strong hoops of 
        steel !
Rocked, moved with rockings, o'er the waves' 
        swelling tide,
While o'er these foaming waters I slowly glide,
Sad hearts behind me, cease — oh, cease to repine !
Wait for my coming from this "world o'er the
        line!"
Rocked, but more roughly, by this world's 
        swelling tides,
Rocked by life's tempest — roughly tossed, yet, 
        besides;
Rocked on life's ocean of the unfathomed deep,
Rocked 'til the final day of one "lasting sleep."
TO THE OCEAN PACIFIC 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, ON THE U. S. A. 
TRANSPORT "LOGAN," EN ROUTE TO P. I. 
 Wondrous blue and briney ocean!
        As I o'er thy bosom glide,
Oft I watch the swaying motion
        Of thy surface far and wide.
Peaceful ocean! oft it seemeth
        When thou art so calm and free,
Surely Fancy never dreameth
        Sweeter dreams than this of thee.
When thy waves but softly tinkle
        'Neath the sun's bright, shining rays,
Making diamond studded twinkles —
        Nature seems to stand and gaze.
There is one thing I learn of thee,
        Though thou hast thy peaceful days,
Oft the sky grows dark above thee,
        And thou art not calm always.
 Thou dost have thy days of trouble,
        Such as is the way of life,
Days when each and every bubble
        Seems a frightful scene of strife.
My life sometimes seems as dreary
        As thy waters ever are;
And my heart is oft as weary
        As a fading morning star.
Though my life is often sadness,
        Yet, it is not always so;
For it has its psalm of gladness
        Mingled with its dirge of woe.
PAUL LAWRENCE DUNBAR
LINES WRITTEN UPON THE DEATH 
OF THIS SWEET POET-SINGER
We were afraid that you would soon be borne 
away
Upon the sweet endearing breathings of 
your heart!
We were afraid that you would soon forget to stay
And give to life your lofty, soulful missioned 
part!
Too true! but — ah! the jeweled breaths with 
which you sang —
That blew in their soft whispers o'er the 
tender strings
Of human hearts, the sweet aeolian sounds that 
rang
An echo as if blown from heaven's angels' 
wings —
Still linger in the ethics of our souls! Then 
must
We say you're dead? and can we ever for 
you weep ?
Ah, no! amid the sacred halo o'er your dust.
        We listen to your echoed- breathing while 
you sleep!
LITTLE GOLDEN PEN 
 Written While a Soldier, at San Joaquin, Panay, P. I., 
for a Friend Who Presented Me with a Fountain Pen for 
a Birthday Present 
Little Golden Pen!
Oh, could there from thy fountain flow, expressed 
       in words, all that my heart so often 
       feels!
        But, ah! for this I know not how to guide or 
       e'en direct thee!
Thy donor, venerable and hale, hath due the
praise for which there never can be 
words —
        Then it is vain to try to say what language 
cannot let me.
Little Golden Pen! 
Since thou art with me now — a souvenir — a 
     token of a friendship tried and true,
        Thou, surely, canst e'er render me invaluable 
assistance;
When wing expressive thoughts to dwell with me, 
my hand will guide thee while thy 
fountain flows
Upon some page where friends may read 
        when I've no more existence.
TO ONE OF THE BRAVE
Written While a Soldier, at Fort Washakie, Wyo., for 
First Sergeant William Barnes, Troop "F," loth Caval-
ry, on the Occasion of His Forty-Fifth Birthday
Though forty-five long years, you say,
Have silvered o'er your head with gray,
Your friends rejoice, to-day, that you
Stand hale and hearty in your "blue."
Long for Old Glory you have stood
With truest sense of brotherhood;
Long may you live a useful life —
Noble and true in peace or strife.
 THE NEW LEAF 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, AT FORT 
WASHAKIE, WYO., NEW YEAR's DAY, 1903
On this page of my life's hist'ry, with the help of 
        God I'll make
Brighter, truer, nobler record — strive to follow 
        Jesus' wake.
Thus I'll make my life more useful, with an 
        influence strong to win
Many who are daily drifting in the way of death 
        and sin.
In my journey o'er life's ocean, Jesus, Savior, 
        pilot me
Let thy beacon light of wisdom ever true my 
        guidance be.
 “EVER FAITHFUL TO YOU" 
DEDICATED TO A LADY FRIEND
Written While a Soldier at Fort Washakie, Wyo.
When e'er I read these words, Dear Heart, of 
        your sweet valentine,
I'm sure no heart can ever feel a sweeter joy than 
        mine.
"Faithful!" no word can e'er express a truer, 
        greater love —
No truer constancy than this have angels up 
        above!
"Ever!" ah, then eternally you pledge that 
        you'll be true!
For love's sweet sake, alone, I choose a happy 
        life with you.
Through every sorrow, joy or pain that we in 
        life may meet,
In sweet companionship we'll share — the bitter 
        with the sweet.
We'll live these words of faithfulness, what e'er 
        our lot may be,
And live that we may after death from earthly 
        stains be free.
THE SUNLIGHT OF TEMPERANCE
Afar it gleams its glowing light,
        And wafts its golden beams
From lofty heights that know no night,
        From realms that know no dreams.
Within the home its glist'ning rays
        Delight each loving heart;
They sweeten life with joyous days,
        And blissful peace impart.
They place upon the mother's face
        The smiles of brightest day,
They give the wife her charming grace.
        They light the children's play.
They give to life its noble worth,
        They sweeten every breath;
They find true pleasures here on earth,
        And smile and welcome death.
THE DRINK SLAVE
Poor Slave! 
Great flowing streams of pity's tears
        And anguish's sobbing bitter cries,
        Are now before your blinded eyes,
Groan in your dizzy, deafened ears!
Poor Slave! 
Poor Slave!
The silver threads of years bow low
        In token of the prayers that rise
        From breaking hearts of wasted sighs –
For you who take this drink of woe!
Poor Slave! 
Poor Slave! 
The love that once you counted sweet 
        Now of yourself is not a part!
        The soulless pulses of your heart 
Now master vou from head to feet! 
Poor Slave! 
Poor Slave !
The touch of baby's tender hands
        Once found within your heart's re- 
spond —
         But, now — alas! your sacred bond
Of love you do not understand!
Poor Slave!
Poor Slave!
Give back to life the love you owe !
        O, break this chain of loveless death!
        O, will a life of temperate breath !
O, leave this cup of nameless woe! 
Poor Slave!
 “LOOKING FOR WORK”
The wheel of Time turns slowly o'er and o'er,
The hand of Wealth revels but more and more
In happy comforts and the joyous fill
Of pleasures such as it alone instills.
But, now, a grave foot-sore procession's tread
Falls, as a funeral march upon the dead,
On many heedless ears that hear its cries,
And many thoughtless hearts that hear its 
        sighs.
Yea, heedless of the hunger and the pains
That steal away the spirit of these brains;
Yea, thoughtless even of the starving wives
Now weeping in the background of these lives!
Yea, heedless of the bowed heads of gray,
And thoughtless of the spoiled children's play
That're hidden in the voice at your door
That only asks for work and nothing more!
Yea, heedless of the love that is, indeed,
Now hidden in this life of darkened need;
Yea, thoughtless of the fatal stroke of death
Now hidden in this feeble, pleading breath!
Perchance, 'tis now you hear the last attempt
Of Sad Despair with every joy exempt!
O, World give now the living that you owe,
That these may something of your comforts 
        know!
 THE DEBTOR
Bowed beneath the dead'ning weight of 
   Woe,
Crawling 'neath the galling yoke of Owe;
Obligation's hand
Beats him with his wand,
And his restless bed his burden knows!
'Neath stern Justice's ever grinding heels,
In Debt's prison now he sadly kneels;
Fettered with Due's claim,
Pilloried with shame!
And no tongue can tell the pain he feels.
Fortunate is he if now he bear
Not a greater burden than this care; –
If his soul is free 
From sin's misery
He may work 'til life again is fair.
 A DEDICATION 
TO PRINCIPAL BOOKER T. WASHINGTON OF 
TUSKEGEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL 
 To you who now so nobly do 
         A noble deed; 
 Who now instill the virtues true 
         To virtuous need; 
 Whose mission is so truly good — 
 So full of kindly brotherhood — 
 Who live the life you surely should –
         A trusty lead;
 Who early saw that skillful head 
         And skillful hands 
 Should, surely, be in union wed 
         'Gainst life's quicksands — 
 For people whose unhappy state 
 Was, surely, in the hands of fate, 
 Would make a combination great 
         As iron bands. 
 Long may your daring presence live 
         And works instill. 
 Long may your kingly reasons give 
         A forceful will,
        Long may your glowing, useful days 
        Shine forth their bright illuming rays, 
      And give to gloomy lives always 
A happy thrill.
THE HAND THAT GUIDES THE 
PLOW IS THE HAND THAT  
RULES THE WORLD 
Perched upon the beam above the plowshare, 
        Gath'ring from the soil o'er which she glides 
 Food and many other cheery comforts — 
        For she has a sure and trusty guide; 
 Busy with her many occupations: — 
         Playing with the lightning of the clouds, 
 Peeping at the great and lofty planets, 
         Solving darkened mystery's misty shrouds; 
 Pealing sweetest music o'er her mountains, 
        Shouting now the lyrics of the brave ; 
 Learning all the mighty Laws of Nature — 
         Seeking e'en a "why" for death and grave; 
Proudly does she polish precious metals — 
        Hoping e'en to make a brighter hue — 
Donning pretty fashions gay in splendor — 
         Rainbow's, sunset's dress and ocean's blue. 
Dancing with the glee of childish pleasures 
        Thoughtless in her love of City's whirl; —
Moves the world with pomp and pride — 
 Oft she scorns to be the bride 
 At her benefactor's side, 
 But the hand that guides the plow 
         Is the hand that moves the WORLD. 
 TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE 
 To learn the great achievements in the epics of 
        your life, 
 Or to learn the noble story of your victory- 
        sworded strife; 
 To learn the supernatural feat with which you
        struck slave-free —
 How the Spaniard, French and English bled and 
        groaned about your knee — 
 We only need to go to Hayti — France — where 
        once you trod, 
 And Hasten to the story of the hearts beneath the 
        sod! 
We need not mock Old Hist'ry for the light he 
        failed to catch 
From the lustrous streak of glory that o'er- hung 
        your cottage thatched; 
We know this cunning artist's white heroes are 
        painted with 
Honors; but, he oft forgets the shaded counte- 
        nance of myth. 
The dotted pages of no book can breathe your 
        spotless fame — 
For 'tis written in the "Milky Way" that marks 
        your noble name.
Soldier and statesman, brave and true, unlearned 
        of book's device — 
Soul-taught alone, your heart proclaimed, 
         "Freedom at any price!" 
 Words feebly shadow forth the vim that heaved 
         your noble breast — 
 We leave these for the sunbeams' crowns! — to 
         grace your sleeping rest! 
 SAN FRANCISCO'S 18th OF APRIL 
 (1906) 
 “ * * * ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, * * * 
nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against 
kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places,
and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the be-
ginnings of sorrows.”  — St. Mark, xiii, 7-8 
"O, what an awful, awful dream!" A dream? O, 
sleepy head! 
      Arouse! arouse! electric brain, from this 
     delusive sleep! 
      Open your eyes upon a truth that churns 
the ocean deep! 
That splits asunder even now the mighty 
mountain's bed! 
O, sleepy eyes, look and behold yon reeling 
mass of steel! 
      Yon track-laid paves of broken stones now 
     writhing in their speach 
      Of mighty forces great and strong that they 
are bound to teach! 
Ears, 'wake and hear their message, too! heart, 
     drink the truth you feel! 
Hark! what is that? — O, fire! fire! our city is 
     wrap'd in flames! 
       The leaping flames whose awful breath 
     bloweth death so deeply wrought 
      With scorched sounds of human cries; and, 
     of mercy beareth naught! 
Who stamps Life's faces with its brand of crisp — 
       unknown names. 
The Unseen Hand! let us believe, in spite of every 
cant 
      About the science that's proclaimed does 
     these great shocking deeds; 
      Life-Words' great prophecies we see ful- 
     filling as they read — 
 All of their deep, mysterious truths we must in 
     wonder grant. 
AN ODE TO THE CHRISTIAN MARTYRS 
In humble reverence and Christian love 
Before the Greatest of them all we bow, 
Likewise before the Father of this One! 
We see the greatness of this mighty love — 
The giving of an only Son to die 
A martyr for the cause of sin! We view 
The cruel thorns upon His sacred brow, 
And crimson streams e'en trickling from their 
        wounds ! 
We hear the hands of buffeters against 
His face; the cruel, ringing hammers' sound 
Upon the nails that pierce His hands and feet! 
We praise Him for the faith and mighty strength 
That He hath given to the noble host 
Of martyrs who have followed Him, and shown 
The priceless jewel of His love, so bright 
And shining to the world! Grim Death canst 
        bear 
No sting of terror for such noble hearts! 
I now in mem'ry of these sacred lives. 
Dare this, the veiled shadow of a song. 
With just the hope that it may mingle with 
The whispers of the soft and gentle breeze 
That hover o'er the halo of their graves!
A MEMORIAL 
IN MEMORY OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS. 
In mem'ry of your truly noble life; 
        In mem'ry of the cause for which you 
fought; 
In mem'ry of your fierce and bitter strife; 
       In mem'ry of the lasting good you
wrought; 
 In mem'ry of the talents, really great, 
        That found a home within your massive 
brains,
And swayed the thousands of each town and 
State 
        Who heard your forceful oratory strains; 
I offer now these simple words of praise — 
       This chord I touch to sound your honor's 
due — 
The pathway of your truly useful days 
        Shines now a grand and brilliant light for 
You.
LIFE'S DAY
        MORNING 
 Aurora's dawning veil reveals 
         A glimpse of 'wak'ning Day 
Who opes his eyes upon the world 
        In a curious, wond'ring way. 
Strange faces 'round about he sees 
        With eyes of truthful vow; 
Fond fingers fan away the cares 
       Before they reach his brow. 
The twitter of the early birds, 
       The freshness of the breeze, 
The scent of Fairy's flowers, and 
       The blossoms of the trees; 
The clatter of the busy world. 
       The lurings of the sea 
Soon lead him forth, on hands and knees, 
       To see what these things be. 
Vain butterflies before him flit — 
       He rises in his glee 
To trip, fall, rise 'mid worlds of books 
       And Nature's misery. 
        NOON 
A feast of wholesome literature; 
        Deserts of sweet love coos, 
And pleasures such as oft he finds 
Digestion brings distress of mind 
       And storming clouds of blues. 
        EVENING 
His dimming eye now faint reveals 
        A world that changes, too. 
Bright flowers vanished from the fields –
       The leaves all colored new 
The happy thoughts of morn's bright 
hours, 
        And thoughtless moments' sting, 
Awake afresh to give him joy 
        And painful reasoning. 
The dreary, tardy hours creep 
        Into his bending frame; 
Upon a cane his waning weight 
        He places, without shame. 
The shades of night he plainly sees 
        Faint twilight gleams afar ; 
 His brighter hopes grow brighter still 
        At the sight of each new star. 
They seem to plainly speak to him, 
         "A good fight you've fought, 
Upon your crown we all shall shine 
        As you have oft been taught." 
The closing scene now shows a smile 
        Upon his beaming face. 
And closes now his eyes to ope 
        Within the "better place." 
PANTHEON 
The heaven and its glories bright above;  
The earth with Nature's beauties here below; 
The wondrous light of day and veiling shades i 
Of night; the glowing sun; the fiick'ring moon; 
The lofty planets and the tiny stars;
The eagle up amid the cloudy mists; 
The little fish down in the whirling deep;
The wisdom's treasures of the very myth 
 Of Time; the best that ever will — or can 
E'er nestle in the very purest soul 
Of Thine own imaged man — lo, all is Thine! 
A MAJOR CHORD 
        JOY 
Hail Fair Elixir of the heart and mind! 
        Hail Bright Cajoler for the good of life! 
Your presence gives to all the sweetest kind 
        Of happiness, amid the world of strife. 
         FRIENDSHIP 
Twin sister to your fairer sister, Love, 
        But with a sweetness truly all your own 
You bind your hearts with golden thoughts; 
          and all 
        Are pure; no one is base — a perfect tie. 
            SORROW 
Sad Friend, when e'er you creep into our 
          lives 
        We do not often greet you with a smile. 
But, still, we know 'tis thus the Lord con- 
     trives 
       To chasten — yet, He loves the while. 
            PURITY 
White with the snowdrifted bleaching of 
          Good Deeds. 
 Bright with the sunlit glowing of Pure 
          Thought; 
Sad with the sight of Pity's sorrowing needs, 
       Glad with the hope of blessings inward 
          wrought. 
 A MINOR CHORD 
        VANITY 
Vain Pride, Conceit; vain love of Fond Display! 
Vain pleasures of the world that cannot stay 
To be our guide when we'll a guidance need 
To cheer us through Death's Night of darkened 
        deed. 
         FAITHLESSNESS 
Untrue to self, and e'en to love untrue! 
Yea, false in words and false in actions, too! 
Great lives are ruined by your sad untruth; 
Great souls are blackened by your life — forsooth! 
             PITY 
O, Plaintive Softener of Hard'n'd Hearts! 
Your mission is, in truth, a one of need; 
The tender sympathies which you impart 
To life is one of noble worth, indeed! 
           HATRED 
Hatred, thou art the bitter foe of love! 
The petrifying hardener of hearts! 
The cruel thrust of Anger's murd'rous blade !  
The strangling grasp of Vengeance's mere 'less 
        hand ! 
The deadly venom of Jealousy's sweetened cup! 
The fatal blow of heartless Envy's club! 
The mortal wound of Guilty Pleasure's plan!  
The darkness that declines to see the light! 
The wrong that e'er declines to know the right! 
The hopeless drift that leads to sinful death! 
 TIME'S CHORD 
             YESTERDAY 
Thou hideth in thy bosom many sweets 
        Of joyous past that we so much adore; 
And many tears of sorrow at thy feet 
        We dropt to thy farewell — forevermore! 
               TO-DAY 
Thy flitting moments dance before our eyes, 
        And beg that we would wreathe into a crown 
Their jeweled forms — so like the starry skies — 
        To make for us an emblem of renown. 
           TO MORROW 
O, sphinx of time, thou flit'h from day to day, 
        Eluding our every grasp — so much 
As butterflies caress the many gay 
        Sweet flowers, yet evade bright childhood's 
touch. 
              ETERNITY 
O, mighty and infinite space of time! 
        O, shrouded myth of hopeful mystery! 
O, glorious light for righteousness, sublime! 
        O, utter darkness for sin's misery! 
 SHARPS AND FLATS 
      REMORSE 
Bitter pang of sin, 
        Painful sleeplessness! 
Dart of bleeding life within, 
        Excruciating stress! 
     DISCOURAGEMENT 
Smotherer, strangler, slayer of hearts! 
Coercer of ambition — lo, living death thou art! 
     FEAR 
Scare, quiver and quake; 
Stare, shiver and shake; 
A heartless breathlessness you are —
A joyless life you make! 
     SHAME 
Guilty sin of heavy head 
        And drooping eyes! 
Evaded gaze of sad regret 
        And heaving sighs! 
 A DIRGE TO ANCIENT ROME 
O, Rome! thy flaming annals even scorch 
Our searching view!    Yea, e'en the breath 
(A lava of corruption, cruel vice, 
Gross irreligion, sensuality), 
Of all thy murd'rous tyrants fall 
Upon the ethics of our very souls 
And sadly wounds us! yea, it even makes 
Us shudder in our dreams ! 
O, Rome! Rome! 
Why didst not thou, for pity, only keep 
From us the knowledge's pain that even such 
Base sins could ever form the faintest part 
Of human lives?      For always in our search 
For thy bright talents — law, philosophy, 
Grand architectural arts, the jeweled breaths 
Of literature — we have to clear away 
The putrifying carcasses of sin — 
The murd'rous work of bloody daggers' thrusts, 
By hands of Envy, Hatred, Pride, Contempt, 
Ingratitude, Dehumaned Pleasure, Fear, 
Degeneracy, Insatiatety, Dislike, 
Debauchery, Ambition, Madness, Fame, 
Mad Pagan Antichristianity, Disdain, 
The Siren's Love, Hereditary Vice! 
The reasons of a serious thinking mind 
Canst not perform a task so sore unclean 
Without returning to its fond abode 
And bringing dizzy tremors to the soul! 
Thy Claudius quakes our very souls with fear; 
Tiberius even haunts our dreams at night! 
Caligula!     Our hearts e'en squirm within! 
Nero!     His name 's breath bears his poisoned sins! 
Yet, when our search is finally all done, 
And at thy grave we view thy ruined heap, 
We see thy talents' virtues with true light 
And close thy mausoleum lid of past. 
THE DOVE 
Once upon a bright spring morning, 
        When the world seemed at its best — 
Filled with sweetly scented flowers, 
        Azure skies from east to west — 
I was walking 'mid the breezes 
        That were blowing 'round about, 
Filling all the blood within me 
        With its glowing, rich redoubt 
'Gainst disease and all its kindred; 
        And I felt that in each beat 
Of my pulse was throbbed a pleasant 
        Thinking mood from head to feet. 
Then I heard the plaintive voice 
        Of a dove — so soft and low — 
All its tiny heart seemed mourning: 
       “O - - - - 0! O! O! O - - - - o! O - - - - o!” 
“Little mourning bird,” I answered, 
        "How can you, to-day, be sad 
While the world now seems so happy, 
         And the flowers seem so glad? 
And the merry bees are buzzing, 
        And the butterflies are gay;
And the breeze that bears your mournings 
        Wafts the fragrance of the hay? 
And the glimmers of the sunbeams 
        On your shining plumage rest, 
Seeking now to learn the secret 
         That is hidden in your breast ! 
All are guessing for a reason 
        That we think could make you mourn, 
For we think no heart among us 
        Should be happier than your own. 
Still while yet we sit and ponder, 
        For the truth we'd like to know, 
 You repeat your only answer:" 
         “‘O - - - - 0! O! O! O - - - - o! O - - - - o!’” 
“Can it be you know the suf 'rings 
        Of the world with death and sin? 
Can it be you know the sorrows 
        Of the clashing battle's din? 
Can it be you know the shameful 
        Stalking of the monster, Wrong? 
Can you see the sad oppression 
        Of the weaklings by the strong? 
Is it true you've not forgotten 
         How a flood did once destroy 
All the people who were wicked — 
        Who had made of sin a joy? 
Can it be you see the murderer 
        As he goes about his work; 
Can it be you hear the clashing 
        Of his deadly, cruel dirk? 
Can you see the suicides leaping 
        From the brinks of sad despair — 
From a life of sinful torture, 
        And a life of burdened care? 
If you hear and know these wailings, 
        And can feel the same, also, 
I know why you sit in mourning:” 
 “‘O - - - - 0! O! O! O - - - - o! O - - - - o!’” 
VOICES OF THE WAVES 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, ON U. S. A. TRANS-
PORT “SHERMAN,” RETURNING TO U. S. 
Gay, rolling mists, now leaping in your play 
A foaming, splashing, white and shining spray; 
‘Tis oft I stand and feast my eyes on you, 
And watch your gentle, swaying field of blue! 
But, as I stand and look methinks I hear 
The voices of your throbbing Pulses stir, 
As gurgling through the veins of all your thought 
They whisper now your hist'ry — sadly wrought 
With wasted loves and battles' crimsoned floods; 
With sad   despair   and    wreckaged-scattered 
       bloods ! 
With maiden's honor and with woman's sighs; 
With youth's ambitions and with man's devise; 
With secret follies and with mother's prayers; 
With dizzy pleasures and with burdened cares!
With blood-stained glitters of the pirate's gold; 
With wealth ill-gotten that is yet untold — 
Is this, in truth, your story, surging waves? 
Are all these secrets hidden in your grave? 
THE MISER 
Bowed in shameful reverence of gold, 
        Quaking with the fear of sudden theft; 
Groping with the blinded weight untold 
        Of   soulless   love   and   yellow-hearted 
quest. 
Starving with the husks of meanly fare, 
        Feasting on the glitter of his hoard; 
Clothed with the rags of worthless wear — 
         Shiv'ring fireless oft in his abode. 
Oft there 're others, too, who share this life. 
        And hear his lie of poverty each day — 
Children, an only daughter — or a wife 
        Weep with the suf'rings that his gold 
could stay ! 
Foolish man ! We pity you. We know 
        The glitter of your gold that now you 
 see — 
Alas! some day you'll leave it here, and go 
        Crushed by its weight, into eternity! 
THE SPENDTHRIFT 
Tripping the time of his frivolous heart, 
Playing in life a ridiculous part, 
Foolish with money and thoughtless with 
        health, 
Careless with love and indifferent with 
        wealth;
Heedlessly racing away from advice, 
        Reveling in pleasures more evil than nice; 
Giddily pacing a dizzy pursuit 
Of squandering measures of shameful repute 
Treating e'en lightly life's serious scenes, 
While gaily discarding his valuable means ; 
Crazed with Vanity's teachings of fun, 
The sorrows of life and its joys are one. 
Merrily laughing when, really, he should cry 
Enriching the vices that surely should die; 
Trif’ling away many comforts so sweet 
For which the sad paupers now cry in the 
        street! 
'Tis a blessing to him when his money is 
        spent, 
Then if he consider and thoroughly repent;
For if his gay heart in atonement he'll give 
He'll surely be taught how he really should 
       live. 
ANITA 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER IN 
MANILLA, P. I. AN ACTUAL CASE 
Far out in the dreamy ocean, by Nature's beauty 
        planned, 
Lie the Islands of the Philippines — the Flower 
        Blossom Land — 
With flow'rs that seem most surely blown by the 
        rainbow's magic wand. 
Their shores are kissed by the foaming waves 
        that race from the dancing seas, 
As lambs that frolic in their play to their bound- 
        ing gay hearts' ease — 
They wash the Sand-beach's feet to see just how 
        much they can tease. 
Tall, massive, sturdy trees here stand, great 
        sentinels of might, 
That seem to do their faithful watch so bravely 
        day and night; 
One sees in these undaunted forms a sermon for 
        the right. 
The glowing brightness of the sun; the chyming 
        of the streams ; 
The whispers of the leafy trees as the breezes 
        pass — It seems 
That Nature gives one here a touch of all her 
        fairy dreams. 
There seems to be a misty spell o'er all the world 
        above 
And all below — and all around — I wonder if it's 
        love! 
And if it is the "sweety" kind that poets oft 
        write of! 
There lived in this bright picture-land, not many 
        years ago, 
A native maid; I'll try to make her lovely 
        picture show 
Before your eyes, for I am sure that you fair 
        beauty know. 
Anita was this maiden's name — her people called 
        her "Nete," 
And th' love they showered over her to her was 
        always sweet; 
Her happy heart shone in her hands and dainty 
        little feet. 
It seems as if the chestnut came and begged its 
        leave to place 
Within the dimples of her cheeks and o'er her 
        pretty face 
Its richest hue, that it might here receive her 
        smiling grace. 
The moonbeams gave their streaming light to her 
        dark and wond'ring eyes, 
They seemed to cast a flick'ring light twixt love 
        and fond surprise 
One moment then the next they'd droop as a 
        wounded pansy dies. 
But, of every touch of Nature's hand that made 
        this beauty fair. 
The greatest glory of them all was clustered in 
        her hair — 
A blending of the sunbeams' gold and th' flow- 
        ing midnight air. 
Anita loved a soldier boy, a colored youth called 
        Bob, 
A soldier in her land.     He heard a love sigh in 
        each sob 
When she lisped his name the best she could — a 
        tiny little "Vob." 
At first Bob seemed as true in love as duty's 
        soldier boy; 
They were both happy day by day — but not with 
        lasting joy! 
For when Bob learned of her great love he made 
        her heart his toy. 
Time brought to Bob these sorrowing words 
        "To America you'll return" — 
Now on his cheeks Anita's tears fell fast; and 
        seemed to burn 
Their way into his dizzy brains! — Can he such 
        love e'er spurn? 
Oh! take me to your dear homeland, "querido," 
        will you, please? 
I love you and I want to go with you o'er land or 
        seas!" 
"I'll take you with me home, my Love," Bob 
        smilingly agrees. 
"Let's go before the altar, dear, within your 
         holy church, 
For there alone can e'er we find the tie for which 
        we search; 
Let's fly into one little nest on Love's exalted 
        perch." 
"O, is this, really, true, now, Vob? — oh! say 
        when may we go 
Before the altar in the church that we, by this, 
       may show 
The love we've cherished now so long and must 
        so surely know?" 
Bob named the day, then in her eyes he saw her 
        happy heart, 
But, lo ! the day he named to wed was his evasive 
        art. 
For on the day before he knew his home-boat 
        would depart. 
Time brought, at last, Anita's day and found her 
        all prepared — 
And at her window all the day she stood and 
        looked and stared; 
But, Bob ne'er came to greet her there — and e'en 
        the waves were sad! 
Bob tried to cheer his murm'ring heart while 
        sailing home that day: — 
"O, well, I could not marry th' girl," he bravely 
         tried to say 
But his heart rose up and choked his words in a 
        strang'ling kind of way. 
"Come eat your porridge, ‘Nete,’ my dear, 'tis 
        plain this man has lied." 
"No, no, mama! O, no, papa! I cannot eat," she 
        cried, 
"I'll wait for 'Vob,' he'll, surely, come to claim 
        me for his bride." 
Day after day Anita stood and looked, but 
        would not eat ! 
Grief crept into her dark blue veins and coursed 
         from head to feet; 
He stole her breaths of beauty that had graced 
          her village street; 
And stole the moonlight from her eyes and fixed 
        dark pools, instead, 
Of tears so deep and still that shone a tint of 
        evening's red — 
Also, the cruel sorrow, too, by which her life was 
        fed. 
He chased the chestnut shades away and gave 
        them to the seas; 
He stole the roundings of her cheeks and flung 
        them to the breeze; 
And being thus so shorn of strength she sank 
        upon her knees. 
Thus was she found by Time, who came and 
         brought his servant, too. 
Death, and he bade him, "Gently take this 
         broken hearted, true 
And saddened, wasted love away to blossom in a 
        new 
And better world! away from life that's now to 
         her so blue!" 
"Oh, 'Nete,' please speak to us once more! we 
        cannot let you go!" 
Her mother, father, brothers, cried — "Don't 
         leave us, love — oh, no!" 
Her spirit dropped, now, in its flight, her whisper 
        "‘Vob,' you know!" 
AN ELEGY TO JOHN BROWN 
(The Would-be Liberator) 
Sleep on! 
True martyr for your principle of right! 
        True hero of the cause for which you 
fought ! 
True life of lofty, grand, courageous might! 
        Sincerity with manly motives fraught! 
Sleep on! 
Sleep on! 
Your grand and noble presence here is done, 
        Your noble heart revolted for sweet 
peace! 
Your noble march to victory was won 
        When from embittered life you smiled 
release ! 
         Sleep on! 
Sleep on! 
Your choice was death! none would your 
life enthrall! 
        You struck for liberty for all your clan ' 
Your enemies e'en at your scaffold's fall 
        Looked and declared, "Here is in 
truth, a man!" 
Sleep on! 
 THE TREASURED CURL 
How dear to my heart is this tress which I trea- 
sure! 
        Such fond recollections it brings to my 
mind: 
I think of the dear loving fingers that cut it — 
        The donor so gentle — so noble and kind. 
Ah! sweet were the moments I passed in her 
presence, 
        While roaming through woodland so happy 
were we; 
O, how I admired those dear silken tresses! 
        She knew it, and kindly gave this one to me. 
So lovely and bright were the trees of the forest, 
        So green were the leaves with the flowers in 
bloom: 
Fair Nature had clothed the dear woodland with 
grandeur — 
        Together we scented its fragrant perfume. 
It seems I now see her all laden with flowers, 
        And hear her sweet nightingale voice soft 
and low 
In silvery ripples re-echoing the forest, 
As sweetly she sang the dear songs I well 
      know.
O, Alice, dear Alice, oft now do I see you, 
        In love's sweetest dreams I behold your 
sweet face! 
But when I awake I have naught to console me — 
        Ah! naught but this curl with its beauty and 
grace! 
Ah! when comes the day that I lifeless am lying— 
       My soul then departed forever to rest — 
When friends are preparing my body for burial 
        Oh, may this dear treasure be placed on my 
breast !

FADED LEAVES 
Now the days are growing colder, 
As each day the year grows older; 
Seared grass with frost is white — 
Summer now is out of sight , 
And the faded leaves are falling. 
Now the days seem melancholly 
As we think of things so jolly 
That have faded from our sight — 
But 'mid thoughts of things so bright 
Are the faded leaves now falling. 
Just as leaves we all are fading, 
Just as leaves do now cease shading 
All must go — aye, one and all — 
The rich and poor, the great and small –
As the faded leaves now falling. 
CHRISTMAS MORN 
Come wake up and sing, "All hail to the King," 
         aurora is dawning the sky; 
Rejoice and be glad, let no one be sad, let " Peace 
        and good will be our cry." 
Ye people be gay for this is the day that Jesus, 
        our Savior, was born; 
O! let the bells ring, and may we all sing sweet 
        praise and thanksgiving this morn. 
“I LOVE YOU, TOO”
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, 
AT FORT WASHAKIE, WYO. 
One afternoon of May's sweet gift, when all the 
        world was gay 
With singing birds and humming bees and 
        flowers' bright array, 
I sat beside the girl I love of all the world the 
        best, 
And held her hand most tenderly, and thus my 
        love confessed:
"O, Alice dear, you are, indeed, my first and 
        only love! 
"The truth of this is known to God and angels up 
        above!" 
O, how my heart did leap with joy, sweet, serene 
        and true,
As in a voice sweet and low she said. “I love you, 
        too." 
REFRAIN 
"I love you, too ! I love you, too ! The angels 
        know 'tis true ! 
"I am so glad you do love me, because I love 
         you, too!" 
The music of her loving voice was so sweet to me, 
As thus she spoke so tenderly these words in true 
        love's key. 
Long years have passed since that bright day, 
        but ne'er will I forget 
The one so fair who won my heart — for, O, I 
        love her, yet! 
I love her, yet, and ever will while 'tis I breathe 
        in life, 
 No happiness will e'er be mine 'till I may call her 
        wife! 
Long years I've passed away from her, clad in 
        my country's blue, 
But, soon I'm going back to her who said, "I 
        love you, too." 
HAVE I DONE WRONG? 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER 
AT FORT CLARK, TEXAS 
Father says that he is sorry that I choose a  
  soldier's life, 
         And he says he feels as if I now am dead;
In the letters from my sister there is oft a doleful  
  strain — 
        Though she tries her best at cheerfulness, 
  instead. 
Brother said when last I left him that "the idea  
  is absurd," 
        Saying "Army life is not for such as you;" 
I have letters from my friends in which they ask  
  the question thus — 
        "Tell us why you joined the U. S. 'boys in 
  blue?' " 
Have I done wrong, O father, sister, brother, 
  friends and kindred dear? 
Have I done wrong, O God of heaven? Am I  
  wrong? Should I be here? 
I have letters from the "fair sex" asking, "Is it 
  really, true?" 
        And the dearest of them all pleads "O, come 
  back!" 
For she says she cannot bear it, since I am so far 
  away, 
        Yet, for years I must remain away — sad 
  fact! 
And she asks me if I'll leave her there so long 
  a weeping girl, 
        For she says this cruel grief gnaws her sad 
  heart; 
And she tells me all the sunshine of her life has 
  vanished now 
        Since it is we are so sadly far apart. 
Have I done wrong, O father, sister, brother, 
  friends and sweetheart dear? 
Have I done wrong, O God of heaven? Am I 
  wrong? Should I be here?
A DIVIDED LOVE 
I'm feeling sad to-night, love, and I cannot rest 
in bed; 
        Sleep has fled far from my eyes of misty 
tears. 
Why is it I'm unhappy? though your love for me 
you've said — 
        Ah, there comes to me the bitter thought of 
years! 
 REFRAIN 
     Sad will I wander where e'er I go! 
My love will ever dwell with you, I 
     know; 
An undivided love is what I crave, 
But to my heart such love you will not 
     give. 
Though you love me and confess it there's 
another one, you know, 
        Whom you tell me has a claim within your 
heart; 
O'er these words I oft have pondered, and 
although it pains me so 
        It is plain that we must ever live apart! 
Though my heart will never cease to beat in love 
for you, my pet, 
        And a happy life I wish you from my heart; 
To another's arms I yield you with a longing, 
sad regret! 
        Ah, farewell, "first love" if we must live
apart! 
MY FATHER'S LETTER 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, 
AT FORT CLARK, TEXAS. 
I've a letter from my father,
        And it is a doleful one — 
Sad, for, I must say, it is his 
             First to me, his soldier son. 
 REFRAIN 
Father, do not grieve about me, for I do not fear 
         the gun; 
I will do my duty bravely while I'm now your 
soldier son. 
When I left my home in springtime 
             I ne'er thought of enlistment, 
     But when last I wrote my father 
        You can guess the news I sent. 
"My Dear Son" — thus he commences, 
             "I have just received your news 
"Be you ever true and faithful 
             "Since it is this life you choose. 
"Son, to tell the truth, I must say 
             "I now feel as if you're dead:
"And must ever have this feeling 
             " 'Til you're home again," he said. 
"Many of your friends are grieving, 
             "Bitter tears fill many eyes 
     “For these strange and sudden tidings 
        "Give us all a great surprise. 
"Son My Dear, do not cease praying, 
             "Pray and be both kind and brave: 
     "Pray that you may live forever 
             "In the life beyond the grave." 
THANKSGIVING 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER, AT LEON, 
PANAY, P. I., THANKSGIVING DAY, 19O1, 
O, Lord above, my prayer to Thee 
Is that my heart, to-day, may be 
Clothed in sincere humility
And tuned with pure thanksgiving. 
REFRAIN 
Thanks, thanks, to Thee — O, thanks, to Thee! 
Dear Lord, to-day, my song is thanks, thanks, 
        to Thee ! 
So many thanks now crowd my mind 
No words to tell them can I find, 
But, Thou who art so good and kind 
Dost know my heart's thanksgiving. 
Then, as my heart, to-day, dost speak –
The contrite heart Thou hath made meek –
Accept these thanks though faint and 
             weak. 
Yet, they are my thanksgiving. 
 THE FROZEN RAIN 
O! the frozen rain upon the ground, 
Upon the trees and all around: 
And e'en the tiny bits of grass 
Are crystal white.    What can surpass 
        The picturesque frozen rain? 
When e'er my eyes this scene behold 
Sweet visions of the things untold 
Light up my heart.    I can but gaze 
As, sparkling 'neath the sun's bright rays, 
        I view the frozen rain. 
These diamond-studded twinkles bright 
Must be of heaven a sweet foresight! 
     Tis not of earth they seem a part — 
They're food for every anxious heart! 
        Enchanting frozen rain! 
 A WINTER'S SUNRISE 
There comes now o'er the eastern hills the 
  glorious sun, 
        His face now glows with radiance of pure 
  light; 
He now views man and many works that must 
  be done 
        Before the darkness of the coming night. 
We gladly welcome thee, O, powerful king of 
  day! 
         Glad are we now to feel thou art in sight; 
We missed thy warmth so much whilst thou 
  wast far away — 
        The warmth thou bringeth with thy bril- 
  liant light. 
The cold and bitter frost canst not withstand 
  thy gaze, 
        And sheets of ice before thee disappear; 
Thou showeth many glories of the God of praise, 
  As daily thou dost shed thy light so dear. 
THE DEATH OF A SOLDIER- 
COMRADE 
WRITTEN WHILE A SOLDIER AT FORT WASHAKIE, 
WYO., AUTUMN, 1902. A TRUE NARRATIVE 
Among the sad-tinted shadows 
        That've painted for me the past, 
     There's one which in tender touching 
        Is a shade of different cast. 
I once knew a youthful soldier, 
             Full of hope's ambition and skill; 
     From his comrades he won true friend- 
               ship — 
        From his cavalry steed — good will. 
Fast friends we became together, 
             And laughed in our comradeship's 
               way — 
     I'm sure no friendship was greater 
        In David and Jonathan's day. 
He told me of his home in Ohio, 
             Of a mother who queened this home: 
Of a sister, I think, and a brother, 
        Who longed that he home would 
come. 
He told me a sweetheart was waiting — 
        This gave me the tenderest touch — 
I told him of mine, true and loving, 
             Who was longing for me — oh, so 
much. 
One day he came into the office 
        (Where I sat as clerk of the troop), 
And said he was going out hunting — 
        With pleasure he was ready to whoop 
I learned that a party of officers, 
        And ladies, and some troop-men. 
     Were going to hunt in the mountains 
        ('Twas Wyoming where we were 
then). 
The party went out for this pleasure, 
        In the late autumn's eve of this State 
With wagons, provision and laughter — 
        A departure of merriest rate. 
In autumn the mountains of Wyoming 
        Steal the mantle of cold Winter's 
shroud,
     By their artful ways of teasing 
             The soft'ning will of the cloud. 
While hunting, it seems, that my comrade 
        Strayed too far all alone, 
To follow elk- tracks of such freshness 
             That it seemed but recently gone. 
He lost his way in the snowdrift, 
             But, ne'er found the game that he 
     sought — 
His tired limbs became helpless, 
             While his brain had the power of 
thought. 
He plowed away with his fingers 
             The cold and cruel snow, 
In which was hidden the ghastly 
             Great Hand that he soon would know. 
There was no fire to warm him, 
             And none that he could make — 
     The chilly winds brought for him 
             Their offerings of cheerless ache. 
He lay with a log for his comfort, 
             And thought of the sweets of the 
        past: — 
Of mother and sister and sweetheart, 
         Who had now surely seen him their 
    last. 
He thought of the pleasures now blighted 
        Ambitions he never could tell — 
Ah! what means this cold, chilling numb- 
    ing? 
Yea, the meaning he knew now too 
    well! 
     *     *    *    *    
At his party's camp he was missing, 
             And a diligent search was then made, 
     But all of one day and another's 
             Daylight was beginning to fade 
     When they found his yet breathing body — 
        Pleading eyes beyond any aid! 
At the camp he talked and told them 
             How he wandered away and was lost; 
     But, no healing art could e'er reach him. 
        Though his party felt keenly the cost 
     In their hearts for the youth now blighted 
        As a flower heart-deadened by frost. 
Back to post they brought him for burial — 
        My heart seemed to melt in its grief! 
     The sight of his face brought mem'ries 
        From which I could find no relief!
The sending to his mother his letters 
        And valuables that she could keep, 
     Was a part of my soldierly duty, 
             And a one that was tearfully deep.
He had read me some of these letters,
             So breathing with fond mother's love; 
     So full of endearing "God-bless-you's" 
        That are touched with the mercies 
above. 
O, mother of him who was my comrade! 
        Your blessings I return to your hand, 
Your boy will need them no more — 
             He's, I hope, in a better land. 
But, this "bread" that you casted so 
        fondly 
Upon the waters of Life, which to 
        you 
Is returning — oh, may it be laden 
        With blessings for you all anew! 
He was loved by all who knew him,
             His departure is bathed with the 
tears 
Of many who were 'bove him in the 
station 
        Of his useful, tender years. 
Look above for your comfort, dear 
         mother, 
             You'll find there one peaceful and 
         deep; 
     We know that your heart is bursting! — 
             'Tis cruel to tell you, “Don't weep!”
Be resigned to the will of the Father, 
        He'll send then His spirit to heal — 
     The bright star of hope for the future 
        Will make many a woe a weal. 
SCAEVOLA 
All honor to undaunted fortitude 
Where ever such a spirit breathe in life! 
The legendary history of Rome, 
Of ancient date, relates one truly grand: 
A Roman youth — One Gacius Macius — 
Resolved to end a certain pressing siege 
Against his city; driven by a man, 
One king Porsenna was his famous name. 
Into his camp this youth stole secretly, 
With willed intent to kill this man of war, 
But by an error killed another who 
Was secretary for the one he sought. 
Be'ng captured in this deed he then was brought 
Before the king who threat 'nd him with fire, 
Demanding that this youth should tell him all 
The plots of what the Romans sought to do. 
"Tell you my people's plots?" replied the youth, 
"Or you will place me in your burning flames?" 
Then, walking silently toward the fire, 
Thrusted his hand — the right one — in to burn; 
Unflinchingly he stood 'til it was charred! 
The king and all his men in wonder stood; 
And whispered, "Gods! what fortitude is this!" 
Go to your people, youth," the king replied; 
Such dauntlessness shall ne'er burn in my 
        flames!" 
"Scaevola" afterward was called this youth — 
Left-handed lived he for the cause he loved. 
O, what a lesson of courageous vim! 
A trueness for the principle of right! 
Live for the right!    Be maimed, or die for it ! 
"Fear not those who the body kill, but fear 
Him, who hath after death, the power still 
To cast the soul into eternal flames!" 
THE BEAUTY OF IMAGINATION 
AND ITS INFLUENCE UPON LIFE 
An Address Delivered Before a Literary Circle, Manila 
P. I., November, 1906, by the Author of This Book. 
I believe, to the average mind the word "im- 
agination" suggests childish “daydreams," 
 foolish "air castles," “idle fancies," and "sweet 
 nothings." Let us see if the word has not a 
deeper meaning. Let us see if we cannot find in 
it something of real value to life. 
First — Imaginations, like our thoughts, are 
either good or bad. Bad thoughts debase and 
dehumanize; bad imaginations demonize. Good 
thoughts inspire noble actions; good imagin- 
ations actuate great deeds. But, my subject 
deals with the lofty summit— the acme of im- 
agination. The beauty of Imagination is the 
poetry of Life: It is the fragrant breath of the 
flower; the whisper of the breeze; the wooing of 
the bird; the murmur of the brook; the voice of 
the wave; the awakening tread of spring; the 
joyous laugh of summer; the crowning gold of 
autumn's eve, and the spotless shroud of winter. 
It is the eye of the moon; the jewels of the stars; 
the glorying pride of day; the trailing robes of 
night; the silver of the moonlight, and the kiss of 
the sunbeams. 
   Its Influence upon Life: Upon consideration, 
it is astonishing to note how many of our im- 
aginations are "possibilties." Imagination 
gives to the poverty of youth a sight of the 
wealth and splendor that may be for him; to the 
despairing lover a view of the love and happiness 
that may be his; to the tired soldier it presents 
the laudatory sounds of victory that are ahead of 
him; it reveals the glowing light of Fame and 
Honor to the longing eye of Ambition. It 
sweetens childhood's play, and enriches declin- 
ing age.     It is the spark of hope to the work- 
ing-man, and the lamp of happiness to the 
millionaire.    It is the wolf of want; and the lap 
of luxury.    It is the love-light of mother's eyes; 
and the heaven under the roof of the lover.    It 
is the hand of Friendship; and the arms of Love. 
It is the source of fruitful endeavors, and the 
root of renowned accomplishments.    It is the 
forerunning "will" of the persevering "way." 
It is the view of sin's torture below, and the 
sight of celestial glories above; the view of Death, 
and the sight of Life; the view of Earth's frowns, 
and the sight of Heaven's smiles. 
O, weird, fleeting phantasm of Muse, 
That playeth 'mid the pearly dews of life ! 
And through the twink'ling, jeweled portals 
        bright 
Of heaven's purity thou soareth oft. 
And to thy fond abode returneth sweet 
And dreamy whispers that to Life unfold 
The smiles that speak of blissful hope, and, of 
The glowing faith within the blithesome heart. 
Sweet Dreamer! that rejoices with the songs 
Of silv'ry twitters that the winged hosts 
Of earth resound their inward hearts of love 
And gratitude unto their Maker!   That 
Dreams 'mid the sun's departing tints to Day; 
His welcome smiles to Morn's sweet breath; the 
        streams 
Of silvered lights of moonbeams'   flick'ring 
        gifts 
To Night; the faultless diamond twinkles of 
The studded firmament above; the bright 
Hued panorama of the covenant 
Of God to Noah; and, the dancing blue 
Of ocean's balmy mists; the fragrance and 
The varied hues of Nature's flowered dress; 
The sermons of the fading shades of gold 
Of Autumn's eve; the lifeless rocks and hills; 
The curse of sin; the hand of death; and, all 
That Life proclaims. 
Heart of the heart, that feels 
The warmth of love! Soul of the soul, that 
        hears 
Celestial songs, and sees the smiles above 
Of angels' love!   Sweet of the sweets of Life!
RETROSPECTION 
Now through dim mists of years I view the past 
        And many scenes of which my heart holds 
    dear 
To my interior vision thick and fast 
        They are presented very bright and clear. 
I see the dear old home where I was born, 
        And where a part of childhood's days I 
    spent; 
'Twas there the radiant rising sun each morn 
        Viewed many scenes of quietness and con- 
        tent. 
There is my dear old father, hale and strong, 
        Moving with gentle tread about the place, 
While mother sings a dear old sacred song 
        With cheerful countenance and smiling face. 
There mother, with a loving lullaby, 
        Holds me, her babe, within her gentle arm — 
Methinks I hear her whisper with a sigh, 
        "May God protect thee, dear one, from all 
    harm." 
'Twas there my little sister, sweet and kind, 
        Was with me and we played so glad and 
         free: 
When ne'er we had a thought of troubled mind, 
        Nor of the many future things to be. 
But mother's voice and little sister's, too, 
        Are silenced now — no more they speak to 
        me! 
For they have long bade me a last adieu 
        And left me lonely here on life's wild sea. 
But, soon I, too, must leave this world behind — 
        When I have run the mighty race of life — 
Then may I rest from troubles of the mind, 
       And every daily care of toil and strife. 
TEACH ME 
Teach me, O God, the story of Thy Son! 
        Teach me to feel Thy Pentacost within; 
Teach me to pray, in truth, "Thy will be 
done" — 
        Oh, teach me! 
Teach me to see the world about my feet; 
        Teach me to hear its music's sweetest 
strains; 
Teach me to know the bitter from the sweet — 
        Oh, teach me! 
Teach me a word of loving truth within, 
         Teach me a look to show this precious 
truth; 
Teach me a touch of tenderness to win — 
        Oh, teach me! 
Teach me the faith that leadeth to the light; 
        Teach me a song of ever joyous day; 
Teach me a step to walk within the right — 
        Oh, teach me! 
“REST IN JESUS”
The Dying Words of My Sister, to Whom I Dedi- 
cated ''The Household Queen," and Who Went to Her 
''Rest" March 17, 1903. 
Dear sister, to "rest in Jesus " 
        You told us you would go; 
And now that you've gone and left us, 
        As others have before, 
We think of these words with rapture — 
        We know your "rest" is sweet — 
Although our hearts droop in mourning, 
        Farewell, until we meet 
With you in the great eternal 
        To share with you your "rest," 
Where there is no pain of parting 
        And ever we are blessed. 
THE ! ! ! 
THE END !   Sickle of Time, 
That's bladed with farewells of many tears! 
And Nevermore is thine 
Own countersign to moments, days and years. 
Thou art the sacred break 
That marks the sever of the silver cord 
Of Life.    The sad mistake 
That marks the "might-have-been" where Life 
             hath trod! 
Where love begins to wane, 
Thou standeth with the drooping shades of night 
For that which yet remains — 
The Life's divided shadow from the light. 
Thou art the period 
That Nature uses for her written book — 
     Her chapter's marked-retard — 
The grave of "It is finished's'' parting look. 
But, yet we find in thee 
A truly dear and sympathizing friend — 
The sweetest liberty 
From sorrowed past — our future hope, THE 
        END!

PREFACE.
As I view the ills that are thrust upon the Negro race, in a country whose highest virtue is freedom; as I note the silence of the press and pulpit, together with their lack of effort to remedy such evils and as I notice the compromise that is made with sin in establishing what is known as "white supremacy," my heart. is made to bleed. Like Lincoln, when he was filled with sympathy for the slave, I resolved at my first opportunity to deal the hydra-headed monster, prejudice, a blow.
When a Northern man comes South to study conditions, he largely meets the servant class of Negroes. With this partial view, he takes what is said by the Southerners and returns home to write on the vexed Negro Problem. When a Southern man writes, he largely eliminates the better qualities of the Negro and paints a pic- ture of him that is much akin to hades. Seeing that the one cannot get at the facts, while the other will not, I reach the conclusion that the story must be told by a Negro-one who is a victim to the inconveniences of prejudice.
Such feelings, continuously preying upon me gave shape to this little volume. I am anxious for the world to know the unvarnished truth of the matter and have accordingly placed myself on the altar of public opinion. If by this effort, the slightest sentiment is generated, tending to call attention to the open sore of the body politic, my prayers will have been answered.
THE AUTHOR.
PREJUDICE.
How strangely blind is prejudice, the Negro's greatest foe!
It never fails to see the wrong but naught of good can know.
'Tis blind to all that's lofty, yea, to truth it is opposed,
Degrading things will ope his eyes, while good will keep them closed.
How cruel, too, is prejudice! how wicked is the tongue!
The evils reign supremely there, the bad is ever sung;
With some the Negro needs a soul, with others he's a brute,
In silence those remaining live and naught of this dispute.
The schools it legislates against, in keeping Negroes down,
Whatever tends to elevate it meets it with a frown.
It gives to them the Jim Crow car and vessels on the sea;
It makes the stockade to exist and take their liberty.
It makes the press to vacillate up the Negro's name,
The pulpit makes a compromise with evil, for the same,
It makes the Pharaohs of today and seals them with its ban,
It strives to close the door of hope upon the Negro man.
It causes mobs to formulate, to come and go at will,
At morning, evening, noon or night, a Negro man to kill,
It brings injustice to the courts when Negrɔ men are tried,
It wrings the ballot from their hands-a thousand wrongs beside.
It is the country's greatest curse, the nation's open sore,
It slowly saps the precious life, is poison to the core,
Such ravages gave certain death to nations in the past,
The same will lay this country low, its fondest hopes will blast.
It minimizes all that's good and magnifies the ill,
The devil's mission upon earth, it clamors to fulfill;
'Twas prejudice that caused the death of Christ upon the tree,
He knows the pangs that Negroes feel and gives them sympathy.
When men refuse to see the light a darkness is assured,
Such blindness comes upon the scene as never can be cured!
Contagious is the dread disease, for Negroes learn to view
The white man with suspicious eyes, but here's a thing that's new.
The Negro Problem of the land, and all the same entails,
Will be no more whene'er we find a sentiment prevails,
To bury prejudice so deep it never can arise
Till all the races of the earth shall meet above the skies.
'Twas God who made the Negro black, the reasons are His own
One blood the nations all the same, the facts are too well known,
He also made the Golden Rule, to use the neighbor well,
Shall prejudice among us dwell forever? who can tell?
THE NEGRO SCHOOLS.
Please be silent now, my country, while I fill the speaker's place; 
While I point out some abuses that we constantly embrace,
Listen with your best attention to the words that I shall say,
How the Negro schools are managed, in this. Commonwealth today.
All the officers are white men and together they conspire,
To undo the schools for Negroes, of such deeds they never tire;
Oft we find among the trustees men who cannot read a word,
But when speaking of the Negro, they are certain to be heard.
Education for the Negro they discourage, and they say,
"It will bring dissatisfaction to such people ev'ry day,
Make them crave for something higher, such as white men should enjoy,
Which will spoil the other Negroes that we have in our employ."
Shorter terms are recommended many times as low as two
Are the months to Negroes given, in a year- now this is true,
Longer terms the whites are given in the same communities-
They conform to such a standard of the right with perfect ease.
Poorer pay to Negro teachers, driving good ones from the field,
Schools are let to lowest bidders to the same they're forced to yield,
Higher pay and better teachers for the white schools is the cry.
While encouragement is given Negro schools to starve and die.
Rural libraries established for the whites on ev'ry side,
But when application's made for Negro schools it is denied,
Thus they deal with education for the mass of Negro youth,
Posing still as great exponents and conservers of the truth.
From the sword of fierce Goliath we may all a lesson learn,
How while planning death to others on your head it may return,
In regard to schools for Negroes, cease their welfare to neglect,
For the same will come upon you in a way you least expect.
JIM CROW CARS.
If within the cruel Southland you have chanced to take a ride,
You the Jim Crow cars have noticed, how they crush a Negro's pride,
How he pays a first class passage and a second class receives,
Gets the worst accommodations ev'ry friend of truth believes.
'Tis the rule that all conductors, in the service of the train,
Practice gross discriminations on the Negro- such is plain-
If a drunkard is a white man, at his mercy Negroes are,
Legalized humiliation is the Negro Jim Crow car.
'Tis a license given white men, they may go just where they please,
In the white man's car or Negro's will they move with perfect ease,
If complaint is made by Negroes the conductor will go out
Till the whites are through carousing, then he shows himself about.
They will often raise a riot, butcher up the Negroes there,
Unmolested will they quarrel, use their pistols, rant and swear, 
They will smoke among the ladies though offensive the cigar;
'Tis the place to drink their whiskey, in the Negro Jim Crow car.
If a Negro shows resistance to his treatment by a tough,
At some station he's arrested for the same, though not enough,
He is thrashed or lynched or tortured as will please the demon's rage,
Mobbed, of course, by "unknown parties," thus is closed the darkened page.
If a lunatic is carried, white or black, it is the same,
Or a criminal is taken to the prison-house in shame,
In the Negro car he's ushered with the sheriff at his side,
Out of deference for white men in their car he scorns to ride.
We despise a Negro's manhood, says the Southland, and expect,
All supremacy for white men-black men's rights we'll not protect,
This the Negro bears with patience for the nation bows to might,
Wrong has borne aloft its colors disregarding what is right.
This is called a Christian nation, but we fail to understand,
How the teachings of the Bible can with such a system band;
Purest love that knows no evil can alone the story tell,
How to banish such abuses, how to treat a neighbor well.
THE PEONAGE SYSTEM.
The religious wars of Europe have been numbered with the past,
But a worse thing, clouds has overcast, bright America with
'Tis the heinous contract system that plantation life contains,
Worse than slavery's conditions in a land where freedom reigns.
Negroes forced in one roomed cabins, mother's from their children torn
All the day till dark of evening from the dawn of early morn,
Sweet affection, thrift and neatness, all that perfect homes would bring,
Yea, humanity is buried at command of money's king.
Shall the future of the Negro by the white man be suppressed,
In his forcing from the present all that makes the future best?
Shall the training of the children be neglected? passing strange
Things material for the morals of the Negro they exchange.
Oft we find an overseer with a gun and club and whip,
Who at night within the stockade locks the Negroes, lest they skip,
If they offer a resistance for their treatment in this cage,
They are clubed into submission in the overseer's rage.
Some are kidnapped for the stockade, others taken there for debt,
Fed with only bread and water and for more they dare not fret,
They are worked like beasts of burden and the story here is told,
Of the sacrifice of manhood to a god that's made of gold!
'Tis an open, open secret how the white man without pain,
Sells the evil one his conscience out of greed for earthly gain,
Barbarism can't surpass it, races cannot lower fall.
'Mid this great enlightened country money's king rules over all.
If a farm hand makes an effort in the schooling of himself,
Or a mother will persist in looking up her little elf,
They must leave the old plantation for a more congenial clime,
"No enlightenment for Negroes," planters say, "'tis loss of time."
"Send to Africa the Negro," they have talked of such you know,
Like to England's Irish question, planters cannot let him go,
Hear the planter loudly singing, this the chorus of the song:
"Keep the 'niggers,' all the 'niggers' in the field where they belong!"
Now he pleads for better treatment, why dehumanize a race?
On the farm he's proved his service and there's none to take his place,
None to stand the heat of summer in the making of the crop,
Whites are taught to need his labor and they cannot learn to stop.
Sad, indeed, to find a nation, bowing down to money's might,
Sacrificing all that's noble, all that's beautiful and right,
"Righteousness exalts a nation," sin can only bring it shame,
Serve no other god, I warn you, in the God of heaven's name.
THE SOUTHERN PRESS.
When a Negro comes in question you may watch the Southern press,
See how bias its opinions, how his ills are given stress,
Prominence is given headlines, when accused he is of crime,
Emphasizes all the evils of the Negro ev'ry time.
If a white man comes in question you may watch the press again,
How its dignity it loses in a compromise with sin,
Down in some secluded corner you the story may behold,
Where the public may not find it, sadly there the tale is told.
It condemns the sins of Negroes which in white men 'twill excuse,
If a Negro's crime is grievous here's the head- ing it will use:
"He's a candidate for lynching," in a type that's bold and plain,
If a heinous crime's committed by a white man, "he's insane."
When the Negroes prove their manhood and their homes protection give,
They're pronounced as desperadoes and too desperate to live,
Nothing like its ever published of a white man, though his case
May be ten times more revolting and far deeper the disgrace.
At some public place if Negroes are mistreated by the whites,
When policemen won't arrest them or defend a Negro's rights,
Though the proof is overwhelming and the public ear it gains.
How conspicuous the silence that the Southern press maintains.
When a good is done by Negroes of the same you will not hear, 
With their ills the press is busy and the good cannot appear,
Wrong, if found upon a Negro, will be charged up to the race,
But if white, with him 'tis ended, brings his people no disgrace.
See! the Southern press is bowing to a god that's made of gold!
And the populace is crying in a way that's passing bold,
"It must run to suit our fancy or the gold we'll take away!"
So the press can rise no higher than the common people say.
Humbleness will be exalted, exaltation be abased,
To the press it sounds a warning blest humility to taste.
Exaltation in a measure waves its banner over all,
But such pride will bring destruction, haughty spirits bring a fall.
THE SOUTHERN PULPIT.
The Southern pulpit, in our eyes,
Descends to make a compromise
With evil things in heaven's name;
The kind that brings a blush of shame.
The evils to the Negro shown,
His rights that Southern men disown,
We view with sorrow and distress,
Its lack of effort to suppress.
Prevailing thought it cannot cross,
If so, it feels financial loss;
The gold to it is dearer far,
Than all the rights of Negroes are.
It preached that slavery was right,
Upon the Scripture based its fight,
Why should we now expect a change
So radical? Such would be strange.
This pulpit fails to higher climb
Than sentiment. at any time.
Such grades of preaching cannot live,
The truth alone can freedom give.
THE PHARAOHS OF TODAY.
Pain and labor of oppression gave the Western world its birth,
From such shores the love of freedom ne'er should perish from the earth;
To a conscience that's awakened, these are words to make it start,
"Each oppressor of a human buys himself a hardened heart!"
'Twas the sixties broke the shackles from the body of the slave,
Which was only half his freedom, for his mind we now must save.
Liberty of his opinion, such as other people use
Give him all that makes for manhood, and the same he'll not abuse.
True, the God of ancient Israel loves the Negro of today,
Many proofs are had in common of the truth of what I say;
For the stronger the oppression made them multiply and grow,
Of the Negro in this country quite the same is true, you know.
"Give him freedom," says the white man, "will defeat our greatest plan,
With his freedom here's the trouble, he'll aspire to be a man.
Men will scorn to suffer treatment on the level of a brute,
Safest way to keep them subjects is their man- hood to dispute."
Ancient Pharaoh was a pagan, bowing down to wood and stone,
Deeds today of Christian Pharaohs would dis- grace the ancient throne.
Leaguers now with Satan's kingdom from their plans he never parts,
Such oppressors of a human pay the price of hardened hearts!
Pharaoh's cruelty in Egypt filled the Israelites with pain,
Thus his heart was fully hardened out of love for earthly gain.
For the same he met destruction; to his rashness it was due,
Modern Pharaohs, his example may a lesson bring to you!
When the Jews for wrong decided, then the nation lost its rank.
Rome, debauched in gross corruption, into degradation sank.
Sins of national importance bring calamities the same,
Just as true as it is ancient, sin will bring the nation shame.
THE DOOR OF HOPE.
The President has thus disclosed 
In words his noblest plan:
"The door of hope shall not be closed
Upon the Negro man.
"His opportunities must be
With other men's the same;
As nation's chief I will not see
Him forced in ways of shame."
Official work he'd scarce begun
When from his lips did fall,
"A special right I give to none,
But equal rights to all.
"Square dealing for the soldiers true,
Who made this country grand;
But more than this no man is due,
And none shall less demand.
"I'm president of all the land,”
The broiling South was told.
"For truth and right I mean to stand,
Such policy I hold."
When urged to crush the Negro race,
He answered with a zest,
"All men of worth shall have a place,
True manhood is the test.
""Tis better all the people up,
Than keep a portion down,
You need, my friends, a loving cup,
Your prejudice to drown.
"The doors of hope are open wide
To all within the land,
With God forever on our side,
This sentiment will stand."
With spinal column stout and strong,
With arm that's made of steel,
He crushes prejudice and wrong,
And makes the demons reel.
To heal the nation's open sore
Of hatred for a race,
He wider swings the open door,
And bares the monster's face.
No president could stem the tide
Of opposition blind,
Since Lincoln for the Negro died,
Till Roosevelt we find.
Long may he live to bless the land
With truth and liberty,
Who for the right will take a stand
And set a nation free.
Then Roosevelt for nineteen four
Our president should be,
Who gives to all an open door
Of opportunity.
LYNCHING.
Have you ever heard of lynching in the great United States?
'Tis an awful, awful story that the Negro man relates,
How the mobs the laws have trampled, both the human and divine,
In their killing helpless people as their cruel hearts incline.
Not the heathen! 'Tis the Christian with the Bible in his hand,
Stands for pain and death to tyrannize the weaklings of the land;
Not the red man nor the Spaniard kills the blacks of Uncle Sam,
'Tis the white man of the nation who will lynch the sons of Ham.
To a limb upon the highway does a Negro's body hang,
Riddled with a hundred bullets from the bloody, thirsty gang;
Law and order thus defying, and there's none to say them nay.
"Thus," they say, to keep their power, "Negroes must be kept at bay.".
How his back is lacerated! how the scene is painted red,
By the blood of one poor Negro till he numbers with the dead!
Listen to the cry of anguish from a soul that God has made,
But it fails to reach the pity of the demons in the raid.
To a tree we find the Negro and to him chain beside,
There a horse to it is fastened and the whip to him applied.
Thus he pulls the victim's body till it meets a dying fate, 
And to history is given a new scandal to relate.
Limb from limb he's torn asunder! See the sav- age lynchers grin!
Then the flesh is cut in pieces and the souvenirs begin;
Each must have the piece allotted for the friends at home to see,
Relatives will cluster round him, laughing, dancing, filled with glee.
To a stake they bind the Negro, pile the trash around him high,
Make the fire about his body; it is thus that he must die.
Burn him slowly, hear the lynchers: "That's the part we most enjoy!
Tell it out in all the nation how we killed a Negro boy!"
Savage mob a Negro's chasing, and to catch him must not fail;
If it does, another's taken, there to force from him the tale
Where the fleeing man is hiding; if the facts he cannot raise,
Though his innocence protesting, for the same by death he pays.
""Tis a Negro's blood we're craving; such will have at any cost;
We must lynch the one in keeping, for the other one is lost!"
This they say, and when they're questioned answer like this is the why,
"To the race at large a warning here a Negro man shall die."
O, how brave the Southern white man when, a hundred men to one,
Lynch a lone, defenceless Negro, when each lyncher has a gun.
If at midnight or the noonday, the result is all the same,
Law is powerless to hinder, and the nation shares the blame.
Lynchers go into the Senate and their savagery uphold,
How they shoot and butcher Negroes is the story that is told.
Guns and ropes they have in plenty, and, if necessary, will
Use them on an office holder, such a Negro they must kill.
How they clamor for the Philippines and Cubans far away,
While a worse thing is transpiring in this country every day.
In the eyes of such law-breakers lives a beam of greatest size,
That will hinder all the pulling of the mote from others' eyes.
Are the candidates for lynching always found among the men?
No, the fiends of human torture lynch a woman now and then.
Yea, the Spanish Inquisition insignificant will pale,
When compared with such atrocities that in the South prevail!
'Tis a blot on Christian manhood time, itself, cannot erase;
Human blood upon the conscience centuries cannot efface.
Simply to suspect a Negro is sufficient for the band,
He must die without a hearing, in a boasted gospel land.
Sowing antedates the reaping, and the nation should beware,
That the sowers to the wind will reap the whirl- wind everywhere.
Hark the cry! the blood of Negroes cries for vengeance from the dust!
How I tremble for the nation when I think that God is just!
RETRIBUTION.
When Egypt said, "Exterminate
The males among the Jews,
Fair Goshen's land make desolate
And bid them glad adieus:"
The darkest hour then was brought
Upon their slavery,
But God came down, with Egypt fought,
And made the bondsmen free.
No means of peace within the bout
Could pay the price-'tis plain—
The measure they had meted out
Was measured back again.
\For blood of Hebrews had been spilt,
And justice did demand
Egyptian blood to cleanse the guilt-
The firstborn of the land!
America! how canst thou tell
Thy tale of bondage sore?
How blood as rain from Negroes fell,
Till many were no more!
The blood of Negroes cried so loud,
For vengeance from the ground,
Till clouds of sorrow wept and bowed
And heaven's anger frowned.
No peaceful means, 'tis understood,
Could end the dread affray;
For justice cried, "Slave-owners' blood
In war the debt shall pay!"
The Negroes of the country now
Are held in open scorn,
To other peoples forced to bow,
Though often higher born.
To lynch a Negro is no crime,
The courts of justice say;
And so 'tis done at any time,
A mob may set a day.
The night is darkest near the dawn,
The voice of nature speaks;
The blood that's from the Negroes drawn
A retribution seeks.
"Revenge is mine, I will repay,'
The God of right declares.
The savage mob, with regal sway
A nation's curse prepares.
America! a warning take,
Repent! forsake the wrong!
Thine evil ways at once forsake,
Thy time cannot be long!
The morning star begins to rise,
The darkest night dispels,
Its ray of hope illumes the skies,
And precious dawn foretells.
America! rouse up! awake!
For God is living still,
Who will of wrong a sample make,
When sin has drunk its fill!
RUSSIA'S RESENTMENT.
At Kisheneff two wicked men,
In secret killed a child.
The blame they put on Hebrews then,
And sentiment went wild!
The Jews they murdered forty were,
Before they found the truth;
His uncle and the gardener
Had killed the little youth.
Such gross mistreatment of the Jews,
Their death by Russian mobs;
When such the Christian world reviews,
Its heart of pity throbs.
America a message sent
Of protest 'gainst the same.
But Russia said, "Till thou repent,
Don't speak to me of shame!
"If blind are leaders of the blind,
Both in the ditch will fall;
Till thou hast cleansed thy guilty mind,
Upon me do not call.
"When people live in homes of glass,
They dare not cast a stone.
The sins of others ever pass,
Till mended are thine own.
"The blood of Negroes cries aloud,
For vengeance in thy land,
And lynchers, too, thy borders crowd,
To kill on ev'ry hand.
"Begin at home, thy beam take out
And make thy vision clear;
Then other wicked lands, no doubt,
Thy messages will hear.
"No such a land can say to me,
Repent, and mend thy ways!
Thy lofty rank, thy dignity
Is lost in thy dispraise.
""Tis he alone that's free from sin,
The stone of censure throws,
Let charity at home begin
Before abroad it goes.
"O, land of lynchers, scorn to raise
Thy voice in foreign wrongs,
Till thou shalt change thy bloody ways,
Reproof to thee belongs.
"The wrongs of Negroes in thy land
By far outweigh the Jews,
Till these are cured, please understand
I thy advice refuse.'
America! thy Christian name
The pagans laugh to scorn!
Thy bloody deeds of open shame
Foretell destruction's morn.
Thy nation's lofty rank is lost,
Thy sins decreed it so,
O, land of lynchers, count the cost,
And counteract thy woe!
In thunder's tone, "Thou shalt not kill,"
From Sinai we hear.
Forevermore that echo will
Resound upon the ear.
Such bloody lands at once take heed,
The writing's on the wall,
So plain that he who runs may read,
"Thy tyranny must fall.”
INJUSTICE OF THE COURTS.
Whites alone upon the jury in a number of the states,
Thus they crush a helpless Negro with their prejudicial hates;
Legal ills they thrust upon him, and the tale is passing sad-
Equal rights with white men? Never! Color- phobia makes them mad.
'Tis the training of the children, every Negro to suppress,
They their spleen may vent upon him and be happy, none the less,
They will boast aloud in anger if by Negroes they are crossed,
"If we shoot or kill a Negro, not a cent will be the cost."
Juries represent the people and their sentiments make known,
When a Negro comes in question there's dis- crimination shown.
They are bold to make assertion that they will not do the same
For a Negro as a white man, and no feeling comes of shame.
Jurymen have made confession after trial had been made
Of a Negro, and "He's guilty!" was the verdict there displayed.
Stern remorse so touched the conscience, they the story did relate,
How the verdict they had rendered was to stay the dying fate.
"It was hard to say him guilty, for the man, we thought, was clear.
But a mob was making clamors that were ter- rible to hear."
"Punishment or death!" it shouted, and around began to press;
And of two impending evils, we have chosen him the less.
Thus we legalized the lynchers, we their words to court have brought,
And the innocent convicted! how revolting is the thought!
When a mob has forced a jury to a stand against the right,
All the waters of the ocean cannot make the conscience white.
Once a Negro girl was saucy, and the wife the husband told,
Who in haste arraigned the servant and began to swear and scold.
Then he whipped her without mercy-straight- way she to law applied.
Passing strange-they found him guilty, and the judge was sorely tried.
This he said, in making sentence, "No disfavor comes to you,
You have only done as others, or as I myself would do,
If your servants vex the mistress, thrash them out again, I say,
Go to jail ten minutes only, and a fine of five cents pay!"
If a judge is conscientious, then the people vote him out,
His partiality to white men they must know, beyond a doubt.
No equality for Negroes in the law the world must know,
If he fails to make distinctions, from the bench they'll have him go.
This injustice is a cancer, in the nation's breast it lives,
Quietly and unmolested, awful is the death it gives.
It results from color-phobia, which the God of right defies,
Slaves of prejudice, take warning! pause before the nation dies.
All the land is running riot, laws are trampled in the face,
Negroes must be law-abiding; whites alone the laws debase.
Wrong upon itself is coiling, hissing serpent of the times,
Whites in self-defense are crying, "Shield us from our people's crimes."
Barbarism fills the country, all for safety take alarm,
From the lowest to the highest, no one now is free from harm;
Anarchy is rife among us, all resulting from the same,
Gross injustice of the court-room brings the nation into shame.
Lawlessness is at a premium, woeful penalty it brings,
Relic of the middle ages is the present state of things.
To the winds we now are sowing, and the whirl- wind comes at length,
Evils cast upon the waters come again with added strength.
THE NEGRO BALLOT.
Can America be reckoned as the country of the free?
In the light of recent actions 'tis a truth that's hard to see.
It has taken from the Negro his protection, yea, his vote,
How oppressive is the finger that such cruel mandates wrote!
"Equal rights are not for Negroes; they shall never have a vote,
To supremacy of white man shall be raised the highest note.
Keep the black man from the ballot and we'll treat him as we please,
With no means for his protection, we will rule with perfect ease." 
Those are words of Southern white men, backed, it seems, by all the land,
From the blacks they'll take the ballot, with their rights on every hand;
O, the maladministration in enforcement of the ills,
Thus they re-enslave the Negro till their cup of evil fills.
When appeal is made to Congress for protetion of a race,
They will promptly dodge the issue, saying, "This is not the place;
In the courts alone there's power to decide it for a fact,"
"We evade it," says the court-room, "Congress has the power to act."
So when Negroes cry for justice in this commonwealth of ours,
There is none to give an answer, none to regu- late the powers,
Congress claims no jurisdiction, and the courts declare the same,
None in all this Christian nation who will face the load of shame.
More than all the host of Egypt or the Canaan- ites of old,
Were the Jews when God was captain of the army, we are told.
Stronger than the ancient mountain of the waters of the sea,
Nature hastened to the rescue, making all op- posers flee.
Though Elisha, when at Dothan, was encom- passed round about,
By the forces of Benhadad, as he put the Jews to rout,
His protection came from heaven in the chariots. of fire,
Yea, the angels and the horses told the earth of heaven's ire.
When for God and right we battle, numbers cannot make a mark,
For while countless millions perished, eight were saved in Noah's ark.
'Twas the faithful few, my readers, who were found on holy ground,
That were saved, while all remaining in the raging flood were drowned.
Tell me not of shame or failure in a just and righteous cause,
For the right at length will triumph in the face of wicked laws,
Heaven still extends protection to the weak- ened and oppressed,
Who will cry to God for succor and relief when sore distressed.
Yea, the angel still encampeth round about when Christians fear,
To deliver them from evil and their souls to fill with cheer.
With the faith of ancient Hebrews should the Negro of today,
Ask the Maker for the ballot, and with courage wend his way. 
If a fervent prayer is offered by a race ten million strong,
Telling of discrimination, persecution, hate, and wrong,
God will hasten to the rescue and the ballot will restore,
And reclaim for Negro manhood, equal justice evermore.
THE EUTAWVILLE LYNCHING.
(July, 1904.)
In the State of "Old Palmetto," from the town of Eutawville,
Comes a voice of pain and anguish that refuses to be still.
'Tis a voice that cries for vengeance for the wrongs it has received,
Yea, it asks a nation's conscience, When will justice be achieved?
'Twas a Negro and four white men that a fishing-party made, 
In this party all the basis of a tragedy was laid,
One of them began a quarrel with the Negro of the crowd,
Told him not to think of justice, for to him 'twas disallowed.
Then they all began to curse him, in a shameful way to see,
Till the Negro said, "I'll spank you, if you do not let me be!"
For this threat he was arrested, and for trial was arraigned,
And it goes without the saying, it was by the I white man gained.
So Kitt Bookard there was sentenced, for that was the Negro's name,
To a fine of just five dollars, and condemned with all the blame.
When the fine he could not furnish, in the guard-house he was placed,
There in safety for the lynchers, who that night the town disgraced.
With the constable to help them and the marshall of the town,
Went the wicked fishing-party to the guard- house, with a frown;
They procured a bar of iron, gagged and tied Kitt Bookard fast,
And they took him in a buggy to the river, for the last.
"Say your prayers," the lynchers told him, "for to Jordan you have come,
Be in haste, for hour of midnight brings you to your final home.”
"If you'll spare me," said Kitt Bookard, "I will be your slave for life."
"Speak no more," the mob retorted, "with your blood will end the strife."
He was clubbed and mutilated, then the fiends put out his eye—
Any mob of heathen darkness would such shameful deeds decry-
Then with weights about his body, in the river he was cast,
Where his blood cried out for vengeance till a week and more had passed.
Bookard's family was anxious to procure him his release,
Through the night his wife was restless, and from worry could not cease.
At the dawn his brother hastened, "I will pay the fine," he said,
But he found the guard-house empty and as quiet as the dead.
Quick a search was instituted, all the Negroes, round about,
Volunteered into the service, bound to clear the place of doubt.
In the night a rain had fallen and no stirring round was done,
Save a buggy-track was leading from the guard-house only one.
Hurriedly the track was followed to the Santee River's brink,
And a dredging was decided when the Negroes came to think.
On the ninth day thus they found him in the silent river's bed,
Weighted with a bar of iron, mutilated, bruised and dead.
When the coroner was summoned and an in- quest was begun,
'Twas revealed in all its horrors, how the deed of shame was done,
'Twas a tale of barbarism that the press refused to tell,
How the mob with hellish fury did the work of demons well.
In the mob was found a witness, when the fiends were brought to court,
Who exposed the shocking lynching in a clear and full report,
All the details of the quarrel, and the fine Kitt was to pay,
Of his death in Santee River long before the dawn of day.
Then the jury left the court-room, just for four- teen minutes' time,
And returned to bring the verdict that would free the sons of crime,
"We pronounce the men not guilty," said the foreman of the crew,—
When the facts are given credance, this was thunder from the blue.
Now that mob unwhipped of justice, poses as the country's best,
Why, it only killed a Negro! let such matters have a rest!
Hark! we hear in half the country, "Keep the Negro in his place,
Violence we measure to him as a warning to his race."
To this day the blood of Bookard cries for vengeance, loud and long,
And the wailing reaches heaven, fills the ear that hates the wrong.
So the same can never triumph-punishment for sin is sure,
Tis God's world, and not the devil's; wrong enthroned is insecure.
While we feel that God is living, we our patience strive to keep,
Still the question comes with power, O, how long will justice sleep?
Those who die the death of Bookard, some sweet day revenge will find,
Nature's God reveals the secret, wrong is punished by its kind.
IMMORALITY.
Have you heard, my friend, the slander that the Negro has to face?
Immorality, the grossest, has been charged up to his race.
Listen, listen to my story, as I now proceed to tell
Of conditions in the Southland, where the mass of Negroes dwell. 
Ev'ry city, town or county, ev'ry state on Southern soil,
Has mulattoes in its borders, found among the sons of toil.
Can you tell from whence they landed; or to whither shall they go?
Is the Negro race responsible alone, I'd like to know?
When a man among the Negroes is the least suspected there
Of an intimate relation with a daughter that is fair,
Then an angry mob arises and he answers for the same
In a death, the worst in cruelty the company can name.
Though the noonday sun is shining at the time the lynching's done,
Still the officers of justice can't detect a single one,
Who partook in Negro killing, for the deed no one is blamed,
And inside the nation's senate comes a voice, "We're not ashamed."
Is the same true when a white man leads a Negro girl astray?
When he takes away her virtue, is the same true? tell me, pray,
Do the press and pulpit clamor or condemn the mighty wrong?
there sentiment against it? is the burden of my song.
When the case is thus presented, they are silent as the grave,
And the law at once is powerless a Negro's name to save,
So you see the same continues and the truth is like a flood,
That in veins of Southern Negroes flow the best of Southern blood.
Can you tell of these mulattoes, did they fall here from the sky?
How is this that they're among us? can you tell the reason why?
Who's to blame for their existence? is the Negro race alone?
If there are such freaks in nature it is time to make them known.
'Tis a custom born of slavery when master's law and might,
Was enforced upon the bondsman without question of the right,
And the parson preached on Sunday how the servant should obey
All the mandates of the master, let them be whate'er they may.
O, how sad the tales of bondage when persuasive measures failed,
How they tortured Negro women till their hellish plans prevailed!
Women faithful to their virtue were as martyrs sent to rest,
Others yielded to the tempter, weary, helpless and distressed.
So the spirit lives at present for the master hand to rule,
or housemaid passes through this training school,
Lo! the greatest of temptations, men and devils there invent, 
Cook or washer, nurse
And present them to the servants, on their ruin so intent.
There's no friend to whom the dusky maiden can appeal for aid,
To the mistress of the home to speak of such she is afraid,
In the law there's no protection that a Negro girl can claim,
None to rescue, none to pity, so she enters into shame.
Now reflect for just a moment, in the light of what you see,
Which is worse, to yield the tempter or the evil one to be?
Can you still believe that Negroes are immoral more than whites?
O, how different the picture if the Negro had his rights!
There's a God who rules in justice, one who feels his children's pain,
So we know that sin and darkness cannot always hope to reign,
All the ills to Negro women will the Father bring to light,
For the Judge, the only Judge of all creation will do right.
THE TRUTH SUPPRESSED.
Why do people sit in darkness as regards the Negro race?
Why so ignorant are nations of conditions in the case?
'Tis because the facts are strangled by a prejudice intense,
Truth is murdered in the forum when she cries in his defence.
If a white man braves the tempest and takes up the Negro's cause,
Thus exposing to the country the injustice of its laws,
He is met with ostracism and consigned to deep disgrace,
He is branded as a traitor to himself and to his race.
Did you know that Sledd of Oxford, his pro- fessorship resigned,
When he gave the press an outline of how Negroes are maligned,
When the world he gave the story of their wrongs on ev'ry hand,
And rebuked his brother white man for sup- porting such a stand?
Have you heard the tale of Bassett's being taken up and tried,
By the trustees of his college and the public too, beside?
He evoked the shaft of censure such as mad men would decree,
Just for writing good opinions of a Negro, don't you see?
We esteem the two professors being natives of the South,
Who would follow their convictions in the face of censure's mouth,
At a risk of their positions, prizing justice more than gold,
Such a sacrifice we'll cherish till the night away has rolled.
Manhood now is at a premium that such risky things will do,
When the life is so endangered from a social point of view,
'Tis a milestone of advancement when a Bas- sett or a Sledd
Rises higher than surroundings, up above the critic's dread.
If the North its grief expresses, as it views the ill so rife,
It is promptly called a meddler, an engenderer of strife,
Then the politicians clamor, while the press takes up the song,
And the people join the chorus in denouncing such a wrong.
We are proud of sympathizers in the great unequal fight,
In the struggle for true manhood and for triumph of the right,
'Tis exposure maims the evils as they viciously unfold,
So his sufferings, unvarnished, by the Negro must be told.
Truth has perished as a martyr, in her grave she's laid to rest,
Though she never fails of rising when the Father thinketh best,
Soon there'll be a resurrection and conditions 'twill expose,
That will bring the Negro's manhood in the midst of wicked foes.
THE CRUM APPOINTMENT.
You, no doubt, have heard the story told of Charleston by the sea,
How they persecute a Negro when a man he tries to be,
'Tis of national importance and the world en- joys the sport,
Caused by William Crum's appointment as col- lector of the port.
When the president decided to appoint him to the place,
Then a train of opposition from the city set apace,
"Our objection to a Negro," said the whites, "has ever been,
That we fear contamination from the color of his skin."
.This the president dishonored, then they brought another plea,
"To the great and grand old party, he has faith- less proved to be,"
Crum his loyalty established and the fallacy Declared,
Brought McComas to his rescue and the prejudice was bared.
To the friends within the senate they directed their appeal,
To defeat his confirmation and suppress a Negro's weal,
For a time the plan succeeded, thus a vote was thwarted twice-
He was promptly re-appointed till the same was numbered thrice.
Then they tried intimidation, told him how the race would lose
All the favors of the white man, and between these he must choose,
They persuaded and they threatened, aye, the Southern press was wild,
In denouncing such an outrage, how the city was defiled!
He with patience bore their envy, heard the clamor and the din,
Ev'ry accusation answered, save the color of his skin,
As a pillar of Gibraltar, he in firmness took a stand,
Braved the storm of opposition like a Moses of the land.
When at length he was commissioned, great, indeed, the city's change,
'Twas a hundred, aye, and fifty that applied for work! how strange!
'Twas the very class of people that his color filled with dread
Who then asked for sub-positions, though a Negro man was head.
Then a telegram was brought him saying, salary was paid,
To no one who was appointed when the senate gave no aid,
Equal to the dire occasion, he made answer, "T no test,
Till the government shall warn me I'll take chances with the rest."
Now contamination's mountain sinks away to common dust,
They are not afraid of Negroes but desire the place of trust,
They want Negroes to be servants and their bosses to be white,
Prejudice distorts their visions and they cannot see the right.
LOYALTY TO THE FLAG.
In the love of home and country and the flag of Uncle Sam,
Can the loyalty be doubted of a dusky son of Ham?
Wheresoever duty calls him, as a freedman or a slave,
The response is ever hearty when "Old Glory" he would save.
'Twas the war of Revolution, when a Negro's blood was first,
To be shed for independence, when a yoke the land had cursed;
Crispus Attucks died in Boston, on State street he paid the debt,
Liberty his blood has planted and the tree is growing yet.
Ask the spirit of Pitcairn how he came to meet his death?
Where and who it was that brought him down to breathe the dying breath?
'Twas the Negro Salem's bullet at the charge of Bunker's Hill,
Bringing to the whites their freedom but to Negroes naught but ill. 
In the battle of New Orleans, eighteen fourteen was the year,
When the Negro fought with valor till the victory was clear;
Jackson paid this glowing tribute-may the spirit never lag-
"None more strong and none more useful, none more loyal to the flag."
O, how brave the Negro soldiers when the Civil war was fought!
Shall they fight such noble battles in the nation's cause for naught?
Hark! the battle cry of Charleston! at Fort Wagner is the place!
At Port Hudson and Fort Pillow how the rebel guns they face!
Fifty-fourth of Massachusetts-may such regiments be praised—
By its valor at Fort Wagner, North and South became amazed!
Hall began as color-bearer but was killed on duty grand,
To the spot went William Carney and the colors took in hand.
Wounded many times was Carney, shot in head, in arm and thigh,
On one knee he fell and crawling kept the colors flying high,
Blood upon the banner streaming while his words the action crowned;
"Boys I've kept aloft 'Old Glory' and it never touched the ground!"
 Colonel Stafford was disabled, Dwight his men to battle led,
With great feeling at New Orleans, Stafford to the sergeant said,
"Guard, protect defend these colors," "Yes," he answered, "though I die
I will bring them back in honor or to God re- port the why."
All the world has heard the story of the Cuban war with Spain,
Ah! the sound of Negro valor falls upon the ear again,
At Elkaney and San Juan how they helped to win the day,
Near the town of Santiago, held the enemy at bay!
Side by side with other soldiers being in complexion white,
Negroes died to take San Juan in the thickest of the fight,
Thus they gained the worthy plaudit from the loyal, brave and true;
"Negroes on the field of battle, dignify the nation's blue."
Shall the prejudice existing in the country now, increase,
While the Negro's patriotism merits rest at home and peace?
Nay, the hydra-headed monster in the end will surely die,
We expect the right to triumph over evil by and by.
NEGRO HEROINES.
Down in history we find it and in grandest works of art,
How the men on fields of battle play so well the soldier's part,
But I come to tell the story of relief from care and pain
Rendered them by Negro women in the Cuban War with Spain.
When the scourge of yellow fever fell upon the boys in blue
And the nation stood in wonder scarcely knowing what to do,
There was found a Negro woman, Mrs. Curtis was her name,
Wife, she was, of a physician with the highest social fame.
When the name of Mrs. Curtis fell upon the nation's ear
And her worth on such occasions had been shown in language clear,
She was summoned by McKinley to the White House-there to plan
How to change the dread condition; how to stay the soldier's ban.
By him there she was commissioned, given fullest oversight
Of relieving fever-stricken in the famous Cuban fight;
With a confidence unfailing, she her preparations made-
Uncle Sam his backing promised true success could not be stayed.
When a call she made for helpers, from the nation's busy throng,
The response from Negro nurses came three hundred eighty strong,
In the Catholics were also, found one hundred twenty nuns,
Who would brave the field as nurses for the fever-stricken ones.
In this noble work of mercy were their duties done so well
That a halo of enchantment round them all is made to dwell,
When we search the war department no com- plaint of them is found,
Not a word to their discredit and to truth that record's bound.
While upon the field of battle helping stem the fever's tide,
While upon that angel mission seven Negro nurses died,
In this work the nuns had fallen till the same had numbered four;
Thus on snowy, angel pinions they the news to heaven bore.
When our boys had thrashed the Spaniards, Mrs. Curtis straightway sent
A petition into congress praying that a monument 
Be at Arlington erected out of sacred memory
Of the nurses who in Cuba died to make the island free.
Mrs. Curtis went in person, she in congress did appear,
Told the story of her labors, of her precious deeds of cheer,
She convincingly impressed it in the nation's congress true,
That for those who fell on duty still a monument was due.
An apportionment by congress for the same at once was made,
Yea, to make a fit memorial for the nation's honored dead;
Twenty-five will name the thousands of the dol- lars that were spent-
In the nation's cemetery stands the nurses' monument.
Mrs. Curtis and her nurses have been valiant in the strife,
May such heroines be favored with a long and happy life;
In the face of such achievements on the nation's battle field,
Prejudice is made to tremble, partly too, his lips are sealed.
WHY NEGROES DON'T UNITE.
Why of all the many races in the country where we live,
Do we find so little union as the Negro race can give?
Is it lack of love? or color? who will give the reason true,
Why they cherish opposition more than other peoples do?
We'll examine for a moment, how the Negro race is made,
Now, we find them all complexions, any hue and ev'ry shade,
Scraps of all the human races in among them we can find,
All the many dispositions, ev'ry nation of its kind.
Ev'ry tribe will hang together, though among the Negroes found,
Which will bring about dissensions, on all questions that abound,
Ev'ry blood must have a "say so," red or yellow, white or black,
Differ always in opinion, racial union always lack.
Hark! the whites of this assembly to a special plan agree,
Lo! the red men now are holding their opinion, don't you see?
Aye, the blacks must have a hearing in the question of today,
Yellow folks compose a factor and the same will have a say.
Scripture tells how Ham was tickled by the shame of Noah's plight,
How his brothers with a mantle shielded Noah from the light,
Now we find that Ham's descendants keep disgraces well exposed,
While the children of the others keep a shameful secret closed.
From inheritance the Negro gets his levity and mirth,
More than any other species of the races of the earth,
He rejoices in reporting what will bring his neighbor shame,
Charity extends her mantle and the others cover blame.
When the race discards the fragments, by the others thrown aside,
And suppresses altogether sinful levity and pride,
Then begins a cultivation of a union of the race,
That will strengthen all its borders which for naught will yield apace.
A NOTABLE DINNER.
Once the nation's chief was honored by the company of one,
Who to lift a fallen people had a work of worth begun,
Lofty things had he accomplished for a race so long despised,
In a land where naught but color by the whites are ever prized.
Booker Washington, the teacher, with the president has dined,
Southern whites it gave convulsions, for to such they're not inclined,
'Tis the color, not achievements, that their fancies recognize,
Whites alone receive their plaudits, Negro, worth they will not prize.
Roosevelt was censured sorely, half the country writhed and hissed,
Just because he shared his dinner with a Negro, -there's the gist-
'Twas the manhood not the color that the president admired,
Souls of worth demand attention, only such his mind desired.
"Down with Washington the 'nigger' and with. Roosevelt, because
He has made of him an equal-how offensive to our laws,
Worthy deeds are not for black men" is the constant cry they raise,
"All advancement of such people brings proportionate dispraise."
Hark! the press begins to clamor, to the South it says "beware!
Lest equality with 'niggers' in the end we'll have to share;
Anti-nigger is our platform, how to crush a 'nigger' man,
Officers must be elected as resulting from this plan."
Washington is far above him-any man who fails to see,
Good when found upon a Negro, from a lack of charity,
See the Southern degradation! view the monster once again,
How it measures deeds of merit by the color of the skin.
Roosevelt was very careful on the choosing of a guest,
Here is what, he did for Tillman, in his zeal to have the best,
Cancelled out his invitation and his company refused,
Dined the best of peoples only-other classes he excused.
Down with prejudice and envy! should be wafted to the breeze,
For the Southern slaves of fashion need a prompt and sure release,
In the teachings of the Master while the path of earth He trod,
We've a brotherhood of races and a Fatherhood of God.
MISUNDERSTOOD.
The ills of all the human race,
The woes of earth that bring disgrace
Would banish, if we only could,
Escape the fiend, Misunderstood.
When Eve and Adam pure and good,
The law divine misunderstood,
A downward course was then begun,
A race that all the earth must run.
The thought is sad, indeed, though true,
That sinners reap in season due,
The fruits of all they sow, and should,
For down in hell they're understood.
The infidels of giant brain,
Would save themselves a deal of pain,
By claiming truth, if such they could,
But they alas! misunderstood.
The wars that devastate the land,
The reason men for wrong will stand,
They have somewhere in seeking good,
The law of right misunderstood.
In harshness do we estimate,
The neighbors oft we underrate,
The scene would change if nature could,
The monster bare, Misunderstood.
The Negro Problem of the times,
Which breeds the most atrocious crimes,
Survives, because in crushing good,
The Golden rule's misunderstood.
The Savior's work on earth was one,
Of building up where sin had run,
He gave to all the highest good,
But passed through life misunderstood.
We long to rest when time is o'er,
In that beyond for evermore,
The habitation of the good,
Above the fiend, Misunderstood.
MUST BE FREED.
The ante-bellum Negro prayed,
For God to intercede,
And God in answer to him said,
"Your children shall be freed."
The hand was seen upon the wall,
The fates at once decreed
That Negro bondsmen one and all,
Should soon be free, indeed.
"If Abraham Lincoln's president"
The South said, "we'll secede;"
They apprehended he'd consent,
For Negroes to be freed.
To battle North against the South,
O'er states rights was agreed,
But echo from the cannon's mouth,
Said, "Negroes must be freed."
Confed'rates did with marked success,
McClellan's steps impede,
Till Abr'm Lincoln did confess,
That Negroes must be freed.
The Union boys with heaven's strength,
From that time did succeed;
And fought with valor till at length,
The Negro slaves were freed.
The Jim Crow car for Negroes made,
To crush their pride, indeed,
Has on the harps of thinkers played,
Those people must be freed.
The right of suffrage from the men,
Is taken out of greed;
A better day is coming when
They shall from this be freed.
Black men before the lyncher's rope,
In vain for mercy plead,
But justice cries, "There is a hope,
From such you shall be freed."
From ignorance and poverty,
From superstition's creed,
From those who crush his liberty,
The Negro must be freed.
The hand has written on the wall,
The clouds must all recede,
For God Whose word can never fall,
Says, "Negroes must be freed."
EMANCIPATION DAY.
The sixties brought a clash of arms-
The mem'ry of it thrills and charms-
While Negro slaves for freedom prayed,
Till Heaven bowed to give them aid.
The God of nations-God of right-
Kept back success within the fight,
Till Lincoln vowed on bended knee,
To set the Negro bondsmen free.
The first of January, see!
In eighteen hundred sixty three,
The first Emancipation Day,
When mad oppressors lost their sway.
The sun of freedom rose that day,
The night of bondage drove away,
When sainted Lincoln did decree,
That slaves forever should be free.
As years of time have come and gone,
For each the Negro race has borne,
Abundant fruit in freedom's name,
That will not bring the nation shame.
Emancipation Day, so great!
With joy we meet to celebrate,
The Sun of Righteousness we hail,
Who died that freedom might prevail.
WHY IS IT?
Why is it so, Dear Prince of Peace,
That wrongs to Negroes never cease?
Are they disloyal to thy name,
And thus are punished for the same?
Is this thy training school on earth,
To mould a race of truest worth?
Pray is it thus that lives are pruned
And sanctified, for heaven tuned?
Thou art the refuge of the race,
That all its troubles will efface,
Wilt thou incline the wayward heart,
To keep thy law in ev'ry part?
'Tis needful that offences come,
But woe unto the man by whom!
They come the evil hearts to chain,
And drive them back to thee again.
For such afflictions, we are told,
Bring people nearer to the fold,
If this be true, then teach them now,
To such conditions here to bow.
Thy chosen people suffer here,
Such chastenings as children, dear,
With patience sweet, in peace and love,
Prepare their souls for life above.
They suffer from refining pains,
The kinds that raise to highest planes,
Can this be why, Dear Prince of Peace,
That wrongs to Negroes never cease?
THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO.
All ye nations, pause a moment! listen to the Negro's voice,
Coming up from all vocations where his life has made a choice!
Listen to each rank or station, as you cross the sea of time,
It is heard in ev'ry nation, any race and ev'ry clime.
If you'll go among the tradesmen and their work of worth inspect,
If you'll tarry with the lowly and their lack of skill detect,
If you'll travel o'er the planet, filled with thought, with action stirred,
In them all you'll find, my brother, that the Negro's voice is heard.
Search the patents of invention, or the soldiers record find,
Peep into the author's study, or the poet keep in mind,
In the avenues of science or the broadest fields of art,
You will hear the voice of Negroes as they bravely play their part.
As good lawyers and physicians, or as men who're called to preach.
As an orator and statesman who the hearts of people reach,
As you view the great professions that have made the world rejoice,
If you'll listen for a moment, you will hear the Negro's voice.
'Tis a voice that cries for justice, not for favors to be shown,
For an equal chance with others, for a manhood of its own,
Give that voice a proper hearing in the forum of the world,
Then all prejudice and envy from the race will soon be hurled.
PART TWO.
THE PRESIDENTS.
When he the nation's heart had won,
The chair was filled by Washington,
The second star to rise so high,
Was Adams, in a morning sky.
The next, when we the records trace,
Is Jefferson, to fill the place,
Then Madison the people raised,
Till Monroe came in to be praised.
John Quincy Adams next was found,
To steer the "Ship of State" around,
Till Andrew Jackson was possessed,
To hold the reins as he thought best.
Van Buren then, was honored so,
And Harrison came next below;
John Tyler to the place awoke,
Who later was displaced by Polk.
With firmness Taylor held the prize,
Till Fillmore filled the peoples' eyes,
Then Pierce was taken by the hand,
And made the foremost of the land.
Buchannan to the chair was led
In quick succession, it is said,
Abe Lincoln's worth then caught the air,
And ushered him into the chair.
To Andrew Johnson came the call,
To be the president of all,
He held the post till Grant was made,
The nation's president instead.
The nineteenth man was R. B. Hayes,
James Garfield next, my history says,
Then Arthur was the nation's chief,
Till Cleveland came to his relief.
The twenty-third was Harrison,
And Cleveland came again as one,
Who knew the ropes and held the sway,
Till bright McKinley won the day.
The twenty-sixth was Roosevelt,
Whose arm of steel wrong-doers felt,
He struck a blow at prejudice,
And brought the country up to this.
DUTY, or TRUTH AT WORK.
Interlinked is truth to duty, have you had the precious thought, 
That the truth in bringing blessings is with duty ever fraught?
Duty is the truth in motion, all its powers put in frame,
Working through a vast creation, things of God in virtue's name.
Duty scales the highest mountains, fathoms out the deepest sea,
Gets the scope of starry heaven, catches whispers of the lee,
Opens mysteries of nature, finds recesses of the soul,
Wheresoever truth is founded, faithful duty finds the goal.
'Tis a sin against your Maker, 'tis a crime against mankind,
To yourself it works an evil which the end will surely find,
It deserves the scholar's contempt and the frowns of all the rest,
If a precious truth is harbored and concealed within your breast.
If you part the truth from duty then a curse attends your way,
Wrong enthroned will hoist his banner working evil all the day,
Grasp the truth and cling to duty, yea, unite them into one,
And a crown of life awaits you when the things of time are done.
A LEGAL MOUSE.
A lawyer had a legal mouse,
A naughty one they say,
That took possession of his house.
And papers ev'ry day.
His books and records it would gnaw,
Without regard for loss,
Its disrespect and lack of awe
Just kept the owner cross.
When no revenge the man could get,
His anger blazed so high,
Till he declared when next they met,
The mouse would surely die.
The murder, all the world should know,
He planned with ire intense,
To strike the mouse a fatal blow
And call it self-defence.
One day the desk he opened wide,
The mouse in regal state,
Sat in a pigeon hole, inside,
In style the scene was great.
A stroke the lawyer at it gave,
A start it made to flee.
Into a hole its life to save,
To find security.
When he had guarded well the hole,
It scrambled for the floor,
Again he kept it from the goal,
Its life endangered more.
The door of hope he seemed to close
Upon the enemy;
Its feelings then, nobody knows,
Its longings to be free.
Up through his sleeve it made a break,
In search of freedom sweet;
His arm he then began to shake,
To bring it to his feet.
His cuff was thrown away, no doubt,
The button had to go;
His coat and vest he tore about,
The mouse had scared him so.
All o'er his body, too, he felt
The mouse, though such a prig,
Himself he then began to pelt,
To yell and dance a jig.
His thoughts he threw around his will,
The same he had not made;
He felt uncertain which would kill,
Such terror was displayed.
The neighbors and the police heard
The noise of that affray;
And to the spot, without a word,
They quickly made their way.
Upon his back, between his shirts,
The little mouse was found.
'Twas hard, amid so many flirts,
To bring it to the ground.
Out of his coat, upon advice,
He came, with haste replete.
The room-door opened in a trice
And made good his retreat.
The mouse was taken from its place
Of hiding and of dread,
So painful was the last embrace,
It fell down by him-dead.
Then to the crowd the lawyer said,
"Of such, my friends, beware,
Mine enemy, the mouse, is dead,
Such things we all can spare.
"The killing, in my case, was one
Of self-defence, 'tis true;
And, on the whole, I've only done.
As other men would do;
"But still, my hands are red with blood!
That mandate, 'Do not kill,'
Prevents the waters of the flood
From washing off the ill."
To all who shall the story read,
And many will, I trust,
Don't kill a helpless mouse, I plead,
Unless the killing's just.
WHY WE MEET.
Why have crowds as magnets drawn
Men to meet, since nature's dawn?
Why did loneliness embrace
Adam, father of the race?
Why did twelve disciples dwell
All together? Who can tell?
Why, at intervals, do we
Gather round the festal tree?
Annual picnics, how can they
Cure the heartache? Tell me, pray;
Grand receptions, sweeter far,
Tell me what their missions are.
Seeking pleasure, killing pain,
Making mirth and gladness reign,
Anguish swoons and sadness quakes
At the sound that laughter makes.
Jollity, with happy mien
Chases trouble from the scene;
Joy, increasing as it flows,
Drowns a multitude of woes.
Thoughts offensive fear and fly,
When good-will is passing by;
Sunlight dancing with delight,
Cares will vanish at the sight.
Love-its gentle strokes are such,
Grief is crippled by the touch.
Sorrows deep we bury here,
In a casket of good cheer.
Peace enthroned, with regal sway,
Drives the dullness far away;
Round the festal board of life,
Naught should come that's born of strife.
Why do people love to meet
And enjoy themselves complete?
'Tis the ruling hand of fate,
That is why they congregate.
A DIALOGUE.
(Club)
Our cup of joy was overfilled
   When thou didst join our throng;
But now, alas! our hearts are chilled,
    By voices loud and long;
They give us all to understand
That soon we'll take thy parting hand.
(Parting Member)
Cease to repine; my thoughts will turn
   To all my friends of yore.
Dame Fortune's charms will never spurn
   The thoughts I have in store.
So long as love entwines the heart,
Sweet mem'ries bloom, though we may part.
(Club)
Thy voice was music to our ears,
   Thy loving smile gave light,
Thy self-possession calmed our fears
   And helped us do the right;
Thine absence we will keenly feel,
As o'er our path the time will steal.
(Parting Member)
Till love is taken from the cost,
   Till hatred reigns in might,
We never count a thing as lost,
   Though far removed from sight;
In love my voice will ring with cheer,
The echoes of this place so dear.
(Club)
That all thine efforts bring success,
   Will be our constant prayer,
Thy joys, we hope, will not be less,
   In other climes than here.
Accept, we pray, this little task,
Forget us not, is all we ask.
(Parting Member)
We form a part of all we meet,
   As blessing or as ban,
As light or darkness to the feet,
   We fill Dame Nature's plan.
So in my actions will be seen,
Reflections of this place serene.
LELA'S CHARMS.
(A Song.)
Dear Lela is my joy and crown,
   My brightest gem and sunshine, too,
Her sweetness often kills a frown
    And plants a pleasure where it grew;
Her voice my soul with rapture fills,
Her sparkling eye my being thrills.
Chorus.
Priceless, darling Lela,
   Thou alone my heart can cheer;
Q, my precious Lela,
   How I love thee, Lela, dear.
She helps to roll away the stone
   Of envy, pride, and self-conceit,
To raise my virtue to a throne
   And crush the evils at my feet;
She brings my wounds a healing balm,
And for each tempest proves a calm.
Her purity and loving smile,
   My pains dispel, with all that harms,
My better nature all the while,
   Responds in full to Lela's charms.
When cares of life have made me sad,
One look upon her makes me glad.
The richest diamond of earth
   My darling is to me, my friends;
No tongue can tell her matchless worth,
   Before 'tis told, the language ends;
My greatest spur to do the right,
Is when dear Lela comes to sight.
WHISPER WORDS OF LOVE TO ME.
(A Song.)
Tell me of thy heart's devotion,
   When the sun has gone to sleep,
While the moon-beams kiss the ocean
   And the stars their vigils keep.
Chorus.
Whisper softly, whisper gently,
   Sweetest words of love to me;
Whisper so my heart can hear it,
   All thy tenderness for me.
In the sunlight or the shadow,
   On the mount or in the vale,
Tell me in the wood or meadow,
   That thy love can never fail.
Tell me, though life brings its changes-
   Winter, summer, spring or fall—
That it ne'er thy heart estranges,
   That thy love will brave it all.
THE PRICE OF DISRESPECT.
(A Song.)
   A lady's love is gained.
   And held when you've attained,
True manhood which the baser things reject;
   Kind sir, all evil hate,
   Keep truth inviolate,
For love will die when fed on disrespect.
Chorus.
   The price of disrespect,
   The price of disrespect,
The price of disrespect is loss of love.
   I warn you now, my friend,
   Consider well the end,
The price of disrespect is loss of love.
   If husband's part you play,
   Or lover's, fond and gay,
Your faithfulness to duty don't neglect;
   If e'er she finds it out,
   That you're a case of doubt,
Her love will tremble out of disrespect.
   From lofty habits choose,
   Be gallant in your views,
Your reputation evermore protect;
   Don't stoop to anything
   That on you shame will bring,
Don't let her pay the price of disrespect.
   Love's house whene'er you build,
   Get workmen who are skilled;
Take honesty to be your architect;
   The best of matter use,
   Dishonored things refuse,
For love will flee the home of disrespect.
   The future holds a claim,
   So build in virtue's name,
The best of tools for building then select;
   A good foundation lay,
   "Twill brave a stormy day,
Love's house will fall when built on disrespect.
EASTER
or
SPRING-TIME.
'Tis the season when nature awakes from her sleep,
When the eye that was closed to the world takes a peep,
When the blanket of snow is no longer insight–
It is lost in the warmth of the sun's merry light.
As we hark to the music of birds of the spring,
Mother Nature re-echoes the songs that they sing;
Ev'ry hue of the flowers unfold on the scene,
While the earth for herself takes a carpet of green.
When the fowls of the air, with a strange harmony,
To their mates will repair and in love will agree,
While the fish of the deep will their beauty display,
And the beasts of the field are so blithesome and gay.
'Tis the time when the angel the stone rolled. away
From the door of the tomb on a bright Easter Day,
When the Saviour of Life and of Light did arise,
And the Comforter send from His home in the skies.
Wicked self is the stone, which the angel of love,
From the door of the soul, if allowed, will remove;
And the best of a spirit that long was concealed
Will arise, and the spring-time of life be revealed.
HALLOWE’EN.
'Tis on October, thirty-first,
That streams of pleasure swell and burst,
When peace and joy pervade the scene,
While keeping watch of Hallowe'en.
On tiptoe here the wonder stands,
To catch a glimpse of other lands;
With bated breath and anxious eyes-
The herald of to-morrow's prize.
In lovely hues a spirit paints
A picture of the "Feast of Saints,"
All clustered round the festal board-
A scene time-honored and adored.
Perchance we all shall tarry late,
When such a time we celebrate,
Our stay excuse, for 'twill be seen,
We vigils keep of Hallowe'en.
We drink the sweet persimmon beer,
The raccoon fills the heart with cheer,
The 'possum hearkens to the sounds,
Of hunters with their horns and hounds
The juveniles their bonfires raise,
The band melodious music plays,
We duck for apples in a tub,
While drums are beating, rub-a-dub!
To some a partner comes for life,
A husband, or a loving wife,
In divers ways, with happy mien,
We spend the time of Hallowe'en.
CHRISTMAS EVE.
The smilax in our homes entwine,
   With mistletoe and holly;
While fun and frolic there combine,
   To help us all be jolly.
The sound of crackers on the ear,
   Amid the flash of rockets,
"Old Santa" comes, with things of cheer,
   For little children's pockets.
The scent of baked meat fills the air,
   The smaller fry including,
While pastry's odor, everywhere,
   Is on the smell intruding.
The poorest beggar, in the streets,
   Procures the season's plenties,
For once in all the year, he eats
   His fill of Christmas dainties.
The days of cold, of sleet and snow,
   Bleak winter is the season
For tides of mirth to ebb and flow,
   While Christmas brings the reason.
BIRTHDAY WISHES TO A PHYSICIAN.
Birthday greetings
From a friend,
All thy meetings
Peace attend.
Time extended
Be thy store,
Bliss appended
Evermore.
Did the flowers
Born of May,
From their bowers

On the air,
Flowers springing
Everywhere.
Chanting gayly,

Make the day we
Celebrate.
Where's the doctor?
Can you tell,
How she make her
Patients well?
Soul of beauty,
Day by day,
To her duty
Hies away.
With the sickest,
Day and night,
In the thickest
Of the fight.
Heaven's treasure
Be thine end,
Is the measure
Of a friend.
·
BIRTHDAY WISHES To A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL.
We turn aside from everything,
   We spurn all other meetings,
And by our presence here we bring
   To thee our birthday greetings.
'Twas on the twenty-seventh day,
   The month of February,
When thou, imbued with prospects gay,
   Began thy life so merry.
Thy purity and kindness, too,
   Thy God-like conversations,
Thy hold upon the good and true,
   Bring peaceful revelations.
May love like sunbeams fall on thee,
   To chase away thy sadness,
When sorrows linger may they be
   O'ershadowed by thy gladness.
May many years be thine to live,
   And to thy life be given,
The highest blessings earth can give,
  Then later-rest in heaven.
BIRTHDAY WISHES To A HUSBAND.
May the saddest memory
   Of thy past life faint and die,
Ev'ry sorrow, here shall we
   Bury in a birthday pie.
Thine a future that is bright,
   As the crystal be it clear,
Ever standing for the right,
   Truth and purity revere.
May thy life a blessing prove
   To thyself and all with whom
Thou shalt meet in bonds of love,
   All the universe the sum.
Many years be thine to live,
   Filled with deeds that cheer and bless,
Thine the highest hope to give
   Greatest joy and happiness.
April showers brought the day,
   Thirtieth the special one,
In the midst of flowers gay,
   Was thy precious life begun.
Nature smiles with all her strength
   On the day that gave thee birth;
May the days of greater length
   Laugh to own thee, son of worth.
Heaven claims thee as her own,
   Life bequeaths the legacy,
With the saints around the throne,
   Live and reign eternally.
ACCOMPANYING A GIFT.
(A Quilt.)
One whose love will never end,
May this present, from a friend,
Bring to thee refreshing sleep,
While thy spirit angels keep.
Peaceful may thy slumbers be,
From the cares of time set free,
Till the dream of life is past-
Till we meet at home at last.
ACCOMPANYING A GIFT.
(From Patient to Nurse.)
From thy patient, who while here
Thou didst nurse with tender care-
May thy days of pain be few,
Faithful Rose, continue true.
Pleasures manifold be thine,
Radiant with light divine,
Friends of worth to thee be given,
Till we meet at home in heaven.
THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.
(A Song.)
We have grown a tree of knowledge, "Worthy Claflin" is the name,
It is rooted down in Orangeburg to foster wisdom's claim;
We have souls among its branches, rising up to deeds of fame-
The tree is growing on.
Chorus.
We will shout, hurrah for Claflin!
Gayly shout, hurrah for Claflin!
We will shout, hurrah for Claflin!
   The tree is growing on.
In the faculty and teachers we have dressers of the tree,
In the soil they find in student life they labor faithfully;
While the president in kindness all the work will oversee-
   The tree is growing on.
Winter spends in preparation gaining strength–the proper thing–
Growing each and ev'ry season, always blooming in the spring,
Bearing forth its fruit in summer while the falls the harvest bring-=
   The tree is growing on.
'Tis the day we call commencement makes the tree of knowledge bloom,
Graduates a class of students, thus for others making room.
As their spring of life is given, noble things the sight will loom–
   The class is moving on.
Graduates begin their summer, active life the same we call,
The results that come from labor always brings to them the fall;
For in life will come a season only once, 'tis then for all–
   The time is passing on.
As a Christian tree of knowledge, spreading branches all around,
With a change for good in people wheresoe'er the shade is found,
Evil dies within its presence while its righteousness abound–
   The tree is growing on.
WHAT WE TEACH AT CLAFLIN.
If you'll listen for a moment, I will tell you now, my friends,
What is taught at dear old Claflin, when your child that school attends,
I will picture all departments, if you'll use your mental eyes,
How the best of education comes to ev'ry one who tries.
In the handicrafts we train them; ev'ry boy must learn a trade,
Architecture, sloyd and drawing, yea, how furniture is made;
Engineering, ironworking, carpentry, and how to print,
Painting, masonry, wheel-wrighting, tailors made without a stint.
Girls are taught domestic science, coupled with domestic art,
Such will give them independence, which is far the better part;
Cooking, sewing, millinery, needlework, and making lace,
Garment-drafting; Thus we teach them how a busy world to face.
Here we teach them vocal music, and in harmony, so plain,
In the best of composition we your girls and boys will train,
Winded instruments we teach them, and the stringed ones, if you like,
On the organ and piano how and when the keys to strike.
We've a grammar school, a normal, and preparatory, too,
With a college as the cap-stone of the courses --this is true–
We've theology for preachers and we boldly take the stand,
That of Negro schools, our Claflin is the foremost of the land.
Now, the matter of religion we have given equal stress,
Education's never finished when it stands or something less.
Here we teach the Bible daily, and we urge a change of heart,
Heart, with hand and head is needed when life's journey one shall start.
Education that's harmonious, training all the parts of man,
Is the kind we give at Claflin, and I'll show you here the plan.
Heads when trained to do the thinking, hands to dignify the work,
Hearts when rightly trained for worship seldom will a duty shirk.
CLAFLIN'S ALUMNI.
Though the cunning of the Indian and the Zulu's thirst for blood,
And with giant strength of Hercules we find ourselves imbued,
They would fail to make a manhood that would reach the highest goal,
For the measure of true manhood is the standard of the soul.
Isaac Newton, Galileo, nature's secrets did unlock,
Many more with equal splendor in the same have taken stock;
Though their souls have crossed the river and are gone, still now we find,
That the standard of their manhood has been measured by the mind.
From this grand association comes the Websters of our day,
And Demosthenes of power shall his eloquence display;
Till the Commonwealth shall tremble with emotion, and exclaim,
"We have names of worth from Claflin, written on the scroll of fame!"
May the leaven of a Luther be imbedded here in peace,
That will cause a transformation to begin and never cease,
Till the ignorance and vices that have bound a struggling race,
Shall be banished from their strongholds and to higher things give place.
Faithful spirits, like Hugh Miller's, as a martyr's we should prize,
For the Bible and geology, he died to harmonize,
Prize religion and biology that Drummond taught as one,
Making laws we find in nature, simply laws of heaven begun.
With the valor of an Ivanhoe, on horseback or on foot,
In a battle of the intellect with minds of great repute,
Armed with sword of mental quality, and lance of learned skill,
We will banish all opposers from the lists, with hearty will.
It is said by those who know just how to value and compare,
That our "Claflin is the leading school for Negroes anywhere,"
It is left for us to prove it or to falsify the same–
Let no one in this alumni stain our Alma Mater's name.
From increasing of advantages this lesson we should learn,
That they make us more responsible for things of life in turn,
We, the chain of superstition that the centuries did forge,
Must attempt to break asunder and a race of people purge.
May each graduate of Claflin be a hero in the fight,
Helping kill the hydra-headed giant wrong against the right,
In the battle all must enter, for we find no neutral ground,
Let each one in this alumni on the side of right be found.
May this grand association ever live and never die,
Till transformed into the region of the sweetest by-and-by.
Then with angel voices blended in a pleasing harmony,
Chant our Alma Mater's praises through a bright eternity.
SOUTHERN WORK of DR. AND MRS. L. M. DUNTON.
To the Palmetto State, in the year 'seventy-three,
In October he takes him a wife,
And as pastor of Beaufort a church near the sea,
They begin on their journey of life.
In a short while to Greenville they hie to locate,
And the church of the town oversee,
The religion and life of their flock regulate,
And the years of their stay number three.
Then to Charleston they go as a power for right,
There for three years they live on the main,
There they struggle with darkness—that demon of night-
And to Greenville they hasten again.
As the pastor in charge for one conference year,
Then as elder is made to preside,
O'er the district of Greenville; his wife with him here,
Makes addresses to children beside.
The grand lecture for young folks entitled "Stepped On,"
Say the people her finest address,
Though delivered in years that are long, long agone,
It as yesterday still does impress.
When the years three amount in this work then they come,
As the president Claflin adores,
As preceptress and model, as queen of the home,
Training young folks to live, by the scores.
'Mid the calm and the storm in the sunshine and rain,
They are faithful to every trust,
By their labors we keep in prosperity's train—
Claflin's flag never trails in the dust.
May the sun ever shine in their pathway on earth,
And may Claflin continue to be,
A reward for their labors, momentous in worth,
Greatest blessing from mountain to sea.
DEDICATION DAY POEM.
(Slater Manual Training Building, Claflin University.)
'Twas the angel of Eden, to Adam he said,
"By the sweat of your brow shall your body be fed";
In the palmiest days of the Hebrews they made
It a law for the boys each to master a trade.
In the time of the Saviour this mandate as true,
And He sanctioned it all as the Son of a Jew,
Even Paul, the apostle, was the maker of tents,
With his own bright example made labor's defence.
'Twas by work of the hands that the black Washington
Rose to eminent heights and the victory won
Over prejudice dark, and in gold wrote a name
That forever will shine on the pages of fame.
Now in Africa, England and schools of the North,
They've adopted his methods because of their worth,
Giving Negroes a weapon stern prejudice to kill-
How the world to them bows when they labor with skill!
Tell me, why do we meet on this hallowed spot?
'Tis a tribute to labor we pay, is it not?
Yea, for this we have come and the day cele- brate;
Slater building completed we now dedicate.
Time will give to the race from this building so grand,
Workmen equal in skill to the first of the land.
Make the most of it, boys, tell it out, prove it true,
And the eyes of the nations will open to you.
Ne'er a king on his throne in his glory was found,
In the hearts of the people more truly was crowned
Than the workman, who toils in the strength of his might,
From the dawn of the day till the coming of night.
No, the mandate of Eden has ne'er been repealed,
But with each generation its force is revealed;
It has lived through the ages of time up to now,
That your bread must be earned by the sweat of your brow..
Education complete that forever will stand,
Must embody the head and the heart and the hand,
Making workmen, indeed, who approach the sublime,
In a work that will live o'er the river of time
LINES TO A GRADUATE.
Written for a reception given in honor of the
Orangeburger who graduated in 1904.
In ev'ry race, in ev'ry clime,
In ev'ry rank or station,
The people always take the time,
To honor education.
How nice it is to graduate
Our thoughts and actions elevate,
It gives us leaders who will stand,
For truth and right on ev'ry hand.
PART THREE.
THE BIBLE.
Read the Bible, it will tell
How in life to journey well,
Wondrous things ye shall behold,
In the law of God, we're told.
If in pleasure or in pain,
Having loss or getting gain,
Joy or sorrow; ye shall find
Blest examples of the kind.
It will help in time of need,
Souls that hunger it will feed,
To the thirsty is revealed
Jesus Christ, a fountain sealed.
Pearls of truth in ev'ry line,
Jewels, too, in lustre shine,
'Tis with peace and pleasure fraught,
Bringing evil things to naught.
'Tis more precious, we are told,
Than the diamond or gold,
More than rubies 'tis adored-
Wisdom of the Saviour, Lord.
'Tis a mine of precious gems
Greater far than diadems,
Ev'ry gem abounds in love,
Fit for crowns in heav'n above.
Love the Bible, gentle youth,
Dive and find the pearls of truth,
Treasure thus the life divine,
Make the precious blessings thine.
Age should hearken to its voice,
And in wisdom make a choice;
Keep it hidden in the heart,
From its precepts never part.
To thy path it brings a light,
One that guides thy steps aright,
Bids the darkness turn to day,
Drives the dreary night away.
It was tried by wicked hands,
But against the world it stands,
Through all time the soul makes free,
And throughout eternity.
THE SOCIAL GLASS.
There's a serpent, namely, drinking
Wine or whiskey, beer or gin,
With man's destiny 'tis linking
All that leads to shame and sin.
Poverty will surely find you,
Worthy pride and manhood pass,
In his clutches rum will bind you—
Lover of the social glass.
When you're stricken with diseases,
Who of you are taken first?
Those who drink! somehow it pleases
Sickness thus to quench its thirst!
Don't you hear the prison ringing,
With the cries of grief and woe?
Drink! its penalty is bringing!
How the tears of anguish flow!
To the almshouse let us visit,
Naught such sorrow can surpass,
Human wrecks we trace, and is it,
That they used the social glass?
Search the mad-house, gentle stranger,
Crazed by drink, such ravings hear!
Did they risk the proffered danger,
Quaff the poison without fear?
Steal the conscience! cloud the reason!
Rob the judgment! O! alas!
This the cup will do in season,
Victim of the social glass.
All affection for another-
Daughter, father, just to think!
Lover, sister, wife or mother-
Drowns within the cup of drink!
And the wrong that's here inflicted
Ceases not, but what is worse,
Born of such the child's addicted
To the awful, awful curse!
Ten years back let's turn the dial,
Then the drunkards of to-day
Are of drinking making trial,
Mod'rate drinkers, as they say.
Mod'rate drinking is the terror,
Leading down to scenes of night,
From the path of truth to error-
Lost, to all that's pure and right.
Look upon the mod'rate drinkers
Ten years hence, what do you see?
To the eyes of all our thinkers,
They the drunkards then will be.
Rum displaces heav'nly nurture,
Deeper than the tongue can tell,
Buries honor, kills the virtue,
Leads you to a drunkard's hell.
THE CIRCLE.
The Christian constellations run,
As do the planets round the sun.
The Sun of Righteousness will shine.
Within their souls, the light divine.
Eternity has ne'er begun
To end the same will ever shun,
The arc of time from nature's heights,
The future to the past unites.
Creator of the earth and sky,
Eternal ages lives on high,
A circle grand His being makes,
The human race the same partakes.
A part of God, the soul of man,
Shall live in blessing or in ban,
Through all the ages and shall dwell
In heaven's bliss or burning hell.
The advent of our Lord was made
At David's town, in evening shade;
His Christian banner there unfurled,
The sun has followed round the world.
To His disciples, Jesus gave
The great commission-man to save-
Concentric circles was the plan,
To find a lost, rebellious man.
My witnesses ye now shall be,
Of all the works observed in me,
Ye shall begin, with loving grace,
At home, Jerusalem's the place.
Ye through Judea, next shall go,
Samaria the truth must know,
To utmost places of the earth,
Ye shall proclaim Messiah's birth.
Through Europe to our western shore,
His name the savage tribes adore;
Pacific isles have heard the sound
Of prayers and preaching all around.
The Philippines and China, too,
Are lifting up His standard true;
His banner floating west has been,
Till Palestine we find again.
And thus is made a circle grand
Around the world, a holy band
Of Christians, who in love agree
To serve the Saviour faithfully.
The God of heaven-God of earth-
Delights to give a circle's worth,
Revealing thus on ev'ry hand
Himself, that men may understand.
SYMPATHY.
Christ to seek the lost was sent,
Sympathy's embodiment;
Sent to seek a rebel soul,
With a balm to make it whole.
Heaven's greatest gift to man!
Then whatever else your plan,
Incomplete 'twill surely be
If you have not sympathy.
Man with pity views distress,
God's compassion makes it less;
He in man we'll ever see,
Shown in deeds of sympathy.
If you would the Saviour know,
On a tour of mercy go,
Help to bear a brother's cares,
And the Son of Man appears.
Inasmuch as ye have done
Good to any needy one,
From thy store of charity-
Ye have done it unto Me.
Sympathy! how sweet the name!
'Twas for thee a Saviour came,
Clothed in deep humility,
Troubled sons of earth to free.
Earth's reward and heaven's, too,
Stands reserved for workers true;
This the burden of my prayer,
Let me feel a brother's care.
THE SOCIAL LIFE.
Of the ills we daily see,
Let us cleanse society.
Look to Jesus in the sky-
Lift the social standard high.
To a proud, exalted plane,
Love of self should ne'er attain,
In the highest social creed,
Should be found a brother's need.
Through a world of sin and woe,
Doing kindness as we go,
It should be the social plan,
Thus to lift a fellow-man.
Looking to a throne of grace-
Lifting up a fallen race—
Even in society,
Jesus eminent should be.
As the planets beam so bright,
Circling, filled with sunny light,
Social planets we should be,
Of the grandest purity.
Round the Christ should we revolve,
Spreading rays of peace and love,
O'er the path by aliens trod,
Lifting strangers up to God.
Freed from social darkness here,
Heaven to meet us draweth near,
Angels chant the glad refrain,
Eden shall be pure again.
REFINING FIRE.
What a cost to be pure! did e'er strike your mind,
That the gold so much prized in the fire was refined?
That the pearls of the deep by the divers are found,
That by peril of life their successes are crowned?
Yea, the trees of the orchard the pruner must know,
If they bring forth the finest of fruit that can grow;
And the knife is applied to the vine everywhere,
In production of grapes that are luscious and rare.
So in life we are taught by the pain and the loss,
That the road to the crown is by way of the cross;
And we pass through the furnace the Saviour to gain.
For with Him, if we suffer, with Him shall we reign.
It is good for the soul that afflictions abound,
That the way of the cross is the road to be crowned;
For the adder is seen on a sunshiny day,
And before we are tried our souls go astray.
We may weep for a night, but the morn bringeth joy,
Then the songs of rejoicing our tongues will employ;
Every storm that arises at some time must end,
Then the rainbow of promise and peace will attend.
There's a pearl of great price and for it must be paid
All the treasures of earth and a sacrifice made;
On the market is placed every idol and sold,
For the Love of the Saviour is better than gold.
Ev'ry soul must afflictions and troubles endure,
As the gold must be tried so the soul be pure
As the pearl is secured at the peril of life,
So the soul in its triumph must pass through the strife.
Like the Saviour who suffered and went to His rest,
Must His servants on earth find the home of the blest,
There to tell Him the story of how in the past,
They surmounted the crosses and came home at last.
BENEFITS OF SORROW.
The trials that the Saviour bore have paved the golden way,
Gethsemane and Calvary before the Easter Day.
He chasteneth the souls He loves and scourgeth every one
Whom He receives into the fold-His will, His will be done.
For ev'ry valley there's a mount, in splendor does it rise,
The vales are deepest when the peaks most nearly touch the skies.
For ev'ry grief there is a joy, we cannot fail to see,
The deeper sorrows that we have, the richer joys there'll be.
The light afflictions that we have, for just a moment here,
Will work a far exceeding weight of love and glory there.
"Be still and know that I am God," is whispered in the ear,
"A shelter from the stormy blast, in trouble I am near."
In tribulations then rejoice, for they will patience bring,
And patience brings experience by which we'll ever sing
Of hope that maketh not ashamed as years of time shall roll,
The love of God is shed abroad by hope within the soul.
Of spirits bright and near the throne 'twas asked from whence they came,
And why their garments were so pure? The voices did exclaim,
Through tribulations they have come and washed their garments white,
In Jesus' blood, the worthy Lamb, in whom they take delight!
Each oak that braves the tempest's blast is stronger made at length;
Each trial borne in Jesus' name augments the store of strength;
Then murmur not when crosses come, such angels in disguise,
In answer to our prayers appear to wipe our weeping eyes.
O'er seas of time while troubles rage and toss our helpless bark,
When human strength is but to fail and all around is dark,
The Saviour steps upon the wave, its fury's thus allayed;
"My training school to lead thee out," He says, "be not afraid."
When clouds of sorrow hover round and rains of trial fall,
When we can do no other than upon the Saviour call,
He quickly comes to our relief and clears the mists away,
His guiding eye attends our march to realms of perfect day.
At home in heav'n, when time is o'er, no tem- pests will be seen,
But perfect joy and peace will bring a tranquil most serene,
With saints and angels round the throne we'll rest from care and pain,
And spend a bright eternity where purest love shall reign.
AFRICA.
As the sun that lights creation,
   Christ, the Sun of Righteousness,
Shall a land illume with glory,
   Filled with sin and dark distress.
Hearken to the great commission,
   Go ye all into the world,
Preach my gospel to the heathen,
   Let my banners be unfurled.
Macedonia's cry, "Come over,"
   Echoes from the slave of night,
"Bring the plan of my redemption”–
   Ninety millions crave the light.
Can we hear that cry unheeded,
   And in full contentment be?
Nay, our souls cannot be tranquil,
   Till our brothers are set free.
God requires this generation's
   Help before its day shall close,
Help to make that darkened country,
   Bud and blossom as the rose.
Missionaries, consecrated,
   Tongues of fire will surely be,
In their pentecostal showers,
   Afric's bondsmen shall be free.
Jesus led a life of service,
   Shielding others from despair;
If we'll enter such a mission,
   He will always meet us there.
Christ has borne our burden for us,
   Made His blood the ransom pay;
We should help our weaker brother,
   That he faints not by the way.
If we march around the ramparts,
   All true Christians in the band,
And reflect the light of Jesus,
   Walls of Satan cannot stand.
May the spirit of the Master,
   Counting earthly gain as loss,
Urge us to enlist the heathen
   'Neath the standard of the Cross.
MOUNTAIN TOPS.
Horeb's mountain top of old
   Held the "Burning Bush," we're told,
Moses was commissioned there,
   Israel's freedom to declare.
Sinai became the mount,
   If we have a true account,
Where the decalogue was made,
   And where Moses often prayed.
From the top of Pisgah, grand,
   Moses viewed the promised land;
Moab's plains, not far away,
   Gave to him his dying day.
David bought the thresher's lot,
   Mount Moriah was the spot,
Blood so stained his hands with guilt,
   Solomon the temple built.
Greatest sermon men record,
   On the mountain by the Lord
It was preached and gave the plan
   How to use a fellow-man.
Jesus' countenance was bright,
   All His raiment, too, was white;
Moses and Elias came,
   Visitors in heaven's name:
"This is my beloved Son,"
   Said a voice when all was done,
Peter saw the holy sight,
   On the mountain, in the night.
On the mount of Calvary,
   Jesus died to make us free,
Took His leave for realms above,
   From the Olivet of Love.
Life itself is full of hills,
   Mountains, valleys, plains and rills,
Rivers, oceans, gulfs and lakes-
   Beautiful the world it makes.
As the years of time shall roll,
   In the mountain of the soul,
God communes with ev'ry one
   Who will pray, "Thy will be done."
Horeb is the mount of call,
   To our life-work, one and all,
What the "Burning Bush" shall say,
   We should cheerfully obey.
On the Sinai within,
   All the laws of life begin,
In the Pisgah's we delight,
   Heaven's Canaan comes to sight.
Our Moriah's will resound
   With sweet music all around,
In the temple of the soul,
   Ceaseless praises e'er shall roll.
On the mountain we are changed,
   From the sins of life estranged,
Heaven's visitors attend,
   Bringing tidings of the end.
That we make on Calvary,
   Sacrifices, all agree,
Love of self is crucified,
   Every idol laid aside.
Life's ideals, pure we get,
   From the mount of Olivet;
On their pinions fly away
   To the realms of perfect day.
SONG OF THE ANGELS.
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men."
To God the highest glory-
   His kingdom shall increase,
To men the wondrous story,
   Good-will and perfect peace.
The highest God in heaven,
   The highest upon earth,
The highest service given,
   For His undying worth.
The highest in thy pleasure,
   The highest in thy pain,
To Him the greatest measure,
   To Him the greatest gain.
'Tis past thine understanding,
   'Tis past thy finding out,
Sweet peace thy life commanding-
   Such change beyond a doubt.
In perfect peace He holds thee,
   Thy mind on Him is stayed,
His holiness enfolds thee,
   When full surrender's made.
Thine implements of warfare,
   Are needed not as yore;
Thy sword has formed a plowshare,
   To learn of war no more.
The love of God has found thee,
   Thy soul has peace within,
Good-will to men around thee,
   Makes heav'n on earth begin.
Good-will to all that's mortal,
   Good-will to ev'ryone,
Till gathered round the portal,
   The plaudit comes, "Well done."
Well done, thou faithful servant,
   Thy praises to the Lord,
Good-will and peace so fervent,
   Bring heav'n for their reward.
THE CHRISTMAS TREE.
Why are candles brightly burning
   All among the Christmas tree?
Outer darkness ever spurning,
   Tell me what their missions be.
They remind us of a Saviour,
  Born to us one Christmas Day,
Who to change a world's behavior,
   Lighted up the pilgrim's way.
Evergreen we see, why is it,
   That the tree is always green?
Why should ev'ry Christmas visit
   Bring the hues we've always seen?
It bespeaks the life eternal,
   Given us by Christ, the Lord,
Points us to the life, supernal
   And the Christian's great reward.
Though in dresses torn and tattered,
   Though they're in the best attired,
Gifts to all the friends are scattered-
   Why is such a thing desired?
"Tis the highest gift of heaven,
   That those presents represent,
How, to all a Saviour given,
   That, my child, is what is meant.
IN MEMORIAM OF E. B. CLARK.
'Twas the angel of death that to us downward flew
On the twentieth of March, nineteen hundred and two;
And a brother we loved was transported away
On the wings of the same to the regions of day.
In the choir where he led must his melody cease,
For he joins in the songs of the angels of peace;
And the league that he served will his memory prize,
While he meets with a league of the saints in the skies.
Do you say he is lost? Let such words be no more;
He has left us on earth but has gone on before,
There to welcome each friend in the loveliest bond,
Till we all meet again in the sweetest beyond.
Now we read in the book known as God's holy word,
Of the saints who are blest and who died in the Lord;
How they rest from their labors, and fruits will be borne,
By their friends upon earth till they meet round the throne.
Over time's rugged sea waves an influence strong,
'Twas begun by his work in opposing the wrong,
And continued to widen till touched by the land,
Of the heavenly shore, on the Father's right hand.
He is dead to the earth and to creatures of time,
But he lives in the fields of a verdure sublime;
We shall see him again when our life-work is o'er,
In the beautiful land, on the heavenly shore.
THANKSGIVING.
Let us give thanks to God above,
Thanks for expressions of His love,
Seen in the book of nature, grand
Taught by His love on every hand.
Let us be thankful in our hearts,
Thankful for all the truth imparts,
For the religion of our Lord,
All that is taught us in His word.
Let us be thankful for a land,
That will for such religion stand;
One that protects it by the law,
One that before it stands in awe.
Thankful for all things let us be,
Though there be woes and misery;
Lessons they bring us for our good-
Later 'twill all be understood.
Thankful for peace o'er land and sea,
Thankful for signs of liberty,
Thankful for homes, for life and health,
Pleasure and plenty, fame and wealth.
Thankful for friends and loved ones, too,
Thankful for all things, good and true,
Thankful for harvest in the fall,
Thankful to Him who gave it all.

The Soliloquy of Satan.
Sovereign! Am I! By God's decree
Of Hell for all eternity,
Where joy and peace are never known,
Nor light of day is ever thrown.
My kingdom, burneth with the fire,
Will flame and burn when time is done,
When chaos and confusion reign—
Extinguished are the stars and sun.
There demons rage in strife and woe,
Enthralled like swine in my domain,
Where invocations, pleas and prayers
To God for succor rise in vain!
See how they grope within the throes!
And gnash their teeth like dogs that bite!
Then weep like orphans at the bier
When dawns on them there is no flight!
Weep, ye cursed, weep and groan!
Thy sins? Seas of tears can not atone!
Plead till the years are sepulchered!
In Hell ay, mercy hath no throne!
Heartless am I! My spirit knows
No justice, mercy, feeling, none!
Hatred and envy and dire revenge
Have come to me—my spirit won!
I laugh at misery, woe and pain
Of those, my captives, held in chain!
Ay! when the sun and studding stars
Have left their sockets waned and paled!
Still! captives will they e'er remain
In Lucifer's charnal travail.
Lucifer is called the roaring lion!
Seeking whom he may devour!
Presence o'erpowering! Bold! as the blast!
Who's never known to shrink or cower.
Accursed by Him dropped from the throne,
Where naught but love and peace art known,
Because rebellion seized my heart
And made me thrust at Him my dart!
Thou hast rebelled, proud Lucifer!
Depart! with those thy favorite hosts!
From thy imperial sacred place,
Go down in shame, ruin and disgrace!
Ay, such was true! And mine the fate!
Thrust! Through the portals, through the gate,
Down! the precipitous road to Hell,
Forever there to live and dwell!
Hell leaped for joy; her hosts proclaimed:
"Proud Lucifer droppeth to his shame!"
Reverberations; the wails, the shrieks,
The tempest struggling up the steeps!
Seethed! Surged! and burned! ten thousand folds,
The depthless sea of sinful souls!
Mine the prerogative to remain?
Nay! naught but submission to that decree
Of Him who shapes all destiny!
The author of immortality.
Ah, Lucifer, why didst thou give
The demon thralldom of thy soul
To bring down judgment on thyself,
To bar thee from the streets of gold?.
Ah! Lucifer! Behold! behold!
That vast, resplendent white-robed throng!
There once thou stood'st immaculate
In praise and eulogy and song.
Bedazzling in God's holiness, outrivaling meteoric light,
Whose fulgence pierced the dark'ning gloom,
Dispersing ebon shades of night!
Fool! Hast thou been, proud Lucifer!
To God thou yet shall bend in tears,
Brought to the gravity of thy fate
Clothed in the mantle of dire fears!
Who is this King of supreme reign
Whose throttling might holds Hell enchained?
'Tis He! my everlasting foe!
Who sinks me to these depths below.
Judge of the court tribunal high!
Oh for my place in yonder sky!
Could my entreaty move Thy will
For reinstatement 'round Thy throne,
Gladly would I flee to Thee,
Where dwell the glories of thine own.
Oh drops of mercy—dews of love
In benediction from above,
Fail on Lucifer this hour,
From Heaven's holy sacred tower.
The soul of Lucifer now weeps
With surcharged heart bleeding and torn,
In sackcloth and ashes behold! behold!
The vain proud Lucifer doth mourn!
Behold me in this sin-cursed plight!
Eternal King, disperse this night!
Cast aside the threat'ning clouds
And lead me to Thy glorious heights!
Hark! the music of the spheres!
In spotless white at God's right hand,
Float strains of that grand tribal band!
The boasts are marching! Hear their song!
Great King of Glory! Oh, how long?
How long must Lucifer remain
Divorced from the glories of Thine own?
Forgiveness can there be for me
Again to sit around Thy throne?
Doth Lucifer, like the widow, mourn?
Like swaddling babies drop a tear?
Arouse!! ye coward!! Doff!! thy fears!!
Inspire!! thy soul again to cheers!!
Away!! with retrospection now!!
Come! welcome sweet forgetfulness!
Blot!! from the memory of Lucifer,
Those season's of his blissfulness!
For every tear that I have shed,
For every plea struck from my tongue,
Summon! thy most destructive powers,
Let souls from earth this hour be flung!
Ha! again did Lucifer turn fool,
Forget himself and play the ass!
Furies of Hell burst forth anew!
Obey! the mandates of my blast!
I, the personification of all!!
That's naught but perverse to the good,
To weaken at unguarded time—
Allow myself to whine and brood!!
To think that I could condescend
To drop to humiliation's shrine,
While founts of grief and sorrows flowed
When memory didst my soul remind.
To rend my soul to depths extreme,
To fall repentant at His stream,
This vain! proud sovereign power! of Hell!!
Susceptible! to such a spell!!
Away! with all that tends to good!
Misery and torture to man for food!
Scoff!! at the pleading ones in tears
And mock! the faltering one that fears!
Let devastation fill the land!
Death! Death! ride on! Spare! not a soul!
Strike down! the unsuspecting one,
For my captivity, my fold!
Brilliance of conquest is for me!
Cursed! be the throngs of liberty!
Their freedom stirs my soul to wrath,
An effervescent aftermath.
Lucifer, rule on in infamy!
Prowl! the recesses of earth!
Barter! for the living souls,
For those as yet not given birth!
Oh, ye of Adam's progeny!
Ye knoweth not! this hellish sage,
Who thwarts the subtlest of man
To give him torture for his wage!
Oh could I seize earth in my grasp
And crush her as the potter's clay,
While o'er the battlements like swine
Behold men fall in fear, dismay!
Ay, when the judgment day shall dawn
The light from every sphere has gone,
The firmament clouds, sinks, disappears,
To be forgotten as the years,
When throttling forces seize the earth,
And fires consuming have their birth,
Catastrophe thrown to relief,
While I with cohorts gloat beneath,
Then! will my reveille break the spell,
And cohorts martialing forth from Hell,
At my dictation! mandates! all!!
Like vultures seize! bind and enthrall!
Oh when ye plead and cower in tears,
Receive ye then my mocks and jeers!
I'll sink thee to the depths unknown,
Reward for sinful deeds, thou'rt sown!
Then, will my soul well to the heights,
Where bliss is law! where bliss is might!
Quickened by misery, woe and pain
Of groveling souls in my domain!
Away! Away! No reasoning power
Could change this demon for one hour!
Well might'st thou try to move God's throne,
As try to touch this heart of stone!
Such! is the law of Lucifer!
Written in blood of suffering souls;
Inexorable, unmoved am I
As He who thrust me from the sky!
In Memoriam.
TO THE LATE PAUL L. DUNBAR.
God from His glorious throne looked down,
And plucked him as the blushing flower;
Solemn as death, grieveous and awed,
Was made a grateful race that hour.
This is a debt we all must pay—
The rich, the high, the low—
The exit from this world to that
Of happiness or woe.
'Tis for the soul of spotless white,
Cleansed pure as Heaven's holy spheres,
To walk the streets beyond the void
Bereft of sighs, bereft of tears.
Brilliance of mind beyond discount,
The birthright of this noble son,
Forged verse which moved the hearts of men,
And brought him laurels truly won.
Deeds of potency and power
Wrought he 'mid clouds of dire dispair,
Upon successes sun kissed heights
He found at last a welcome there.
Verse flowed as magic from his pen,
Encouching sweet and beauteous thought,
Of negro life before the days
When struggling men for freedom fought.
As long as history endures
He there shall find abiding place;
Plaudits and honor e'er for him—
The greatest poet of his race.
Not in monumental stone,
Not in history alone,
But in our loving, grateful hearts,
He there shall live—shall find a throne.
Bury him in a hallowed spot,
Where devastation cometh not,
In a picturesque vale where nature in sublimity
Stands out in wondrous bold relief,
The enshinement of him
Whose life was brief.
Meditation.
TO CAPT. WALTER S. THOMAS.
We gaze upon the shining orbs
That guild the depthless welkin dome,
Survey that grand etheral space where countless hosts angelic roam,
Where symphonies, rhythmical songs,
The chants, the lays, beyond compare,
And ask in wonder what is man's fate?
Has he a blissful future state?
Creations of the Divine hand
Tell us above all worlds doth tow'r
The King of Kings with sovereign pow'r
Where e'er He wills disposing night,
Guiding the worlds in their swift flight.
Ay, man reads in the rocks, the hills, each blade of grass,
The flower, the murmuring stream, the truth personified—
"Futurity" for they the just, the pure, the glorified.
Thus man lives on and on,
Prophetic of the robe, the crown,
Sublimities which have no bound,
The Jasper walls, the Heavenly throne,
The universe's foundation stone.
He Is Not Dead
TO THE LATE REV. JAMES POINDEXTER.
Weep not! He is not dead—
'Though sepulchered, the tenement of clay,
The severance of the silver chord
Means but new birth to live alway.
Decrepit, so made by fleeting years,
Fatigued, with faltering step
He climbed life's weary way,
Beyond the enshrouding mists
His soul cleaves the vaulted skies,
Merged in the realm of supernal day.
The great white throne embellished with
The choiring throngs resounding
With the rhythm of spheres,
Welcomed this soul that took it's flight
From earth 'mid grief and falling tears.
Indelibly stamped upon life's way
He left his impress for his race to live
When stars grown ancient dismissed from vaulted skies
With fulgent suns sink no more to rise.
Gilded upon the heavenly scroll,
Fulgent as the spheres that roll
Onward and onward through space,
His sacred name there finds its place.
The shedding of Christ's blood on Calvary
Was for such as he, who lived the life
The great tribunal approbates, that swings awide
The golden gates.
Soft Falls the Night.
Soft falls the night—
And chases 'way
The slowly dying
Summer day;
The sun from his
Ethereal height
Is curtained
By the shades of night.
Soft falls the night—
The birds that tune
Their songs to nature
In commune,
Now hush their lays,
Seek silent rest
Within their downy,
Leafy nests.
Soft falls the night—
The starry hosts
Creep 'cross the dome
Like silent ghosts;
And on and
Like sheep they stray—
Within their wake
Cast silvery rays.
Soft falls the night—
A peaceful sleep
O'er earthly mortals
Doth now creep;
They rest now from
Their day's pursuit,
The world is still!
The world is mute!
Soft fails the night—
The verdure green
Now glistens with
A dewy sheen;
The flowers droop,
Their petals close,
They dream away
In sweet repose.
Soft fades the night—
Lo! breaks the dawn!
And Nature 'wakens
With the morn;
Exultingly sends up
Her lays,
Her symphonies
To God in praise.
Freedom For All! For None No Thrall!
Columbia! Before thy shrine we bow,
List to our humble pleading now!
For deliverance mortals weep, commingle mute.
Our souls are weighted down with woe,
Which aggregate a mighty cross,
Lend us thine ear in reverence,
Let not an humble plea be lost.
Sad is our plight, dismayed we grope,
The lowering clouds in secret might
Conspire to hide becloud Hope's sun
That shines upon yon thrilling heights!
Bliss is the goal for which men strive
That state, bereft of sighs and woes,
Where things congenial e'er survive,
Where all are friends, where none are foes!
Thou'rt crowned with glory unexcelled;
The world has acquiesced in awe,
That thou art mighty in thy power,
Most potent is thy word and law!
Thine is the power, to burst the thrall,
And free thy sons from black'ning pall,
That they may stand like men of old,
Proud they are of thy mighty fold!
God did'st Himself ally with thee,
To set His sons and daughters free!
He approbates no color line!
Be just to all mortality!
Let justice ring from every height!
Teach men to lend an ear to right!
Black's no disgrace—God made us all!!
Freedom for all! For none no thrall!
Patriot ardor thrills the breast
Of every noble son of Ham!
Let not thy banner mean to him
A reverie, a mock, a sham!
They've trod the field in battle's might—
And when thy elation sounded, "Fight!"
Forward! was their battle cry,
For they believed thy cause was right!
High on the heights of liberty,
Where floats thy banner on the air,
Our noble sons fought, bled and died!
'Mid glory helped to place it there!
Goddess, thy sacred tears
Triumphant as the years,
Give us the help for which we're cried,
Thrill us with the ecstacy
That makes the soul feel edified
Reminiscence.

An' de night cums 'roun',
Not er heaben light's er flicker,
An' de road keeps er windin'
An' de gloom gits thicker,
Hab patience, bruddah!
Dis am er worrul ub triboolayshun;
It's thorns ez well ez roses
Fo' de white an' blackes' nation.
Ef yo' stiff in de ankle,
Yo' kin hardly make er wobble,
An' yo' hea'ts sick an' achy
Dat it bahly makes er throbble,
An' yo' plight gits wussah
Kaze de trouble cums dubble,
An' it fills yo' wid discouragement
Lak de gasses fills er bubble,
Hab patience, bruddah!
Dis am er worrul ub triboolayshun;
It's thorns ez well ez roses
Fo' de white an' blackes' nation.
Joy.
TO MRS. HENRY LINDEN.
Dey's nuffin' lak joy,
An' dey's nffin' lak shout
To drive erway de trouble
An' to shuffle out de doubt!
To stimmerlate er fellah
An' to jossle out de bone,
De pains, de aches an' stiffness
Lak er fiddle's aftah tone.
When de joy cums in,
An' de gloom goes out,
Er fellah's bound to sing,
'Bound to whis'le er to shout.
Ef he hain't mighty kyarful,
Matters not ef he's er deacon,
He'd step er little shottisch
Ef he'd hyear er fiddle squeakin'.
It brings out de smile,
An' it 'sperses 'way de frown,
An' lifts up de heart
Wid de burden bowed down;
An' yo' gloom an' yo' trouble
Roll erway lak er stone,
An' de song ub rejoicin'
Takes de places ub de groan.
It's effect erpon de soul
Am prezaxly lak de rain
Dat falls erpon de verdure
An' dat draps erpon de grain.
It 'vigorates an freshens
An' it tones de system up,
An' you drink to ovahflowin'
Wine fum life's enchantin' cup.
It doan cost nuffin',
Jes ez free ez am de air;
Ez free ez am de Gospul,
It's yo' pribbellidge to share.
Try er little, bruddah,
Try to git into de charm;
Ef it doesn't do yo' good,
It sho' woan' do yo' any harm.
Yearning.
TO MR. J. T. RICKS.
When de moon streams down
On er kam still night,
Let me sot by de moss-cubbahd stream,
An' plink out de ditties ub mah ol 'banjo,
While mah soul steals erway in o' dream.
Jes' git out dah whah de solemness come,
Whah de kentry am still ez def;
When de honeysuckles sleep an' dey hide deyselves,
An' de li'l winds blo' dey bref.
Whah de bullfrog hollers neef de ol' pine tree,
An' de kill-dee an' de lonesome quail call,
Whah de owl hoots slo' as de moon draps lo'
Ez de night shades slip an' fall.
Whah de willers hang lo',
An' dey 'pear to weep
Ez de night bird's plaint come down,
An' de li'l brooks skip in jubilee
While murmurrin' out dey sound.
Dat am sech er place whah I longs to be,
When de night am still an' kam;
When all de worl' seems los' in def
An' lef' yo' whah yo' am.
Sad Am de Night.
TO DR. F. W. WHITE.
Sad am de night. Now de solemn tone
Creeps fum de erf to de heaben's throne,
Whah de stars an' moonbeams break forth bright,
Fo' to crown de worrul wif er sof', sweet, light.
Sad am de night. Now de lonesum, owl
Hoots 'cross de main to er fren'ly fowl,
An' de zephyrs sigh, and de cricket call
Fum de root an' branch and de vine-clad wall.
Sad am de night. How de heaben's pause,
Ez ef to ketch firmer hol de cause
Ub dis strange meanin' up whut am meant
Ub dis rapt silence an' sad content.
Sad am de night. Fum de sacred heights,
Whah gem sublime dem gran' strange lights,
I hyah de angels white robe throng
Now break forth saint in reverent song.
Sad am de night. Lurks er feelin' strange
Dat seemz to hah er boundless range.
It takes yo' back to olden days,
When fleet foot youth lent blissful rays.
Sad am de night. In letters bold
On night's great tablet am enscroll'd
Dat tells erf in er prophetic way
Ub dat eternal heabenly day.

[Mrs. Henry Linden] 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY. 
     I was born September 22, 1859, under the British government in Canada, fourteen miles from London, and lived there to the age of eight, when my parents brought me to the states. We first went to Kentucky, Campbell county, where my grandfather lived at that time— my father's old home place. 
      My father was born in slavery. He ran away before the war, when only a boy, and went to Canada, where of course he obtained his freedom.  
     My mother was a Canadian. She had a good English education and taught school, and when my father went back to Kentucky it was a brand new thing to see a negro teacher, and it did not set very well with the rebels iu those days, so they ordered my father to take his family and leave Kentucky; but as slavery was over and he was free he thought that he had a right to live where he pleased, and declined to go. However, in a short time we were compelled to go to save our lives, as those rebels were preparing to burn us out. The powder had been placed under the house during the absence of our family on Sunday, and every arrangement was made to burn us out, but one of the gang weakened and turned state's evidence. That was all that saved us.  
     So then we left Kentucky and came to Ohio, where we have remained ever since. We first went out on a farm two miles from Richmond, Ohio, where we remained for two years (Lockland, Ohio). Then my father obtained a good position as foreman for two real estate men. As he was not a scholar and could not write, the responsibilities became too much for him and he lost his mind, becoming melancholy; he was perfectly harmless, but could do no business. 
     At that time there were several small children, and as I was the eldest, although not yet twelve years old, it became necessary for me to go to work to help support the family and earn a living for myself. Of course I had very little schooling. I had to stop school and begin the hardships of life. I soon got a place to nurse, and while I was nursing I was the cook occasionally, so therefore I learned to cook so well  that when I was there six months the cook became sick and I took her place. I was then not thirteen years old. After that time I continued to cook, but my father's health grew worse and we had to leave the town and go to the country, where he grew able to work a little on the farm. With my help and a younger brother's  assistance we did very well that year. I made a good farm hand, and was glad to work and help my parents. 
     My father grew worse again, and hearing of the Delaware springs at Delaware, Ohio, we thought the water might help him, so we moved to Delaware. The water did him good, and I think added a great many years to his life. I continued cooking at very good wages. 
     Soon a Chinaman came to the town and opened a laundry. He advertised for help, making good offers to induce girls to learn the trade. I went there to work with several other girls, all were white but me. Of course my girl friends laughed at me and often called me "Chinaman," and I would feel bad, but knew that I was doing the best that I could; I took it for my share. I learned at eleven years of age to trust God; though young I believed he would bring me out more than conqueror, and he did. Some of those that laughed at me had to come to me for work when I opened my laundry, but I could not hire them because they did not understand the work. Now when I first learned the trade this Chinaman hired me to iron and polish and gave  me a dollar a day; I worked with him until he moved his laundry to Columbus, Ohio, and was  the only one working there that learned the trade thoroughly. The trade is a profound secret with the Chinese. They will pretend to teach you, but if you are not pretty sharp you will never learn. I found that out at once and  began to take advantage of every available opportunity, and would make starch at home and try it  by ironing a shirt. I also took some of the chemical that he used in his starch and had it analyzed so as to learn what it was made of, for I made up my mind to some day keep a laundry of my own, and have since done so and wag very successful. 
     My dear readers, I tell this hoping that some young girl will profit by my experience. I will give you a brief sketch of my life to the present time. 
     My home being of such an humble nature and I had to live so poorly and was not very strong, I married at the age of seventeen, and was very unfortunate in getting a husband who wa« unkind and did not support me; he was everything but a husband to me. I married against my parents\ will, so I thought as I had made my  bed hard I would do the best I could and would not annoy them any more than I could help; so I again went out to service to make a living, with a strong determination to make life a success. Discouraging it seemed that those whom I had thought were my friends proved to be enemies. 
     I lived with my first husband nearly two years. He proved to be a gambler and blackleg of the very worst type, so I thought I was lucky to leave with my life. He would sell my clothes when he would get broke, and the furniture out of the house when I would be out at work, to obtain money to gamble with. I was young and foolish, and when he would come and plead with me to forgive him I would, and work and get more things; but at last I tired of that life, and one day I came home from my work at a late hour only to find my furniture gone and all my clothes sold again, and he was not in sight, nor did he return until the wee hours of the morning. When he came I, tired and worn out with a hard day's work, was lying on a straw tick that he had left, without any cover, but the weather was warm. I will always believe that he intended to take my life, for when he came he brought another man who had just got out of the penitentiary, and was a desperate character. I called the neighbors next door, and the villian left, but my so-called husband remained, and I vowed that morning that I was through with him. As I had my living to make I would make it alone in peace. 
     He went from bad to worse until he died, but before his death he married a white woman and she grew as tired of him as I did I obtained a divorce from him, and after I applied he went to the penitentiary for stealing. 
     I worked right along, and the people I worked for were kind to me and tried every way to console me, and I never lost hope for the future, always believing that I would make my life count for something and be a credit to my race, as I have tried to live right and set a good example for the young, and asked God to guide me. I do not mean to say that I am perfect, for none of us are without fault, but have tried to do the best I could in my weakness. I have had a hard time, as everyone has that has had to struggle for a living at all kinds of work. 
      In time I had the opportunity to go to Florida as a cook, and while there met and married a gentleman who at the time was in the detective service — a railroad detective — and made his mark in the service, but was a regular spendthrift, and spent money faster than he made it, so that made me work hard again, but this time engaged in business for myself. I opened a laundry and later learned the French cleaning, and of these two trades I have made a success in life. After I had learned my trade as a cleaner I had just fifty cents to start my business with, but in six years that fifty cents made me four thousand dollars that I could see. My work was altogether for actresses and transient trade at the hotels, so the hotels and theatres have proved a blessing to me. Today I am worth several thousand dollars, living well and doing a first-class business. This is told to help some one else who may have my experience or one just as hard. 
     When I was forty-two years old I became very active in club work; although belonging to clubs for ten years was too busy to take any part in the work, but for five years have been an active worker. I am a member of six clubs and president of two of them. The clubs of which I am president are the Phyllis Wheatley and the  Friday Afternoon Study Club. The Phyllis Wheatley has adopted an orphan child, a little girl, and support her and expect to educate her if she lives. The Friday Club has under consideration a day nursery and kindergarten for colored children, for which we are working to that end and hope to accomplish in time, to the credit of the race. All the other clubs are for charity and self-improvement. 
     Five years ago we took up needlework in the Wednesday Afternoon Club, and I learned that art, and in that time have made nearly 250 pieces  of doilies, center-pieces, pillow-shams, stand-covers, sideboard and dresser scarfs, and many  smaller pieces. Also have the honor of bringing the first doily to the State Federation. Our president asked the ladies to bring some fancy work, and I was the only one who responded. 
     The club work has been very helpful to me,  and since that time I have been inspired to write  poetry. In January, 1905, I wrote my first lines;  subject, "Tell Her So," and since that time have  written forty or fifty poems. When I had written fourteen pieces I put them in print in pamphlet form and named them "Scraps of Time," selling them to the public at twenty-five cents each, and in four months sold over five hundred  of them, and am now preparing for this book. I have contributed my poems to magazines and to the daily papers in my city and abroad. I contribute now to a white newspaper, the Daily News, the people's paper in our city with the largest circulation. It is a white paper, but they print my poems and run my cut as well. 
     Now, dear readers, the reason I am giving you a little sketch of my life is to show you what you can do if you will. With push, pluck and ambition and Christ as your leader, you will make life a success. Now I am going to add my poems to this book.  
     I have two lovely boys, and believe that they will make great men if they live. 
     I have a good, kind husband. This is my third one, and he is old enough for my father. He was born a slave and fought in the Civil War, with no opportunity for schooling, but with all of his disadvantages he is a successful business man, and he does the largest transfer business in Springfield, Ohio. He has been married before and raised a creditable family of children. He was a widower for nine years previous to his  marriage to me. 
     My second husband died after a long spell of sickness, and left me with two baby boys. We were buying a home, and I was five hundred dollars in debt on it when he died, without a dollar on earth only that I worked for. Now you may imagine my position; two children, one three years old and the other five months. It took nerve and ambition to assume the responsibility, but I trusted God and came out all right. He opened different avenues in life for me. I did a paying business and was very successful. I had to keep a girl to care for my children while working at my trade. I was a widow only one year, and in that time got out of debt and bought a horse and buggy; so my circumstances were very good when I married my third husband. But he was in hard luck. He had been well fixed, but had lost it all by bad management, though I have never regretted marrying him. He is a good, kind husband and an ideal step-father. My boys fairly worship him and he does them.  
     My husband is a very useful man. He is an inventor, and has invented several useful articles that are in use today and giving satisfaction. The Linden piano truck, that is used by almost every transfer man and piano store in Ohio, is his invention; also a piano lamp that is in use, a hose union, and the window curtain rollers that are used in almost every home in the world. But with all his inventions and patent rights he has profited very little, as he sold them all at a sacrifice. Some one else is making the money out of them; he is only getting the honor of the  name. He has been in the transfer business for forty years, and is now making a success at that. We both know the art of starting with nothing and making life a success. We know what it is to toil hard day and night to make ends meet. 
     Now, dear readers, I tell you these things to encourage you through life; to show you if you have the will power and pride and ambition you will be victorious in whatever you undertake, and do not get the idea that everything is against you, for God is no respecter of persons, and man is just what he wills to be. The world is here and you must grasp every opportunity and never think any position too high for you to fill. Think more of yourself than anyone else, and have faith in your own ability, and believe that you can do what others have done, and when you are in the right just stand to fight and conquer if it kills. Though wrong puts on a stronger coat, and often shows up fight, when the battle is ended it always favors right. 
     I write a brief sketch of my life to inspire others so that they take advantage of passing opportunities. Our young should be encouraged. Instead of scolding and finding fault with them, let us who are mothers encourage the young to look up and not be content with so little. Let us teach our boys that to be men of note they must be self-supporting and take care of their families with the dignity of any race or people; and also teach them if, when married, they cannot get what is needed in their homes without denying themselves, to remember that it is manly to see the family provided for if they have to sacrifice themselves. The thing we need is more manly men and more noblewomen who will stand up for the right,  never faint or fall, and whose great abilities will demand respect from all. We live in an age of prosperity, with everything at our command if we will just keep on moving as we should, hand in hand. 
     Little did I think five years ago that the world would be reading after me, with such a limited schooling, but today the greatest men and women of my own race and others are reading my works, in this country and the old country, and giving me great praise for my ambition and helpful eflforts. The president of our own America as well as kings and rulers of the old country is applauding my work with loud praises. It is worth while to do something. What need you care for the would-be critics that are doing nothing themselves and criticize your efforts? Take new courage and "pull for the shore." My efforts were criticized, but what did I care for that. I started with that expectation, but with God as my leader I expected to win the fight in  the end.  
                          Dare to be true, dare to do right, 
                               With Christ as your leader 
                          You will win the fight. 
FOR THE GOOD OF THE PYTHIAN ORDER 
For the good of the order it behooves me to say 
That the supreme lodge of Pythians has set apart this day 
As an annual thanksgiving in a religious way; 
We must return thanks to God for his goodness. 
We appreciate the fact and do not take it back, 
That we make rapid growth and improve every year; 
The joy and comfort of doing what is right 
Overbalances sorrow and care, and today we are prosperous and happy. 
This organization has something of which to boast. 
It stands above all others this side of the coast. 
For the support of its widows and orphans this lodge does the most 
That I know, for I've tested its treasures. 
Its laws are all right and right up to date, 
But like all other good things it sometimes meets fate 
In unlawful members, and they go on at such a rate 
It almost takes a regiment to get them straight. 
But our people are learning that law must be obeyed, 
That they can no longer stand in the way; 
They must be gotten rid of and go out to stay, 
For this is for the good of the order. 
Now, dear sisters, you must have minds of your own, 
Not to let ignorant men lead you wrong, 
And when you are ditched they will laugh and sing you a song, 
"I'm sorry; you should have known better," 
But look at your law and be governed by that, 
Be united as Calaxthians and take a stand 
That you will run your order without the help of a man; 
Confide in each other—this is a good plan to have a creditable order. 
Let us this coming year live as we should, 
Each one endeavoring to make their word good, 
And set a good example to those we may hood, 
Then the courts will all grow and prosper. 
As women of our race let us look up to God 
For his blessings and trust in his word, 
And on our thanksgiving be of one accord, 
And then we will be prosperous and happy. 
TO THE WHEEL OF PROGRESS. 
Your name is the Wheel of Progress—a pleasant name indeed. 
Move on in line of progress, for that is what we need, 
The things that lead to progress are what we do and say and mean, 
We can have a world of progress if we use this term and theme. 
Now to the Wheel of Progress so cultured and refined, 
With noble thought and action, with able brain and mind,
Women of different callings and teachers of different schools, 
We feel to acknowledge you our leaders as a rule. 
Much depends on you for the future and the coming generations at lodge, 
Your teachings and grand example, though sometimes it may seem hard, 
Will bring laurels to crown your efforts 
When you go home to meet our Lord. 
And we appreciate you; yes, more than tongue can tell. 
With Mrs. Jones as president we know you will do well, 
With your various departments — charity, literary and art— 
We expect at the next Federation to hear from you a grand report. 
I have a sweet recollection of the first poem I ever wrote, 
Was read by Miss Hetty Taylor, that inspired me to be a poet, 
And of course your club I will always love for its loyalty to me; 
That proves that you believe in progress, so that encouraged me. 
May long live the Wheel of Progress, and in history may her name be found,
When her members' toils are ended and their labors have been crowned, 
I hope she will leave a record that will live and last; 
So sweet will be the memory when looking back over the past. 
Let us build a monument in something that will live when we are gone, 
That may year after year grow brighter, that time will not crumble down, 
That coming generations may look on it with pride, 
Then you will prove a blessing as club women true and tried. 
But may the gem that we make be lasting and grow as the days roll on. 
And glitter instead of tarnish until it becomes as bright as the sun, 
And coming generations will prosper from your well trained hands 
And honor the Wheel of Progress of over this broad land. 
THE Y.M.C.A. 
One of our race's greatest needs in this country today 
Is a number of well supported and managed Y.M.C.A.;
Yes, in every city and town and hamlet around 
"Where the feet of our race treads over the ground. 
Our young men need pleasure in various ways 
As well as hard labor and study all day, 
And there is no better place for them to be 
Than in some well equipped and well managed Y.M.C.A. 
And let us be awakened to the needs of today, 
And make a sacrifice to support our Y.M.C.A.,
Then our young men will have some place to play 
Simple games, and read good literature at the Y.M.C.A. 
If we would have creditable men we must rear creditable boys, 
Give them every advantage that will add to their morals, 
And let us remember in this enlightened day 
These things can all be found in the Y.M.C.A. 
As mothers of a race we must do as well as say. 
And make a strong effort to help the Y.M.C.A. 
Let the church be first to teach them to say, 
"I am a loyal member of the Y.M.C.A.”
Now to the credit of our race we have today 
In the city of Springfield a Y.M.C.A.,
With Springfield's bad name, its riot and shame, 
We have something to be proud of then—Y.M.C.A. 
Let us resolve in our hearts that we as a race 
Will do all we can in our power to replace 
The good name of Springfield to the credit of our race. 
By indorsing every good move with the Y.M.C.A. 
Now for my part I am here to say 
That I will do my whole duty by the Y.M.C.A. 
You can do as you please, but God blesses me, 
And I will make it my business to help the Y.M.C.A. 
BRAVE MAN AND BRAVE WOMAN. 
Brave man and brave woman, 
With brave and honest heart, 
And with their money will not part. 
Will make life a grand success. 
I know what it is to labor hard; 
And with pluck and ambition 
And womanly brain I ventured out 
And aspired to learn a trade. 
Of laundress and French cleaning 
I learned the trade, worked hard, 
And strict attention to business paid, 
And found it worth while to learn a trade. 
If you have no wealth, don't be sad, 
Take it for your lot, don't think it bad, 
But strive for the front with honest heart, 
And exercise your brains and hands— 
You will find this is a very good plan. 
ALL WE ASK IS JUSTICE. 
The National Federation is a grand and glorious band 
Of noble colored women that invades this land; 
They've taken a grand stand in making a demand 
For their offsprings of this land justice. 
Chorus: 
Hurrah! Hurrah! You will hear our voices ring; 
Hurrah! Hurrah! You will hear our women sing 
When they have fought the battle 
That has won the glorious prize 
That we have been fighting for so long called justice. 
We are making a great sacrifice, but mean to win the prize, 
Makes no difference what it costs us we mean to live and try 
To make the future better or we will know the reason why — 
The only thing we are asking now is justice. 
We will let the awful past alone and act as we call wise, 
We are willing to work hard and make any sacrifice 
Or do anything we can to help our race to rise, 
But all we ask at any hands is justice. 
We feel that we are right in making this demand; 
Our fathers worked and shed their blood and made this country grand, 
They have fought in every battle and are willing yet to stand, 
And all they ask this country now is justice. 
But we feel at last we have a friend in Roosevelt the president; 
He stands for right, a hero bold, as he knows all races have a soul; 
As chief executive of this land he makes this stern and last demand, 
And means it, too—for every man justice. 
As women of Ohio state we ask each state to federate,
And this will make us stronger; when every state is organized, 
And all are fighting for this prize, you will hear 
Our women cry, "We must have justice." 
 AS WOMEN OF OUR RACE. 
As women of our race we have the odds to face 
In battling for our rights; 
But we will take it for our share. 
Never murmur, never fear,
Through God we will win the fight.
God is opening doors for us,
And bids us enter in and be his guest 
In many a walk of life 
That was closed to us through strife 
By the more favored race. 
Now we may win the fight by being loyal, 
By training minds and hands, 
As mothers of this land 
To show their grit and sand 
By working hard. 
Then we will demand a place 
Side by side with any race 
In this broad land; 
Let us prepare to fill a place 
Through ambition, dignity and grace. 
ENCOURAGEMENT. 
Encouragement is what I need, encouraged I ought to be, 
Encouragement from one like you is all and all to me; 
I like to speak encouraging to any one I meet, 
I feel encouraged when I do, for they encourage me. 
We are here to encourage anything that is right; 
God intends it thus to be, and we will win a home 
That will not fade whenever we cross life's sea, 
Let us remember that encouragement belongs to God's great plan 
Of making pilgrims happy while traveling through this land— 
Then why not be encouraged when looking o'er the past 
And know it is better farther on, 
And reward will come at last. 
THE FALL IS HERE. 
The fall is here, with its brown leaves falling 
Aud its cold night winds kissing the flowers; 
Soon the flowers will be dead and the trees will be barren, 
Then we will know that summer has fled, 
And all nature around will seem asleep aud forgotten; 
Then the hearth by the fireside will welcome us home— 
We can talk, we can ponder and think of the summer. 
How we enjoyed the fragrance of its sweet-smelling bloom. 
Alas! that is not all— the winter is coming 
With its joy and its sorrow, its pleasure and pain. 
And while wandering through winter with its snow storms and freezes 
It seems but tomorrow that spring comes again. 
Then spring-time appears, aud is welcomed with gladness 
By the bees and the birds and beasts of the field; 
The flowers lift their heads to cheer man in his sadness, 
And the birds sing sweet songs of the winter that has past. 
Now our lives vary like the seasons in reason, 
We are not all alike, and how could we be? 
Some like the fall, always gloomy and chilly. 
But once in awhile the sun shines in their home. 
Now some like the winter—their lives are real stormy, 
And it seems they are always looking for spring, 
And they live in the hope of their spring-time coming; 
And their winter will end like a dream on the wing. 
Some like the spring, always glad and inviting, 
And make all rejoice as they pass through this life, 
And make one feel at home whene'er in their presence, 
While waiting to welcome the summer to dawn. 
Some like the summer, all gay like the flowers 
That put out their blossoms in the sweet month of June, 
And to meet them at home there is a glad hand of welcome 
That makes one rejoice in their summer-like home. 
 OUR NOBLE BOOKER T. WASHINGTON. 
The greatest self-made man in the world today 
Is one of our race, I am proud to say; 
Not a giant in stature, nor robust in size, 
But with brain and ambition he is noble and wise, 
           Our noted Booker T. Washington. 
By his great example and influence as well 
He has brought the world to acknowledge him; 
His noble ability, his manhood and pride, 
With pluck and ambition also applied,
           Our noble Booker T. Washington. 
Now today we applaud his great name with loud cheers, 
In churches and halls and in Congress it appears 
As well as in the schoolroom and our firesides so dear, 
To the credit of our race we handle with care 
           The name of Booker T. Washington. 
We must always remember and should not forget 
The poor little slave boy with just mother to pet, 
He struggled through life with discouragements, yet 
Determined abundance of knowledge to get, 
           Our honorable Booker T. Washington. 
Every mother in this country should teach her child 
That with pluck and ambition, through hardships and trial, 
And with strong determination and well made-up mind, 
Through hard work and patience he can be in time 
            The equal of Booker T. Washington. 
MAN IS WHAT HE WILLS TO BE. 
Man is what he wills to be—that is not a saying, but it is true; 
I have had this experience, and it may be so with you, 
Man need not worry about his fate, but let him take a stand; 
It makes no difference what turns up, I will be a noble man. 
And then be will work right to that end and every effort make 
To build a towering monument to his credit grand and great, 
And if he keeps on moving, doesn't stop to think of fate. 
He will be the lucky man that the whole world calls great. 
Then man is what he wills to be, 
Either little, much or great; 
He can make himself a world of power, 
Or bring on a shameful fate. 
I started out in life alone to win my way or die, 
To make my life count something or would know the reason why, 
And when the first effort had made discouraging and yet 
I just put on a little pluck and pushed right to the gate. 
Now it is more than a notion, fellowman, to take your place in life; 
You have got to struggle hard and make a sacrifice. 
But you feel better in the end when you look back and think 
Of all the knocks you have undergone, and now your chain is linked. 
Life is not worth living, fellow-woman, if you never have a lick, 
You can appreciate success when it comes thick; 
Sometimes I was up, sometimes I was down, and I would stop and think, 
"This world is individuals, and each must take his place," 
I would brighten up and start afresh, and say "I will win the race." 
So man is what he wills to be; God put him here to think,
Not like the dumb beast of the field, to only eat and drink, 
He gave to man a glorious gift of knowing good from bad,
That he might be partaker of the good and scorner of the bad. 
God gave man brain to think and faculties to act, 
Gave him power to sail the seas and ride upon the winds, 
To dive down in the mighty deep and bring up costly gems, 
To dig the coal out of the earth that heats and gives us light, 
And with a million other gifts I cannot name that is right. 
MAY. 
One beautiful morning in the month of May all was serene and quiet, 
The birds sang sweetly, their music a dream, and the sun shone bright; 
The flowers all in bloom with their fragrances so sweet,
And the green-carpeted earth made the picture complete. 
It was the first day of May, all nature seemed gay
And all of the trees seemed to bow and welcome the day, 
And every heart seemed happy and the bees seemed to say, 
"Do you know that winter has passed and this is the first day of May?" 
When we think of San Francisco in her terror today, 
We thank God we are living on the first day of May; 
We have lots to be thankful for, and should continue to pray 
For the sad ones in San Francisco on the first day of May. 
 PAY YOUR DEBTS. 
Everybody knows her, for they see her every day 
As she swings around the corner with that blue dress on parade; 
Though it is not all in looking, stylish clothes don't win today, 
There's nothing counts like dollars when you have your debts to pay. 
This we should teach our children, not extravagant to be.  
As our race in this country has not so long been free; 
They must take care of their money and buy homes in various ways, 
To be creditable and honest when they have their debts to pay. 
I believe in style and fashion that is not out of the way,  
I believe in home and comfort and living happy every day; 
Do not go beyond your means, makes no difference what they say, 
And after awhile you will be excluded from having debts to pay. 
Now this has been my motto, to do as well as say— 
Not teach you and practice different, but I can truthfully say 
That in my broad experience success has followed me. 
And I make a strong effort to keep the debts all paid. 
THE HOUSEHOLD OF RUTH. 
The Household of Ruth is pure friendship, love and truth, 
It will keep you in your youth if you are a good attendant; 
The law is strictly executed and lived up to by all 
Who bear the name of the noble order,
And all is well with anyone who gets into her borders. 
This organization is just what it should be, 
Its principles for right and elevation 
In carrying out the law in every form, 
And this is what will make and save a nation. 
It soothes the sister's broken heart with a loving word of cheer, 
It fills the empty pocketbook of the needy one so drear, 
It gives food to the hungry, takes care of the sick, 
Buries its dead in order and all of those things, just think. 
Why not join the Household above all other things? 
When its principles are good and pure and its works so truly great, 
Every man should be an Odd Fellow and every woman a Sister of Ruth; 
They could not do better, now that is just the truth. 
I AM AS HAPPY AS A QUEEN ON HER THRONE. 
When I watch my two boys, Walter and Robert, at play. 
It makes me think of my childhood days, 
When I used to play and skip not alone as a mother, 
      I am as happy as a queen on her throne. 
With kind husband and children and comfortable home, 
With Christ as our leader while through this world we roam, 
Who never forsakes us or leaves us alone, 
But shines as a light to beckon us on, 
      I am as happy as a queen on her throne. 
With pluck and ambition I have great success, 
I make a strong effort and God does the rest, 
I work for the future and think for the best, 
And believe that my boys will make life a success, 
      I am as happy as a queen on her throne.
Now when this life is ended on earth we love, 
We hope to make a family in the kingdom above 
Where all is joy, and peace, and love, 
And then we will kneel and give God the praise, 
      For he is our king on the throne. 
WHAT IS WOMAN? 
What is woman to the world? Has her worth been told? 
It is true she is more precious than silver or gold, 
Or rubies or diamonds; her worth cannot be told, 
For she is a most precious jewel. 
Then may it be remembered that she stands next to God, 
If she lives for Christ's kingdom to take up her abode; 
She was first at the cross and last at the tomb— 
A faithful creature was woman. 
And you will find her first in all good work, 
And then when it is done you will find her always helping, 
Too, to carry the burden of those she chances to meet, 
Or her husband if she is a wife. 
OCTOBER IS HERE. 
October is here, and the clubs begin business 
After a tweet summer's rest from club work's toil and care; 
Now afresh we begin preparing for winter, 
To make happy hearts of the sad ones dear. 
At last we thank God we are to do something to make 
The world better by helping the poor; we ask God to guide us, 
And give us ambition to bring food and comfort to many a door. 
Yes, there are children awaiting our meeting that they may have clothes 
And books for the school — they know where to get them; 
The faithful club woman are willing to give them help as a rule. 
This is our club work, to give to the needy as well as improve 
Our own minds, and to look after the sick and give homes 
To the children, and tell the poor mother to tell hers what to do. 
Now this is a great work we are doing, dear sisters, 
Come, let us be united in doing what we can for the Lord, 
Let us go hand in hand with each other, and remember as we lift let us climb. 
In a few years we will be through with our meetings,
Then we will join the happy hosts o'er there with our Lord, 
With our friends all around us and our Savior before us, 
Standing to welcome us home in the end. 
And then we will realize what good we have been doing 
When life is no longer with us on this earth; 
Let us take up new courage and hold fast to our promise, 
We will receive our reward in the over-there. 
As women of power and mothers of this country, 
We must hold fast together to lift as we climb; 
If we do not we will keep the race from uniting 
And making one strong, united uplifting band. 
GOD'S ELECTRIC POWER. 
The world with all of its thought and action 
Is run by God's electric power; 
We are God's improved invention, 
He is promoter of the hour. 
God is life and light and wisdom, 
All that lives is built on him, 
On the land and in the water, 
The very air we breathe he gives. 
Why should man be so egotistic 
When he in God's sight is so like the clay; 
But God has place for every creature 
That in creation lives today. 
He has seen fit to give us comfort,
And in peace and happiness to dwell, 
If we obey his blest commandments 
And do his everlasting will. 
Why not make our lives impressive 
By helping some one when we can, 
And feel that we are each expected 
To bring some credit to the land. 
A RIOT. 
The Riot in Springfield, Ohio, February 26, 1906. 
When all was quiet and serene, a storm broke out at the dead, 
And the roaring of pistols and firebells were heard; 
On the sound of the midnight air could be heard 
Loud voices screaming in agony great. 
"Oh, what is the matter?" you could hear someone shout; 
The answer, "My house is on fire! Someone put it out!" 
Breathless the mob ran to and fro like a scout, 
Putting torches and destruction to all that come about. 
In the still of night, as horrible as death, 
Comfortless and homeless so many were left 
Hungry and clotheless in their awful flight; 
Dear God, it was terrible at the dead hour of night! 
This lawlessness has buried Springfield's great name, 
But I hope business will go on just the same, 
With her car-load of officers with salaries to pay 
Not able to control this city today, 
And we must be disgraced with a riot. 
This is something awful in this great land today, 
Where everything is prosperous and making a way, 
To think peace is disturbed by the low and degraded, 
And impeding progress by standing in the way 
With their torches and pistols, taking the day with a riot. 
O whiskey! that great evil that is doing it all, 
But that is no excuse, let them answer the call 
Of the strenuous law that is made for all, 
And they will come to the conclusion when they have a fall 
To be law-abiding citizens and courteous to all, 
And there will be no more riot. 
 LIFE'S GOLDEN SUNSET. 
 It's a grand thing when you're old, love, 
      To have someone care for you. 
 Someone to make you happy, 
      Someone to love you, too. 
 It makes life bright and gay, love. 
      When you think of the summer flowers 
  That you used to nourish in childhood, 
      In the spring of youth's hours. 
 But oh, it's spring to me, love, 
      When I look at your earnest gaze 
  And see the rosy sunbeams 
       Upon your smiling face. 
 I would always be gay and happy, love, 
      If I had you at my side, 
 It makes me revere the moment, love, 
      When I became your happy bride. 
 But we are growing old, love, 
      Our sun of life will soon set,
 But as long as we are here, love, 
      We will bless the day we met. 
 So when toil and care are o'er, love, 
      And time with us will cease, 
 We will join that happy host, love, 
      Where all is joy and peace. 
THE PROSPECT OF THE FUTURE, 
Or The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Rules the World. 
In looking o'er the prospects of the future 
And knowing the success of the past, 
And knowing it all comes through the woman of the world,
You need not count her least or last. 
For all that you can count to your credit of being 
This or that, or making life a success, you may rest assured 
And it is true where're you go, that 
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. 
It seems that something must happen every day; 
It takes a mother's tender care to drive the blues away, 
It makes no difference how you try to keep her from the whirl, 
She will let you know that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. 
We boast of our great president and statesmen grand and bold, 
And forget it is through his mother's training 
That his name has been enrolled among noble heroes; 
Unfurling the flag and digging gold all come through 
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. 
COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS. 
If you would only stop to count your blessings 
      I think we would more thankful be, 
When we remember God is willing to give us blessings 
      When we earn them full and free. 
Do not let us stop to murmur 
      When things go wrong and make you sigh; 
Think this must come in a lifetime,
      Count your blessings, do not cry. 
If we would only count our blessings 
      How much happier we would be,
You know the loss is always counted, 
But let them go for all they will bring 
       In making happiness to thee. 
CULTIVATION. 
We should cultivate our different tastes 
And display them with modest grace; 
Though all our tastes are not the same, 
Of course we are not to blame. 
But if we pursue the different arts 
We will find a taste for something; 
No matter what your taste may be, 
Have courage to cultivate something. 
We must find a taste for something— 
Music, needlework or painting; 
Each of these arts has its charm, 
If you cultivate either 'twill do no harm. 
Each one should strive hard 
To find out what she can best do, 
And when she finds her place 
Pill it as if she always knew. 
Everybody has a gift 
If they did but know it, 
And if you cultivate some taste 
Your study will soon show it. 
I studied the art of needlework, 
And was soon adopted to it; 
And as I studied farther on 
I discovered that I was a poet. 
I then and there began to write 
And I am still sticking to it,
And some of the best critics in the land 
Have indorsed me as a poet. 
I believe in doing something good, 
Why not? It is best to do it, 
For you are adding to the world 
If you only did but know it. 
Now when we study Nature's law 
It gives us thought and action, 
Then we begin to realize 
That we are God's invention. 
TO THE QUEEN OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. 
To the queen of the British government 
We owe gratitude and love 
For giving our race liberty when coming in her gates; 
She gave every man his portion and a home beneath her flag, 
If he would be loyal and truthful, and stand up for the right. 
Oh hail, the Queen of England! She was a royal queen indeed,
She was a queen to every nation, she was the nation's need; 
She was an earthly angel, and full of love and pride; 
For crushed, enslaved humanity she was a kind and loving guide. 
Oh, that royal Queen of England! How we mourn her loss so great, 
And to ever reverence her name, when we hear it spoke, 
Of that God-given ruler, who made for us a place 
That we might flee from evil to a home of refuge safe. 
Her kingdom saved my father and gave him freedom sweet, 
And I was born her subject, a Canadian complete; 
But she has gone to the God that gave her, and we must give her up, 
But her son, the King of England, has fallen heir to her throne,
With all of the royal honors King Edward now is crowned. 
Now we hear the King of England is ill, and it grieves our hearts to know 
That the son of the Queen of England's health is very poor;  
Now, honored King of England, we love and adore your name,
For the sake of your dear old mother your kingdom I hope to hail. 
Now we hope you will recover and live for years to come, 
To make your kingdom happy as well as your royal home; 
And I hope I may live to see you, as next year I expect to sail, 
And with pride in that grand old country 
And your kingdom I expect to hail. 
Now, royal Queen Alexandria, I blush to speak your name, 
To know my life's so humble and yours the heights of fame; 
But as I am a woman and also a woman's friend, I read of you 
And loved you as if I had met you time and again. 
THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR, OR NEW YEAR'S EVE. 
 On the last day of the year we have so much to be thankful for, 
 So much we have had and so much that we should do, 
 To know that our lives have been spared here for something, 
 By One that knows the future, the present and past. 
 Let us prepare to meet the new year rejoicing, 
 To know that our lives have been spared for something good; 
 Let us make new resolutions to do more in the future 
 Than we have in the past for the kingdom of God. 
 Then each of our lives should be busy working 
 And thinking, and praying to God 
 To make the world better and men nobler and braver, 
 To take responsibilities and live up to his law. 
 We should be inspired to work for the Master, 
 In helping the sinner to come to his arms; 
 It is true this past year we have had struggles and crosses 
 As well as sunshine, and pleasure with pain. 
 But in life's weary dream this must all be expected, 
 But trusting will make the road easy to trod; 
 Then we are promised a great reward over yonder 
 With the glories and blessed in the kingdom of God. 
 When I think of our race in the past we have all things to hope for, 
 To know that God has prospered us so in the past; 
 We should be willing to trust him alone in the future, 
 And believe he will take us home when this life is past. 
THE SILENT NIGHT. 
 In the dead hour of night, 
 When all Nature is dreaming. 
 The watchman in the watch-tower 
 Is treading his beat. 
 The soft mellow breezes go out through the leaves, 
 The silvery moon peeps down through the trees; 
 It is the peaceful slumber of silent night, 
 When the earth is a most beautiful sight. 
 The countless stars in the heaven of light 
 Illumine the pilgrim's pathway bright 
 That speeds to and fro through the silent night, 
 In quest of a happier, holier plight. 
 Then he takes up new courage and travels right along, 
 The journey is long, but his faith is quite strong,
 He knows that through hardships and struggle, if right. 
 He can cheerfully pass, with God, through the night. 
      It is like a dream of a cold winter night,
           When I think of the past; 
      The storm and cloud have left the skies 
           And my pathway is clear at last. 
GOSSIP. 
 One fatal mistake that is made today is gossip; 
 Too many women, I am sorry to say, love to gossip. 
 The height of their ambition seems to be 
 To talk about their neighbor across the way 
 And to pick her to pieces as we commonly say, in gossip. 
 Find fault with her clothes, her husband or home, 
 Her style of living, her manner or brogue, 
 If not the poor girl who is struggling alone 
 To make for herself a comfortable home, 
 Or the boy that meets misfortune while through this world he roams, 
 Instead of simply gossip. 
 To gossip, my friend, is a terrible sin, it doesn’t a fortune 
 For anyone win, but makes enemy and strife, 
 And wrecks some one's life and often breaks up homes,
 And parts husbands and wives, and sometimes causes the use of a knife— 
 Then what is to blame but Gossip. 
 Now let us as club women do something else 
 To make the world better by looking at self 
 And talking of the things that make happiness and wealth, 
 And make ourselves useful for God and be blessed, 
 And be excused from Gossip. 
 OH WOMAN, BLESSED WOMAN! 
 Woman's worth to the world can never be told, 
 She is a jewel more needed than silver or gold, 
 The world could not move without her great name enrolled, 
                Oh woman, blessed woman! 
 God created woman for the helpmate of man, 
 Knowing without woman man could not stand,
 And then God devised a plan 
 To bring woman in existence from the rib of man, 
                Oh woman, blessed woman! 
 Then God caused man to take a deep sleep, 
 And then his loving commandments to keep, 
 He would create something the pride of his life 
 And would make him happy by giving a wife, 
                Oh woman, graceful woman! 
 You may find her busy in public and home, 
 In church work and club work she can plainly be seen, 
 In rearing her children each good mother a queen, 
                Oh woman, blessed woman! 
 NEW YEAR'S MORNING, OR THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR. 
 The new year has dawned and we meet it with gladness, 
 And today is a day of frolic and joy, 
 Notwithstanding some hearts are bowed down with sadness. 
 But we who are happy should pray for their joy. 
 I resolve today to make others happy and serve the great King 
 Who is supreme over all, to do all in my power 
 To make the world better by a Christian example 
 And answering when he calls. 
 This my forty-sixth New Year—I have been blest and lucky, 
 While others are gone and their voices hushed in death; 
 But I am here and spared to my family, 
 With my husband and children and friends to enjoy. 
 I look ahead away in the future, as well as thank God of love 
 For the past, to know when life is ended we have wound up 
 Our work here with hoping and trusting our Blessed Redeemer, 
 We'll bid farewell to earth and go home at last. 
 We should be careful in rearing our children and teach them the things 
 That will add to their lives, that will inspire  them to think, 
 And act for the Master, and share responsibilities of this life's great burden, 
 And feel it is a duty they must perform. 
 I could say more, though it gives me pleasure to know 
 I have lived through sadness and sorrow as well as pleasure and pain; 
 I know what it is to be sad and heart-broken, but trusting God 
 Has brought peace and happiness again. 
 LET US STRIVE TO DO SOMETHING. 
 Let us strive to do something inspiring, 
 Let us strive to do something for God, 
 Let us strive to make somebody happy, 
 For this is our duty to all. 
 Now this is the work of a Christian, 
 To lift up the weak ones that fall,
 To help them to carry their burden 
 To the Lamb that gives comfort to all. 
 Let us take heed and be anchored 
 In this Rock that cannot shake or will not fall; 
 The Savior that is always our refuge 
 Let us answer at once when he calls. 
He will be our food when we are hungry, 
 He will be our drink when we are dry, 
 He will be our peace in confusion, 
 He will take us home by and by. 
 Let us be true to each other, 
 For this is our Savior's command, 
 Strive hard to do our whole duty 
 And receive our reward in the end. 
OUR CLUB WORK. 
           To better the condition of humanity, 
      For the cultivation of the mind, 
           To tear down the walls of ignorance, 
      Then we are lifting as we climb. 
      To make sacrifice a pleasure, 
           We will see results in time; 
       If we only work and trust God 
           He will reward us after while. 
      So let us make work pleasure, 
           And never murmur, never fear, 
      But take Christ for our leader. 
           And always keep him near. 
      Now as long as he will lead us 
           Not a battle will we lose in line; 
      Then we will work and trust him ever 
           In this lifting as we climb. 
      Now, dear sisters, when we are weary 
           And all burdened down with care, 
      With the club work we have been doing 
           In the lifting others here, 
      We will bind our sheaves together. 
           As club women true and tried, 
      Then we will look alone to Jesus, 
           Who will give us our reward. 
 AN ORPHAN GIRL. 
 I am a little orphan girl. 
 My ma and pa are dead; 
 The Phyllis Wheatley mamas me 
 And gives me what I need. 
 They give me pretty clothes to wear, 
 And books to read I love; 
 May long life and success bless 
 The Phyllis Wheatley Culture Club. 
 All little girls are not like me blessed, 
 To have someone to care for them 
 When their parents are at rest, 
 But the Phyllis Wheatley has seen fit to take me in their breast, 
 THE CHURCH BELLS. 
 List, I hear the church bells ring, 
 They sound like distant music to me, 
 I love to go to church and hear the choir sing 
 The beautiful praises of God. 
 My heart is glad when the Sabbath appears, 
 Then I make preparations for church, 
 I sometimes wish Sabbath would last all the year,
 For it drives away sorrow and grief. 
 My life has been cloudy, with sunshine and rain, 
 But I will just take that for my lot, and feel that 
 I am no better than Jesus my king,
 And they crucified him on the cross. 
 SCRAPS OF TIME. 
      Time has brought about great changes, 
           And will bring as many more; 
      Now to waste time it is dangerous,  
           For time is precious, but always sure. 
      Now time is so very precious,
           Just one moment at a time,
      Then we should always improve it 
           As it gently passes by. 
      Now we will take time for pleasure, 
           And we must take time for pain; 
      And let us spend our spare moments' time 
           In brightening up the mind. 
      Let us get good books and read them, 
           So that we may be inspired 
      To put our time in something good, 
           To show what we have read. 
      Now time belongs to God the father,  
           And he deals it out to man, 
      Just as he sees fit to give it; 
           But with God time never ends. 
     But with man time has a limit, 
            And sometime it is very short. 
     But the main thing is to improve it; 
            While you have time do your part. 
      You can do that in thought or action, 
           Or in work in various ways; 
      The slave has proven this to you 
           By accomplishing something in his day. 
      He was styled alone as chattels,
           In this country now so great, 
      But time has made him famous, 
            For he put Christ in the lead. 
      Then Christ fought for him his battle, 
           And broke the chain that set him free, 
      And time has made him the greatest man 
            The whole world knows today. 
      Just in forty years of freedom 
           He has made this country think; 
      He is styled inventor, doctor, lawyer. 
           And proficient in every rank. 
   
     And this is not half—contractor, 
           Soldier brave, and in battle he stands first; 
      And he's owner of great properties, 
           And has millions in his purse. 
      This country should be proud of him 
           And make him a welcome guest, 
      It might as well, for he is here to stay, 
           And is still feathering his nest. 
 THE WAYWARD SON. 
 Good-by, my son, good-by,
 My poor wayward boy! 
 You are breaking your poor father's heart;
 He loves you, and believed 
 That you would mend your way 
 And would from bad habits depart. 
 But alas, it seems hopeless, hopeless. 
 When I think of you now a man,  
 And still seem perfectly contented 
 With throwing your earnings to the winds. 
 Stop and think for a moment! 
 Your time is fair spent, and soon life  
 With you will be at a close; 
  You had better be saving your earnings 
 For something that will do you good. 
 You will soon be counted with men and things of the past, 
 And nothing to your credit will note when you are spoken of by name; 
 The world will only laugh, for they won't even remember your name. 
Now you cannot be a back number with your intellect and brain; 
Save your time and credit and put your earnings out to work, 
And say, "I will have something and show the world I am a man." 
 Then you will make your father happy 
 When he thinks, "My son has accomplished 
 To make my old age brighter, 
 And give me happiness in the end. 
 “I have worked and toiled and struggled 
 To give him all of the chance to stand 
 Side by side with any hero in this broad and noted land; 
 He can get to be a hero and make himself a nobleman," 
 Now if you will stop and think, 
 My son, what God expects of you, 
 You will surely turn around 
 And find something good to do 
 That will make your name a credit 
 And will drown the awful past, 
 And make me feel so proud of you 
  To know that you are a creditable man at last. 
 THE PARTING LOVERS. 
 Good-by, sweetheart, our days of bliss, 
 Sealed by love's pure and sacred kiss, 
 Are ended in tears; 
 We part—the dream is o'er, 
           Good-by, sweetheart. 
 I may not meet thee of old, 
 But oh, how can we live apart, 
 God knoweth best, God help us both 
 To live and say 
           Good-by, sweetheart. 
 DO YOUR BEST. 
 When you are called on to perform a duty, 
            Do your best; 
 Make an effort to fill the pace, 
           And God will do the rest. 
 Never say, "That is too hard for me," 
 But always try to make the task 
 A world of pleasure. 
           Do you know why? 
 Because God has put you here 
 For something good and grand; 
 If you cannot fill the pace 
 Will you have answered the command? 
 MARRIAGE VOW. 
 May God bless your home 
 And make you happy; 
 May he children to you give, 
 May your union prove a blessing, 
 Teaching others how to live. 
 Always keep your marriage sacred, 
 Then j'ou never will grow cold, 
 But will always love each other 
 Until death will part you all. 
 God invented happy union, 
 God indorses marriage vows; 
 Then let no one put asunder 
 What God has given to you now. 
  
THE SUN OF OUR EXISTENCE. 
 The sun of our existence here 
       Is sinking very fast, 
 Let us make our lives a monument 
      Of credit while we last. 
 Let us do all of the good we can, 
      That others may see and feel 
 That we made the world better 
      By ambition, pluck and zeal. 
 Let it be our hearts' desire to make history 
      While we live, so that others may retain 
 And know that we have accomplished something 
      And also lived to live again. 
 Each of us should be inventors 
       In this broad and busy land, 
 And feel it is our duty 
       To be improving all of the time. 
 Let us give the world new ideas, 
      And exercise our hands and brain,
 As coming generations will expect of us 
      To learn something grand and something 
 Noble of our action in this age. 
      Now as we must fill our places 
 Let us fill them with delight and feel this is our gain, 
      You know success follows labor just as pleasure follows pain. 
 Let us then be up and doing 
      What we find, with all of our might, 
  In this business world improving 
      And leaving monuments of light. 
  
THE WOULD-BE CRITIC. 
 Very often when you are striving 
 To make life a grand success, 
 Someone stands off and criticises 
 By giving you the discouraging laugh. 
 But what need you care for that! 
 just keep the upward road, 
 And this will lead you to success, 
 If you ambitiously onward go. 
 The one that laughs the loudest 
  Is the one that laughs the last, 
 So when you see them laughing 
 Just put on more ambition to the task. 
 And tell them you are a hero, 
 And expect to win the prize; 
 That you mean to be a champion 
 In whatever you undertake. 
 No prize comes very easy, 
 You must work and fight to win; 
 That is why the Japs are fighting hard 
 And the Russians losing them. 
 God is not always with the strongest, 
 But is always with the right. 
 That is why the Japanese won; 
 He gave them power and might. 
 Now this should be a lesson 
 For this country great and grand, 
 That God is no respecter of persons, 
 But is father of every man. 
It is a very dangerous thing 
 To undertake to crush the weak; 
 For our Savior is always on their side — 
 As a general thing they are meek. 
 THE BIRD SONG 
 The little birds warble their song in the tree, 
 Chee-chee, whee-whee, whee-whee; 
 Their song is the sweetest music to me, 
 Chee-chee, whee-whee, whee-whee. 
 In the morning you hear them sing before day, 
 Especially in the beautiful mornings of May, 
 When flowers are all blooming with fragrance so sweet, 
 And the earth represents a glorious green sheet. 
 Then our hearts all rejoice that winter has flown, 
 And spring has appeared in it's beautiful gown, 
 To make the heart happy of the sad and forlorn,
 Then you will hear the birds singing their song. 
 When we think of the birds and the loving care 
 That God gives them through the winter and spares them to sing, 
 And much more attention he has given to man. 
 Why not love God and trust him as only man can, 
 And he will teach us to sing in that beautiful laud 
 Sweeter songs than the birds ever sang. 
 Now evening appears and the birds' songs are hushed. 
 They have flown to the trees and couched in their nests, 
 They have spent a remarkable day. 
 Just as the birds’ little voices are hushed, 
 Just so will ours in the night of our lives, 
 And may it be said of us just as of the birds, 
 That we have made someone happy today. 
 This world is a forest, a flower field, a grove, 
 And it is tenderly cared for by love, 
 God is the father of this beautiful land, 
 And dwells with the angels above. 
 Let us make it our business to be like the birds,
 To make every heart happy we meet,
 Then when time is no longer with us on the earth 
 We will worship at our Savior's feet. 
 THE MISSIONARY. 
 I think at a distance I hear a loud voice, 
 Saying, Come, Come, Come. 
 Look unto me and I will make you rejoice. 
 Come, Come, Come. 
 It is the cry of the father to the heathen so great. 
 He waits us as missionaries to bring them to his feet, 
 Then he says Come, Come, Come. 
 Now why will you linger, or why will you wait. 
 If you are cleansed they cannot hurt you, then bring them to me, 
 I say Come, Come, Come. 
 The world will grow better, if you do your part 
 In helping the sinner whenever you can,
 You can do it if you will, that is Christ's command, 
 Then Come. Come, Come. 
TELL HER SO. 
 If you have a word of cheer, 
 That will light the pathway drear 
 Of a pilgrim sister here, 
           Tell her so. 
 Tell her you appreciate 
 What she does and do not wait 
 Till the heavy hand of fate 
            Lays her low. 
 If your heart contains a thought, 
 That will brighter make her lot, 
 Then in mercy, hide it not— 
           Tell her so. 
 Wait not till your friend is dead, 
 Ere your compliments are said, 
 For the spirit that has fled, 
           (If it knows) 
 Does not need, where it has gone, 
 That poor praise to speed it on; 
 There love's endless, golden dawn, 
           Is a glow. 
 But unto our sister here 
 That poor praise is very dear; 
 If you have a word of cheer, 
          Tell her so. 
  
 LONELY WORLD.
 Sometime the world seems sad and lonely 
      To the weary passer-by, 
 For he has a heavy burden, 
      That is the reason why. 
 Something sad to him has happened 
      On his journey home, 
 But this to him may prove a blessing 
      As he goes further on. 
 The negro in this country thought 
      That his lot was very hard, 
 To know his lot was cast in bondage 
      But he put his full trust in the Lord, 
 And like all other work he does 
      He heard the mournful prayers; 
 He heeded them, he answered them, 
      And in his time he set the captive free. 
  
 ALL WE ASK IS JUSTICE. 
The Ohio Federation is a grand and glorious band 
Of noble colored women who invade this father-land; 
They have taken a grand stand in making a demand 
For their offsprings of this land justice. 
They are making a great sacrifice, but mean to win the prize; 
Makes no difference what it costs them they mean to live or try 
To make the future better, or they will know the reason why; 
The only thing they're asking now is justice. 
We will let the awful past alone and act as we call wise; 
We are willing to work hard and make most any sacrifice 
Or do anything we can to help our race to rise, 
But all we ask at any hands is justice. 
We feel that we are right in making this demand, 
Our fathers worked and shed their blood to make this country grand; 
They have fought in every battle and are willing yet to stand, 
And all they ask this country now is justice. 
We think at last we have a friend in Roosevelt, the president; 
He stands for right, a hero bold, as he knows all races have a soul, 
As chief executive of this land he makes this stern and last demand, 
And means it, too—for every man justice. 
As women of Ohio state we open up a broader gate,
And ask each state to federate, and this will make us stronger;
When every state is organized and all are fighting for this prize; 
Then you will hear our women loudly cry, we must have justice. 
PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR. 
One of our race's great lights has gone out to the world, 
No more he will flourish his pen with a whirl, 
As a poet he'll live and shine like a star, 
In the hearts of his race, Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
Yes, he has answered the call that comes to us all, 
Only young, it is true, but his life's work is done, 
Though his name will live and shine like the sun,
As though his life had just begun. Our noted Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
Is he missed, yes he's missed in the hearts of his friends. 
      And that mother that loved and watched o'er him to the end. 
Is sad and heart-broken that you may depend. 
When she thinks of Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
Our Savior that cares for the beast and the birds, 
Will tenderly care for that mother on earth, 
That has brought such a treasure to the credit of her race, 
As our noble, Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
Now when he is laid in his last resting place,
And followed with sad hearts, bathed in tears, 
It will long be remembered, years upon years,
The death of Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
GOLDEN JUBILEE OF WILBERFORCE. 
 Oh! Wilberforce, our star of hope, 
      We love and adore thy name; 
 Many find knowledge within thy courts 
      And are wielding a sword of fame. 
 Just think in a half century, 
      How proud we ought to be, 
 Of a noted place like Wilberforce, 
      Sound aloud the jubilee. 
 Long live the name of Wilberforce, 
      May she shine as bright as the sun, 
 At the end of a whole century, 
      As if she had just begun. 
 Many bring credit to this our race, 
      From thy broad and open doors, 
 They hail from South America 
      And from Africa's dark shores. 
 They come from foreign countries, 
      They come from the isles of set,
 To be taught at our noted Wilberforce 
      And to the olden Jubilee. 
 Let us strive to do something for Wilberforce, 
      And add to her great name more; 
 With her towering halls and libraries, 
      And her museum a perfect store. 
 With her choir of heavenly voices, 
      Giving God's great name all praise, 
 With ambition, brain and honor 
      Her students take this day. 
 With culture and refinement, 
      With modesty and grace, 
 With push, pluck and ambition. 
      Each student fills his place. 
 Three cheers for our dear old Wilberforce, 
      Three cheers for its faculty brave, 
 Three cheers for its loyal president, 
      Three cheers for its heroes in the grave. 
 Can we forget the founder, 
      Of this grand and noted place?  
 Dear Bishop Payne the hero, 
      May his ashes rest in peace. 
 Not only him but others, 
      That have gone to their resting place. 
 And their soul with God that giveth, 
      All happiness and peace. 
 TO THE CONFERENCE. 
 Another conference year has passed,
      And we are yet alive; 
 Our lots not with the dead are cast,
      For Heaven we all strive. 
 Dear bishops, what a privilege 
      To deal with God in prayer, 
 To send His shepherds to the field 
      For loving flocks to care. 
 May God inspire your heart to work 
      In vineyards day and night, 
 And with Him only for you shield 
      To take up arms and fight. 
 May you take new courage now 
      To conquer in the fight,
 With God as refuge in your front,
      Make Satan take his flight. 
 And when you in new fields have gone 
      And the gospel you have proclaimed, 
 And bade poor sinners come to Christ, 
      To love and praise His name. 
 When you have finished your work on earth, 
      And the Master has called you home, 
 May your life be spent in saving souls, 
      Then you will have overcome. 
 May we all meet on yonder shore, 
      Where conference never ends, 
 With Christ as bishop at the head. 
      And we His children blest. 
 Dear bishops, then your work will cease; 
      Dear ministers, then you'll rest. 
 And all of whom have kept the faith 
      Will go home and be blest. 
 THIS COUNTRY'S NEEDS. 
 This country needs more noble men 
      That will stand for God and right; 
 That, willingly, their aid will lend,
      To stop this country's fight. 
 More sun crowned men, that fear the Lord, 
      That will the law, enforce. 
 More men, that read and love his word— 
      Men, that pursues this course. 
 More men of principle and prayer, 
      Not men that wants a name. 
 More men working for the cause 
      And not for worldly fame. 
 But men that are willing to sacrifice, 
      To help this country's needs. 
 Men that will stand up alone— 
      Their loving lord, to please. 
 We want more men that studies law 
      That will the law, obey. 
 That will shuder at the thought of crime 
      In any form or way. 
 Men not afraid to trust the Lord. 
      That will take Him at His Word— 
 That will own Him in their offices 
      And His name in their homes be heard. 
 And in election time not beer and wine 
      Should control the voting polls. 
 Let principle with good and right— 
      Not, friends, silver nor gold. 
 Then peace will reign all over the land 
      And men will do the right. 
 Then take God for your guide and shield 
      And He will stop the fight.

INTRODUCTION
In presenting this little volume of poems to the public, (mostly of which are closely associated with a proscribed race,) the writer's sole and earnest endeavor, is to bring to light their real life and character; and if in any of these humble and simple rhymes, a passage or thought may chance prove a medium, through which the race may be elevated, or benefited, if only in the private mind of some reader, the writer feels, that her efforts is fully repaid.
THE AUTHORESS.
DEDICATED TO MY SISTER AND BROTHERS.
GLEANINGS OF QUIET HOURS.
ATHELSTANE.
OH, ATHELSTANE, the faithful!
Why linger at my gate?
Is not thy hopes yet blasted?
I for another wait.
Now hie thee, to yon forest;
'Tis Clare bids thee depart;
Nay, bow thee not in sorrow,
To break my bleeding heart!
"Oh Clare, why wed another?
Thou canst but give thy hand,
Thy heart is in my keeping,
Were I in foreign land."
"Why tarry here, in bondage,
When freedom is so nigh?
My steed waits in yon forest.
And champs his bit to fly."
"Far from thy cruel uncle,
Thy pining heart shall rest,
In peaceful bliss of Eden,
Upon thy lover's breast."
"Oh, Athelstane, the faithful!
My heart is thine alone;
No more I'll brook their babble,
I'll fly with thee, mine own."
THE SNOW-FLAKES.
DOWN, DOWN, in millions, blending,
The snow-flakes gambol fast;
With eddies gay, descending,
Hurled by the winter's blast.
Down, down, in millions, blending,
The shower seems never ending,
While a white spread is extending,
From the countless flakes, amassed.
Down, down, in millions blending,
The snow flakes gambol fast;
Each little drop is wending,
To a resting place at last.
Down, down, in millions, blending,
Our God the flakes are sending,
And a lesson is impending,
Which blind man fails to grasp.
Down, down, in millions, blending,
The snow-flakes gambol fast;
In mystic shapes, portending,
God's wisdom great and vast.
Down, down, in millions, blending,
While scholars are contending,
And the sage his wits is bending
Unexplained, they drift and pass.
THE FUGITIVE.
WITH BLEEDING back, from tyrant's lash,:
A fleet-foot slave has sped,
All frantic, past his humble hut,
And seeks the wood instead.
Once in the woods, his manhood wakes;
Why stand this bondage, wroth?
With diabolic, reckless heart,
He turns he, to the North.
He flings his crude hat to the ground,
And face the northern wind;
Fleet in his tracks, the blood-hounds bay,
He leaves them far behind.
By devious way, cross many a stream,
He fiercely pressed that day,
With deadly oaths for brush or brake,
That chance to block his way.
Erelong, when kind and soothing night,
Had hushed the strife of man,
He wades waist-deep, unto a tree,
To rest awhile and plan.
He knows no friends or shelter, kind,
To soothe his deadly grief,
He only knows, that farther north,
A slave may find relief.
No lore of book, or college craft,
Lends cunning to his plan,
Fresh from the tyrant's blasting touch.
He stands a crude, rough, man.
But Providence, with pity, deep,
Looked down upon that slave,
And mapped a path, up through the South,
And strength and courage gave.
Sometimes, a friendly fellow-slave,
Chance, spying where he hid,
At night would bring his coarse, rough, fare,
And God speed warmly bid.
And sometimes, when to hunger fierce,
He'd seem almost to yield,
A bird would fall into his clutch,
A fish would shake his reel.
And when on reaching colder climes,
A sheep-cote shelter made,
Or, law-abiding Yankee, stern,
Clandestinely, lent aid.
Till after many a restless day,
And weary, toiling, night,
All foot-sore, worn, and tired of limb,
His haven looms in sight.
His tired feet press Canadian shore,
Friends tell him he is free;
He feels a craving still, to hide,
It seems it cannot be.
But from suspense and thralldom freed,
His manhood wakes at last,
And plies he hand and brain with might,
To mend his ruthless past.
And Providence, in years that came,
Sent blessings rife, his way,
With grateful heart he journeyed through,
His free, allotted days.
JUST HOW IT HAPPENED.
WELL, I was at the dresser,
A-prinking at my hair,
When mamma bustled in, and said,
"Luvenia, Joe's down-stair."
Of course I was all ready,
But say girls, don't you know?
Just not to seem too anxious,
I poked, and came down slow.
Well, girls! I felt so funny.
When I came to the door;
For Joe had on a sober look,
I'd never seen before.
But soon he was all smiling,
And I felt quite at ease;
Then girls, he caught and gave my hand,
The cutest little squeeze.
I sat down on the sofa,
And Joe,— he sat so near;
That sober look came back again,
And girls! I did feel queer.
I said, "You look so sober;"
(For girls, that's not his way;)
And then he laughed so odd, and said
He'd felt blue, all that day.
I said, "What is the matter?"
Says he, "My heart aches so!"
Well girls! I was so got at that,
I only said, "Oh Joe!"
He slipped his arms around me,
I understood, you see,
Now girls, what are you giggling 'bout?
You'd kissed him too, like me!
A PRAYER.
OH, LORD! I lift my heart,
In gratitude, to Thee,
For blessings, manifold,
Thou hast bestowed on me.
When conflicts raged within,
Too blinding to express,
Thou pitied my still tongue,
And soothed my heart to rest.
Keep me within thy care;
Compel me, to the right;
'Tis sweet to walk with Thee,
In darkness or in light.
DEATH AND RESURRECTION.
THE PRIESTS, the elders, and the scribes,
From council had adjourned;
And Pilate's proffered sacrifice,
The mob had promptly spurned.
And up Golgotha's rising slope,
A boist'ous, cruel, band,
With taunts, and jeers, and foul rebuke,
Leads forth the Son of Man.
Oh, what a scene for human eyes!
Our Savior. bowed in grief;
And tortured by the very ones,
To whom He brings relief.
Close at His side, a swarthy man,
Beneath His cross doth bow;
Oh Simon! Ne'er did mortal bend,
To nobler task than thou.
And, on the brow of Calvary,
With scoffing, and with scorn,
They nailed our Saviour to the cross,
With diadem of thorn.
`Tis done, and Joseph now has laid
His body in the tomb;
And none except the guards keep watch,
Amid the somber gloom.
But what can bar our holy Lord,
Or cross his wondrous plan?
The stronghold 'bout His lonely tomb,
Shows unbelief of man.
When, to the tomb, the women came,
In grief, at break of day,
An angel, 'mid an earthquake, vast,
Had rolled the stone away.
No power within this great domain,
Can stay our mighty King;
Oh grave, where is thy victory,
Oh death, where is thy sting!
Despite the grave, despite the bar,
In triumph He hath flown,
And sitteth on the Right of God,
Joint-ruler of His own.
ADIEU, ADIEU, FOREVER.
ADIEU, YOU haughty maiden!
Proud Lydia, adieu;
I will not tarry longer at your side;
My heart now heavy-laden,
With sorrows made by you,
Never more shall thrall me or satiate your pride;
Adieu, adieu, forever.
Adieu, you dusky maiden,
You crafty prude, adieu!
No more the sport of narrow mind I'll be;
Ne'er shall my heart awaken,
To love strains, played by you,
I spurn you from my heart, for a maid of small degree;
Adieu, adieu, forever.
Adieu, you heartless trifle!
To dally with my love,
When I humbly laid my whole heart, at your feet;
My very soul you'd rifle,
Your vain heart you did prove;
Henceforth, for nobler maidens, this outraged heart will seek,
Adieu, adieu, forever.
THE HUSBAND'S RETURN.
THE PROUD, majestic Southern sun,
Let fall a golden gleam;
It flickered through a leafy bower,
And fell aslant a traveler's brow,
And roused him from his dream.
A finer specimen of man,
Was never cast in clay;
A swarthy Hercules was he,
With that rash intrepidity,
Of manhood's earliest day.
He, an emancipated slave,
From Rappahanock's side;
Assured by Lincoln's strong decree,
Had journeyed southward, bold and free,
To claim his stolen bride.
From many a camp of Union men,
He'd found his rations free;
And by their kindly guiding hand,
He now locates the plundered land,
Where his young wife must be.
A three hours' tramp 'cross rugged hills,
Footsore, yet full of life;
Now brings him to the handsome gate,
Where flowers, bedeck a mansion great,
The prison of his wife.
And as he boldly seeks the porch,
On entering through the gate,
The master, from his wicker chair,
With grim forebodings, wildly glare,
As he his errand wait.
Advancing nearer, now at hand,
He recognize the face,
The same firm mouth, the flashing eye,
The trouble wrought in days gone by,
Comes back with no good grace.
"Well Steve, you scoundrel, what's to pay?"
He said, with rising fear;
"You've run away, that is a fact,
I'll have you flogged, and shipped right right [sic] back,
What do you want back here?"
Young Stephen, to keep down his wrath,
His strongest will employ;
He simply says, "All slaves are free,
The news is heard where e'er I be;
I want my wife and boy."
A white rage lights the planter's face,
His oaths are fierce and wild;
He calls on demons from below,
To take him if a will he'd show,
To yield the wife and child.
The rash young freedman with one bound,
Had seized his deadly foe,
But Providence sent "second thought,"
Before the murderous deed was wrought,
He loosed his hold to go.
There played about that swarthy youth,
As he strode down the path,
A threat'ning storm from rights bereft,
That stayed the planter's gasping breath,
And took away his wrath.
"Stop, Steve! where are you going now?"
He cried with deadly fear;
"Come, boy, now let me hear your plan,
Come, let us talk as man to man!
Your wife is happy here."
Young Stephen flung an answer back,
With fury in his eye,
That suddenly did take his breath,
And paled his face, as if grim death
Had dropped down from the sky.
"I'm a-goin' to the barracks,
An' fetch the "blue-coats" here;
I swear this day I'll claim my wife,
Or you will pay it with your life,
Long 'fore the night appear."
Swift to the dairy house hard by,
A summon speeds the while;
A slender girl, with, sweet, dark eyes,
Comes quickly forth in glad surprise,
Dangling a heavy child.
Young Stephen's wrath is all forgot,
As with a cry of joy,
With kisses sweet and sighs of love,
The bright sun smiling from above,
He clasps his wife and boy.
And, as he strained them to his breast,
Where tumult late held sway,
A peace suffused his storm tossed heart,
That bade all gloomy moods depart,
And lit with joy his way.
WHILE THE CHOIR SANG.
THE THREAT'NING clouds of yesternight,
Have sought the western rim;
The peaceful Easter sun, beams forth
"Glad tidings to all men."
The festooned church is filling fast;
The frivolous, the gay,
The saint, the sinner, mingle free,
On this triumphant day.
Around the altar decked with flowers,
Each old saint takes his seat;
The organ swells, the choir breaks forth,
In cadence full and sweet.
But there, amongst the aged saint,
About the altar rail,
A vacant seat, an absent face,
Bespeaks the same sad tale.
Within a humble, upper room,
Across the street, near by,
All weak and worn, and racked with pain,
A faithful soldier lies.
He's felt the galling slav'ry's yoke,
In days now long since, fled;
He's groaned in destitution, sore,
And felt the need of bread.
But through it all, with child-like faith,
He's looked up to his God;
And though the billows loudly roared,
He came across, dry-shod.
And now, the crucial test is come,
For Jordan's bank is near;
He's trusted God at smaller streams,
Canst he not trust Him here?
The choir bursts forth in classic strains,
The notes unto him ring;
Though he's not trained in classic lore,
He knows they praise his King.
His soul hath caught the holy spell;
Who could doubt such a King?
His fav'rite hymn is on his lips;
He launches, as he sings:—
"Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus;
Steal away, steal away home,
I aint got long to stay here.
He feels his old wife's ling'ring clasp,
He faintly hears her moan,
For Jordan's waves break on his ear,
And drifts him toward his home.
The choir, in rich crescendo strains,
In final triumph, chord;
They little dreamed, 'twere theirs to launch,
An old saint to his Lord.
UNCLE IKE'S HOLIDAY.
"WELL UNCLE IKE! This beats me;
I don't know what to say:
Last night I took it for a joke,
When of that odd project you spoke,
To celebrate today."
"I didn't take you for the man,
Kind as I've been to you,
To leave me in this busy time,
Tomatoes, spoiling on my vines,
To loaf a whole day through."
I've corn now parching in the field;
Potatoes yet to dig.
Yet you can walk off in this way,
And leave me in "a hole" all day,
Nor do you give a "fig."
You colored folks, are cranks for sure;
Here in this busy week,
To stop a good job, just for fun.
And sport around from sun to sun,—"
"Stop right dah! Let me speak!"
"Dis day is 'Mancipation,
De day when God, who reigns,
Wid Lincum fah his instrument,
De very jaws ob Sof did rent,
To bust de slav'ry's chains.
"An' now, wid umble gratwatude,
I's promised him fah one,
To set aside one day each year,
An' meet my people wid good cheer,
An 'joice at whut He's done."
"You say, I'se stopped in busy times,
I answer in reply,
De 'high boss', dat I'm on today,
You sot astride, dis very way,
Jest back here, in July.
"Yo' June grass lay cut in de field,
De wetter looked like rain,
An' yet you sent me right back home,
An' to yo' surrey hitched yo' roan,
An' driv off jest de same."
"An' mind you, when I spoke to you,
'Bout wastein' sich a day,
"Faw Jesus Christ I would not work,
Doe tahment claimed me fah a shirk,"
Dem aw de words you say."
"I won't say dat, I'll wuk fah God,
But, mind you dis is true,
Mo' serious time will hab to come,
An' mighty heavy, arg'ing done,
Befo' I'd wuk fah you."
I s'pose you know whut brung me 'round,
I want dat 'change', you know;
I call it wrong to stingy be,
Upon de day when we are free;
Tank you sah; I must go."
A HOME GREETING.
A PAIR of soft, black eyes,
A velvet, dusky, cheek,
A flash of dazzling pearls,
An Eden for me speak.
And next a soft embrace;
My eyes drink to their fill,
The tender, liquid, depth,
Of orbs that ever thrill.
A long, ecstatic, kiss,
That drowns all earthly strife:
What gift can e'er exceed,
A pure, confiding, wife?
LINES TO AN OLD SCHOOL-HOUSE.
DEAR SCHOOL of my childhood, thrice dear doth thou seem,
Now that thou shalt soon be no more;
Oh, fresh in my memory, sweet visions gleam,
Reflecting the bright days of yore.
Those days when we played with our faces abeam,
And manhood and womanhood, seemed but a dream.
Thy grove, cool and shady, with maples o'er grown,
Has sheltered us all, in the past;
We've romped 'neath thy shadows, while bright years have flown,
Too sweet and too pleasant to last.
Dear school of my childhood, with pain in my heart,
I yield to grim progress, and see thee depart.
And all of our teachers: how bright in our mind,
We recall every one, as they came;
Each, like a wise monarch, unselfish and kind,
Did make our advancement, their aim.
Think not that the scholar, ne'er valued thy care;
Thy teachings sank deeper than thou wert aware.
Thy dear grove has sheltered, when life seemed a care,
And trials have clouded our way.
And oft the young lover, and sweet maiden fair,
Have wooed here, where once they did play.
Oh, fresh in our memories e'er wilt thou be,
Since the skein of our childhood is woven with thee!
Dear 'Amity,' emblem of friendship's pure gold,
We shall not bemoan thee, as past;
E'en now, like that fabulous phoenix of old,
From thy ashes, a new school looms, vast.
More comely in structure, we view it near by,
And hail thy successor, with pride in our eye.
We dread not the future, oh 'Amity,' new,
What else canst thou do, but succeed;
Thy ancestor's mantle has fallen to you,
And we know thou'lt supply ev'ry need.
May thy present scholars, and those to enroll,
Inscribe a good record, upon thy fair scroll.
THE EXAMINATION.
LOOK here, Petah! whut's dis here,
Dat I heard at sistah Brooks,
'Bout you fallin' back dis year,
In most all uv yo' school books?"
"You think me an' pa'll work,
Keep a lazy scamp in school,
Jest to play, an' prink, an' shirk?
Ef you do, you ah a fool."
"Oh ma, Mrs. Brooks don't know,
What I do at school each day!"
"'Twan't her dat tole me so,
I aint 'peatin' whut she say."
"But I heard it, right enough,
An' I'm b'lievin' uv it, too:
Now, I woont stan' no sich stuff!
So you know whut you kin do."
"I'm not lagging in my books!
'Less it be my algebra:
They told stories down to Brooks—"
"I'm a-b'lievin' whut dey say."
"Fetch dem books fum dat machine,
An' my specks, fum off dat she'f,
I'll find out whut all dis mean,
Gwine to test you fah myse'f.
"Look at me, an' look at pa!
Nevah spent one day in school;
Brung up undah slav'ry's law;
White folks used us fah a tool."
"But jest soon as freedom come,
Me an' pa made up our minds,
To take lessons fum Miss Crum,
An' she said we jest did fine."
"We wuked days, and studied nights;
Pa right here can tell de same,
How de lessons we would fight,
See who'd git the biggest name.
"Doe pa now won't have it so,
'Tis de fac' jes' ax Miss Jane:
I wus fust,—whether or no,
Kase I had de strongest brain."
"Sakes o' life, ma! how you 'blow,
'Kase I once misspelled 'employ,'
Look here Cindy, don't you know?—"
"Oh, hesh! let me test dis boy."
"Whut's dis book you's gibbin' me?
'Spose I keer for allerbay? A, b, c, and x, y, z;
Here, boy, put dis book away!"
"Learned my letters long ago,
And I thought you did de same;
Dese new schools beat all I know!
Don't know you or dem to blame."
"Bring dat spellin' book to me!
You don't use dat book no mo'?
'Spec you ought now, we will see;
Take yo' place tha' by de do.'"
"Now Pete spell me 'domineer;
Right; now spell me 'gasoline;'
Dey's 'too easy' do I hear?
Never mind, now spell 'machine!"
'Mancipate',(set free, to fly;)
Once I craved dat soon an' late:
'M-a-n—c-i si man—ci,
P-a-t-e, 'Man-ci pate'.
"E' cums fus instid uv 'M',
Dis here spellin' will not do!"
"Dates de way you spoke it to 'im,
Dat boy's jest as right as you.'"
"Pa, I wush you'd shet yo' mouf,
An' quit takin' on, so mean,
Now den, Petah, spell me 'soul';
Right,—now spell fah 'me, 'ravene'"
"Wrong! I knowed you'd miss a sight;
Dat new's straight, I got at Brooks;
"Ma, I know I spelt that right!"
"Aint I lookin' on de book?"
"Like as not de boy is right,
Cindy, let me see dat word;
Dat word's 'raven'— Sakes o' life!.
Kyah! kyah! kyah! you is a bird."
"Oh shet up! an' act wid sense!
Ain't gwine test Pete any mo';
You knowed when I fus' commence,
Dat my eyes wus dim an' so."
"Dat's why I bought dem gold specks,
Dat you made de man take back;
You wont have me here to vex,
Always, wid yo' spite an' slack."
"B'lieve Lucindy's gwine to cry;
Kyah! kyah! kyah! she is a bird!
Makin' out she's gwine to die.
'Case she mispernounced dat word."
A CHRISTMAS GHOST.
THE EVE of Christmas had arrived;
The children were in bed,
The clock upon the mantel, chimed
The half-hours as they fled.
Aunt Lucy tip-toed 'bout her work;
For work she had to do;
I've never seen a Christmas eye
Bring aught but work,— have you?
And so Aunt Lucy tip-toed 'bout,
With heart expectant, light,
"Twould be a shame to wake the babes,
With Santa mos' in sight."
But all at once Aunt Lucy stopped;
"Laws! Whut's dat thumpin' noise?"
She had good reason to believe,
It wasn't Santa Claus.
And yet, five minutes back, had she
Not seen on pillows white,
Four little cherubs, wrapped in sleep,
Most pleasing to the sight?
With busy hands and heavy step,
Aunt Lucy fairly flew;
Admitting that they were awake,
She had her work to do.
Next, calls she stern, behind closed door,
(Too busy to pass through,)
"Now, whut's flat thumpin' sound I hear?
Paul Peters, is dat you?"
"Phil, Joe, an' Babe, I know is sleep,
An' you, too, ought to be,
Ef you don't git back in dat bed,
I'll lay you 'cross my knee!"
"But mamma, Santa Claus is come!
I seed him pattin' Ring,
He's come an' fetched his wife along,—"
"He aint cum, no sich thing!"
"But ma, he had a dreat big sack,
They did'nt [sic] make no noise,
An' when he set it down, to rest,
He kissed Miss Santa Claus."
"You hesh yo' mouf, an' git to bed!
Don't b'lieve a word you say;
Fah none has come into this house,
But Sis an' mister Clay."
"Nobody axed you whut you seed,
All bad boys see a sight;
You git in bed, or you will see,
A whoopin' 'fore 'tis light.
So guilty Paul crept back to bed,
Most miserable of boys,
For fear she'd tell old Santa Claus,
And forfeit him his toys.
Yet mamma never "peached" on him,
For Santa brought a host;
And so he solved the myst'ry thus:
He merely saw a ghost.
A VALENTINE.
OUT of the depths of a heart of love,
Out of the birth-place of sighs,
Freighted with hope and freighted with fear,
My all in a valentine, hies.
Oh, frail little missive
Of delicate texture,
Speed thee, on thy journey,
And give her a lecture!
Fathom her heart, that seems to me, cold,
Trouble her bosom, as mine,
Let it be mutual, this that I crave,
Her 'yes' for a valentine.
Oh, frail little missive,
In coy Cupid's keeping,
Oh! speed back a message,
To set my pulse leaping.
A TRIBUTE TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM.
DEAR friends, we are gathered together,
With innocent hearts, that are light;
Each face is abeam, and meet doth it seem,
As there is a wedding tonight.
A wedding! with love and peace in full bloom;
And a sweet, comely, bride and an exquisite groom.
Dear friends, we are gathered together,
And happiness leads us tonight;
We follow her star, with nothing to mar,
Through the sweet, dreamy whirl of delight;
And we feel our hearts throb and swell for the room,
To encompass our hopes, for the sweet bride and groom.
May this night's love and contentment,
For the happy pair, prove to be,
A nucleus e'er, to enlarge with each year,
As their barque drifts out, in life's sea:
And we wish them many returns of the day,
With peace, love, and happiness, as only friends may.
Should sorrows e'er darken their pathway,
As oft in our lives, sorrows will,
May they turn to the One, to whom millions have come,
And each heard His sweet words, "Be still."
And may His blest Presence, forever find room,
In the pure, sweet, abode of the bride and the groom.
EMANCIPATION.
TIS a time for much rejoicing;
Let each heart be lured away;
Let each tongue, its thanks be voicing
For Emancipation Day.
Day of victory, day of glory,
For thee, many a field was gory!
Many a time in days now ended,
Hath our fathers' courage failed,
Patiently their tears they blended;
Ne'er they to their, Maker, railed;
Well we know their groans, He numbered,
When dominions fell, asundered.
As of old the Red Sea parted,
And oppressed passed safely through,
Back from North, the bold South, started,
And a fissure wide she drew;
Drew a cleft of Liberty,
Through it, marched our people free.
And, in memory, ever grateful,
Of the day they reached the shore,
Meet we now, with hearts e'er faithful,
Joyous that the storm is o'er.
Storm of Torture! May grim Past,
Hurl thee down his torrents fast.
Bring your harpers, bring your sages,
Bid each one the story tell;
Waft it on to future ages,
Bid descendants learn it well.
Kept it bright in minds now tender,
Teach the young their thanks to render.
Come with hearts all firm united,
In the union of a race;
With your loyalty well plighted,
Look your brother in the face.
Stand by him, forsake him never,
God is with us now, forever.
TO A DECEASED FRIEND.
WRITTEN IN MEMORY OF MRS. POLLY DIXON.
THE veil of death hath fallen,
Loved one 'twixt thee and me;
Thou art now among the chosen of the Lord;
With heavenly saints immortal,
Enrobed in sanctity,
Thou art chanting with the blest, in sweet accord.
Oh, ever bright thy image,
Is pictured in my heart,
Though autumn after autumn now hath flown;
But memories still steal o'er me,
In which thou hast a part,
And I sometimes yearn to rob Death of his own.
Well didst thou keep the promise,
My dying mother craved:
That thou shouldst ever guard her orphan brood;
Oh, blessed foster-mother!
Thy tenderest love, thou gav'st;
And thou ever taught me lessons, pure and good.
Oh Death! why rob so early?
Why snatched thou her, from me,
When I, in wane of childhood, craved her most?
If longer thou hadst spared her,
I could ungrudgingly,
Permitted her, to be unto me lost.
Oh, many times in blindness
Have I stumbled as I tread,
The rugged old road, which to me is new;
And I miss thy warm hand's pressure,
And I grieve that thou art dead;
While sad, regretful, tears, mine eyes bedew.
But sleep, beloved mother,
Why shouldst I grudge thy rest?
For thou indeed, hast done the 'better part;'
A mother to the orphan,
Of wives the true and best,
My inmost self, can yield thee, with glad heart.
AN AFTERNOON GOSSIP.
IS that you sistah Harris?
I knowed you when you knocked;
Jest keep right on a-pushing,
The ole door isn't locked!
Ole white man's been forgetting,
Each day since first I sent;
He's got a pow'ful mem'ry,
When comes the time for rent.
Now, sit down; Whut's your hurry?
You have no work to do;
I'm mos' done with my i'ning;
You always beats me through.
You aint no bother to me!
Jest sit here where its cool;
Hush fretting 'bout them child'en!
You know they're safe in school.
Now, whut's the news, Amanda?
Hearn some 'bout Flora Ann;
Jest take this little rocker,
And reach that pa'm leaf fan.
I hearn she's gone and married,
That trifling Louis Bird;
Says I to Abe this mo'nin',
Don't b'lieve a single word.
Hush woman! Whut's you sayin'?
How can that news be true?
Flo Ann wus sot on Jasper,
She never keered for Lou.
Well people! Don't that beat you?
Gone married Lou fo' spite;
The Lod have mussy on her!
She's trapped herse'f for life.
Guess what ole Jeems ben doin'?
Can't guess to save my life;
Aint took a crazy notion,
To git another wife?
Fo' land-sakes! sister Harris,
Ha! ha! ha! aint I beat?
That man's jest buyin' hosses
Fo' crows an' dogs to eat.
Now, you know well as I do,
He loses ev'ry one:
They're half dead when he gets them;
I 'spect he thinks it's fun.
'Twus jest a week last Tuesday;
Abe made me break my side,
Telling how the marshal fined him,
For half bur'ing one that died.
I hearn 'bout Sister Curtley?
Why Sistah Harris, no!
Fell down and broke her ankle?
Good Lo'd! You don't say so?
Fell down them ole back do' steps!
She told me they wus broke;
Ole Smith put off the fixing:
I'd make that white man smoke!
I must git round and see her;
Hope God will bring her through;
We must pray for her, Mandy,
And see whut we can do.
We must not shirk our duty,
And linger in the lurch,
But help, in tribulations,
A sistah in the church.
You say you're feeling poorly?
Then course you couldn't go;
Yes, Sistah Riley told me,
That you wus feeling slow.
Now hush your 'pologizing!
I know your heart is true;
Whut sistah did more shouting,
Last 'vival time than you?
You wa'n't out to meeting,
When they 'churched' Riah Brown?
You'd broke your sides a-laughing,
How Elder called him down.
The Elder riz and asked him,
To take a seat in front;
So, up the aisle he shuffled,
And sot down, with a grunt.
Then, spoke up Elder Mitchell,
"Now, whut have you to say?
You know the charge against you,
For the evil of your way.
"You've walked the way of sinnahs,
Used church funds for your gain,
And when 'cused by Deacon Riley,
Took the name of God, in vain."
Ef evah in your lifetime,
You've seen a good whooped hound,
With head and tail a-dragging,
You then saw Riah Brown.
"And therefore," said the elder,
His voice wus loud and stout;
"We want no wolves among us;
I move to turn you out."
Poor sistah Brown wus crying,
Riah wus sniffling too;
Yet seemed no sad occasion,
Jest spite of all I'd do.
I know 'twa'n't like no christain,
The feeling that I had,
For ev'ry where around me,
The sistahs looked so sad.
But 'pon my word, Amanda,
Since my eyes first saw light;
I never felt more tickled,
Than I did Tuesday night.
Then Riah says a sniffin'.
"I did do whut you say,
But bred'ren 'twas ole Satan,
That coaxed me from the way."
You could a hearn a pin drop,
When he commenced to say,—
"I'm but a umble critter;—"
Laws, listen! Is that May?"
Laws, honey! here's the child'en,
School caint be out so soon;
Ef ever time went flyin',
It did this afternoon.
That's right, I didn't finish,
Well, I wus most nigh through,
You'll hear the rest tomorrow?
I dont keer ef you do.
All right, tomorrow, Mandy,
I'm mighty gled you come;
Now, don't fret 'bout them child'en,
You'll find them safe at home.
And say, oh Sistah Harris!
Tomorrow, when you come,
Please tell old Mr. Bailey,
To send Abe's hatchet home.
THE MUSE'S FAVOR.
OH MUSE! I crave a favor,
Grant but this one unto me;
Thou hast always been indulgent,
So I boldly come to thee.
For oft I list thy singing,
And the accents, sweet and clear,
Like the rhythmic flow of waters,
Falls on my ecstatic ear.
But of Caucasia's daughters,
So oft I've heard thy lay,
That the music, too familiar,
Falls in sheer monotony.
And now, oh Muse exalted!
Exchange this old song staid,
For an equally deserving:—
The oft slighted, Afric maid.
The muse, with smiles, consenting,
Runs her hand the strings along,
And the harp, as bound by duty,
Rings out with the tardy song.
THE SONG.
Oh, foully slighted Ethiope maid!
With patience bearing rude upbraid,
With sweet, refined, retiring, grace,
And sunshine lingering in thy face,
With eyes bedewed and pityingly,
I sing of thee, I sing of thee.
Thy dark and misty curly hair,
In small, neat, braids entwineth fair,
Like clusters of rich, shining, jet,
All wrapt in mist, when sun is set;
Fair maid, I gaze admiringly,
And sing of thee, and sing of thee.
Thy smooth and silky, dusky skin,
Thine eyes of sloe, thy dimple chin,
That pure and simple heart of thine,
'Tis these that make thee half divine;
Oh maid! I gaze admiringly,
And sing of thee, and sing of thee
Oh modest maid, with beauty rare,
Who e'er hath praised thy lithe form, fair?
Thy tender mien, thy fairy tread,
Thy winsome face and queenly head?
Naught of thy due in verse I see,
All pityingly I sing of thee.
Who's dared to laud thee 'fore the world,
And face the stigma of a churl?
Or brook the fiery, deep, disdain,
Their portion, who defend thy name?
Oh maiden, wronged so cowardly,
I boldly, loudly, sing of thee.
Who've stood the test of chastity,
Through slav'ry's blasting tyranny,
And kept the while, their virtuous grace,
To instill in a trampled race?
Fair maid, thy equal few may see;
Thrice honored I, to sing of thee.
Let cowards fear thy name to praise,
Let scoffers seek thee but to raze;
Despite their foul, ignoble, jeers,
A worthy model thou appear,
Enrobed in love and purity;
Oh, who dare blush, to sing of thee?
And now, oh maid, forgive I pray,
The tardiness of my poor lay;
The weight of wrongs unto thee done,
Did paralize My falt'ring tongue;
'Twas my mute, innate, sympathy,
That staid this song, I sing of thee.
THE FAVORITE SLAVE'S STORY.
WELL, son de story of my life,
Is long, and full of shade;
And yet, the bright spots, here and tha,
A heap of comforts made.
When fust my eyes beheld de light,
'Twas on a Chris'mus day;
Twelve miles fum Richmond "on a fa'm,"
As you young upsta'ts say.
We said "plantation" in de South,
We black, and white folks too;
We wa'n't a changin' ev'ry day,
Like all you young folks do.
My mother cooked de white-folks grub,
Dat's all she had to do,
Ole Miss, she spilte her half to death,
And spilte her young ones, too.
Fah, well I mind me, in dem days,
How I and Sue and Pete,
Would roll around Miss Nancy's cheer,
And play about her feet.
Miss Nancy,—I kin hear her yet—
'You Petah, Sue, an' Si!
I'll make yo' maustah whoop you sho!"
(Wid laughtah in her eye.)
Ole mause, he'd whoop us soon as not;
But, when Miss Nancy saw,
She'd run out, wid dat look, an' say,
'I wouldn't whoop him, Pa.'
One day,—I nevah kin fahgit,
Ole Miss wus sick in bed;
Ole Mause, he ripped, an' cussed, an' to',
An' made himself a dread.
Somehow, I can't tell how it wus,
He slapped my sistah Sue,
And mammy, coase she took it up,
Den dab wus heap to do.
Pete lit right in wid tooth and claw,
And so did little sis,
Fah me, I had anothah plan,
I flew upstairs fah Miss.
I met Miss Nancy on de stairs
Wrapped in a great big shawl,
An' comin' down de steps so fast,
Jest seemed as ef she'd fall.
I tried to tell her 'whut wus up,'
She pushed me on befo',
Fah mammy's cries wus in her yeahs
An' she heard nothin' mo'.
She caught ole Mause, an' pulled him off;
Her eyes dey fa'ly blazed;
Ole Mause commenced a silly grin,
An' looked like he wus dazed.
I'd nevah seed Miss Nancy mad.
Good Lo'd! She fussed an' to'e;
She 'raked ole Maustah o'er de coals',
Until he begged an' swo'.
She wouldn't 'low Maria whooped,
She jest would leave de place,
An' take 'way ev'ry slave she brought!
She jest r'ared in his face.
She wouldn't 'low Maria whooped,
Jest leave her young ones be!
They nevah sassed her when she spoke,
It wasn't dem, 'twas he!
He tried to coax her back to bed,
But, Lo'd! She wouldn't go:
'Whut time had she to stay upstairs
When he would take on so?'
An' Mammy, she wus cryin' loud;
(De whoopin' wus her fus,)
An', whut wid little sistah Sue,
It made Miss Nancy wus.
She'd fuss all round about Ole Mause,
Jest like a spunky hen;
She'd pat my mothah on de back,
An' den begin' again.
Well son, she p'intly mane things wa'm,
Fah Ole Mause whined an' swo';
No mattah how we all took on,
He'd whoop none uv us mo'.
"Maria, take yo' Miss upstairs!"
He'd wring his hands an' say;
Miss Nancy'd stamp her foot an' scream,
She'd stay right tha' all day.
Well, when she'd fussed plum out uv bref,
To add to his ala'ms,
She jest 'keeled' ovah in a faint,
An' fell into his a'ms.
Well, son, tha wus anothah stir;
We young ones thought her dead:
Ole Mause, I b'lieve, he thought so too,
Fah he plum lost his head.
Ole Miss wus sick fah quite a spell,
An' mad right thue it all;
Fah when ole Mause cumed grinnin' roun',
She'd turn an' face de wall.
So things went on, until one day,
He axed her, how she felt,
She reached out wid her ole time smile,
So he cumed tha an' knelt.
Dey made it up, right dah an' den,
An' as de day was fa',
he took her up into his a'ms,
An' brung her down de sta'.
An' aftah dat, I tell you, son,
Ole Mause, he let us be,
An' doe he slashed de othah slaves,
Pete, Sue, an' me went free.
An' so de time went spinnin' on,
Wid not a keer nor plan;
I didn't know whut trouble wus,
Till I wus nigh a man,
Ole Fairfax owned my fathah, son,
Dey lived across de creek,
De white folks al'ays let him come,
Three nights in ev'ry week.
Of coase he had his Sundays, too,
Great days dey use to be,
Fah all de blessed day he'd have
We young ones, bout his knee.
Or else, he'd take us all to church,
All breshed up neat an' new,
Wid' Mammy hanging to his arm,
An' leading little Sue.
An' Mammy's eyes 'ud be so bright,
When she had Pappy near;
She'd laugh an' giggle like a gal,
But tryin' times drawed near.
Ole Mause an' Fairfax wus fast friends;
A pa' uv roscals dey;
In gamblin', cheatin', an' de like,
Dey bofe had heap to say.
So bofe got mixed up in a scrape,
Wid Richmond's bank, an' den,
Dey bofe sold ev'ry slave dey had,
To keep out uv de pen.
I tell you son de good white-folks,
Wus good in time uv ease;
But soon as hawd times cummed tha' way,
Dey'd change, "quick as you please.
Soon as Miss Nancy seed de trap,
Ole Mause had done walked in,
She changed right dah, an who but she!
A-helpin' him to sin.
Dey talked an' planned togethah, long;
An', as de days flew by,
Miss Nancy changed an' got so cross,
Dat Mammy use to cry.
One mawnin', jest to pick a fuss,
She said she missed a pie;
When Mammy said dey all wus tha,
She said, she told a lie.
'Dat pie wus in her cabin, hid;
She wus a vixen, bold;
An' ef she didn't bring it back,
She'd have her whooped an' sold.'
Well, son, you see dat wus her scheme,
To sell her, wid de rest;
An' aftah dat, she made it plain,
To all uv us, I 'fess,
An' so, at last, de day rolled 'round,
When all, exceptin' I,
Wus put upon de block an' sold,
To any one who'd buy.
Oh, son! You don't know whut it is,
To see yo' loved ones sold,
An' hear de groans, an' see de tears,
Uv young, as well as ole.
An' see dem white men bus'lin 'roun',
A-feelin' uv yo' a'm,
An' havin' you to run an' skip,
An' caper till you's wa'm,
An' all de while, wid questions, keen,
An' wid a watchful eye,
Not keerin' how yo' h'a't might ache,
Jest so you's strong an', spry.
Po' Mammy! How kin I fahgit,
Her pa'tin' from us all?
Dat pa'tin', son, will 'bide wid me,
Until de Lo'd will call!
'Way down de rivah, she wus sold,
Alone, wid no kin nigh;
Her tendah h'a't broke 'fo' she left,
I know she's long on High.
An' Pappy, Pete, an' little Sue,
Wus sent their dif'rent ways,
An' not one has my eyes beheld,
Since dem sad, pa'tin' days.,
Oh son, you don't know how I felt,
When all dat stir wus past!
Sometimes I'd git to grievin' so,
I thought I couldn't last.
De empty cabins all aroun'.
De stables empty, too,
Miss Nancy, cryin' day an' night
Ole Mause a-lookin' blue.
I tell you son, dem tryin' days,
Aw burnt into my soul:
I feel de pain, I see it all,
Same as dem days uv old.
Ah well! De sun will sometimes shine,
E'en in a po' slave's life;
De Lo'd healed up my broken h'a't,
By sendin' me a wife.
Miss Nancy wus as good to her,
An' spilte her jest as bad,
As she did mammy long befo',
Sometimes it made me sad.
Ole Mause had prospered, bought mo' slaves,
Ole Miss wus sweet an' kind,
My little ones an' Charlotte dear,
Had pushed my grief behind.
I al'ays wus Miss Nancy's pet,
She made it very plain;
An' I must say, in all my grief,
She tried to ease my pain.
An' now, dat I wus gay once mo',
An' happy as could be,
She petted Charlotte an' my chaps,
An' seemed as pleased as me.
So time sped on widout a keer,
Save whut had long since past,
Till Ole Mause's health begin to fail,
An' son, he went down fast.
He took on scan'lous in dem days,
When he saw death wus nigh,
He cussed an' to' from mawn till night,
It made Miss Nancy cry.
He nevah had been conquered, son,
By any living thing,
So, when grim Death lay hold uv him,
He fit ha'd, 'gainst de sting.
But, son, at last he'd found his match,
Fah spite uv all his rage,
Ole Satan flung his fi'ry hook,
An' pulled him in his cage.
You nevah seed a sinnah die,
So son you jest don't know;
You could've heard Ole Maustah cuss,
Fuh half a mile or mo'.
He axed me fuh a glass uv gin.
He jest wus crazy med,
He bit de rim from off de glass,
An' spit it on de bed.
An' den he yelled, "Look at him, Si!
"Drive that black dog away!
He's snapping at my throat, you see,
Ketch hold his chain, I say!"
He would've sprung plum out de bed,
Had I not held him in,
Den, wid a long an' doleful yell,
He died in all his sin.
De wah, dat had been grumblin' roun',
Broke full about dis time,
De slaves begun a-walkin' off.
To suit their own free mind.
Ole Miss wus cryin' day an' night,
An' beggin' me to stay,
While Charlotte urged me, on de sly,
To go North, fah away.
I looked into her pleadin' eyes.
So helpless, trustin' me,
An' den, upon my little chaps,
An' manhood said, "Be free!"
Ole Missus cumed down to de gate;
To bid fahwell she tried,
But she jest held fast bofe our hands,
An' cried, an' cried, an' cried.
An' so we cumed up to dis state,
An' worked on, bes' we could,
A-trustin' al'ays in de Lo'd,
An' tryin' to be good.
We raised our chaps, dey all done well,
An' now have settled down,
Exceptin' Jane, our baby gal,

FREEDOM AT MCNEALY'S.
ALL around old Chattanooga,
War had left his wasteful trace;
And the rebels, quelled and baffled,
Freed reluctantly their slaves.
On his spacious, cool, veranda—
Stood McNealy, gaunt and tall,
With bowed head, and long arms folded,
Pond'ring on his blacks, enthralled.
Years and years, he'd been their master,
Harsh and stern his reign had been;
Many an undeserving lashing,
He had rudely given them.
All his life he'd been a despot;
Ruling all with iron hand;
Never till this deadly conflict,
Had he e'er brooked one command.
But his lately rich plantation,
Sacked by Union men he see;
And the bitter dregs stand waiting:
He must set his bondmen free.
From their work, they come together,
At their master's last command,
And at length, well-nigh two hundred.
'Fore the large veranda stand.
Oh! that motley crowd before him,
Speaks the wrong one man has done;
For his constant, dire oppression,
Can be seen on every one.
Men of middle age all palsied,
By hard work and sorrow's pain,
Blighted youths and orphaned infants;
All had felt his cruel reign.
There were women fair, who knew him,
To be more of brute than man;
There were children clinging to them,
Through whose veins his own blood ran.
Widowed hearts in swarthy bosoms.
Ever bled in patient pain,
O'er their loved ones, sold before them,
To increase McNealy's gain.
All of this preys on McNealy,
As before his slaves he stands;
And his low'ring, dogged, expression,
Speaks the power that's left his hands.
And, with quivering voice and husky,
Tells he that each one is free;
Tells them of his heavy losses,
Meanly seeking sympathy.
And the soft hearts of his vassals,
Melt, as only Ethiopes' can;
As with brimming eyes and kind words,
Each one grasps his tyrant's hand.
One by one, they've all departed;
Man and woman, boy and girl;
Void of learning, inexperienced,
Launched upon the crafty world.
But one cabin is not empty,
Two old souls are kneeling there;
In the throes of desolation,
They have sought their Lord in prayer.
They have never tasted freedom.
And their youthful hopes are fled;
Now, the freedom they are seeking,
Is with Jesus, and the dead.
Poor aunt Jude and uncle Simon!
Freedom brings to them, no cheer;
They have served McNealys fam'ly,
For three-score or more, of years.
Steep and rough, the road they've traveled,
Many were their heart felt groans,
Yet they cleave unto their tyrant,
For his lash, is all they've known.
Like a bird of long confinement,
Cleaves unto his open cage,
These two wretched slaves, benighted,
Clave to bondage, in their age.
And they sought McNealy humbly,
With their hearts filled to the brim;
Told him, all their days remaining,
They would gladly give to him.
And McNealy, pleased and flattered,
With no feeling of remorse,
Takes them back into his service,
As you would a faithful horse.
ADOWN THE HEIGHTS OF AGES
ADOWN the heights of Ages,
Where mist oft dims the view,
Where blinding chaos rages,
Whilst sweet peace mingles, too,
A caravan e'er moves along,
A fast increasing, fitful throng,
To whom we've said adieu.
Oft, through the mist, seclusive,
Familiar forms, appear;
And from their realm, exclusive,
Their joys and griefs, we hear;
A bright ray, oft, lights up the mist,
And flash us back a loving kiss;
Or counsel we hold dear.
And often, in the young night,
When memories, beguile,
We drift behind the foot-lights,
And play with them awhile;
'Tis then we press that hand, again,
And hear that voice, that thrills to pain,
And drink again that smile.
Then stroll we through the wildwood,
Down to the meadow brook.
And with the joy of childhood,
We ply our fishing hook;
Or, in the country school, once more,
We take our places, "on the floor,"
Intent with slate and book.
Or else, with joy and laughter,
We join the social feast,
Which brings the smile long after,
The hour of mirth has ceased;
We catch those love-lit eyes, as bright
As e'er they shone that long fled night,
And feel our glad heart leap.
And so we drift, forgetful,
Of all except the past,
'Til with a start, regretful.
We find ourselves, at last;
The drama fades before our eye;
We yield our loved ones, with a sigh.
Back, to relentless past.
Thus down the heights of Ages,
A mere yore in the throng,
All that our life engages,
Moves speedily along;
Small, small, indeed the part we play,
The hour glass wastes the sand away,
Ere half is sung, Life's song.
AFTER THE QUARREL.
LINDIE, chile, fo' Lawd sake, tell me
Whut's come ovah you an' Link?
Mos' fo' weeks since he's called on you,
Time he's comin' back, I think.
'Tain't no use to cry now, Honey,
Mussy! how de chile takes on!
Mammy knows well how yo' h'a't aches,
Done felt all, chile, fo' you's bo'n.
Felt dat, when yo' Pa wus co'tin;
Lawd! I've felt it day on day!
Honey, Sugah, hesh yo' cryin!'
Can't make out a word you say.
Oh, I see! Link's done got jealous!
Didn't I say it wan't so sma't,
Prancin' round, wid Elex Johnson,
When you know, Link's got yo' h'a't.
I go tell him dat you love him?
Lindie, ain't you goin' med?
Tink yo' Mammy'd stoop to dat trick,
Tink I'd frow you at his head?
Wha's de dignity I taught you,
While you growed up by my side?
Didn't mean it? Dat sound bettah,
Knowed you had Virginia, pride.
Honey, chile, yo' Ma feels fo' you,
Hash yo' cryin', brace up prim,
Don't you know dat Link is grievin'
Much fo' you as you fo' him?
Yes indeed! Link's not fo'got you,
He'll quit poutin' by an' by.
Den he'll love you mo'en evah,
'Twas dat way wid Pa an' I.
Dah, you laugh; dat's bettah, Honey,
But now mind, when Link comes back,
You leave Elex to Lize Posten,
An' jest trot on yo' own track.
SONG OF THE MOON.
OH, a hidden power is in my breast,
A power that none can fathom;
I call the tides from seas of rest,
They rise, they fall, at my behest;
And many a tardy fisher's boat,
I've torn apart and set afloat,
From out their raging chasm.
For I'm an enchantress, old and grave;
Concealed I rule the weather;
Oft set I, the lover's heart a-blaze,
With hidden power of my fulgent rays,
Or seek I the souls of dying men,
And call the sea-tides from the fen,
And drift them out together.
I call the rain from the mountain's peak,
And sound the mighty thunder;
When I wax and wane from week to week,
The heavens stir, while vain men seek,
To solve the myst'ries that I hold,
But a bounded portion I unfold,
So nations pass and wonder.
Yea, my hidden strength no man may know;
Nor myst'ries be expounded;
I'll cause the tidal waves to flow,
And I shall wane, and larger grow,
Yet while man rack his shallow brain,
The secrets with me still remain,
He seeks in vain, confounded.
INSULTED.
MY Mamma is a mean old sing,
An' toss as she tan be;
I'm doeing to pack my doll trunt,
An' doe to Ga'n'ma Lee.
My Mamma baked a dinger tate,
Den panked me shameful hard,
Dust 'tause I stuck my finder in,
An' filled de holes wiz lard.
If I was down to G'an'ma Lee,
She'd say "Ionie, shame!"
And fen I'ud tommence to ky,
She'd call me pitty names.
But Mamma, fus, she slapped my ear,
Den jerked me fum de chair,
And panked and flung me on de lounge,
An said, "You dus' lay dere!"
I'm doein' to tell my Papa, too,
Fen he tum home tonight,
He'll take me back to g'an'ma,
An' out of Mamma's sight.
An' fen she det so lonesome,
Like she did las' week, an' kied,
I won't yon out an' tiss her,
I'm doeing way, an' hide.
SOFT BLACK EYES.
SOFT black eyes, all pensive, tender,
Changeful as a shifting ray;
Now, in sympathy they linger,
Now, in mirth, they flash away.
Orbs of midnight, like a dart,
Doth thou pierce my aching heart!
Soft black eyes, half coy, half artless,
Half in earnest, half in jest,
Well I know thou art not heartless,
Yet thy tricks doth pain my breast.
Orbs of night, gaze a caress,
Thou, alone, my life canst bless!
Soft black eyes, so sweet and soothing,
Knowest thou from day to day,
My sad life in sighs I'm losing,
Sighing heart and soul away?
Let my plight, those stars molest!
Sympathy will give me rest.
RAPHAEL.
BEHOLD young Raphael coming back;
How long the time doth seem,
Since last he parted from the side
Of her, his sweetest dream.
And yet a fortnight scarce hath past,
Since last he left her side,
And saw these soft eyes fill with tears;
His love, his joy, his pride.
And now he's coming back again,
A husband's place to hold;
He seeks communion with himself,
And saunters 'cross the wold.
With polished rifle on his arm,
And hunting coat of gray,
His Pilot trotting at his heel,
With joy he winds his way.
Though Raphael is a marksman fair,
Of hunting over fond,
Ere yet, he lifteth not his gun,
To bring the good game down.
But now doth muse he from his dream,
And cocks his trusty gun;
For he hath reached the willowed dell,
Where deer is wont to run.
The day is calm, soft breezes blow,
And all is still as dawn;
Upon the lake, among the rush,
Are floating, flocks of swan.
Then saith young Raphael, as he gaze
On rush, and willows 'round,
"The truant deer hath sought the cliffs,
And naught but swan I've found."
I'll choose the whitest of the flock,"
Thus did young Raphael speak,
"As symbol of the pure young heart
Of her, whose hand I seek."
And so, adown the dell he peers,
And through the rush he sees,
A mass of downy whiteness there,
Half hidden by the leaves.
He lifts his gun, he takes good aim,
And forward Pilot start:
Triumphantly he lowers his piece;
He knows he's hit the mark.
Oh luckless youth, retrace thy steps!
The sight that waits thine eyes,
Will turn thy ebon locks to snow;
And waste thy life with sighs.
Oh deadly bullet, why so true?
What havoc thou hast wrought,
To turn into the deepest grief,
Young Raphael's noblest thought!
For there, half hidden by the rush,
Doth lie a heap like snow;
Poor Pilot whines and licks the face,
Of one full well he know.
And now, young Raphael's coming up;
He puts the rush aside.
And there upon the sward, beholds,
His game—his own loved bride.
One look reveals his waiting love,
All clad in snowy white,
Her angel face, her bosom red—
He groans—and all is night.
Oh young, heart-broken, weary youth!
God chasteneth whom he love;
Thy thoughts were ever with thy bride;
They never soared above.
But since the one thou lovest so well,
Hast flown to realms of rest,
Thy whole soul turneth to thy God,
And yearneth for the blest.
And when thy keenest grief is past,
And hushed thy deepest sighs,
Thou'lt deem her but an angel sent,
To lure thee to the skies.
A DOMESTIC STORM.
I'M goin' to whoop you, Sammy Taylor,
Done gone eat nigh half my pie!
"Please Ma, honest, no I never,"
Hesh dat tellin' me dat lie!
Here's de prints uv dirty fingahs,
As you tilted up de lid;
Here, you smeared de plate wid grape juice;
"Nom' I didn't" Yes you did!
Ma'ch yourse'f right in dis kitchen!
"Please, I didn't steal it Mum,
See, I've been out hunting bird eggs,
Jest got back afore you come."
Hunting bird eggs! didn't I tell you
Dat 'twas wrong to pester birds?
Thought I told you to mind Viney,
Don't you say another word!
Den you didn't steal de grape-pie,
Do some meanness doe you would;
Wonder, den, if Viney eat it?
Ef she did, I'll whoop her good.
Viney!. — "Ma'am!" —Ma'ch in dis kitchen;
Taint no use fo' you to cry;
I can see as plain as daylight,
Dat 'twus you dit eat de pie.
Eat dat pie Miss Julie sent me,
When Jim cya'ed de washin' home!
You knowed dat you'd got yo' po'tion,
Ef you went an' left it 'lone.
Ef you wont hear to Miss Vi'let,
Whut she teach in Sunday School,
Den I'll try anothah method,
I will whoop you to de rule.
Where's my switch? Jest ti'ed uv foolin;
Ought to done dis long befo!
0-o-o! Please Ma dont whoop no harder,
Honest! I wont steal no mo'!
Sit right down da' in dat cornah;
Stop dat sniffin'! wipe dat nose!
Ef I'd set, and let you do it,
Next you'd eat de house I s'pose.
An' you's been out huntin' bird eggs,
Spite uv all I said to you,
When I told you to mind Viney!
Dah, now! Dah! "Please, Mammie, oo-o-o!
"'I wont never steal no bird eggs,
Please quit whoopin' Mammie, do
I'll mind Viney good, the next time!
Guess you will, you rascal, you.
A LITTLE WREN.
A WREN dropped down on my window sill,
And his little feet was hid in the snow;
Yet he tossed me a saucy glance, as to say,
I'm happy out here where the ice wind blow
And life seems bright and cheerful as May;
And you inside in your soft armchair,
Seems half in content and half in despair.
And coyly he frisked about in the snow,
And the white flakes flew from his dainty feet;
And airily lifting his little right wing,
With latest wren etiquette me did he greet;
Then dashed he away, with a merry swing:
And I thought as he scurried away from my sight,
Contentment is his who reads it aright.
He was without and I was within;
Yet he had the sunshine, I had the shade;
With life as it was, he e'er could rejoice,
While I must be pampered, and comforts be made,
Ere I my jubilant joys could voice;
And I thought as I mused on the failings of men,
Which does God deems wisest, the sage or the wren?
IN THE VALLEY.
OH GOD! my heart is thine,
Content, am I in Thee;
Thy chast'ning rod but proves,
That Thou, abides with me.
I know Thou leadeth on,
But oh, the way is drear;
Naught, but the click of thorns,
Is sounding in my ear.
I cry, 'Thy will be done!'
My heart is with the cry;
Yet comes not light, nor peace,
To soothe my tear-dim eye.
My heart craves earthly things;
I feel its nature's claim;
Since Thou didst give me life,
Canst I discard an aim?
The hot blood stirs my brain,
And sweet dreams to me flock:
Alas! I see them wrecked,
Upon Ambition's rock.
Oh Christ! Come down to earth,
An elder brother, be;
And pilot Thou, my barque,
Which drifts, capriciously.
Oh wrench me from the toils,
Of this entangled mesh!
My spirit strives for Thee,
Despite the erring flesh.
ADDRESS TO ETHIOPIA.
OH, ill-starred Ethiop'an—
My weak and trampled race!
With fathomless emotion,
Thy dismal path I trace.
Thy bright and stalwart, swarthy, son
Thy meek-eyed daughters, fair,
I trace through centuries bygone,
Of misery and despair.
Thy fathers' fathers, long were taught
Nay, forced by tyrants, bold,
To worship at a mortal shrine,
With humble heart and soul.
So long hath slav'ry's blasting hand,
O'er thee its power swayed,
That now, though freedom sweet is thine,
I see thee cowed and dazed.
The sin is at thy tyrant's door;
The curse is at thine own;
And e'er will rest upon thy head,
Till thou wilt tear it down.
Oh! rouse thy slumb'ring manhood, strong!
A foothold boldly earn;
And scorn thy brothers' patronage,
When he's thy fellow-worm.
Tear down those idols thou hast built,
In weakness to the proud!
Knowest thou that in thy blindness, deep,
Thou desecrate thy God?
Oh! rise in union great and strong!
Hold each black brother, dear;
And form a nation of thine own,
Despite thy tyrant's jeers!
We need not reek in blood and groans,
This is a war within;
We need but conquer cow'ring self,
And rise a man, with men.
What though our number may be few?
Hath not the Jews long stood,
In unions strong, 'mid myriads
Of foes, who craved their blood?
Then, rise oh fainting Ethiopes!
And gather up thy strength;
For, by repeated efforts, strong,
Thou'lt gain thy ground at length.
The same God hast created thee,
Who did thy fairer brother;
Thinkst thou, that in His justice, great,
He'd prize one 'bove the other?
AUTUMN.
LIST to the sad wind, drearily moaning;
Moaning the fate of the choicest and best;
Seest those red leaves descending in torrents?
'Tis blood drops of warriors sinking to rest.
Many a volley they've turned in their glory,
Now, lack-a-day! They perish, all gory.
Ever they conquered and victory boasted,
O'er storm and o'er drought and vollies of rain;
Showing more strength when battle was over,
And bearing off laurels again and again.
Flushed with success, did they go forth rejoicing.
Now their ill-fate, the sad wind is voicing.
Fiercely the frost-king urged on his subjects,
Spreading destruction o'er hillside and fen!
Yet bravely they fought, not one e'er despairing,
Till gushing with life-blood, they fell down like men.
Now the pathos of death the last scene is lending,
Who'd have believe such a fate was impending.
LINES TO EMMA.
OH, could I but sing as the minstrels of old!
Whose beautiful love songs ring still in our ear!
In accents so musical, rhythmical, clear,
Now soaring majestical, now hov'ring near,
With passionate tenderness, shy and yet bold,
That enamored his lady-love, ruffled her breast,
And drew her frail form to his bosom, for rest!
Oh, could I, my sweetheart charm thus to my breast,
Methink overflowing, my cup would then be;
To gaze to the depth, of those eyes' liquid sea,
And cause them to waver and droop before me,
And to feel my glad heart throb wild with the zest,
While tenderly holding her in my embrace,
And feasting my eyes on her fair, angel face.
But alas I am luckless, dear Emma the best,
And sternly hath Cupid dealt fate unto me;
To stir my love passion, and yet let me see,
A maiden that yearneth another's to be,
And yearns not in vain, to be queen of his breast,
For my bosom too often has felt that keen dart
To be wrong in sounding a brother's sore heart.
UNCLE JIMMIE'S YARN.
DID I evah tell you, Sonny,
Well, a-he! he! he!
De trick I played in Dixie,
'Way back in 'sixty-three?
I wus wild an' full uv mischief,
An' reckless ez could be,
In dem rough ole days in Natchez,
'Way back in 'sixty-three.
I wus out a-for'gin', Sonny,
Well, a-he! he! he!
Out a-doin' debbilment,
Big man sah, who but me?
Had a smackin' big hoss-pistol,
'Long bout dis size, confound!
Jest to wa'm dem rebels' jackets,
An' make dem jump around.
It wus early Sunday mawnin',
Well, a-he! he! he!
When all de boys wus restin,
'Cept sma'ties, jest like me.
I, astride my coal black filly,
Cumed a-lopin' up de hill,
Whar I halted an' sot lookin',
Down Natchez, ca'm an' still.
I could see de great big buildins',
Well, a-he! he! he!
A-r'arin' up tha steeples,
Dat seemed a-sassin' me;
Den I pulled ole roa'in' Betsey,
An' aimed de cupelo.
Uv de co'thouse uv de rebels,
An' let de triggah go,
I wus handy wid a pistol.
Well a he! he! he!
My han' wus true an' stiddy.
Fuh I wus young, you see;
So my fust shot toe a slab off,
Nigh big ez dat ba'n doe;
Dat jest riled me wus dan evah,
So, once mo' I let huh go.
Den de othah side, I leveled,
Well, a-he! he! he!
She jest to'e tings to pieces,
Ez any eye could see;
So den, nuttin but de centah pa't.
Uv dat fine cupelo,
Was a-standin' now fuh Natchez,
De rest wus layin' low.
Den I loaded roa'in Betsy,
Well, a-he! he! he!
An' cracked it on de centah,
An' Betsy bawled out, Dee!
De centah pa't jest crumbled down,
Sho Sonny, yes sah ree!
So dat settled wid dat co't-house,
'Way back in 'sixty-three.
Den I wheeled, an' spurred my filly;
Well, a he! he! he!
An' put off fuh de barracks,
Ez fas' ez fas' could be:
I could heah de bullets whislin',
About my very head,
Fuh I'd hit de rebel's bee-hive,
An' dey answered me wid lead.
When at last I reached de barracks,
Well, a-he! he! he!
De captain standin' 'kimbo,
Wus fus man dat I see;
"Whut's you doin' to dem rebels?
You vagabond, he sed,
You raised mo' fuss an' smoke down dah,
Dan evah could ole Ned."
Den de laugh his eyes 'gin twinklin',
Well, a-he! he! he!
An' so I bust out laughin',
I seed dat I wus free;
'You'll git yo' fill uv fightin', sah,
You roscil!' Den, says he,
And dat wound up de co't-house scrape,
'Way back in'sixty-three
OH, WHENCE COMES THE GLADNESS?
OH, whence comes the gladness?
The joy fraught with madness?
The hopes and the fancies of childhood's bright day?
The weird exultation,
And rife animation,
That sets all the heart strings,
A-chord with the May.
From whence comes the Wonder-Land?
Likewise the Fairy land?
The halo encircling, the trifles of life?
The bright dream materialized?
The bear and wolf humanized?
The bugbear, the werwolf,
And fair water sprite?
Then searched I with lightness,
The summer sun's brightness;
There caught I a glimpse of this coveted mirth,
Then sought I the South Wind;
Among the rank clinging vine;
And caught it once more,
As it fled from the earth.
A KINDLY DEED.
A THOUGHT flashed 'cross a kindly mind,
It grew into a deed;
A deed, that stretched a helping hand,
Unto a brother's need.
That brother, strengthened by the deed,
In humble gratitude,
Passed on the blessing he received,
To do another good,
And on it went, and years passed by;
'Til, as the maxim run,
This deed, around its circuit passed,
Returned where it begun.
It found its owner sunken low,
In heartache's bitter groan;
The thought, the deed of that far day,
Proved but a friendly loan.
THE OLD FREEDMAN.
HE sits in front of the bright, blazing grate;
A poor old freedman, maimed and gray;
With worn hands folded, he sits and waits,
His Master's summons, from day to day.
His ebon brow is seamed deeply with care;
His dim eyes, robbed of their scanty sight,
By the dazzling red of the ember's glare,
Sets him to dreaming as thou 'twere night.
And his hard, early life comes, scene by scene,
As acts appear on a play-house stage;
While he sits with a thoughtful smile, serene,
And views the past, in a dreamy maze.
Yes, now he can smile as he thinks on those days,
For the fire of youth has long fled his breast;
He has cast the burden of past care away,
And humbly looks to his Master, for rest.
He hears the fierce screams of his mother, wild,
Anguished and startling, and loud as of old;
While haplessly he, her remaining child,
Is hurried "down the river," and sold.
And now comes the scene of that sugar farm,
Where the lash and fever, rules supreme;
Where the humid, sickly, atmosphere, warm,
Brings on a giddiness, e'en in his dream.
He is hoeing cane, with a stalwart pace,
And with him, a girl, the joy of his life;
With her graceful figure and dark brown face,
And her sunny smile— his own fair wife.
When e'er the overseer's back is turned,
He lends a strong hand to her lagging row;
That her exacting task may be earned,
To ward from her back, the brutal blow.
Despite the appalling crosses of life,
He deems himself, e'en a happy man;
Just to have her near and to call her 'wife',
And to hurriedly press her little worn hand.
The third scene is on, and now he behold,
His Lucy coming with eyes filled with tears;
"Oh Ruben," she's crying, "why I'm to be sold!"
The words fall like doom upon his shocked ears.
Again that dull giddiness rises within,
His lower limbs weaken, he rests on his hoe;
He feels her embraces again and again,
Then turns she, and back to the "big house" doth go.
Her fleeting form brings him back to himself;
He drops his hoe, with a desperate groan;
He'll make the rude trader take back his foul pelf
He'll claim his wife, for she is his own.
Oh, futile struggle! he sees his fair love,
Borne off by the rude, evil, trader, who spoils,
While he helplessly, calls on his Father above,
And is fiercely, brutally, lashed for his toils.
Oh, let us pass over the dark days that came,
And rev'rently screen this act of his life!
When the anguish of Rizpah, who mourned for her slain,
Could not be compared, with his grief o'er his wife.
And now, clears the smoke, that is black as the night;
He stands firm a giant with Gettysburg's brave
The death blows he deals, in the hand to hand fight,
Serve vengeance to rebels who late held him slave.
And now, he is come to the calm years of peace;
His restless wand'rings in search of his wife;
When despaired and discouraged, his wanderings cease,
And he fills with religion, the void of his life.
And now the last scene, the triumphant, the grand!
With dim sight renewed and infirmities, fled,
Fair Lucy once more is pressing his hand,
And Jesus is placing a crown on his head.
For there, in front of the bright blazing, grate,
With a sad, kind, smile, and expressionless eye,
At the end of the day, in the even, late.
He had taken his flight, to his home on high.
THE OLD YEAR.
INFIRM and aged, doth he sit,
And ponder on the gilded past;
His brilliant eyes, alas, death-lit,
Is like a spark, too bright to last,
And muses he on days now sped,
When he, a youth, with staff and thong,
Pursued the waning year, that fled,
And left him monarch brave and strong.
What happy days they seem to be,
Now that they number with the past;
But hark! those distant shouts of glee!
He cuts his musings with a gasp.
With bony hands he grasps his cape,
And wraps it 'bout his trembling form;
Then turns, a humped, decrepit, shape,
And flees the coming of the morn.
And as his wasted form doth drift,
All mist-like, through the frosty air,
Close in the rear, behold a rift;
And through it comes the glad New Year.

THE HOUSE OF FALLING LEAVES
I
OFF our New England coast the sea to-night
Is moaning the full sorrow of its heart:
There is no will to comfort it apart
Since moon and stars are hidden from its sight.
And out beyond the furthest harbor-light
There runs a tide that marks not any chart
Wherewith man knows the ending and the start
Of that long voyage in the infinite.
If change and fate and hapless circumstance
May baffle and perplex the moaning sea,
And day and night in alternate advance
Still hold the primal Reasoning in fee,
Cannot my Grief, be strong enough to chance
My voice across the tide I cannot see?
Page  14
II
We go from house to house, from town to town,
And fill the distance full of smiles and words;
We take all pleasure that our strength affords
And care not if the sun be up or down.
The way of it no man has ever known —
But suddenly there is a snap of chords
Within the heart that sounds like hollow boards,—
We question every shadow that is thrown.
O to be near when the last word is said!
And see the last reflection in the eye —
For when the word is brought our friend is dead,
How bitter is the tear that will not dry,
Because so far away our steps are led
When Love should draw us close to say Good-bye!
Page  15
III
Four seasons are there to the circling year:
Four houses where the dreams of men abide —
The stark and naked Winter without pride,
The Spring like a young maiden soft and fair;
The Summer like a bride about to bear
The issue of the love she deified;
And lastly, Autumn, on the turning tide
That ebbs the voice of nature to its bier.
Four houses with two spacious chambers each,
Named Birth and Death, wherein Time joys and grieves.
Is there no Fate so wise enough to teach
Into which door Life enters and retrieves?
What matter since his voice is out of reach,
And Sorrow fills My House of Falling Leaves!
Page  16
IV
The House of Falling Leaves we entered in —
He and I —we entered in and found it fair;
At midnight some one called him up the stair,
And closed him in the Room I could not win.
Now must I go alone out in the din
Of hurrying days: for forth he cannot fare;
I must go on with Time, and leave him there
In Autumn's house where dreams will soon grow thin.
When Time shall close the door unto the house
And opens that of Winter's soon to be,
And dreams go moving through the ruined boughs—
He who went in comes out a Memory.
From his deep sleep no sound may e'er arouse,—
The moaning rain, nor wind-embattled sea.
Page  17
MY THOUGHTS GO MARCHING
LIKE AN ARMÈD HOST
MY thoughts go marching like an armèd host
Out of the city of silence, guns and cars;
Troop after troop across my dreams they post
To the invasion of the winds and stars.
O brave array of youth's untamed desire!
With thy bold, dauntless captain Hope to lead
His raw recruits to Fate's opposing fire,
And up the walls of Circumstance to bleed.
How fares the expedition in the end?
When this, my heart, shall have old age for king
And to the wars no further troop can send,
What final message will the arm'stice bring?
The host gone forth in youth the world to meet,
In age returns —in victory or defeat?
Page  18
MATER TRIUMPHALIS
To Louise Imogen Guiney
FORESEEN in Eve's desire,
Foreborne in Adam's bliss,
The whim of a dream on fire
Has brought the world to this:
Foregone was the break of order,
Ere the Will was disobeyed
And the Angel at Eden's border
Stood with a flaming blade.
This was at the beginning—
What shall it be at the end!
For the first child borne in sinning
Will God or Nature befriend?
Eve's desire is yet burning
Fair women in country and town,
And Adam's bliss is turning
Empires and kingdoms down.
Page  19
Is this the worth of a story,
Is this the dream of a song—
A fabled blare of glory,
This battle of right and wrong?
O sweet, fair body of woman,
O strong, brave will of man —
Co-equal in the human,
Unequal in the plan!
The deeds of warriors vanish,
The words of martyrs die,
But never the heart can banish
The drift of Helen's sigh.
Jerusalem is forsaken,
Gomorrah is a lure—
Eve, once from her sleep awaken,
And Adam's kiss is sure.
Page  20
But God is yet the Master,
The dramatist of the play;
If He wove an act of disaster,
He wove an act to allay.
Deep in the dream's forebeing
The Artist was greater than life
Who smiled at His own foreseeing
The Virgin mother and wife.
Page  21
MESSENGERS OF DREAMS
MY heart can tell them, every one,
The messengers of dreams that run
Above the tree-tops in the sun.
Whether of great or little worth
They carry the heart's desires forth
East and west and south and north.
I know the night will close them in —
And they will meet the tempest's din —
Ere they come to that far-off inn.
The inn that stands on the bourne of hope,
Where Fear and Delight together cope
For victory on a little slope.
My heart can tell them, every one,
The returning messengers that run
Above the tree-tops in the sun.
Page  22
A WHITE ROAD
A WHITE road between sea and land,
Night and silence on either hand —
Pointing to some unknown gate
A white forefinger of fate.
I follow, I follow — I'll wend
My way on this road to the end;
Silence may keep to the sea,
On land no light shines free.
Bend low impenetrable sky—
Through your shades my road runs high:
It needs no stars to guide—
No measuring sea-tide.
I breathe the imperishable breath,
I trespass the bounds of death—
For my heart knows all the way
To the eternal day.
Page  23
TO ARTHUR UPSON
HOW placidly this silent river rolls
Under the midnight stars before our feet,
While we chaunt music of dead poets' souls
The treasury of Time has made so sweet.
This is my Charles, O Friend! the loving nurse
Of a boy's heart who dreamed life would be worse
Than death, if he gave not in future years
Some few more songs to those this river bears.
Ah, here we sit, the boy's heart grown to man's —
Westward from Cambridge, hid among the hills,
Breaks forth its source no wider than your hands; —
How like our own experience it fills
Here at this point its widening banks, as we
Grow out to fill our duties, to the sea!
Page  24
Here all the night is on us with its stars;
The pregnant silence tapers to a sound;
The river's crossed with pulsing silver bars
The distant lights reflect; upon this mound
We sit through this eternal hour of time
And read the book our souls have writ in rhyme:
Youth's golden chapters done in poetry —
But where this river here runs on to sea
By muddy flats, stone walls, and wharves that close
The glad impulsive welcome of its home,
So henceforth shall Time write our acts in prose;
Yea, and when God adds Finis to the tome,
This Dedicatory night our souls will blend,
To show, though life, true Friendship cannot end.
Page  25
ON THE DEATH OF THOMAS
BAILEY ALDRICH
(March 19, 1907)
I
WHAT sudden bird will bring us any cheer
Whose song in the chill dawn gives hope of Spring;
Can we be glad to give it welcoming
Though April in its music be so near?
Not while the burden of our memories bear
The weight of silence that we know will cling
About the lips that nevermore will sing
The heart of him with visions voiced so clear.
There is a pause in meeting before speech
Between men who have fed their souls with song;
The strangeness of an echo beyond reach
Cleaves silence deep for speech to pass along.
There are no words to tell the loss, but each
Of our hearts feels the sorrow deep and strong.
Page  26
II
The Wondersmith in vocables is dead!
The Builder of the palaces of rhyme
Shall build no more his music out of Time.
In the deep, breathless peace to which he fled
He sits with Landor's hands upon his head
Watching our suns and stars that sink and climb
Between him and our tears' continuous chime —
Sorrowing for his presence vanishèd.
Aldrich is dead! but the glory of his life
Is in his song, and this will keep his name
Safe above change and the assaults of strife.
Poet, whose artistry, his constant aim
Kept true above defections that were rife,
Death taking him, still leaves his deathless fame.
March 20, 21, 1907.

GOLDEN MOONRISE
WHEN your eyes gaze seaward
Piercing through the dim
Slow descending nightfall,
On the outer rim
Where the deep blue silence
Touches sky and sea,
Hast thou seen the golden
Moon, rise silently?
Seen the great battalions
Of the stars grow pale —
Melting in the magic
Of her silver veil?
I have seen the wonder,
I have felt the balm
Of the golden moonrise
Turn to silver calm.
Page  28
MADAME OF DREAMS
To John Russell Hayes
I KNOW a household made of pure delight,
That sits within a garden of quietness:
A welcomed visitor by day or night,
I win a refuge from life's storm and stress.
Ah, here no footfalls cease and then resume,
Nor sounds of closing doors nor creaking beams;
And throned within her favorite gold room
Amid the roses' perfume and the gloom,
I greet my smiling hostess, Madame of Dreams.
I know not how I won so dear a friend,
I know not of her family or her race;
Her voice is a sweet music without end
Unfolding the wistful beauty of her face.
She has known all the world's great tragedies —
Was at the ruins of Troy and Actium;
And her deep heart holds many memories
That are the ghosts of countless aching sighs
Dead lovers uttered ere their lips grew dumb.
Page  29
She seems so old from her experience—
With Egypt's queen she sailed along the Nile —
She heard Demosthenes' great eloquence —
Saw Camelot melt 'neath Arthur's golden smile.
But Time has dealt with her as with the sea,
Whereon it leaves not any scars nor seams;
And like a bud that breaks at last to be
A faultless rose June's dews and suns decree —
Beauty and Youth have crowned Madame of Dreams.
Page  30
TO FIONA
DEAR little child, whose very speech
Gives me joy beyond my heart's measure,
However far my years may reach,
Life can offer no greater treasure.
Loveliest flower in my garden of dreams!
Mine have been sweet like fairy stories —
But of all that have come true, it seems
Your babyhood brought the greatest glories.
All my life long I have tried to make
Dreams in a perfect song go winging;
I knew the wonder when you spake,
And your life went a lyric singing.
Page  31
TO FIONA
Nineteen Months Old
NOW my songs shall grow
Sweeter, year by year,
just because I know
You shall read them, dear,
When your little hands,
And your little eyes,
Babyhood expands
Into grown-up wise.
You will ask me then,
Reading what I write
Of my youth and then
Song of you took flight.
Darling, I shall say —
Just because I knew
In some future day
You would hold them true:
Page  32
"Father wrote these songs
When I was a child;
Now to me belongs
All his dreams exiled.
"Mine is all the joy,
Mine are all the tears
In the heart of boy
And the man of years."
This, my little one,
Is what you will say,
When my songs are done,
And my hair is grey.
But my songs I know,
Sweeter, year by year,
From my heart will flow
For your soul to hear—
When your little hands,
And your little eyes,
Babyhood expands
Into grown-up wise.

OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST
To John Daniel
THE earth is our Mother, but thou, thou art Father of us and of Time,
For all things now were not, when thou wast strong in thy prime.
There was silence first and then darkness, and under the garment of these
Was the body of thee in thy might with its infinite mysteries.
And God alone was aware of thy presence and power and form:
And out of His knowledge foresaw His will in thy calm and storm;
Answering unto His will he gave thee lordshipand crown,
And bade the kingdoms of man to worship thee and bow down.
For earth He made out of dust for change and defeat in the blast —
But thee He made eternal, through æons and æons to last
Page  34
Unmarked by sun or wind, supreme where thy waves are tost—
Not an inch of thy Beauty to perish, nor an ounce of thy Might to be lost.
Page  35
II
Between the morning-star and the sea
The black night hangs disconsolately;
Winds from the gates of the east arise
And crack the silence to the skies
Through which the long grey dawn can flee
Between the morning-star and the sea.
Between closed eyelids and the sea
An echo floats continuously;
The spirit wavers ere 'tis won,
As the east pauses ere the sun
Lights the whole world up, radiantly,
Between closed eyelids and the sea.
Between the sunlight and the sea
Time hoists her sails, pulls anchor free;
The ship of Life moves on its keel —
Humanity commands the wheel
And steers for one more Hope to be
Between the sunlight and the sea.
Page  36
III
The night being done
And the day begun
With the reappearance of the lordly sun,
To labor and cope
The earth gives scope,
And to every man the strength of hope.
With each new morn
There is reborn
Some effort which yesterday left forlorn;
For a little rest,
And a will to test,
Is the road that runs from worst to best.
No man is poor
Who can endure
The will to forget what is past and sure,
Of the change and fate
That participate
In defeats that passed him through last night's gate:
Page  37
Instead he is rich,
Who can forward pitch
His breast to the front of To-day— to which
The recompense
Must yield defence,
And Time surrender the consequence.
Page  38
IV
Over the world hangs the splendor of noonday,
The winds fold their echoes away in the offing;
Up the long coast comes a murmur of laughing
Where the little foam-waves and the sand-dunes play.
Here far away from man's hating and scoffing,
Time leads the sun home to the house of his dreams.
This is the way of the world in a vision —
Hope that's alluring, and desires that follow:
Tears that are eloquent, laughter that's hollow:
Beauty forever pursuing her mission. —
But I care not for these, —when the seas call low
Time leads the sun home to the house of his dreams.
Page  39
Greyness of dawn cannot dull the noon's brightness,
Shadows of even cannot mask it and darken;
Men of the world may pass through it, nor hearken
Beat of its pulses that make the stars sightless.
Triumphing out of the pause that is flightless
Time leads the sun home to the house of his dreams.
This is the joy of man's heart in its dreaming:
The midmost heaven of all his desire —
Farther than noon lo! the sun mounts no higher,
And Love in man's life is his noon-sun a-beaming.
Clouds full of silence, and sky full of fire,
Time leads the sun home to the house of his dreams.
Page  40
OCTOBER XXIX, 1795
Keats' Birthday
TIME sitting on the throne of Memory
Bade all her subject Days, the past had known,
Arise and say what thing gave them renown
Unforgetable. 'Rising from the sea,
I gave the Genoese his dream to be;'
'I saw the Corsican's Guards swept down;'
'Colonies I made free from a tyrant's crown;' —
So each Day told its immortality.
And with these blazing triumphs spoke one voice
Whose wistful speech no vaunting did employ:
'I know not if 'twere by Fate's chance or choice
I hold the lowly birth of an English boy;
I only know he made man's heart rejoice
Because he played with Beauty for a toy.'
Page  41
SONG OF A SYRIAN LACE SELLER
To Edward F. Burns
ON the sidewalk by the busy flow
Of peoples passing to and fro—
Where the wan winter sunlight falls
Across the grey gates of St. Paul's,
A woman of an alien race
Stands with a tray of fancy lace.
Swarthy of skin with raven hair,
A daughter of the Orient there,
Wearing her native costume yet
Of woven shawl and long head net —
And the long Syrian sunrise
Looking out from her curtained eyes.
The curious, intricate designs
Of every lace in faultless lines
Of ancient symbols she has made,
Turning her country's lore to trade:
The Orient's mystic sorcery,
In this far land across the sea.
Page  42
Out of the Common sharp and fleet
The cold winds blow across the street;
And their shrill voices seem to say:
Symbols and dreams have passed away —
And our wise western world decries
All their lost hidden mysteries.
Page  43
NYMPHOLEPSY
To Burton Kline
THE slanting gleam upon the wing
Of a swift-darting lark that flies;
A sudden shadow lengthening
Up the hill-side till it dies
Melted by the burning sun;
A star that shoots across the night,
The dews dissolving on the rose —
Ah, to see perfection won,
Beauty unfolded to the sight, —
And lose it, — lose it, when it goes.
I know that half our hopes are vain, —
Our finite ears pretend to catch
Beyond the stars a spheral strain;
Our Sentinel-souls forever watch
For that dim Spy they never stop;
We make our bodies clean and pure,
We fill our minds with lore and creed, —
Yet long before the curtains drop
The tired flesh cannot endure —
And much of knowledge do we need.
Page  44
Out of the twofold heavenly plan,
The mystical, creative will
Wrought forth the fine achievement Man—
Perfect, and yet imperfect still;
The dust beaten into shape
Is flesh artistic, hue and line—
Splendid, superb Masterpiece;
And closed therein from escape
As the sap within the vine,
The Soul that gives the dust increase.
Now which one shall I strive to turn
To life's best usage while I stay
Where suns and winds may touch and burn
Flesh— and faith and creed o'erlay
The soul? Must they be separate
In a world that nourishes both
To perfection's destined end?
Must my soul carry a dead weight
And stunt my flesh's imperial growth,
And thwart theInspiration's trend?
Page  45
TO DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI
GREETINGS, Master, take from me
Where thou art, beyond, above
Imminent touch of earth and sea.
May thy spirit there approve
This oblation of my love
Unto thee,
Sent from where I be and move.
How can death divide and keep —
Though it conquers sight and sound —
Silences so wide and deep
Neither Life nor Death can bound?.
In a circle winding round
Wake and sleep,
Souls that search and sweep are found.
Page  46
I salute thee, and rejoice,
Master, whom our hearts now own
Thine, as the one faultless voice
In the praise of Beauty blown
Since Keats' lips were turned to stone,
Ears from noise
Of a world whose choice is known.
Unto Beauty thou didst wed
Music, pure and absolute,
Till men's hearts agreed and said
Thou didst master Shelley's lute —
Time no longer can dispute,
Laurelled head,
Thy long memoried repute.
Subtle shapen melodies,
Thou, my Master, bidst arise,
Colored as the autumn trees,
Tremulous with sudden sighs,
How God's magic underlies
Earth and seas
Secret sounds like these comprise.
Page  47
APRILIAN RHAPSODY
STRAIGHT in the heart of the April meadows,
Straight in the dream in the heart of you;
Deep in the glory of gleams and shadows,
Flame and gossamer, green and blue —
Out of the nowhere east from yonder,
Out of the presences felt and seen,
Filled with the first unremember'd wonder,
Radiant with the memory of last year's green —
Straight in the heart of the April meadows,
Straight in the dream in the heart of you —
Spring —in the glory of gleams and shadows,
Flame and gossamer, green and blue!
Page  48
A SONG OF LIVING
To Dr. Marcus F. Wheatland
IT is so good to be alive:
To have deep dreams: to greatly strive
Through the day's work: to dance and sing
Between the times of sorrowing —
To have a clear faith in the end
That death is life's best, trustful friend.
To be alive: to hear and see
This wonderful, strange pageantry
Of earth, in which each hour's session
Brings forth a new unknown procession
Of joys: stars, flowers, seas and grass
In ever new guise before me pass.
To have deep dreams: ah me, ah me!
To bring far things close by to see;
To have my voyaging soul explore
Beyond my body's ponderous door.
To make my love from a thousand graces,
Seen in a thousand women's faces.
Page  49
To greatly strive: perform my share
Of work: for the world grows more fair
To him who measures Time and Fate
By what his laboring days create —
For work is the voice that lifts to God
The adoration of the sod.
To dance and sing: my body's praise
For being fair in many ways.
It hath no other voice than this
To thank God for a moment's bliss —
When art and heaven together trust
Joy to the perfection of the dust.
Times of sorrowing: yea, to weep:
To wash my soul with tears, and keep
It clean from earth's too constant gain,
Even as a flower needs the rain
To cool the passion of the sun,
And takes a fresh new glory on.
Page  50
To have clear faith: —through good or ill
We but perform some conscious will
Higher than man's. The world at best
In all things doth but manifest
That God has set his eternal seal
Upon the unsubstantial real.
Page  51
AVE AND VALE
OH far away across the beach
The mist is in the sunset,
And dreams lie low
In the silence of the foam;
Beyond the dim horizon
Where the creeping darkness pauses
I hear the grey winds calling
And they lead desire home.
O Ave to the evening star,
And Vale to the setting sun;
And a deep, deep sea across the bar
Where the grey winds call and run.
Page  52
Oh far across the hope of speech
A doubt is on desire,
And Love lies low
In the pauses of my heart;
My speech and silence hovers
On the verge of phantom futures,
While I watch the morrows dawning
And the yesterdays depart.
O Ave to the evening star,
And Vale to the setting sun;
And a deep, deep sea across the bar
Where the grey winds call and run.
Page  53
HOC ERAT IN VOTIS
I'LL leap to your desire
With a flight more swift than light,
Though your soul should be a fire,
And mine, a moth in the night.
I'll leap to your desire
As the lark does to the sun,
Though it can fly no higher
Than the topmost clouds may run.
I'll leap to your desire —
And I pray God night and day,
To set your soul on fire
And burn my dreams away.
Page  54
IN THE PUBLIC GARDEN
August, 1904
THE illumined fountain flashed in the pond,
It was purple, and green, and white, —
You and I in the crowd, and beyond,
The shining stars and night.
Beyond were the shining stars and the night, —
And near was the fountain at play.
— But ah, the dreams that have taken flight,
And never come home to stay.
Page  55
RAIN IN SUMMER
THE afternoon grew darkening from the west;
A hush fell on the air, and in the trees;
The huddled birds pronounced their prophecies;
The flowers bent their heads as if to rest
Now that the tide of the sun's golden seas
In one long wave swept off the earth's wide breast.
Up sprung deft shadowy patterns by degrees,
And nature's face her soul made manifest.
Lo, in the instant, slant, like a hanging string
Of silver glass beads, pendant from the clouds
The rain descends! Leaves sing, and wavering
The tall lithe grasses dance in separate crowds.
I stand and let my soul commune, it knows
The mystery that calls it from its close.

The ETERNAL SELF
To Vere Goldthwaite
THIS earth is but a semblance and a form—
An apparition poised in boundless space;
This life we live so sensible and warm,
Is but a dreaming in a sleep that stays
About us from the cradle to the grave.
Things seen are as inconstant as a wave
That must obey the impulse of the wind;
So in this strange communicable being
There is a higher consciousness confined —
But separate and divine, and foreseeing.
Our bodies are but garments made of clay
That is a smothering weight upon the soul —
But as the sun, conquering a cloudy day,
Our spirits penetrate to Source and Goal.
That intimate and hidden quickening
Bestowing sense and color with the Spring,
Is felt and known and seen in the design
By unsubstantial Self within the portal
Of this household of flesh, that doth confine
Part of the universally immortal.
Page  57
Beyond the prison of our hopes and fears,
Beyond the undertow of passion's sea —
And stronger than the strength earth holds in years,
Lives man's subconscious personality.
O world withheld! seen through the hazy drift
Of this twilight of flesh, when sleep shall lift
I shall go forth my own true self at last,
And glory in the triumph of my winning
The road that joins the Future and the Past,
Where I can reach the Ending and Beginning!
Page  58
THE HOUSE OF DEATH
LO, a house untenanted
Stands beside the road of Time;
They who lived there once, have fled
To some other house and clime.
Towers pointing to the sky
With long shadows on the ground,
Never shade a passerby,
Never echo back a sound.
Page  59
AT NEWPORT
Sunrise: Bateman's Point
HERE'S the land's end, just discerned
By the sheer fall, where the sea below
Runs less wild since the tide has turned,
And daybreak lingers weird and low.
Between the dawn and hovering night,
On the grey sea-roof of the earth,
A crimson circle lifts in sight
And Time gives day eternal birth.
Page  60
Sunset: On the Beach
I hear across the murmuring sea
The sunset cannon's sullen boom,
Whose distant dying echoes flee
Before the silence of the gloom.
The long pale shadows creep along
The dunes and over the water's verge;
A dusky sea-mist rises up
Above whose veil the ships emerge.
I know full soon the night will come,
And one shall find me waiting near:
Our hands will touch, our lips grow dumb,
And dreams steal on us unaware.
Page  61
SIC VITA
HEART free, hand free,
Blue above, brown under,
All the world to me
Is a place of wonder.
Sun shine, moon shine,
Stars, and winds a-blowing,
All into this heart of mine
Flowing, flowing, flowing!
Mind free, step free,
Days to follow after,
Joys of life sold to me
For the price of laughter.
Girl's love, man's love,
Love of work and duty,
Just a will of God's to prove
Beauty, beauty, beauty!
Page  62
A SONG OF THE SIXTH MONTH
GLAD, mad, and a bit sad too —
Face o' the rose in the eye of the sun;
God has dreamed and his work is done —
June's on the world, heigh-ho!
See how the greenish shadow raises
Patterns on the sun's flood of golden blazes
Round a pink, slim girl knee-deep in daisies.
What is this slow full sense of Time!
This great armada of chirp and song,
That are as a host of sails that throng
Across June's tidal sea of rhyme.
Buttercups and daisies, sing low, sing high —
Age is a fable, death is a lie —
And June's too good to tell us why!
Page  63
FROM THE CROWD
I WAS captive to a dream—
And only vague forms went by;
And the tumult was the sigh
Of the sea at the end of a stream.
The clangor of cars in the street,
Darkness and clouds overhead,
And out of the lights that spread
The crowds that part and meet.
As the foam of a wave will mark
The night with a shining track,
A girl's pale face turned back
Crossing the street in the dark.
It was only a second's glance,
But my soul leaped out to her:
I felt my shaken memories stir
The dreams of an ancient trance.
Page  64
LOVE LEADS HOME
NOW that all the twilight glimmers through the lane,
As of old, wandering, dreaming let us go;
Living so, tenderly, youth and love again,
Bringing back the past, dear, known unto us twain—
Tasting the happiness that we used to know.
Youth went from us long ago, fading like the foam
That a ship passing leaves trailing on the sea;
Seemingly youth may die, hopes may stray and roam:
Faithful hearts kept true and young will Love lead home —
Home to his first dwelling-place in the heart of thee.
Page  65
THE FULL HOPE
LORD of my life before whose will I yield
Lo! I withdraw the barriers of my pride;
Let my heart swell a windless evening tide
Till all the marshland of my past's concealed;
Let stillness in my ecstasy be sealed
Deep as the swelling sea is deep and wide;
Lord of my life, where all my dreams abide,
Take me into thy dwelling who am healed.
Ah, Love! we shall dwell here for ever more—
In this great dwelling of our Hope fulfilled;
Ever the past behind us, and before
The golden future. What the gods have willed
Of good or bad to enter at the door,
We shall dwell here until our hearts are stilled.
Page  66
A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE
FAREWELL
"A little while before farewell."
— WILLIAM MORRIS
A LITTLE while before farewell
What shall time say our lives befel
Between the summons and the hour?
Shall it be like a red rose-flower
Whose perfume is remembered bliss:
While thus in silence our souls kiss,
With no sad words to break the spell!
With no sad words to break the spell
A little while before farewell!
Only the longing in your eyes
To comfort me in Paradise.
And there behind the silences
I know the world's forgetfulness
Can change not, eyes that speak so well.
Page  67
Can change not, eyes that speak so well
Where my love lives imperishable.
And passionate words can say no more:
Nor tears show grief is oversore:
But just your sad eyes — O how strange
The loneliness! the sudden change!
A little while before farewell!
A little while before farewell:
How quick Time runs to strike the knell.
When the dim curtain covering me
Comes down from great Eternity —
O then, my love, let there be heard
One never-ending sigh and word —
The low-breathed, whispered, long farewell!
Page  68
TO BEAUTY
O MISTRESS of the world! Heaven's own dear child!
Priestess of Joy, and things that holy are;
Under thy smile men's hearts are reconciled,
And after thy light, they follow, as a star
Follows the moon across the tide
A constant wooer at its side.
And I will follow, follow thee so far
Across the tide of life, and will adore
And worship thee in visions evermore.
O Maiden of shy innocence I say
Thou art too fair to live in widowhood;
Since Keats, thy lover, sleeps in Roman clay,
For thee to be forsaken were not good.
I fain would be thy wooer,
Thou canst not find one truer,
For I will love thee in whatever mood
Thy sensitive and most delicate soul
Doth on my spirit work its sweet control.
Page  69
And it shall nevermore be truly said
The glory of the world hath passed away;
Ah, no! the heart of dreams shall raise its head
And Poesy again will hold her sway.
Oh, give me power to teach
The wonder of thy speech,
And give thy heavenly message to our day:
For the barren hearts of men have need
Of the humane influence of thy creed.
Page  70
SONG: TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW
TO-DAY and to-morrow, and the days that come after,
Springtime and summer and two seasons more;
The night full of tears and the day full of laughter,
And dreams that come in and go out of the door.
O Time that is fleeting too fast for our capture,
While the heart of our dreams beholds it pass by—
The yearning and burning, the desire and the rapture,
Till we home to the earth and we home to the sky.
Page  71
O harvest of dreams! when the sowing is over
And fulfilment of growth gives over all plying —
Ah, down the long sunset of life the heart-rover
Turns twilight to weeping and darkness to sighing.
We gather the harvest of dreams and we store them
Deep down in our hearts for the hunger that craves
When springtime and summer, — the laughter that bore them,
Sails away like a ship that we watch on the waves.
Page  72
LATE AUGUST
CHANGE of heart in the dreams I bear—
Green leaf turns to brown;
The second half of the month is here,
The days are closing down.
Love so swift to up and follow
The season's fugitive,
If thou must, make rapture hollow,
But leave me dreams to live.
Change of heart! O season's end!
Time and tide and sorrow!
I care not what the Fates may send,
Here's to ye, goodmorrow!

MALAGUEÑA
To Isabel Ward Carter
I HAVE named you Malagueña,
Malagueña, Malagueña —
Though your eyes have never burned me,
Nor your lips have spoke, and turned me
In a whirl of mad delight.
But the many stars that whisper
In the night,
And the vagrant winds that lisper
Through the day,
In the music of my dreams have learned to play,
Malagueña, Malagueña!
All things name you, Malagueña,
Malagueña, Malagueña —
Birds that sing in rangeless rapture,
And the glory that we capture
From the coronated rose:
All the passion in the ocean's
Ebbs and flows;
Ah, they fill me with emotions
Naught can tame,
When I seek you in the shadow of a name,
Malagueña, Malagueña!
Page  74
When I meet you, Malagueña,
Malagueña, Malagueña —
Shall we stop and gaze in wonder?
Nay, like winds that meet in thunder
We will close in tight embrace,
And my kisses flash like lightning.
On your face;
Then our souls will feel the tightning
Each to each,
Till remoulded into one they break in speech,
Malagueña, Malagueña!
Page  75
SONG: AS A NEW-MADE BRIDE
AS a new-made bride at the altar-stair,
I have given my life for good or ill,
To Song, my bridegroom: a mated pair
The bride shall do the bridegroom's will.
And we'll keep house as never before
Was household kept on the hill of dreams,
Where Beauty will be a sign on the door
From which Joy gleams.
Page  76
UNDER THE STARS
I TAKE my soul in my hand,
I give it, a bounding ball
(Over Love's sea and land),
For you to toss and let fall
At command.
Dear, as we sit here together —
Silence and alternate speech,
Dreams that are loose from the tether,
Stars in an infinite reach
Of dark ether:
Over and under and through
Silence and stars and the dreams,
How my emotions pursue,
With a still passion that teems
Full of you.
O what can the stars desire,
And what can the night fulfil,
Of a thousand thoughts on fire
That burns on my soul's high hill
Like a pyre.
Page  77
Does the flame leap upward, Where
God feels — and heat makes human,
Pity, in His heart —a snare
To win worship for a woman
Unaware?
If He made all Time for this,
O beloved, shall we not dare
To crown His dream with a kiss,
While each new-born star makes fair
Night's abyss?
Page  78
TEARS
I SAW the picture of your face woven in the rain;
All day long the rain fell, —fell into my soul;
I knew your heart last night was like music full of pain,
And from your wistful eyes I saw the sad tears roll.
Oh, silent are the heavy clouds, and silent is the heart,
And silence clothes the dreams that hold the future years;
But musical are raindrops, and eyes that droop apart
To let the music of your soul come flowing through your tears.
Page  79
SONG
FAILURE is a crown of sorrow,
Success a crown of fears—
From the Book of Life we borrow
Leaves to turn the years.
Art is but a joy divine,
God says yea or nay —
Love alone is worth the time,
Live it as we may.

A VISIT TO OAK-LODGE
To Nixon Waterman
THE Heights of Arlington were wrapped in snow;
And over all the carmine sunset flush,
Gave nature's face a woman's love-lit blush,
As if her heart dreamed of the spring below;
So high your house, dear friend, I seemed to grow
Up to the evening star, where in the hush
Of twilight, I did feel the pulses brush
My soul, rising from the city that we know.
At last I reached your door —you welcomed me
With your warm genial smile and close handshake,
And gave me greetings to your company —
Your friends, whom you made mine for friendship's sake.
And there before your blazing logs did we
Soon hear the voice of dreams upon us break.
Page  81
SONG: THE TRAIL OF STARS
WHEN mortals tread the trail of stars,
High is the heart, O high:
For all things else are of the earth,
But Love is of the sky.
The trail they tread is a path of dreams,
Where Love a-journeying goes
To a garden beyond the gates of night
Where blooms a flower Love knows.
Page  82
THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON
For His Eighty-third Birthday
BENEATH the bare-boughed Cambridge elms to-day
Time takes no flight in his unwintered heart;
Where fourscore years and three came to depart,
The vision shines that cannot burn away.
In perils of change his voice is still our stay,
Who kept the true direction from the start.
He knew no deed born from his thoughts apart —
And held his pen Truth's summons to obey.
O reverend head, take this our crown of praise,
On this, thy Birthday, hallowed by our love;
A soldier's honor and a poet's bays;
In public heed thy virtues held to prove —
Though long, we wish thee longer, length of days,
To lead us up the heights where we would move.
Page  83
WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS
For His Seventieth Birthday
SEVENTY years! The magic of youth
Wrought in the stern old age of Truth.
Seventy years has Howells grown
Through the infinite seen to the finite known.
Shed in his wonder of things commonplace
A mind of wisdom, a heart of grace;
Building life on the faith he had
That the world was neither too good nor bad.
Years has he reached of the liberal span
Vouchsafed the journey of mortal man:
And keeping good trust of soul and heart
The Master built him a palace of Art.
Page  84
"Open my heart and you shall see
Grav'd inside of it, 'Italy.'"
Open his heart and read inside,
"America " — writ with a passionate pride.
And this one symbol of hope and strife
Wove to his vision the magic of life.
At the end of a journey of seventy years
The painter who drew its joys and fears,
Its shape of body, its essence of soul,
The ways it travels to reach its goal—
Stands to-day in the glories they shed,
The laurel of greatness on his head.
The Master at Seventy! He it is knows
The way of perfection hid deep in a rose!
Page  85
THE SHEPHERD OF THE FLOCK
OF DREAMS
HE calls them out with a musical shout
From the folds that are lying nowhere;
And up they climb to the meadows of Time
Through the seasons of the slow year.
With bleat, bleat, bleat, on the road they beat,
On the great highways of vision,
Where I hear them knock, the long white flock,
With a rhythmical precision.
He follows them forth who values their worth
For the clothing of man's desire;
And he makes no claim for pelf or fame,
For he's far too rich to aspire.
His kingdom lies in the long sunrise
Of life, where the nations arose,
And he gathers his sheep from the fields of sleep
Where the hopes of the world repose.
Page  86
THE FIRST BORN
MY little babe was two hours old!
I came in from the wind and rain —
The summons gave me joy and pain —
More wonder than my heart could hold.
The winter afternoon was dim —
A faint light shone across the bed;
My wife with one dear arm outspread
Was holding the little life of him.
There on the threshold where I stood
I had no wish to speak or move:
For there God's presence did approve
This Mary of the Sisterhood.
Page  87
LA BELLE DE DEMERARA
HER face was a fair olive hue;
Eyes like a tropic night when dew
Makes the air heavy to the sea's rim;
Figure like a willow, subtle, slim,
That had the grace of a young queen;
Hair, as the Empress Josephine
Fashioned, when Paris bowed to her:
— La belle de Demerara.
I see it all as in a dream:
Georgetown's seawall, where the stream
Of Quality flows; among them moves
She, whom the city's pride approves,
What beauty gave and virtue crowned
When music charmed their lips to sound
This name their hearts bestowed on her,
— La belle de Demerara.
Page  88
Sir Francis Hincks, at Government House
On a gala night before her bows;
Out from England on duty sent
The Colonel of the regiment
Glides with her in the stately dance;
And in her soft vivacious glance
Chief-Justice Beaumont bends to her:
— La belle de Demerara.
O Poet who sang of Dorothy Q.;
I have a Great-Grandmother too,
Born in a British colonial place,
Sent to learn Parisian grace;
Who won all hearts in her demesne
By the Caribbean's warm blue sheen:
And large is the debt I owe to her,
— La belle de Demerara.

THE ANNUNCIATION OF THE VIRGIN
AS one who hath been dreaming all night long—
Some blissful, sweet, but dim foreboding dream,
Wherein the soul hath kissed some joy supreme
But knows not whence nor whither, sight or song—
Mary awoke 'midst her lone chamber's throng
Of chanting silences. Her soul did seem
Aware— as earth is at the dawn's first gleam—
Of strange primordial moods it gropes among.
With the day's full-blown rose of light she knew
Her dreams had been her marriage-bed with God;
Her soul now trembled in its nakedness
Before the Bridegroom: while her heart lived through
The consecrating, tender period
Till she should hold her Child with a caress.
Page  90
GOLDEN HAIR
ONCE I made a little poem out of golden hair,
I put it in a dream and sent it to a rose;
And in the early dawn when I walked the garden fair,
I saw you, dear, before you went as every shadow goes.
O golden is the web o' the sun, golden is the sea,
And golden is the rose's heart that makes the garden fair—
All golden is the shadow that's in the heart of me,
And golden is the buried dream shrouded in golden hair.
Page  91
GREY DAWN
THE grey dawn creeps on a shadowed sea,
And the morning-star is a ghostly beam;
And or ever the sun lifts silently —
O Love! was it a dream?
I felt you come like the light at dawn,
I opened my soul to envelop the gleam;
Ah, the Memory stays, though the day is gone —
O Love! was it a dream?
Page  92
IN THE ATHENAEUM LOOKING OUT ON THE GRANARY BURYING GROUND ON A RAINY DAY IN NOVEMBER
HERE in this ancient, dusty room
Filled with the rain-washed chill and gloom,
The wistful books stand 'round in hosts —
Familiar friends of forgotten ghosts
Who sleep in their narrow beds below
When daylight walks, and by them go
The unremembering city throng.
Here where dust and silence belong
I feel their presence in each nook
As if they too would stand and look
With me, out where the motley city lies,
With timid, unrecollecting eyes.
Page  93
I feel the damp creep round my heart
Because my thoughts have grown a part
Of the infinite, ancient sense of pain
Echoing voices in the rain.
How long its unassuaging cry
Has filled man's memory with a sigh
When wind and rain among bare trees
Has made even joy feel ill at ease!
Joy! —where that tortuous winding coil
Of slaves to duty, sweat and toil —
Does joy dwell there? this monotone
Of rain is far more dumb of groan.
How old the world is —yet I think
No man has yet had his full drink
Of joy, while life flowed in his veins
Or disillusion racked his brains.
How like a picture shadow-bound,
That street is 'cross the burial ground!
And from this room those forms out there
Are not so real as ghosts in here.
Page  94
AS SILENT THROUGH THE WORLD
SHE GOES
AS silent through the world she goes
Companioned by a withered rose,
Where nothing is, but all things seem
The heavy will of a ghostly dream:
Even so she knows not life from death,
Nor words from music's golden breath;
The wind's moan is the sea-moan's heart,
And Love from Grief dwells not apart.
Page  95
ENIGMAS
THE joy of the world is in a man's strength,
The sorrow of the world in a woman's tears;
Beauty lives and dies in a second's length,
And Time rolls on the years.
The battles of the world are in a man's dream,
The altars of the world in a woman's eyes;
Out of Eden follows one long far gleam
Till the last slow sunset dies.
Page  96
SIR WALTER RALEIGH
HE heard the four winds and the seven seas,
And voices inland under alien stars,
And drove ambition like auroral cars
Striking the hill-tops when the darkness flees.
Vain in his dreams, but brave in his vanities;
No carpet-knight yet versed in parlor wars;
And half a rogue when honesty debars
The desire to take the prize his fancy sees.
And yet he knew the silences of speech —
The leaf-heard utterance of April rains;
The echoes in the twilight out of reach
Beyond the dim horizon where it wanes.
And like the distant sea-wash on the beach
He sang a few sad tender lyric strains.
Page  97
ON BLAKE'S "SONGS OF INNOCENCE"
IF thou hast ever heard on a May morn
Within a leafy wood the wild birds sing,
And felt thy soul take joy in marvelling
How in such little creatures could be born
That pure melodious concert of the dawn—
Then thou dost know the ecstasies that wing
From pulse and passion when a dewy thorn
Is breaking from a rose-bud blossoming.
Such joy gave he, who sang the innocence
Of childhood — Blake, who was more child than man
In that grave wonder of his reverence
Unto which God revealed the visional plan
Of His Eternal Life: —the evidence
Smote him as Moses' rod —and music ran.
Page  98
THE BOOK OF LOVE
I HOLD the book of life in my hands
When I hold your face, and press your lips
To my lips in a kiss, and touch all lands
In a thousand dreams that sail as ships,
Out of my soul across your soul
To the ends of the world you keep,
Between each shadowy golden goal
Of your eyes, where the kingdoms sleep.
Shall I ever read the history through,
And learn the dates of wars and kings —
How nations fell and rose and grew?
Ah, life's too short for smaller things
When your face is mine — the world itself,
Of past and future and present in one;
A book God wrote for my heart's own shelf,
And bound in the bindery of the sun.
Page  99
TO LAURENCE HOPE
ALL the world of deep desire loves your song,
Touched of joy by starlight when the moon hangs low;
Filled with all the odors that arise and throng
All the secret memories delight can know.
Like your bulbuls singing when the dusk's in bloom
How your music stirs us till our joys make pain—
Pain the flower of passion's most tender doom,
Sum of all that life may lose and death may gain.
For the dreams you gave to music, sure and strong,
All the world of deep desire loves your song.
Page  100
First in you the poetess, throned high and crowned
In the soul of us who mate a dream to rhyme;
We who wander strangely in the lure you've wound
Flowerful 'round the passions you have made sublime
Was there ever poetess since Sappho sang
Who could match the fever of your pulsing blood?
Love that drew from the harp of life joy and pang,
How your playing rose and filled our hearts to flood;
We, your singing brothers, now chaunted and found
First in you the poetess, throned high and crowned.
Page  101
THIS IS MY LIFE
TO feed my soul with beauty till I die;
To give my hands a pleasant task to do;
To keep my heart forever filled anew
With dreams and wonders which the days supply;
To love all conscious living, and thereby
Respect the brute who renders up its due,
And know the world as planned is good and true—
And thus —because there chanced to be an I!
This is my life since things are as they are:
One half akin to flowers and the grass:
The rest a law unto the changeless star.
And I believe when I shall come to pass
Within the Door His hand shall hold ajar
I'll leave no echoing whisper of Alas!
Page  102
KINGDOMS AND HEIRS
UNDER the round blue sky,
Over the wide green sea,
Where the sun-robed hours fly,
The starred silences flee:
Where birth comes down in song,
And death goes up in tears —
Are the kingdoms that belong
To dreams' uncrownèd heirs.
Page  103
TO ROY ROLFE GILSON
YOU asked me out to spend the day with you:
How quick it passed across the face of heaven —
And yet it does not pass from out our hearts;
But in the valley of our memories
Stands as a twilight in a valley stands
Between the day and night —a moveless joy.
Page  104
WHITE MAGIC: AN ODE
Read at the Centenary Celebration of the Birth of John Greenleaf Whittier at Faneuil Hall, Dec. 17, 1907
WHITE magic of the silences of snow!
Over the Northern fields and hills, the moon
Spreads her veil o'er the wizardry below;
Amongst the ruined tree-tops is a croon
Of the long vanished populace of Spring;
There is a glory here
Where the lone farmhouse windows, glimmering
Across the snow-fields, warm the chilly air.
Peace is upon the valley like a dream
By Merrimac's swift stream,
Where his pure presence made the earth so fair.
Page  105
Time cannot tarnish the glory of the hills:
Tides cannot wear the immaterial winds
To outworn voids where no loud echo fills
The long beach-comber which the sea unbinds;
The moon shall light the sun ere these things be;
But sooner our glad hearts
Know not darkness from sunlight on the sea
Ere from the lips of Memory departs
Thought or speech unpraiseful of Whittier's life,
White magic of song and strife —
Strife for the right —Song for a sake not art's.
In the rough farmhouse of his lowly birth
The spirit of poetry fired his youthful years;
No palace was more radiant on earth,
Than the rude home where simple joys and tears
Filled the boy's soul with the human chronicle
Of lives that touched the soil.
He heard about him voices —-and he fell
To dreams, of the dim past, 'midst his daily toil;
Romance and legend-claimed his Muses' voice
Till the heroic choice
Of duty led him to the battle's broil.
Page  106
Song then became a trumpet-blast; he smote
The arrogance of evil in the State;
The indignation of his music wrote
A flaming wrath in councils of debate.
'Twas passion for the justice of God's word —
Man's common heritage
Fulfilled in the high name of Brotherhood.
The oracle and prophet of his age,
He led men doubtful between wrong and right
Through Song to see the light,
And smite the evil power with their rage.
He helped to seal the doom. His hope was peace
With the great end attained. Beyond his will
Fate shaped his aims to awful destinies
Of vengeful justice; —now valley and hill
Groaned with the roar of onset; near and far
The terrible, sad cries
Of slaughtered men pierced into sun and star;
Beyond his will the violence — but the prize
Of Freedom, blood had purchased, won to God
His praise that all men trod
Erect, and clothed in Freedom,'neath the skies.
Page  107
Let thanks be ours for this great passion in him;
And praise be our remembrance of his trust;
Blessings that no compromise could win him,
Like Ichabod, to soil his glory in the dust.
Let ours be, too, his spirit of forgiving:
We can but master fate
By the sure knowledge of our brothers' living —
Won by matching his virtues, not his hate.
Let the white radiance of his Inward Light
Be to us, step and sight
Up the steep road of life to Heaven's gate.

ON REVISITING NEWPORT BEACH
February 29, 1908
ONCE more I stand upon these sands, and gaze
Across the open sea. Five winters' suns
Divide that other presence of me here,
When up the windy crescent of this beach
I walked in rapt communion of farewell.
I leave the world behind me now — forget
My late and feverish intercourse with life
And its mixed motives of the city street:
Circumstance like a garment I've cast off
And bring my naked soul for your apparel,
O sands and waves and unconfinèd winds!
O sands! whose separate grains vast worlds condense;
O winds! whose wings do beat the discs of suns;
O mutable and everlasting sea!
Thou whose being wast mother of time and man —
I stand before you naked for your dreams
To clothe my soul with Hope and Strength and Light.
Page  109
OFF SHORE
LOOK out across the blue-green sea,
Look thither where the blue glooms lie —
Beyond the bourne of mystery,
Between the sea-rim and the sky.
Oh look— and look across the deep
Sundering, indivisible flood —
Secretive as the doom of sleep
That falls on man's ancestral blood:
Look out and gaze from vanished eyes
That longed for home from Tyrian ships;
Look out from ruined destinies
That burn behind the blood's eclipse;
Look from the stare when Adam saw
God spread Creation at his feet;
As Moses, when the Stones of Law
God gave him where the whirlwinds meet:
Page  110
Look out across the blue-green sea,
Look thither where the blue glooms lie —
There still is Canute's mystery,
And mocking Plato's inner eye.
Oh look with Shakespeare's teeming brain,
And look with Voltaire's biting scorn —
Behold the sudden rush of rain —
The miracle's unborn!

L'ENVOI
LORD of the mystic star-blown gleams
Whose sweet compassion lifts my dreams;
Lord of life in the lips of the rose
That kiss desire; whence Beauty grows;
Lord of the power inviolate
That keeps immune thy seas from fate;
Lord of the indestructible dew
Fresh, as the night the first rose drew
Its moisture to her heart and won
Ease from the first day's burning sun;
Lord of the pomp a crown endows
And peoples hail on kingly brows;
Lord of the beggar's tattered coat,
A derelict on life's sea a-float;
Lord of thy blinded children, they —
Who see no sunlight in the day,
Nor star-shine in the night —but be
Dreamless toilers on land and sea;
Lord, Very God of these works of thine,
Hear me, I beseech thee, most divine!
Lord I praise thee, and adore thee
For thy great works laid before me.
My prayer-book is thine open air
Where nature prints thy Laws so clear;
Page  112
My altar is the human strife
Where I take sacraments of life;
My proof in immortality
Speaks loud in every blossoming tree.
Lord, Very God, now lift I my voice
Thanking thee for that which I rejoice —
Thy gift of life, be it short or long,
And with it the great gift of song!

        <collex:text>Memorial Day
Go;--for 'tis Memorial morning--
Go with hearts of peace and love;
Deck the graves of fallen soldiers;
Go, your gratitude to prove.
Gather flow'rs and take them thither,
Emblem of a nation's tears;
Grateful hearts cannot forget them,
In the rush of passing years.
Strew the flow'rs above their couches,
Let thy heart's affection blend,
With the dewy buds and blossoms,
That in fragrant showers descend.
Strew the flow'rs above the heroes,
Slain for loving friends and thee;
Canst thou find a better off'ring,
For those sons of liberty?
While the buds and blooms are falling,
Earnest hearts are asking,--Why--
In a tone, though low and gentle,
Yet, as ardent as a cry,--
'Why must precious lives be given,
That our country may be free?
Is there not a nobler pathway
To the throne of liberty?
'Can we choose no nobler watch-word,
Than the ringing battle-cry,
Harbinger of strife and bloodshed,
Must we sin, that sin may die?
'Long ago, to far Judea,
Came the blessed Prince of Peace;
Shall we ever heed His teaching,
That these wars and feuds may cease?'
Jimmy’s Pet Superstition
Teacher, Jimmie's toe is bleedin';
Stumped it, comin' down the road;
I jest knowed that he would do it,
'Cause he went an' killed a toad.
Teacher, you jest ought to see it;
Oh, the blood's jest spurtin' out!
You won't ketch me killin' toad-frogs,
When I see them hoppin'bout.
"Oh, now, Johnny, that's all nonsense!
I told you sometime ago,
That the killing of a hop-toad
Wouldn't make you hurt your toe;
"Who told you that silly story?"
Grandma said that it is so;
She's much older than you, teacher,
An' I guess she ought to know.
"Come, now, Johnny, don't be saucy;"
Teacher, grandma did say so,
An' she says:'You No'thern cullud,
Don't b'lieve nothin' any mo'.
'Cause you say there ain't no speerits,
'Tain't bad luck to kill a cat,
Dog a-howlin' ain't no death-sign,
An' you've made me b'lieve all that.
But I jest can't b'lieve this, teacher,
'Cause I'm 'fraid to -- Don't you see?
Bet you wouldn't b'lieve it either,
Ef you went barefoot, like me.
The saddest day will have an eve,
The darkest night, a morn;
Think not, when clouds are thick and dark,
Thy way is too forlorn.
For, ev'ry cloud that e'er did rise,
To shade thy life's bright way,
And ev'ry restless night of pain,
And Ev'ry weary day,
Will bring thee gifts, thou'lt value more,
Because they cost so dear;
The soul that faints not in the storm,
Emerges bright and clear.
HIS ANSWER.
He prayed for patience; Care and Sorrow came,
And dwelt with him, grim and unwelcome guests;
He felt their galling presence night and day;
And wondered if the Lord had heard him pray,
And why his life was filled with weariness.
He prayed again; and now he prayed for light;
The darkness parted, and the light shone in;
And lo! he saw the answer to his prayed--
His heart had learned, through weariness and care,
The patience, that he deemed he'd sought in vain.
DOUBT.
A doubt crept into a heart one day;
The brave heart said: "Twil be gone tomorrow;'
Ah, little it knew!
For it steadily grew,
Till it covered that heart with a pall of sorrow;
And there came at length, a darksome day,
When the hope of life seemed gone for aye.
A ray of light, in a darkened heart;
Yes, only a ray, but it grew more bright,
And it steadily spread,
Through darkness and dread,
Till it flooded that heart with a glorious light;
And a soul gave thanks to its God, above;
The light was a Savior's guiding love.
THE AFTER-GLOW OF PAIN.
A youth, with proud heart, pure and strong,
And eye with hope aflame,
Goes forth to join the busy throng,
And win success, and fame.
He presses on, with eager feet,
Adown the sunny way;
As yet, he knows naught of defeat,
And to the struggling ones he meets,
Gives little sympathy.
But soon the dark clouds gather' round,
The storm breaks overhead,
The wild winds howl, the rain comes down,
The lightning flashes red.
But when, the last cloud swept away,
The sun shines out again,
The youth emerges from the fray,
With softened heart, and sympathy,
The afterglow of pain.
A maiden, full of life and love,
Goes singing on her way;
To measured strains her light feet move,
And joyous is her day.
A transient shade comes o'er her face,
When told some tale of pain,
But soon a bright smile fills its place,
The song that slackened, for a space,
Goes lightly on again.
But hark! the song at last is still;
The smiles are changed to tears;
Dark, troubled thoughts, her young heart fill,
And doubts, and gloomy fears.
"Ah me!" we say, "her song is o'er,
And 'twas a joyful strain,"
But list! the maiden sings once more,
A sweeter song than e'er before,
The afterglow of pain.
'Tis thus, 'tis thus, the infant dies,
The parents look above;
False friends deceive us on the way,
We seek the Greater Love.
And so the threads of grief, that run
Through life, may prove our gain;
The noblest deeds that e'er were done,
The sweetest songs that e'er were sung,
Are afterglows of pain.
IF THOU SHOULDEST RETURN.
If thou shouldst return with the sweet words
of love,
So earnestly spoken that day,
Methinks that thy words, this sad heart would
move,
For my pride has melted away;
And I've learned how true was the heart that
I spurned,
And I've longed for the face that never returned.
If thou shouldst return to claim me thy bride,
How gladly thy fate would I share;
How gladly I'd spend my whole life at thy
side,
How honored I'd feel to be there;
Oh, I've learned to revere the heart that I
spurned!
And I long for the face that never returned.
If thou shouldst return, ah, vain is the dream!
I'll cherish the fancy no more;
Though dark and forsaken my pathway may
seem,
I'll press bravely on as before;
And trust in the One who forgives our
mistakes,
And heals the deep wounds that our wayward-
ness makes.
MRS. JOHNSON OBJECTS.
Come right in this house, Will Johnson!
Kin I teach you dignity?

Jest because you wan'to play.
Whut does po' white trash keer fah you?

An' a-givin' you the blame.
Don't come mumblin' 'bout their playthings,

'Twus the best that I could git you,
An' you've got to make them do.
Go'n' to break you fum that habit,
Yes, I am! An' mighty soon,
Next, you'll grow up like the white-folks,
All time whinin' fah the moon.
Runnin' with them po' white children--
Go'n' to break it up, I say!--
Pickin' up their triflinn' habits,
Soon, you'll be as spilte as they.
Come on here, an' take the baby--

'Fo' I'll have you runnin' with them,
I won't let you play at all.
Jest set there, an' mind the baby
Till I tell you --You may go;
An'jest let me ketch you chasin'
Aft' them white trash any mo'.
PARTED.
She said she forgave me;
I looked in her eyes,
And knew that her words were true;
For one blissful moment,
I felt my hopes rise,
And sought I, my vows to renew.
But, something I missed,
In her calm, steady, gaze,
Caused the love words to die, e'er they came;
For, though her kind heart,
So freely forgave,
Still, I knew that it was not the same.
For, once, that pure heart,
Was all, but my own;
Well I knew, how it quickened its beat,
How those sweet, gentle, eyes,
With a soft luster, shone,
At the sound of my coming feet.
But little I valued
The pearl I had found,
And carelessly cast it away,
For one, whose gay laugh
Proved a meaningless sound,
And whose heart was all vanity.
And when I returned,
For I'd learned her true worth,
As I sadly gazed in her eyes,
I knew that her love
Had died at its birth,
I had lost forever, my prize.
AN OPENING SERVICE.
"Holy, holy, holy!" the choir chants sweet
and low,
And earnest hearts are lifted up in prayer;
The organ's mellow cadence peals solemn,
soft, and slow,
And God is with His people, gathered there.
"Holy, holy, holy!" they bow before His will;
The pastor's tones rise solemnly o'er all:--
"The Lord is in His temple, let all the earth
be still;"
A deep calm regins throughout the sacred hall.
"Holy, holy, holy" Who would not humbly bow,
Before such holiness, such love divine?
And leaving pride and folly, join with His
people, now,
In faithful worship, at so pure a shrine.
"Holy, holy, holy!" their full hearts swell
within,
As o'er and o'er they hear the soft refrain;
And when, the service ended, the choir rings
out 'Amen',
A hundred voices mingle in the strain.
THE CHRISTMAS RUSH.
Well, we went down town a-shopping,
My brother and sister and I;
'Twas just two days before Christmas,
With Ev'rything yet to buy.
There were gifts for nieces and nephews,
And trinkets for sister and me,
There were sweets for the Christmas dinner,
And things for the Christmas tree.
We felt there was pleasure before us,
When we cheerfully boarded the train,
But we found 'twas only business,
Ere we reached our home again.
The streets were crowded with people,
And at last when we reached the stores,
There was such a mass of shoppers,
We could scarcely pass through the doors.
We forced our way to the counter,
This bitter truth to learn--
That others were there before us,
So we must await our turn.
At last it came, and we purchased,
And then--'twas enough to derange!
We had the self-same experience,
Awaiting our parcels and change.
'Twas the same at ev'ry counter;
'Twas the same at ev'ry store;
Just pushing and crowding and waiting,
And seemingly, nothing more.
Well, after much taxing of patience,
Our Christmas shopping was done,
And laden with many parcels,
We gladly started for home.
But the crowd had almost doubled,
When we came out on the street,
And, but for the good-will of Christmas,
We'd have lost our tempers complete.
It seemed that half of the city,
Had come out a shopping, that day,
While half stood at the show windows,
To look, and to block the way.
We tried to rush -- it was useless,
Of course we missed our train,
Then waited an hour for another,
And at last we reached home again.
And now, a few words of counsel,
I would kindly give, by your leave,--
Don't put off your Christmas shopping,
Till the day before Christmas eve.
AN AUTUMN DAY.
I sat in the door of our cottage,
One golden autumn day,
And the breezes stirring the tree-tops,
Were as soft as those of May.
But looking away to the woodland,
Through hazy autumn air,
The red and gold of the forest leaves,
Proclaimed the frost-touch there.
The grass was still green in the pasture,
Where soft-eyed cattle trod,
And down in the deep, sheltered valleys,
Were asters and golden rod.
But I knew the merciless frost-king,
Would come with might, erelong,
And blast all the green things remaining,
And still the sweet bird-song.
So my heart drank in the warm beauty,
Of that soft autumn day,
With a wistful love for ev'rything,
So soon to pass away.
I'LL FOLLOW THEE.
My Saviour, let me hear Thy voice tonight,
I'll follow Thee, I'll follow Thee;
The clouds that overhang my way, obscure
the light,
And all is dark to me.
I'd hear Thy voice above the tempest's shriek;
I'll follow Thee, I'll follow Thee;
And though my sight be dim, my spirit weak,
I'll trust, though naught I see.
I'd feel Thy arm, supporting in the dark;
I'll follow Thee, I'll follow Thee;
For Thou canst fan to flame, faith's sinking
spark,
And seal my loyalty.
I shall not sink, dear Lord, When Thou'rt my
guide,
I'll follow Thee, I'll follow Thee;
Though lashed by heavy waves, on ev'ry side,
I'm safe, when Thou'rt with me.
THE EASTER LIGHT.
'Tis Lent, the holy time of fast and prayer;
Of meditation and repentant tear;
When saints bow humbly 'neath the cross
they bear,
Treading the path of duty, without fear.
But one remains within her quiet room,
And looks with sadness, out upon the town;
Lent brings her nothing, to dispel the gloom,
That hovers o'er her path, and bears her
down.
What matter, if the bells chime sweetly, now,
Calling the many worshipers to prayer?
No holy light breaks o'er that clouded brow,
She does not care to mingle with them,
there.
Into her life, the hand of Death has come,
Bearing her truest, best beloved, away;
And now, her heart, all wretched and forlorn,
Is crying out to Death, incessantly:--
"Oh Death! give back my best beloved again;
Give back my own, thou heartless, tyrant,
king!
Seest thou my bleeding heart, all rent in twain,
And carest thou not, that thou hast done
this thing?"
'Tis Easter morn; the lenten fast is o'er;
A risen Savior bids the glad world sing;
The grave is open; Death has pow'r no more,
For Christ has robbed him of his deadly sting.
The church is crowded with a happy throng;
O'er banks of flow'rs, the softened sunbeams
play;
The choir bursts forth, in glad, triumphant,
song:
"Oh earth, rejoice! The Lord is ris'n today."
A dark-eyed girl comes slowly down the aisle,
Her face marked deep, with bitterness
and pain;
The choir is singing joyfully, the while,
"Rejoice, rejoice! for death has ceased to
reign."
The maiden lists the song, half bitterly,--
"Well may they sing, they've never wept
in vain,
They've ne'er had cause to ask, unceasingly,
'Where shall I find my lost beloved again."
But listen! one is singing all alone;
Her rich voice, welling up so full and clear,
Throbs ever, with a sad, sweet, undertone,
Telling, she, too, has met some trial here.
And now her voice sinks soft as falling dew;
Now rising high, it seems to pierce the dome;
The undertone e'er throbbing sweet and true--
She, too, has suffered, but has overcome.
She sings today, that some o'erburdened
heart,
May find that light that shines within her
own;
The maiden listens--ah! the hot tears start,
And melts the ice, that o'er her heart has
grown.
The thoughtless ones gaze at her, wond'ringly;
'How can she weep, when all the world
is bright?'
While others gaze, with kindly sympathy,
Knowing her heart has found the Easter
light.
UNCLE RUBE ON THE RACE PROBLEM.
'How'd I solve de Negro Problum?'
Gentlemen, don't like dat wo'd!
'Mind me too much uv ol' slave times,
When de white man wus de lo'd.
Spoutin' roun' about 'My niggahs',
Knockin' us fum lef' to right,
Sellin' us, like we wus cattle,
Drivin' us fum mawn till night,--
Oh, you say, I'm off de subjec';
Am a little off, I see,--
Well, de way to solve de problum,
Is, to let de black man be.
Say, 'you fail to ketch my meanin'?'
Now, dat's very plain to me,
Don't you know, you whites is pickin'
On de blacks, continu'ly?
Jes' pick up de mawnin' papah,
Anywhaur you choose to go,
When you read about de black man,
You may bet it's somepin low.
It's all right to tell his meanness,
Dat's, pervided it is true;
But, why, in de name uv blazes,
Don't you tell de good things too!
No, I ain't a-cussin' either!
Ef my blood wus young an' waum,
Guess I'd sometimes, feel like cussin',
How you whites is takin' on.
Still, I don't hol'wid dat business,
Leave dat, fah you whites to do --
Cussin' an' a-suicidin',
When de whole land b'longs to you.
Den, agin, ez I wus sayin',--
Ef a black man makes a mawk,
Seems you white-folks will go crazy,
Try'n' to keep him in de dawk.
An', ef he don't watch his cornahs,
An' his head ain't mighty soun',
Fust he knows: some uv you white-folks
Done reached up, an' pulled him down.
Whut you say? I'm too hawd on you?
Whut you 'spected me to do,
When you axed me, my opinion?
Tell you somepin' wusn't true?
Co'se dah's some exceptions 'mong you,
An' I ain't denyin' it;
But dah's mighty few, I tell you,
Dat kin say: 'Dis shoe don't fit.'
Yes, you say some blacks is 'on'ry;'
So is many uv de whites;
But de black race mus' be perfec',
'Fo' we git ou' 'equal rights.'
Foreign whites, fum ev'ry nation,
Finds a welcome in dis lan',
Yet, dah seems to be no welcome
Fah de native cullud man.
You don't have to 'tote his skillet,'--
Ez de folks in Dixie say,--
Only, when you see him strugglin',
Don't you git into his way.
Co'se, ef you is got a mind to,
You kin lend a helpin' han',
But de best help you kin give him,
Is, to treat him like a man.
Look at all de great improvement,
He has made since he wus free;
Yet, de white-folks keep a-wond'ring,
Whut's his future go'n' to be.
All time talkin' 'bout his meanness,
An' de many things he lack,
Makin' out dey see no progress,
Doe dey're try'n' to hol' him back.
Oh, it ain't no use in talkin',
Ef you whites would jest play faiah,
All de wranglin' 'bout dis problum,
Soon would vanish in de aiah.
Once dey couldn't find no method,
Dat would put down slavery,
Till it like to split de country,
Den, dey set de black man free.
Dat's de way wid dis race problum:
Ef de white-folks had a min',
Dey could fin' a answer to it,
Like dey did de other time.
Co'se, dah's two sides to dis problum,
An' dah's things de blacks should do,
But I'm talkin' 'bout you white-folks,
And de pawt dat b'longs to you.
'Don't know whaur to place de black man?'
He will fin' his place;-- You'll see!
Like de foreign whites is doin',
When you learn to let him be.
'Den, you feah amalgamation?'
When de black man takes his stan',
Don't you know he'll squar' his shoulders,
Proud, dat he's a Af'ican?
In dis lan', to be a black man,
Isn't called a lucky thing;
An' dat's why some fools among us,
Think it smawt to mingle in.
An' you white-folks isn't blameless,
Some uv you is in dat too,--
Takin' ev'ry mean advantage,
Dat is in yo' powah to do.
But, de race will reach a station,
Whaur de blindes' one kin see,
Dat 'tis good to be a black man,
Jest ez sho', ez sho' kin be.
Den, agin, sometimes I'm thinkin',
Dat dis 'malgamation fright's
Jes' got up by you smawt white-folks,
Keep fum givin' us ou' rights.
Fah, ef now; in all her trials,
Mos' uv us stick to de race,
You know well, we won't fahsake her,
When she gits a honored place.
'Be a nation in a nation?'
Now you're talkin' like a fool!
Whut you mean by '"Plur'bus unyun?--
Many nations 'neath one rule.
Not go'n' back on dat ol' motto,
Dat has made yo' country's name,
Jest because de race you brung here,
Ax you fah a little claim?
Well, I 'spec' I mus' be goin',
Gittin' kinder late, I see;
Guess nex' time 'Ol' Rube' is passin',
Gentlemen, you'll let him be.
Oh, you say, 'you bah no malice,'
Well, I'd ruther have it so,
But I'll hol' up fah my people,
Whethah folks like it or no.

PREFACE.
To all who may perchance peruse the pages of this book 
These lines are written.
To all who may misunderstand their meaning full these lines
Are dedicated.
To those of studious nature who are wont to criticise
They are submitted.
To those whose comprehension will allow them to enjoy
They are dictated.
To those whose curiosity may cause them to obtain
This book to read it;
To those who in their lonely hours would be consoled awhile,
Or who may heed it;
To those who love to read the inmost feelings of a soul
Lonely and blighted;
To those whose hearts are kind and good and who with simple things
Are much delighted;
I recommend these unkempt lines with pleasure and good will
To entertain them:
These murmurings of ill content and happiness combined
With love of nature.
Encompassing the remnant of ambitions, circumstance
Of which restrained them
From measuring their height, yet have not their persistence lost
Nor temperature.
Charles Fred. White.
FOREWORD.
If you had been deprived of an education in your early youth; if then you had run away from home to obtain that education and found, after some ten or eleven years of knocking and being knocked about, that you could not save money enough out of your scant earnings to pay for your schooling; if, during those years, you had traveled through nearly every state between Boston and San Francisco and from Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas to the southern part of Canada, being compelled to work, generally, in menial positions if you wished to keep from starving; you would not think you had been very fortunate in life.
If you had walked the streets of a great city by day, sometimes with only five cents in your pockets and only a scant meal in your stomach for several hours, and all one December night stood in the archway of a church door to rest from a weary day of job hunting; if you had lived upon scant means, compelled to support yourself, often being physically hungry in an endeavor to satisfy your mental hunger for knowledge; if, again, you had been compelled to leave school for a year or two because of lack of means; you would think that yours was indeed a hard, rough lot.
If your dear, grayhaired grandmother, whom you had taught to write while yet you were a child in turn for her reading, self taught, the Bible to you, had told you how she was cruelly sold from her mother and sisters while but a mere girl and that she had never again seen any of them; if she had pictured to your infant mind, while tears came stealing down her cheeks, the inhuman beating and torture administered to her and her fellow slaves by her "Christian" masters; if she had bared her arm, her back, her breast, and showed unto your childish vision the cruel scars, the heritage of all her life of bonded toil, which she would bear until her death; if she had afterwards told you how beastly, how shamefully, how disgracefully she had been treated by those Caucasian brutes, who distorted the Holy Word into sponsor for their crime; if your grandfather had described to you as you sat upon his knee the indignity and torture heaped upon him and his while he was a slave; if your own mother
 and father, born in slavery. had related to you the insult, wrong and injustice meted out to them after the war by their good white friends of the South, which they had left never to return; you would hardly feel that any folk but black folk were your friends.
If you had served your country in the ranks of the volunteer army in foreign war, when that country did not protect your life, nor even your property, at home, when you could not be sure that upon your return you would not find that some friend or relative had been despoiled of life, liberty or property without due process of law; if you had afterwards arrived one day in Denver, Colorado, tired and hungry, and been refused anything to eat in three or four public restaurants, notwithstanding you had offered money to pay for it, especially when you were neatly dressed and well behaved; if you had plodded wearily through the sultry, dusty streets of the business section of St. Louis, Missouri, on a hot summer day, parching with thirst, while not a druggist, confectioner, nor anyone else whom you asked would either give or sell you a drink of water or soda; if then you had walked across the bridge over the Mississippi to East St. Louis, Illinois, and been given a glass of warm dishwater to drink by a man who had been kind enough to sell you a sandwich from his lunch cart; if you had been refused a glass of soda phosphate, to relieve a depression, in a drug store in the heart of Cincinnati, Ohio, (the home of Secretary W. H. Taft) or a dish of ice cream at the gate of the United States Army barracks at Fort Thomas Kentucky, or if you had been "jim-crowed" in Little Rock, Arkansas; if you had been threatened with lynching by a mob of Missouri whites because you fought for your own rights; if even in many places in the North you had been proscribed, ostracised and mistreated, refused lodging, or recognition which you undoubtedly deserved;— and all this for no other reason than that your complexion is darker than the hue of those who so misuse you, —you would surely think this a wretched and ungrateful country.
So, while reading the poems on the following pages, if you think that sometimes they are too radical or harsh, turn back to this foreword, read it again, and, taking for granted that the author's own experience is here but briefly told and that these writings are based upon actual facts, consider whether they are harsher than that experience. Then consider further that this same person has absolutely no prejudice towards any human being on account of race, color or creed, that he thinks as much of one person as of any other, so long as he is treated well and justly, — for
The soul has no color but of eyes,
Possesses no malice, no disguise:
The soul knows no creed but love and faith;
It knows only man; it knows no race:—
consider also that he lives in harmony with everyone who will be congenial to him; and, after all, ask yourself whether he is not partly right, whether you yourself could love a country and a people who had treated you as herein stated.
C.F.W.
I THANK THEE, LORD.
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast brought
Me to this age, that Thou hast wrought
Such miracles and wondrous things
Beneath the shadow of Thy wings.
Forever and anon I'll sing
The praise of Jesus Christ, my King.
'Tis Thou who made all things we see;
Thou who hast always watched o'er me
While in the toils of life entwined;
Who ever unto Thee hast bound
Me with thy love, so rich and kind,
And showed to me the way around
All things which blemish or would mar
Thy glory, which doth from me bar
The sinful fiends of wickedness
Which, but for Thee, would me possess:
To Thee do I my glad voice raise;
To Thee I ever will sing praise.
Come, all ye lands and join the throng;
Sing out His praises loud and long;
Walk in the path that He has trod;
Give glory to almighty God.
Come, join with me, and we will blend
Our voices, and we'll heav'nward send,
Hosanna! Thine the glory be
Who died for us and made us free!
1898.
PRAYER.
Lord, our God and Father up in heav'n, we praise Thy name:
May Thy kingdom holy on this earth e'er be the same.
Thou art everlasting through all time that is to come:
Thou art ever welcoming us to our heavenly home.
Holy, holy, holy Lord, we pray Thee keep us ever:
Guide and keep us in the right and ne'er Thy succor sever;
For, though we may think we're strong, we are yet very weak;
So we lean on Thy great arm the while Thy way we seek.
1898.
THE SOUTH'S UNGOLDEN RULE,
OR
AN AMERICAN RIDDLE
Contented, he was lured from homeland;
Free, he has been captive made;
Though human, he was bound in chains and
Sold like beast in slavery's trade.
Kind-hearted, he was beat and tortured,
Though resentless, he was killed;
Forgiving, was his wife extorted,
Forced to yield to brutish will.
Obedient, he was made to labor;
Faithful, he was starved and scarred;
Deserving, he was shown no favor;
Handsome, his offspring was marred.
Religious, worship was denied him;
Truthful, he has been profaned;
Though grateful, white men have belied him;
Dead, his corpse was torn and maimed.
Progressive, was deprived of learning;
Though respectful, driv'n to shame;
Though innocent, was lynched by burning:
Has not of his own a name.
Sept., 1900.
JOLLITY.
Ah! You're quite a jolly girl I see.
Where are you from?
You are just the kind I'd have you be;
You're full of fun:
Always telling jokes, with pretty smiles
Upon your face.
Thus you pass away the tiresome whiles
With ease and grace.
Ha! Ha! Ha! You say you're always gay,
Content and free?
Well, I know you've been quite so to-day;
So full of glee.
It is better, I suppose, to bear
Life as it comes.
Let it go as best it may, and care
Not when 'tis done.
Life is not of such worth that it ought
To be the cause
Of a constant worry, making naught
One's pleasant joys.
Of this short existence we know but
Present and past:
Future lifts her veil not, lingers not,
But glides so fast
That no man has ever felt her wrath,
Nor heard her speak:
So we're blindly stumbling 'long her path
Each day and week.
Thus we go through life at her behest,
And we should be
Happy, with a hope some day to rest
On Future's knee.
Sept., 1900.
MEDITATIONS OF A NEGRO'S MIND, I.
[Read at a mass meeting in the state capitol building at Springfield, Illinois, 1899.]
Had I a land that I might call my home,
I would be glad;
But I'm compelled this cruel world to roam
With feeling sad,
Because the Lord, in his wise way, preferred
To make me black;
Therefore the lighter races of this earth
Would keep me back.
Methinks, sometimes, it is a hard, rough lot
The Negro has to bear, willing or not:
He's scorned and driv'n about from door to door
Without an open ear to his implore;
Without a heart's being touched by his sad plight;
Without a hand to help his way to fight,
Save that of God, who doth all things aright.
Two hundred eighty years have past and gone
Since first he trod upon this unkind land:
Two hundred eighty years of basest wrong
Pollute this nation's history, to stand
As long as this creation shall extend,
Though not recorded by historian's pen.
The boasted pride sung by this populace,
The liberty and freedom talked upon
Are not enjoyed by this darker race,
Although these do by right to it belong.
A flag which doth enshroud beneath its fold
Such deeds of crime unwritten and untold,
Save by the hand and tongue of the oppressed,
Or by a friend, — of whom we few possess,—
Is not a flag of freedom, nor for right,
However long it wave, or to what height.
Yet, such a flag does now wave o'er our head,
Intent our names to hide of martyred dead;
But no; the Negro's tongue shall not be hushed,
Nor his protesting feeling e'er be crushed,
Until the hand of dastard crime is stayed
And bound by freedom's laws, by free men made.
May, 1889.
MEDITATIONS OF A NEGRO'S MIND, II.
Doth negro claim existence now
Who meek to unjust laws would bow
Without a protest on his brow,
And call himself a man?
Doth live a member of our race
Who dares not coward villains face
To drive them from their hiding place,
And thus for his rights stand?
Was e'er a dark hued infant born,
In childhood from its mother torn
And reared up in this land of scorn,
And yet doth love this land?
Was ever slave upon this soil
Contented year by year to toil
While ne'er, within, his blood did boil
To unshackle his hand?
Did e'er, while this proud nation's slave,
A negro's heart within him rave,
Yet, never he an utt'rance gave,
And claim right to this sod?
Did e'er Caucasian trade or bart
In human souls with dev'lish art,
Nor once was turned his stony heart,
And claim to serve his God?
Did e'er one of this paler tribe
Despoil his darker brother's bride,
Defy the law with threat or bribe,
And boast an honored name?
Did e'er a statesman in this land
Boast of his firm and rightful stand,
Nor tried to loose the fettered hand,
And claim a right to fame?
March, 1900.
AFRO-AMERICA.
[Read at a mass meeting in the state capitol building at Springfield, Illinois, 1899.]
Oh Country, 'tis to thee,
Land of the lynching bee,
To thee we wail.
How long shall these base wrongs
Pollute, thy freedom's songs?
To thee the right belongs
Them to assail.
Our native country, see
How we long to be free
To live and love.
We long to see the time
When this most heinous crime
Shall change to deeds divine,
Like those above.
Let wailings swell on high,
Let rocks, trees, hills, all cry,
"God's will be done:"
Let Christian souls arouse,
Let all our cause espouse
And keep our fathers' vows
Ere ruin come.
Now, gracious God, to Thee
In Thine all-wise mercy,
We do appeal:
May this land soon be brought
Out of this doom it's wrought,
For long, in vain, we've sought
Freedom to feel.
May, 1899.
MEDITATIONS OF A NEGRO'S MIND, III.
I wonder why the Negro should be hated;
He has done no great wrong unto mankind:
He was out of the same crude dust created
As all the rest of human race, I find.
He's tried to do the best that he knew how to,
Although he was oppressed in shameful bond;
Persisted not to do what he should not do;
To duty's call he always did respond.
Sept., 1900.
A LETTER TO MY SISTER.
Allene, sweet sister, with the blood
Of youth yet coursing through your cheeks,
I was informed, not long ago,
That you had quit attending school.
What is the cause that you should act
So rashly as to stop your search
Through that enormous library
Piled up by Time in ages past
And guarded with unceasing care
By fond Existence? I wish that
You might know the full value of
An education. I think you
Would reconsider soon your act
And turn again toward the path
Of learning, and would never cease
To delve into the depths of things
Unthought by others. I suppose,
Though, that you have considered all
This thoroughly, and have resolved
That 'tis as well for you to stop.
Yet, I cannot but think that you
Have acted wrongly. Surely you
Will in some future year regret
That you have thought it wise and well
To discontinue the pursuit
Of knowledge. I should you advise
To get all education that
Can well be stored within your brain;
For nothing that you learn will be
Of any disadvantage to
You through the life that is to last
Until your death. If you have learned
To deeply think upon the things
Brought up in daily studies, 'twill
Help you to think more thoroughly
Into the cares of daily life;
No matter what their size or weight.
I was surprised, indeed, and sad
To hear you had determined thus
To forfeit your good chance to be
In future time a person of
Great wealth in wit and lore of books.
Since I was taken out of school
I've often wished that I might find
An opportunity to go
To school again. I'd like to have
A college course of quite four years,
Which I intend some day to get,
E'en though I may be then some years
A senior o'er my present age.
When you and Lilian had begun
To study music, you recall
The fact that you cared naught for it,
While Lilian studied much and learned
Quite readily to play: so well
That afterwards you were inspired
With full desire to be equipped
To play as well as she? Forthwith
You then began to practice much
And study more than you at first
Did care to; so that now you have
Succeeded quite in learning well
To chant the strains of sweetness deep
And melody upon the keys
Of the piano, bringing forth
The deep expressions, beauties and
The symphonies of art and life.
So, in the years when Lilian
Has graduated from her class
At high school, and equipped herself
With lore of books, you will regret
That you did not advantage take
Of time, then past, by draining all
The books in reach of their great wealth
Of countless treasures, precious gems,
And hiding them away within
Your chest of memory, to use
At times when they are needed most.
Therefore, I'd be much pleased if you
Would continue your term of school
And finish honorably and well.
Nov., 1900.
THE HOLIDAYS.
T'ward the last of bleak December
When the northern fields are bare,
When the trees are still and leafless,
And the frost flies through the air,
When the bluebird has flown southward
And the robin seeks more warmth,
When wild-goose and duck have had their
Summer outing in the north,
Then the hare and deer are hunted
By the jolly city folk
Who have left their toil and business;
Donned their winter cap and cloak.
Then the farmer has his pleasure,
For the harvest has been stored
In the barns and sheds for winter,
And the fruit preserved and lowered
To the cellar for safe keeping,
And the winter meat is cured.
Squirrel, too, has hid his acorns
In some safe spot and secured.
When the student's mind is wearied
With the studies of the fall
And the melancholy days have
Settled calmly over all,
Then begins a week of pleasure
Known to us as "Holidays."
Christmas Eve is first to greet us
With its joyous rhymes and lays.
On this night we hang our stockings
Side by side along the wall
To be filled with toys and sweet things
By Saint Nicholas, as he's called.
On the next day, then, we get up
When the sun at early morn
Peeps out on the joys before him:—
Christmas day, when Christ was born.
All this day we're gay and mirthful;
One whole week is spent in glee;
Then comes New Year's day with all its
Vows to be, or not to be.
So the world begins its journey
Through the coming year of strife,
Mingling all its joys and sorrows
To compose what we call life.
Dec., 1900.
SONG OF A SUMMER BREEZE.
I have come, as it were, from nowhere;
I have no cherished home:
I am welcomed by high and low folk,
Wherever I may roam.
Oft I come, as a gust or soft wind,
With gentleness and glee;
For a while I will linger, and then
I'm gone as silently.
Though I come over dismal marshland,
I bring not its foul air;
Though I come from the grave, or death bed,
I bring not their despair;
Though I travel o'er plain and mountain,
I bring not weary hours;
Though o'er desert I pass, or rockland,
I've naught but soft, sweet flowers.
Though the sunlight forsake my pathway,
My heart seems light and free;
Though the world may be filled with sorrow,
I bring it not with me.
Oft on cold snowy days I fly through
The chilled and frosty air,
Causing icicled trees to shed tears
While worn by winter's care.
In the spring I revive the flowers,
The trees, the grass; the bird
Sings, the bee and the brook make music
As sweet as you have heard.
In the summer I breathe on warm days
And cause them to withdraw
Their intense heat; I make the green fields
The prettiest e'er you saw.
As I fly through the land, I gather
The sweetest for my store.—
Oft I come in the sad, still autumn
To soothe some soul that's sore.
I have sorrows and cares and troubles
As deep and great as yours,
But I cover them o'er with laughter,
And bind them up secure
With the chords of delight and kindness,
Then paint them well with smiles
And distribute them to the lonely
To turn away the whiles.
I invade the repose of sick room
And fan the fevered brow.
In seclusion of love I'm list'ning,
To mark the sacred vow.
In the solemnness deep of worship,
In hour of fervent prayer,
Oft I busy myself with wafting
A breath of solace there.
I have come, from where?—From the unknown,
A mystery I seem.
I shall pass, and no man shall see me:
Return but as a dream.
Feb., 1901.
AN EASTER MORN.
Brightly now the sun is shining
On this Easter Sabbath morn:
Voices heav'nward are inclining;
And the sky's without a scorn.
Beautiful white clouds are moving
"Cross the broad expanse of blue
Which o'erhangs the earth, so soothing,
Reflecting its azure hue
In the ponds, the streams and rivers,
Lending color to their depth.
In the breeze the dead grass quivers
As if it received fresh breath.
Mildness hovers in the weather,
Gently nursing Easter's form
As the rich and poor together
Nursed the baby which was born,
Years ago, within a manger
In the far East, we are told.
(Though He was to them a stranger,
They took Him fine stones and gold.)
Warmth and pleasantness are keeping
Hand in hand with light and air:
Through the sod the grass is creeping:
Happiness seems everywhere.
Not more perfect in the springtime
Could a day be than is this,
Stripped of all of winter's cold clime
With a touch of summer's bliss.
Yet, with all the joy and sunshine,
There's some rain beneath the sod.—
Though a life be mirthful, sometime
Through a dismal swamp it's trod.
April, 1901.
AN INCIDENT
A charming maid got on the train
With mother and her father,
Bound for the western hill and plain,
Expecting naught to bother,
But soon there came a trim young man
Who rushed up to the car,
Excited, with expression wan,
And asked of me how far
He'd have to go to get some flowers.
I told him he might find
Some at the news stand. All his powers
Of haste he then aligned,
In order to return before
The time the train should leave;
For at first sight he'd loved her more
Than she could well believe.
He happened to be at the same
Hotel where she had stayed,
And when she in to dinner came
He saw and loved the maid.
He had not met this sweet, French Miss,
(Now formally, I mean,)
But he had learned her name was "Thyss,"
When he her face had seen.
He found the flow'rs, in haste returned,
And sent them in to her;
His mind was wild, his heart had yearned
Her sympathy to stir.
She knew him not, nor e'en had thought
That she was thus admired.
She was surprised much and was fraught
With wonder, and desired
To see the person who had sent
This token of respect;
So to the vestibule she went
And asked his name to get.
I knew him not better than she.
Impatiently he paced
The platform along side of me,
Until the maid he faced.
He tried to say something to her,
But failed; his voice was weak;
His lips uttered a faint murmur;
But thus his heart did speak:
"Comme le ciel est si bleu,
Pour vous mort pauvre coeur est en feu;
Comme mon coeur l'est ce jour,
Je parlerai d'amour toujours."
"Voulez-vous m'accepter?
Puis-je mon coeur, en fin, vous laisser?
Je vous aime, chere mademoiselle,
Et la, sans vous, mon coeur est frele."
May, 1901.
LOVE.
[Published in the Exeter (N.H.) News-Letter, 1904.]
In the soul is born a feeling,
Or a sentiment, called love,
Which is nursed, caressed and cherished
With care, tender, from Above.
By the law of God, who made us,
By the guidance of its like,
It selects a life companion
From where'er its fancies strike.
Often does it make an error;
Oft is deceived in its find;
Oft is scorned and turned back coldly:
Oft brings sadness to the mind.
By the law of man 'tis given
As a trust, with cupid's seal,
To be nurtured, fondly cared for:
Thus becomes life's woe or weal.
By the law of changeful nature,
It is made to ill agree;
In its haste has oft been blinded
By some false identity.
On its whims have hung great fortunes,
Or the fates of great careers.
By the sting of its rejection,
Lives have been engulfed in tears.
Hearts have yearned for its fond presence
E'en grim Death has stayed his stroke
To permit this magic power
To repair a heart, once broke.
For love's sake have lives been ended:
From its joy has sorrow fled:
To its care is honor trusted.
Souls bereft of love are dead.
May, 1901.
ENCOURAGEMENT.
'Tis not winter time yet, my dear heart,
Though autumn has crept through the air;
'Tis not time to be sad and lonely;
There's no need to live in despair.
The birds are yet singing with sweetness;
The grass is yet growing and green.
The streams are yet rippling and merry;
The snow-clad hills are not yet seen.
The flowers are yet full and handsome;
The squirrel yet plays in the trees;
The sun has lost none of his lustre;
There's some warmth yet left in the breeze.
Therefore, dear heart, cheer up, be mirthful;
Throb not with less vigor and vim;
Thy blood flows as freely as ever;
Thy life is yet nourished by Him.
Oct., 1901.
THOUGHTS OF THANKSGIVING.
Thanksgiving day is coming soon,
That long remembered day
When nature gives her blessed boon
To all America.
On that glad day, in all our land,
The people, in their wake,
Give thanks to God, whose mighty hand
Deals blessings good and great.
The roast goose, steaming on the plate,
The sweet potato cobbler,
The cranberry sauce, the pudding baked,
The seasoned turkey gobbler,—
All these delights and many more,
From north, south, west and east,
Do all the nation keep in store
For this Thanksgiving feast.
Alas, for those who are denied
This blessed boon of God!
May all the needy be supplied
Like Israel by the rod.
Nov., 1895.
IN HONOR OF LINCOLN.
Hail! ye heroes who yet stand!
Hail the martyr of our land!
Hail him who for his country delved!
Him who the great rebellion quelled!
Him who rent our fetters twain,
Him who broke the clanking chain
Which 'round our lives did e'er entwine,
Resounding loud its doleful chime!
On, oh nation, strong and great,
Though the world predict thy fate!
The future may yet have in store
Some deed to test thy strength of yore.
On, oh nation, in thy might,
Ever upward in thy flight!
Hail Lincoln,—though to rest he's laid,—
Who freed us by God's mighty aid.
Jan., 1896.
SPRING.
The day is mild, the spring is here,
The blithest season of the year:
Although the ground's o'erlaid with snow,
The sun sends forth his warming glow.
The trees will soon begin to bud
And, as the sun dries up the mud,
The dandelion may be seen,
With yellow head and clad in green.
The children homeward wend their way,
Some hurry on, some stop to play.
Their lessons for the day are done;
From school they march out, one by one.
I see, across yon vacant space,
As through the trees my visions trace,
A dairy wagon with its load
Of milk and butter on the road.
The geese and chickens all are out
And picking at the first green sprout,
As through the shallow snow it peeps,
While warm, spring wind above it sweeps.
I sit within my humble wall
Reflecting over winter's fall:
It seems to me but yesterday
With kingly pomp he held his sway.
March, 1896.
WHAT IS LOVE?
Love: what is love;
That fascinating power, divine,
Which fills the heart with thoughts sublime,
Which causes men to tear their hair,
Which brings delight and brings despair
Into the peaceful mind?
In vain, in vain, I've delved to find,
To fathom from its mystic rhyme,
As down the stealthy roll of time
It spreads its blessings o'er mankind,
Or, laughing wildly at his fear,
Sends down its vengeance, year by year,
The incantations of this word
Which, though I sleep, are ever heard.
Perchance, some mortal who has found
Himself within this magic mound
Of uninvited thought can give
The explanation of this myth
Which has, by its unwonted skill,
Defied the universe at will
For these long years.
May, 1896.
PAST MEMORIES.
As I look on the dreary day,
From which the warmth of sun has flown,
My thoughts seem wand'ring far away,
As though past mem'ries back had blown.
Yet, while the day is dark and drear
And I am sitting all alone,
A thought, which brings to me good cheer,
Betakes my mind to home, sweet home.
I think of all the loved ones there,
Of brothers, and of sisters, too,
Of father, and of mother fair
Who guided me my young days through.
Of grandpa, also, old and gray,
In Tennessee's far, southern land,
Who toils on sadly, day by day,
With withered, feebly active hand.
Cheer up, grandfather, and be gay,
For, though this life to sorrow's given,
You soon will leave and go away
To your companion, now in heaven.
Life is but a mortal casing.
For the soul while here on earth;
Ever with an eye upraising
To our Father's heav'nly hearth.
Feb., 1897.
SABBATH.
'Tis a pleasant Sunday morning,
And the sun is shining clear,
Ever giving us a warning
That our God is always near.
Now a breeze, as though from springtime,
Wafts itself from o'er the lake,
Bringing with it all the sweet chimes
From the church bells in its wake.
As the golden sunshine cometh
Softly through my window pane,
As the rippling water runneth
O'er the pebbles to the main,
As the trees, in breezes swaying,
Gently bow their heads, inclined,
Seems to me I hear them saying;
"Peace on earth to all mankind."
Now that God is in his Glory,
Let us praise Him more and more;
Let us sing the offertory
Till to Him on high we soar.
Feb., 1898
PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION.
Hark! I hear the sound of singing,
And of sleigh-bells, gaily ringing,
And the sound of steeds fast springing,
Fleeting o'er the frozen snow.
Now are cheers and bursts of laughter!
Louder, louder, as though faster,
Thinking, never of disaster,
While adown the lane they go!
Now the sound of horns and jingles,
As a sweet voice with it mingles,
Steals upon my ear and tingles,
Lingers, while the moon hangs low.
Now the sounds are growing fainter;—
Distance makes enchantment daintier
As the hour grows still and quainter,—
Till they die away so low,
Scarce I hear them in the distance
While, intent, my strained ear listens
O'er the snow which 'round me glistens:
Now they're gone.—From memory?—No.
Feb., 1898.
DESPONDENCY.
I care not how soon I leave here;
Leave this cruel, lonely world:
I've a longing to depart to
Where the flag of peace, unfurled,
Spreads its grand, celestial tidings,
As it waves in silence there,
Through the realms of the Creator,
Far beyond this earthly air.
As I sit within my chamber
Musing o'er my wasted life,
I can think of naught but sadness
Intermixed with toil and strife.
All the world about seems joyous,
Seems to be o'erfilled with glee:
Nature, with inviting glances,
Bids us all her joys to see.
But, alas! I feel not cheerful,
Matters not how bright the day,
For my thoughts are doleful, dreary,
Of the mystic far-away.
Though betimes I may seem joyful
From some outward look or sign,
Yet, within, my heart beats sadly,
As with burden on the mind.
You who read this simple poem,
Think not as is here expressed;
'Tis a miserable feeling
Thus to be in mind distressed.
Feb., 1898.
WAR'S INSPIRATION.
If God hath willed that I should die,—
And thus our race name glorify,—
While fighting amid war's alarms,
'Mid crashing shells and cannons' storms,
While freedom's flag waves o'er my head,
O'er dire remains of martyred dead
Who gave their lives and lent their aid,
Who faltered not, nor were afraid
To die upon the battle-ground
With unfurled glory all around,
Then, I am full content to die
And be upraised to Him on high.
Feb., 1898.
TO LILIAN.
I knew not I a sister had
With intellect so great,
Who loves all things of nature's fad
And handles their great weight
With such ease and dexterity,
Such wondrous grace and skill,
That warm-hearted posterity
With inspirations fill
When reading o'er her scopic lines
Of philanthropic trend,
Imbibing what her verse defines
And what her mind doth lend.
Strive on, dear sister, toward the goal
And pluck your laurels there:
Though sometimes you be on the shoal,
Steer out, nor linger there.
April, 1898.
TO H. P. L.
Dear maiden, please accept my thanks, wilt thou,
For this kind token of thy loving nature,
As I in high appreciation bow
Before thy queenly form of beauteous feature.
Thy thoughtfulness and kindness in this deed
I never shall, through countless years, forget;
For, though thou art not of my race nor creed,
Thou gavest me this gift without regret.
The marked simplicity of thy chaste ways,
The welcome glow which beams in thy bright eyes,
The smile which overspreads thy face for days
And weeks alike, make thee a living prize
For whom the members of the other sex
Do well to strive and contrive, day by day,
Endeav'ring, while thou dost their brains perplex,
Each one to make thee his and win the fray.
And I would say to him who doth succeed
That, had he searched o'er all this universe,
He would have found no one to better lead
Him through this world of coldness and reverse.
Thou art a gem of rarity and worth,
Of beauteous manner and of winning grace,
Who captureth the high esteem of earth
With winsome ways and ever smiling face.
Thou scornest not the thought to stoop so low
As to make glad the hearts of sons of toil
Who are around thee going to and fro
About their work, endeavoring to foil
The shirking fiends of laziness and make
Great preparations for commencement day
In which thou art to modestly partake
And with the wings of knowledge fly away.
May all good fortune which great God hath given
And all success and goodness here on earth
Befall thee, and when thou dost reach the heaven
May thy seat be before thy Father's hearth.
This tribute to a heart so great and kind
That 'round itself doth welcome all mankind
I pay thee. I shall cherish while life last
This fond memento of a day soon past.
June, 1898.
TO THE GIRLS OF KENWOOD.
[Written in Cuba.]
The pretty emblem of good luck,
Presented by brave hearts to me,
No hand but death from me shall pluck:
It shall a fond memento be.
A picture of the same appears
Upon this card of little worth,
There to remain, perhaps for years,
Until 'tis burned on age's hearth.

THE EIGHTH ILLINOIS IN CUBA.
[From an essay read before our Sunday School in camp near San Luis, Santiago de Cuba.]
Camped in Cuba in the mountains,
Far away from home and friends.
From the precious civil fountains,
In a land of marsh and fens,
* In this church of thatch and palm leaf,
Cut and built by our own hands,
We are holding Sunday service
As is done in many lands.
Far away o'er hill and valley,
Over marsh and mountain top,
Over battle-ground where rallied
Man and horse at freedom's knock,
Over ruined mill and city,
Over waste of richest loam
Where the dove of peace once flitted,
But was driven from its home
By the shells of cruel cannon
And the swords of treachery,
Fly our thoughts to home and loved ones
Whom we soon expect to see.
Over barren devastation,
O'er a land of wasted wealth,
Over what was once plantation,
But now lies untilled, undwelt,
Far across the stretch of ocean,
Far beyond the sunken Maine,
Pray our friends in deep devotion
For our safe return again.
But, instead of tears of pleasure,
Some must shed their tears for grief,
For depleted is our measure;—
+Fourteen rest the sod beneath.
No more reveille shall wake them;
Taps has blown for them its last;
Nor shall ever foe o'ertake them,
For their fighting all is past.
Comrades, over our departed
We have fired the death salute;
Let us cheer their broken-hearted
Loved ones, grieved and destitute.
Jan., 1899.
THE EIGHTH RETURNING FROM CUBA.
Gaily we ride by the river,
Rumbling o'er mountains and creeks,
Laughing and jolly as ever,
With warm, red blood in our cheeks,
Riding through cuts in the mountains,
Riding through tunnels in hills,
By the fresh, silvery fountains,,
O'er crystal cascades and rills,
Through rural towns and collections,
Stations of various names,
High hills in all the directions,
Through swamps and pine-covered plains,
Scenery fine of description,
Beautiful valleys and vales,
Grandeur of wondrous conception
Portrayed on most gorgeous scales,
'Round curves alongside the river,
Under cliffs hanging with rock,—
Naught from my mind e'er can sever
These scenes in memory locked.
By farms, of modern perfection
With their storehouses o'erfilled
With produce, fine for selection,
From rich land thoroughly tilled,
Through forest and broad plantation,
Hickory, walnut, oak, birch,
Cities of large population,
Districts of value and worth;
Thus comes the gallant Eighth Regiment,
Volunteered from Illinois,
Back from the Cuban intrenchment,—
Brave band of true-hearted boys.
March, 1899.
THE NEGRO VOLUNTEER.
[Written for the National Standard-Enterprise, Springfield, Illinois.]
He volunteered his life and health
To go to cruel war—
Increasing thus his country's wealth
In soldier boys afar—
To fight the battles of a land
Which does not him protect
And, though great danger was at hand,
He did not e'en object.
He went, it seemed, to certain death
By bullet, sword or scourge,
Where dry, hot trade winds blow their breath
And rains the land submerge.
He knew well when he left his home—
Though home it did not seem,—
In Cuba's far off wilds to roam,
That death raged there supreme;
That Spanish treachery and hate,
That fever's dreaded ills,
That rain and heat and heavy weight
While on the march or drills,
Awaited him his fate to seal,
His life-blood's wall to break,
To laugh in scorn when he should reel
And fall, no more to wake.
Though monsters such did him confront
And threaten him with death,
His bravery they could not daunt,
But made him fear the less.
Of such brave hearts as he does own
A land might well be proud,
Enforce the laws, protect his home,
His all, from lawless crowd.
The bird doth soar in lofty space,
The fish doth swim the sea,
The beast doth field and forest pace,
The Negro—where hath he?
The bird at night flies to her nest,
The beast's home is his lair,
The fish in quiet nook doth rest,
The Negro must despair
Because, alas, he hath no home,
No place to lay his head
That he can truly call his own;
Nor e'en when he is dead
Doth his lone grave remembrance gain,
In hearts, save of his kind;
Nor is it marked by tomb of fame,
Nor wreathed with flower nor vine.
June 1899.
A HYMN OF COUNSEL.
[Published in the National Standard-Enterprise.]
To him who knoweth not the value of his life,
Nor careth aught for that which elevateth him,
Who findeth existence to be a constant strife,
Who brings upon himself despalr or sorrow dim,
I would recite this simple poem of advice
And beg him to accept without return of price.
For, though it come not from most learned brain of man,
Nor may of classic nor of cultured language be,
This simple lay may cause someone to better scan
The prospects of his being, or more plainly see
The need of education, or of moral worth,
Which two combined bring comfort, peace and joy to earth.
I would first say to him: be honest, good and true;
Be faithful to thyself and value self-respect;
Do all that is within thy scope and power to do
To keep thyself and others prudently erect;
Observant ever be of great and common things,
And listen to the songs which reverend nature sings.
Betake thyself within secluded walls of thought,
And there, in loneliness, portray thyself to thee,
Arrayed in all thy foolish waste, so dearly bought,
Which causeth oft thy heart to droop and downcast be,
And fathom from beneath this mass of malcontent
Thy better nature which was downward crushed and pent.
Then raise it gently up from out its gloomy nest,
Support it with the strong arm of thy will and sense
And cherish it with all the life within thy breast,
And it will grow so rapid and with glow intense,
'Twill blossom in the springtime of its newer birth
And bid thee pause to view the goodness of the earth.
If thou, perchance, should find thee restlessly engaged
In wav'ring contemplation o'er thy changing ways,
Dislodge these diabolic thoughts from off their stage;
Think not of wrong, but of the beauty of these lays.
Beget thee to the avenues of shining light,
For danger lurks about in shadows of the night.
Go willingly unto the fountain of success.
Fed by the spring of learning, beautified by love,
And drink thou of it freely, that thou may possess
The mighty power of knowledge, sent from Heav'n above;
For education is a wealth of untold worth
Which, once acquired, can ne'er be lost by thee in earth.
Full many kingdoms in himself doth man possess,
The thrones of which are oft usurped by evil power;
Grim indolence, the solemn death-knell to success,
Doth lurk about in ev'ry hidden nook and bower.
Simplicity is greatness, born within itself,
And plainly marks all greatest deeds and thoughts of wealth.
Improve thy time and talent while 'tis yet in reach.
Strive hard to grasp a branch of fame's exalted tree;
Take heed to that which doth great elevation teach;
Mark well each lesson learned, for 'twill of value be;
Love thou all things which tend to principle of right;
Keep all good deeds of men always within thy sight.
But if thou thinkest that thou needest counsel not,
Or that thou'rt wise enough and strength hast to endure
These worldly battles often waged long, fierce and hot,
Heed not the simple words and teachings of the pure,
And thou shalt pass into the vast oblivion's doom
Where naught but sorrowful regretfulness doth bloom.
June, 1899.
DECEMBER.
The days are short, the air is cold,
The bleak wind stirs the lifeless trees,
The sun sends forth faint rays of gold,
While Autumn rests at peace and ease.
The summer birds have flown away
To warmer climes and greener shores,
And little snowbirds chirp their lay
While picking crumbs from kitchen doors.
The cows are milked within the barn,
The horses bridled in the stall,
The geese and chickens, to keep warm,
Stand on one foot, but never fall.
The children, playing on the lawn,
Are building snow men at the gate,
Or, having done that, they have gone
Out coasting, hitching, or to skate.
The school has closed for holidays
And Santa Claus will soon be here
To turn the melancholy rays
Into a week of mirth and cheer
The present year will soon be past,
For it is old and feeble now,
And o'er December's bier, at last,
Must New Year make his reverent bow.
Dec., 1896
AT EVENING.
Evening sun beams not upon me
As I sit in silent shade
Musing o'er this earthly dwelling,
Which to rest must soon be laid.
Ah, my heart grows sad and weary;
As I'm dreaming, all alone,
Night is drawing swiftly onward,
And I'm "One day nearer home."
Stealthily the night brigades are
Creeping o'er the walls of day
To attack him in his weakness,
Conquer and drive him away.
Soon the hosts of knights of Darkness,
With their glittering, starry shield,
Will usurp Day's throne and fortress
And a while his sceptre wield.
Then the gallant Day will muster
All his forces for the fight
And with light and rays of sunshine
Drive the foe fast from the site.

A HISTORICAL REVIEW.
In fourteen hundred ninety-two
America was found
And olden theory proved untrue—
That earth was square, not round.
In fourteen-ninety-seven, then,
John Cabot started out,
Resolving straight across to wend,
And shortened much the route.
In 1506 Columbus died,
A prisoner in chains,
Although for several years he'd cried
For freedom from these pains.
In fifteen hundred sixty-five
St. Augustine was rounded,
And ever since has stood and thrived,
Though centuries have rounded.
In 1607 Jamestown's homes
Appeared among the wild—
And here begins a tale of woe
Of this land's orphan child.
In 1619 Slavery's wrong
Disgraced our country's page
And made a blot so deep and long,
'Twill last through countless age.
In seventeen hundred seventy-five,
Oppressed by English law,
The colonists a plan contrived
To wage a freedom's war.
In 1781 they gained
The object of their strife;
Ungratefully they tighter chained
The slave to misery's life.
In '70 brave Attuck shed
His life-blood in the fight,
The first of all this country's dead
To die for freedom's right.
E'er since, in all this nation's wars,
The Negro's played great part,
Glad always to defend her cause
From depth of his brave heart.
In '65 he fought the South
To save the nation's name:
An accident which came about
Freed him from slavery's chain.
Two hundred years, and more, they'd kept
Him 'neath this cruel rake,
The while the nation's conscience slept;
Nor did it once awake
Until secession's mighty gun
At Bull Run so did pelt her
That she, alarmed, compelled, did run
To Washington for shelter.
'Twas then the thought within her mind
Occurred to free the slave,
If, by this action, she could find
A mode her name to save.
Thus, now, you see, the orphan's free,
So far as slavery's counted,
Yet he is burned, and hanged to tree,
And chased by fiends well-mounted,
Accused of crime, though innocent,
He's tortured with strange pleasure:
The wailings of his soul are lent
To swell her song's blank measure.
Since he was freed he has progressed
And all the world astounded,
For never have other men possessed
Such intellect unbounded.
Though hearts of stone and calumny
Will persecute and murder,
He bears his cross to Calvary,
Nor falls beneath his burden.
In '98 he volunteered
To fight for human cause
In foreign land, yet, while he steered
His son or brother was
Strung up to tree, or stake, or post
And tortured, cut and burned
And sold by pieces to a host
Of dastard hearts which turned
To look upon such awful sights,
Unequaled on this earth
By cannibals or savage rites,
With coolness and with mirth.
At El Caney and San Juan
He faced the poisoned lead
And victory brought from among
Defeat and heaps of dead.
He lay in trench, in mud and mire,
Through rain, heat and disease,
Nor ever once expressed desire
That awful place to leave.
O'er dead Caucasian boys he rushed,
O'er some crouched down with fears,
While from his wounds his warm blood gushed
And mingled with their tears
He cut the barbed wire fences down
Which did impede his way
And stormed blockhouses on the crown
Of hills; thus gained the day.
He cried when he was not allowed
To enter in the city
The same day that up hill he plowed,
And thought it a great pity
That he might not pursue the foe
Into his place of refuge
And strike at once the final blow,
Thus end the war's grim deluge.
He also garrisoned the land
His bravery had conquered
And made a record which will stand
Among the world's most honored.
And now that war is waxing hot
In far off Philippines,
And boys of lighter hue do not
Equal their task, it seems,
There's been some talk of sending there
To bring things to a close,
This orphan child of curly hair,
Broad mouth and flattened nose.
In southern part of this "free" land
He's not allowed to vote:
They've tied our Constitution's hand
So that he might be smote.
If he, perchance, commit a crime,
He's hanged 'thout court proceedings;
His guiltless kin, too, at the time
Are killed, despite their pleadings.
He's guiltless oft of crime alleged,
(Which often has been proven,)
But fiends their wealth and life have pledged
To stagnate law's just movement.
Will someone lend a helping hand,
Or sympathizing heart,
Or honor pledge and life to stand
For right on this child's part?
O, human beings of this earth,
Arouse your dormant sense
Of right, give merit its true worth
And claim your recompense!
Sept., 1899.
CONTENT.
Toiling, toiling all day long
With his will and might,
Humming tune, or whistling song
From the morn till night:
Ever happy at his work,
Ever gay and free,
Never does he duty shirk,
But content is he.
Cheerful is his little home,
Though of meagre size,
Ne'er he cares from it to roam,
There his treasure lies,
There his heart's delight is found,
There his joy and pride,
With his children playing 'round,
Sweet wife by his side.
Early does he rise at morn,
To his work he goes
His day's duty to perform
Without pain or woes.
Fully well is he aware
Of his family's needs,
Amply does he store prepare,
And. always succeeds.
Thus, the happy father lives
For his children's sake;
Thus, to them example gives
Of which they partake.
Sept., 1899.
CAUTION.
The voice speaks often words which are not uttered:
The face oft portrays feelings not intended:
The smile expresses things which would be smothered:
The mind revives some scenes which are long ended:
So measure well the word before 'tis spoken
And study thoroughly before you've written,
For careless words oft cause hearts to be broken,
And writing, misconstrued, great hopes has smitten.
Learn to control at all times your emotion;
Don't laugh at others' accidents or errors;
Don't execute your every whim or notion,
Nor do things which will cause you future terrors.
Consideration should be first in all things—
The execution is subsequent matter,—
For hastiness oft trouble brings that's galling
And sadness o'er the world promotes and scatters.
Nothing is known until 'tis well experienced:
No man's so wise that he cannot be wiser:
Judge not a person only by appearance:
Call no man fool, he may be your adviser.
Sept., 1899.
ONE YEAR AGO.
Just one year ago we broke camp
In the distant Cuban plain
And began our joyful home tramp
On the transport and the train.
But, though far from lonely birth land,
I was happy and content;
I was filled with joy and mirth and
Happiness where'er I went.
In the lonely life of camping,
In the mountains wild and drear,
Or when through the country tramping,
Strove I to be of good cheer;
For I loved to ramble often
Through sweet nature's gorgeous realms:
She has power to soothe and soften
That which naught else overwhelms.
By the lonely brook and river,
Laughing in their solitude,
Where the leaves in soft breeze quivered
And all seemed with life imbued,
Where the birds were gaily chirping,
Where the fish in deep pools played
And the timid deer were lurking,
Where the bees their honey made,
In her solemnness of silence
Nature was at home to me.
In the calmness of that island
I did live contentedly.
I was wont to sit in quiet,
Or to roam in loneliness
Through the country wrecked by riot,—
But which now by peace is blessed,—
Studying language, people, action,
Or the vegetation there,
Gazing with much satisfaction
On the products, rich and rare.
Plodding o'er the rugged highlands,
Through the marshy lands below,
I would pass away the whiles and
Watch the minutes come and go.
I would sit sometimes for hours
Basking in the sun's warm rays
While a stream 'neath shady bowers
Sang to me its favorite lays.
I partook in games athletic
Which were held among the boys.
I beheld scenes so pathetic
That they saddened all my joys.
While disease and death were raging
In the towns and camps around,
While their friends were busy placing
The deceased beneath the ground,
I was well kept and protected
By some power of the Unknown,
Which also my way directed
As I through the wilds did roam:
So I lived in sweet communion
With the worlds of blue and green
By horizon linked in union,
In that heaven land of dream.
March 9, 1900.
STRUGGLE WITH TEMPTATION.
What is this haze which now I feel,
Which stealthily begins to steal
About me? 'Tis some magic power
Which comes at this belated hour
To wind me in its grasp. 'Tis strange
This feeling should my mind derange
And cause me such alarm, for I
Have ne'er, in all these years passed by,
Encountered such an influx of
Marauding thought, so hard to solve
As this which now has come to pass.
Methinks awhile some stupor has
O'ershadowed me, and bound my brain
And dimmed my eyes, so that in vain
May I attempt to delve into
The fath'mless depths which now accrue.
It matters not, it seems, how much
Effort I bring to bear to touch
The key-note of this instrument;
The selfsame mystery in extent
Enshrouds its impregnable fort.
Defiance even seems to court
Its presence when from wary tent
Of Indignation he is sent
To battle with this monster, turn
A traitor and betray the urn
Which nourished, kept and cherished him,
Thus cause his guardian much chagrin.
My wits seem somewhat baffled by
The presence of this mighty spy.
I scarce can get my thoughts composed
To right myself. I'm half disposed
To cease this struggle and allow
Full sway to the usurper, bow
Submissive at its feet, betake
Myself within the walls of fate
And there remain for aye, or till
Such time that I may pass at will
Without this dazed compulsion, free
To think and act contentedly.
May, 1900.
A TALE OF HEARTS.
One night while walking 'long the street,
Returning from the choir,
A young man was involved in thought
Which burned as though 'twere fire;
For he had seen a girl in church,
Whom he had known before,
Whose pleading eyes and saddened face
Seemed deeply to implore
His acquiescence to escort
Her home at close of church.
He had denied her the request
And, thinking she might search
The crowd for him, had gone out at
A side door close to me
And waited till he saw her leave;
Yet did it not with glee.
'Twas sad: the girl loved him, and said
He was her heart's desire:
That's why his mind was so involved
With thought which burned like fire.
He did not wish to mistreat her,
But he did not love her:
To cherish her fond hopes, then blight
Them, he did not prefer.
So he was meditating as
To what course he should strike
When, looking just ahead of him,
He saw three hearts alike.
At first he thought to crush them all
And leave them to their fate,
Then quickly thought that he would spare
Them,—but it was too late:
The blow was struck; one frail heart broke
And severed into parts:—
I know not what became of it—
But those were candy hearts.
June, 1902.
A BLIGHTED LIFE.
In the southland of this country
Lived a happy, wedded pair:
Each content was with the other,
And their hearts knew no despair.
They were of Caucasian lineage,
Or, at least, 'twas thought they were,
And no one had e'er disputed
This, their claim, l may aver.
She was fair, of modest beauty,
Soft her hair of light brown hue:
He was darker of complexion
And his hair was darker, too.
So they lived together, happy,
Never questioning their birth;
Lived in love and adoration
Close as nature lives to earth.
But ere long they both grew restless
And they left the balmy South,
Moved to that great northern city
At the Hudson river's mouth.
They were soon seen out in public
And occasioned much comment.
Said the gossips; "He is colored."
This was said where'er they went.
Thus continued they their meddling
With this couple's happiness:
Thus their prejudice they vented,
These two young hearts to depress.
Then they said to her; "He's colored:
Has Negro blood in his vein."
Thus tormented they the young bride
Till her heart relaxed in pain;
Till her soul cried out within her:
"Is it true;—and if it be,
Can I not still live and love him?
Can he not still live for me?"
"Can we not remain together?
I do not question his kin,
It may be true,—yet, l love him,—
Can there be a diff'rence, then?"
Thus she wailed and strove with reason.—
Would she overcome the blow?
Could she not raise an embankment
That would dam their gossip's flow?
No—alas! her heart was failing.
They would separate, she thought:
So decided she and acted;
Left him, and a fairer sought.
But her soul was not contented:
She could love no one but him,
For her life to his was mated.
God had made their souls a twin.
Thus some people of this country,
Who, by chance, are very light,
Tear asunder the Almighty's
Work and claim that they are right.
Is there not some power of conscience
That will cleanse their hearts and souls?
Are there no Caucasian Christians
'Tween these two terrestrial poles?
July, 1903.
A STUDENT'S CHRISTMAS PARTING.
[Published in the Exonian, Phillips Exeter Academy.]
Farewell, ye halls of red and gray!
Nay; Au revoir! I'd rather say!
Ye campus grounds now bleak and drear!
Ye buildings to my heart made dear!
Ye chapel walls, your songs bestir!
I leave you now, old Exeter.
Ye books and pen I lay aside
To rest you, calm and unespied.
I go to greet the coming year,
To welcome him with mirth and cheer.
Vacation time is near at hand
When all is joy throughout our land.
Ere long again I'll greet you all,
And from your slumber calm I'll call.
I'll bring with me a newer strain
To fill your corridors again.
I'll bring with me a heart so free
'Twill fill your stolid walls with glee.
The folk at home are waiting now;
Already is the holly bough
Made into wreath of red and green
To grace the beauty of the scene.
Again, ye hall and corridor,
I turn to bid you, Au revoir!
Dec., 1903
ADVICE TO A FRIEND.
You say that virtue is its own
Reward: I'm sure that's widely known,
Yet, while I wish not to pursuade
You to refuse the request made,
I think that our reward is found
When satisfaction does abound
In feeling that our work is not
Ungratefully scorned or forgot.
For no reward can truly be
Unless received with feeling free,
Unless 'tis given from the heart,
Unless 'tis made of life a part.
We often may feel that we should
Our talents lend for doing good;
We also oft may later find
That the return is quite unkind.
So I should say, be sure that you
Consider well the step in view,
Yet do not fail to full regard
That virtue is its own reward.
Feb., 1904.
THE MINOR CHORD OF LIFE.
[Published in the Exeter News-Letter.]
Is there not a hand of power
That can stay the wheel of fate?
Is there not a soothing hour
For sad hearts that mourn and wait?
Can no recompense their longings
Find while wand'ring through this life?
Must no sunlight pierce their mornings
With its many-pointed knife?
Must they wander through existence
With their heavy burdens bent?
Must no heart lend them assistance?
Must no hope to them be lent?
Fain would some assistance offer,
But it satisfies them not;
Others fain would comfort proffer,
But their comfort comforts not.
Some would gladly shelter give them,
But the storms still rage within;
Others with bright hopes would cheer them,
But to them all hopes are dim.
These sad hearts possess a longing
Which no earthly power can soothe;
There's a strain to them belonging
Which the hardest heart would move.
Yet, these souls are meek, forgiving,
Patient, though time nothing brings.—
Life would not be worth the living
If no sorrow tuned its strings.
April, 1904.
FROM THE STAGE OF LIFE.
Once there was a happy youth
With heart as light and free
And gleeful as a lamb at play,
As merry as could be.
No morning sun e'er rose on him
That did not see him smile;
No evening twilight sank to rest
And left him sad the while.
No bird at daybreak sweeter sang
Than did his whistling note;
No youth nor maiden was more kind,
Nor any kinder spoke.
But now those days have long since gone,—
They can return no more,—
And he, once innocent and blithe,
Is changed e'en to the core.—
Oh, cruel fate that wrought the deed
That turned his heart to stone,
That stole away his innocence,
And left his soul alone,
Thou might'st have done a kinder thing
And yet deserved thy name!
But no: thou wouldst not kinder be
And save a life from shame.—
One day he met a pretty maid,
Of rather modest mien,
Whose love for him he read as soon
As he her face had seen.
He liked her, too, and often was
In company with her,
And as the days and weeks passed by
Much more attached they were.
But yet he hardly loved the girl,
Though she loved him, she said;
So he had dared think—to himself—
That some day they would wed.
But then the tempter came to her
And she, poor suffering girl,
Could not resist, but yielded up
Her honor, her life's pearl.
Her face, from then, was different
Than he had seen before;
She could not look straight in his eyes;
She trembled more and more.
He asked her what the matter was:
She said 'twas nothing much;
But, since he had observed, he could
Not be content with such.
So he began to question her,
And she, 'mid tears and pain,
Confessed and begged that he forgive
And take her back again.—
Oh, cruel dart that pierced his breast
And left thy flint head where
A heart did once in pleasure throb,
Thou'st robbed his bosom's lair.—
He could not think the same of her;
He cherished naught but scorn;
He chided her with fiendish glee:
She was downcast, forlorn.
"False woman, why didst thou not think
Of all this shame and woe,"
Said he, "ere yielding up thy name
And maidenhood? Now go!"
"And never let me see thy face
Again here on this earth
While life shall last and I have breath,
While honor has its worth."
"Thou saidst to me that thou didst love
Me, but hast proved a lie,
And now hast impudence to ask
That I forgive. Could I
Forgive a thousand times thy wrong,
I never should forget
Thy bland, deceitful countenance,
Thy promise false.—And yet,
Was it thy fault that thou didst yield
And barter thy good name
To one of such ignoble birth
For ignominious shame?"—
"Ah yes; too well thou knew his tale
Of life, his character;
Too well thou knew what he had been;
Full well knew who thou were."
"Hadst thou not known his vile repute,
Nor designed his intent,
Hadst not been warned nor cautioned 'gainst
The way in which thou went,
There might, perchance, be some excuse
For this mishap of thine:
Thou hast gone headlong into it;
Thou must now wail and pine."
"Thy future life shall be despair,
Thy past one deep regret;
Thy lonely hours shall be in shame;
Nor shall thou e'er forget
The purity which once was thine,
The pleasure of those days
When thou wert clothed in virtuous robe,
When thou wert chaste in ways."
"The phantom of thy purer life
Shall haunt thee in thy sleep;
The terror of thy faded bloom
Shall pierce thy day dreams deep,"
"Thy bare existence until death
Shall be as Hades dark;
Thy reddened glare of tainted love
Shall glow a mere, small spark."
"The liking which I had for thee
Is gone fore'er; has flown
Away to find a worthier soul—
And left me sad, alone,"
"But yet, Fate hath not baffled me;
I have a weapon still.
Though one has proven false to me,
I cannot and I will
Not think that womankind is false,
That none is good and pure,
For I've a mother, sisters too,
Whom I'd profane, I'm sure,
Were I to countenance such thought.
Such vile indecency
Is for some baser animal
Than I could ever be."
His faith, though shattered, was not lost;
He would not all condemn
Because this one had done a wrong:
Such thought was base to him.

PRESENTATION POEM.
[Written for my sister Allene.]
Dear Friend, my teacher for the bygone term,
Accept this token of my love for thee,
For from thee many lessons did I learn
And much of thy blithe, kindly nature see.
Thy kindness unto me and loving care
While through the streets of knowledge I did roam,
Thy willingness, benevolent and fair,
To teach and tell me things which thou hast known,
Which always do portray themselves so well
In thy expressive countenance, thy smile,
And which to all beholding do foretell
Thy kind intentions towards them all the while
To make them happy, by thy blithesome face,
Thy beauteous, characteristic grace,
Time ne'er shall from my memory erase,
Though many years be swallowed into space.
This simple token, though of little worth,
And of the things which transpire here on earth,
Expressive is of feeling which was born
Out of kind treatment, which no heart can scorn.
June, 1899.
HALLOWE'EN.
[To a Friend.]
Last night was Hallowe'en, you know;
The cowbells rang, the horns did blow,
The goblins stalked o'er stones and planks
And small boys played their annual pranks.
The women dressed in men's attire;
The small girl, too, quenched her desire
To get into her brother's pants:
The hollow pumpkin had its chance.
The sidewalks creaked, the street cars balked,
The sign boards moved, the lamp posts mocked,
The wagons went to roof resorts
And front gates climbed poles of all sorts.
The Indians at tobacco stores
Went on the warpath by the scores.
The ticktacks played on window panes
And stuffed men mounted weather vanes.
The larger boys played other tricks;
They tied dogs' tails to large-sized bricks:
Pinned placards on policemen's coats
And set fire to the tails of goats.
They masked themselves as spooks and ghosts.
And stood behind trees and big posts;
They set logs 'gainst some folk's front doors,
Then knocked and ran away, of course.
They put torpedoes on the rails
For streetcars, and painted cats' tails;
And many more such things as these
They did, which you may name with ease;
For, if you were not once a boy,
I'm rather sure you did enjoy,
At some time, hearing stories told
Of how the boys did do of old.
But boys must have their fun and play,
Although they often have to pay
Quite dearly for their tricks and sport,
Which sometimes wind up in a court.
Yet, boys can play their pranks and jokes
On numerous good-natured folks
Who think that boys must have their fun,
E'en though they sometimes have to run.
So Hallowe'en may come and go,
And cranky folk may often show
Their temper, but the boys don't care;
For what's a boy who will not dare?

AS WE SHOULD BE.
We should be as kind and cheerful
As we can here on this earth;
For in Heav'n we may be judged by
What our work in life is worth.
Life may not always be pleasant,
We may oft feel grieved and sad,
But we should not think that others
Have not sadness as we had.
Some are rich, enjoying pleasures
Of this world with careless ease;
Some are poor and laden with much
Sorrow, deeper than the seas;
Yet we all should be contented,
Whether rich, poor, sad, or gay,
For this life is what we make it.—
There's some sunshine every day.

A VALUED LESSON.
[Thought upon leaving Exeter.]
I sat beneath a stately elm,
While Autumn round me threw her cloak,
As though she would my mind o'erwhelm
With thoughts of other lands and folk.
And as she fanned my solemn brow
With a refreshing, cooling breeze,
I fell to thinking of the now
And of the then that is to be:
That I am now a student poor
In knowledge of this universe,
With many hardships to endure
Ere I may ope that valued purse.
And as I sat reflecting 'lone,
A little bee came flying near
In search of honey for his cone
To feed him through the winter drear.
He lighted on a tiny flower,
Which swayed and bent beneath his weight,
But finding not sufficient dower,
He flew away and left it straight.
But there his efforts did not end,
He tried another, and one more,
And yet again he tried to rend
Some from another for his store.
And as I turned unto my strain
Of thinking, I bethought me so:
If now I fail, I'll try again;
I shall succeed some time, I know.
And in the then that is to come
I'll look back o'er the trodden hill
And view what persistence has done.—
There's no success without some will.

A WESTERN REVERIE.
(Song—To my sisters.)
[Written on a U. P. Train in Wyoming.]
When the sun sets o'er the hills in the desolate, wild west
And its crimson, golden light fades into blue,
And the dusky drab of eve steals up o'er their rugged crest,
Then it is, my dearest hearts, I think of you.
When the far-off curling smoke from a campfire on the plain
Wends its heav'nward way far up into the sky,
And the dim and reddened glare of the disappearing flame
Fades from sight, 'tis then I wish that you were nigh.
When the sky is gold and blue
I am thinking still of you,
As the setting sun displays his latest ray;
And when night steals o'er the plain
Thoughts of you arise again,
And my heart can find no rest, so far away.
Night then draws her starry veil o'er her darkened, blushing face
And reflects the gentle memories of day,
And the moon peeps o'er the hill from her cozy hiding place
And pours out her soul in light across my way.
Then, as constellations rise slowly on their upward climb,
And the north-star, too, lends me her silver gleam,
Phantom visions of you cross the horizon of my mind,
And I slumber through the beauty of the dream.
Aug., 1905.
VALE DICO.
Dear Exeter, I fare thee well!
Fore'er I leave thy hallowed halls!
What I've endured, no one can tell,
Save my sad heart locked in its walls.
This heart was not so sad always,
It had a blithesome, happy strain;
But now, alas! it's changed its lays
To doleful lines, more doleful pain.
0
And not because I hate thee do
I take my leave of thee for aye,
But 'tis because I love thee true
And fear to hurt thee if I stay.
For I am human, with a right
Of life, with feelings, and a soul,
And 'gainst race prejudice I'll fight
As long as I can weapons hold.
Thy sons to me, except a few
Have been as brothers and as men;
Have been as fathers to me through
Adversities that proved them friends.
But some there were as opposite
To them as poison is to sweets;
Whose souls were vile and ill befit
To mingle 'mong thy walls and streets.
I noted well the hearty cheer
And welcome from these greater souls:
I noted, too, with careful ear,
The silence of those narrow moles.
I noted well the hearty grip,
The pleasant mien, the strong, firm voice,
I noted, too, that limpid slip
Which names the knave of narrow choice.
If thou couldst speak, I feel well sure
That thou wouldst shame those baser hearts,
That thou wouldst shun them as impure
And bid them to their 'customed parts.
For thy gate, Phillips did decree,
"Shall ever open be to youth
From every quarter, equally,"
Whose principles are right and truth.
Now, as I go, I bid thee feel
With all my heart I say, Adieu!
Some other hall shall train my zeal
My future destiny to woo.

ON THE DEATH OF DUNBAR.
[To his Mother]
Is Dunbar gone, forever and for aye?
No, he is not! his soul has never died;
His spirit form is with us through our day;
Nor in our night does it desert our side.
Though sweet "Li'l' Gal" may weep, "Malindy" mourn,
"The Party" veil its face with solemn crepe
In sorrow for him of whom they were born;
And though we, too, may weep at his sad fate;
Yet one consoling thought remains to cheer
Us in this hour of lamentation deep:
His soul yet lives, is with us year by year.
He is not dead, for in our midst he sleep
Enfolded 'tween the covers of his books.
The old tree, torn with bullets, by the road
Still moans the story of its deadened looks;
The "Ole Mule," with his lazy human load,
Still plods along his weary homeward way;
"Malindy Sings" as sweetly to our mind;
The "Uncalled" hovers round us as to sway
Our lives with "Lyrics," poetry and rhyme.
We need but to unfold his clothbound bier,
To take him from his grave upon our shelves
And lend his inmost soul our closest ear,
And Dunbar lives, and speaks, e'en, as ourselves.
A life we mourn which late we oft extolled;
A work unfinished, yet complete, we read,
Like his, our lives, our talents will unfold
And bloom with beauty, if our hearts we heed.
Feb., 1906.
WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF A SKEPTIC.
To-day the brilliant sunbeam hangs
O'er all our joys, our cares,
Removing all of sorrow's pangs,
Depicting all its snares.
'Tis nature's cloak of soothing dreams
She throws about our life,
Admitting naught of sorrow's beams
To mar our upward strife.
May, 1906.
WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.
[To L. F. C.]
When you find yourself in sorrow,
Weighted down by care and strife,
Raise the curtain of the morrow
And behold a brighter life.
May, 1906.
FIDELITY.
Sweetheart, for love of you, I'd give
Up all the pleasures of this life,
And be content fore'er to live
And love you, though through endless strife.
I'd give up all the joys of earth
For love of you, my dearest heart;
I'd forfeit e'en my right of birth,
Than that your love from me should part.
The fiercest storms of life I'd brave
If but your love were the reward.
I'd cross the sea of pain's dread wave,
Nor would I one complaint record,
Nor say, nor feel one faint regret,
If 'twere for love of you I sailed;
I'd suffer untold grief, and yet,
No mortal ear should know I wailed.
I'd sever all the earthly ties
That bind me to a living soul
And journey upward to the skies,
If I but thought your love the goal.
I'd suffer all that cruel word
And unkind act could e'er inflict
Upon my heart, if I but heard,
One pledge of favor from your lip.
I'd suffer death a thousandfold
For one sweet kiss from you, my dear,
If I your love might have and hold,
For death were naught if love were here.
Nov., 1905.
SATAN'S DREAM.
[Scene based upon L. Christine Jensen's "Life."]
Ah! Dead! What! Dead! My favorite prince!
Thou, whom I sent out not long since
To check those Christians on their way
To Paradise!—I'll curse the day
That saw this deed!—Ah! Yes 'tis true!
But look they well; this day they'll rue.
Poor prince, brave prince, thy royal blood
Shall be avenged: I'll cause a flood
Of Christian souls to fall, for this,
Down into my deep, dark abyss.
Ye habitants of my abode,
Come, rally, dance, mine anger goad,
And register this vow: I swear
By thunderbolt and lightning's glare
That I'll avenge my prince's death,
That I will draw no restful breath
Until I've brought their haughty souls
And cast them on my bed of coals.
But hark! Methinks I hear a voice!
Ah, yes! 'Tis they!—Fools make your choice;
This day shall be the last you'll see,
For ere the morrow ye shall be
Locked in my deepest, darkest cell.
I know my elves will treat you well:
For bread they'll give you burning coals;
For water, teeming, seething bowls
Of hottest blazes of my realm;
When tired, your souls they'll overwhelm
With tortures vilest e'er conceived.
Then Faith and Hope and Love must leave;
They cannot live within my gate,
For with me dwell Despair and Hate.
Ha! Ha! Proud Faith, thou'st battled well;
Before thy sword my captain fell;
But thou dost battle now his peer
Who causeth earth to quake with fear,
Who holdeth lightning at command
And sendeth thunder through the land,
Who visiteth the earth with plagues
Until the haughty Christian begs
For mercy. So, proud Faith, look sharp:
I'll yet destroy thy magic art.
I'll show thee that the Tempter's power
Can overcome thee, make thee cower:
I'll teach thee that revenge is sweet,
While thou dost grovel at my feet.
Then I, Satan, who once did quail
Before thy gaze, shall mock thy wail:
I, who the while was terrified
By thy bright glare, shall hail with pride
The victory: and I shall wreak
My vengeance on both strong and weak:
I'll overrun the land with wrong
And scatter discord 'mongst thy throng
Of idle followers. Then I
Shall rule supreme o'er earth and sky:
So, Faith, and Hope, and Love, take care—
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! —Beware!
Jan., 1906.
TO THE ORGAN.
[Written in Payson Church, Easthampton, Mass.]
O, mass of tone immaculate,
Of harmony most intricate,
So beautiful, so consecrate,
I love to listen to thy song,
As through my melancholy soul
It pours its torrents sweet and long.
| love to listen to thy swell,
For thou dost deep emotions tell.
My inmost soul is moved and thrilled
With joy, with sorrow, sweetness, hope,
My life with harmony is filled.
When thy great volume bursts the air,
Or soft, steals on me unaware;
The world with lyric beauty teems;
My swift imagination sails
Through seas of melody, and dreams.
A soul thou hast inborn, innate;
And yet, thou art inanimate,
Thou mass of tone immaculate.
Oct., 1906.
TO A ROSE AT WILLISTON.
[The rose which grows behind South Hall.]
Pretty, ruby, half-blown rose,
Grown upon our campus green,
Tell me, have you any woes?
Are you happy as you seem?
Tell me, ere your beauty fade,
Ere your fragrant odor wane
'Neath this dormitory's shade,
Have you ever known a pain?
Oft I've passed behind this hall
To my lessons, to the well,
And you, crouched beneath the wall,
Seemed to have some tale to tell.
Tell me why your cheeks are red;
Are you blushing, dainty flower?
Why sometimes you droop your head;
Is't your melancholy hour?
Have you heard the leaves are dying?
Have you seen them turn and fall?
Have the autumn breezes, sighing,
Whispered to you nature's call?
Come, my beauty, tell me, pray,
Should I pluck you in your bloom
Would you live for me one day,
Just to brighten up my room?
'Twere a pity I should take
You, sweet, red rose, from your thorn,
Yet, the chill winds make you quake
And ere long you will be gone:
Gone into that great unknown,
Where the beautiful of earth
Springs up and matures, full blown,
In a realm of song and mirth.
So I'll pluck you, rosebud shy,
From your thorn-bush, chill and cold,
That your fragrance, as you die,
May be breathed into my soul.
Then I'll press and keep you, rose,
Though your ruby hue be gone,
To remind me, as time goes,
Of my life at Williston.
Oct., 1906.
THE DEATH OF THE LEAVES.
[Published in the Willistonian, Williston Seminary.]
Green the grass is on the campus,
But the leaves are turning brown
As the melancholy autumn
Spreads the hoar frost o'er the ground.
Quivering, the leaves are waiting
For the call from earth's dark mold,
For she needs them to protect her
From the winter's ice and cold.
When they hear her call, they scamper
From their lofty summer home
Back to mother earth, who gave them,
Whence they never more may roam.
Silently they do their bidding;
Carefully their carpet weave,
So that when their work is finished,
No uncovered spot they leave.
Closely to her breast they hover,
That her life-blood be not chilled,
Till the sun returns in springtime,
When their mission is fulfilled.
But the breezes miss their presence,
Dancing gaily in their wake,
So, in sorrow, sighing, moaning,
They bewail their playmates' fate.
Colder grow their hearts from sighing;
Louder grow their moans and wails,
Till their moist tears turn to snowflakes,
Covering o'er the new made graves.
And the barren trees, too, weeping,
Lash the chill winds with their limbs
Till to icicles their tears are
Frozen by the angry winds.
Then the wood-birds leave the forest,
For they find no pleasure there
Since the little leaves have fallen
And the trees are in despair.
So we should employ our lifetime
That our friends may moan and grieve
When we leave this world, as do the
Trees and winds the little leaves.
Oct., 1906.
WRITTEN ON A CHRISTMAS GIFT.
[To M. E. G.]
When you're lonely or in sorrow,
Wipe away your burning tears
With this token of a friendship
Which, yet short, may last through years:
And when you have reached the highest
Step upon the stair of fame,
Turn and wave to me this kerchief;
I'll be somewhere in the train.
Dec., 1905.
MY SISTERS
Would you like to know who occupy the best place in my heart?
It's a secret but I'll tell you if you'll promise not to tell,
For I think they're just the sweetest girls, and Oh! they are so smart
That I love them very dearly—Oh, you've guessed it, have you? Well,
Now I don't care if you do know, for they're all the world to me,
And I like to have you know it.—They're my sisters; don't you see?
Yes, my sisters are the dearest girls that I have ever met:
I loved them before I knew it, and my love I don't regret.
I was bashful when I found it out, and wouldn't say I did,
But I'm not afraid to own it now, for I am not a "kid."
1907.
THE DAY OF REST.
The day of rest is soon to come
When we'll fly to our eternal home
Where we shall dwell in peace and rest
Among the myriads of the blest
Who have been called from earthly cares,
From toils and trials and despairs
To that dear land where peace doth reign,
Where sorrow can no foothold gain.
And when we reach that paradise
And stand before our Lord and Christ.
We'll praise His name, for he hath giv'n
To us a peaceful home in heav'n.
We there shall meet our loved of yore,
Who now are waiting at the door.
Within that home we'll dwell alway,
Through time and everlasting day.
O Lord, we thank Thee for that home,
Where we can rest, no more to roam,
Where everlasting light doth 'bide
And never doth its glory hide.
There in that peaceful bliss we'll live,
Wrapt in the robe which Thou dost give
To those who will accept Thy love
And sing Thy praises as above.

ON THE GIFT OF A WHISKBROOM.
[To R. C. R., Jr.]
When you have swept on wings of fame
Far past these souls more common sired,
Pray, brush the dead dust from your name,
That I may view and be inspired.

ON THE GIFT OF A THERMOMETER
[To A. L. C.]
When you have soared thorough dizzy air
And cut your name on fame's high cliff,
Please take the temperature there
And drop it to me as a gift.
Dec., 1905.
ON A CLOTHES BRUSH.
As you may brush your clothes at times,
So that no grain of dust remain
To mar their good aspect,
I ask one favor through these lines;
That you will keep the giver's name
Free from dust of neglect.

THE HEARTS OF AMERICA.
[To a Friend.]
The heart of the South, my little girl,
Is as hard and rigid as stone;
It tortures to death with knife and flame
Those of flesh and blood of its own.
The heart of the North, my little maid,
Is as ice, so frigid, so cold;
It listens and looks, but answers not
To the wails of colored folk's souls.
The heart of the South, my little child,
Is as black as midnight with crime;
Nor can it erase those murd'rous stains
Through the endless ages of time,
The heart of the North, my wond'ring babe,
Is devoid of feeling as steel;
It enforces not our country's laws,
Although millions of us appeal.
The heart of the Negro, little dear,
Which was once so tender and kind,
Is bitter against both South and North,
Since in neither justice it finds.
But Liberty's heart, my little one,
May be sleeping, but is not dead;
And when it awakes, as soon it must,
There may be some rivers of red.
The heart of the man oppressed and wronged
Yearns for vengeance, justice and right,
And once it begins its angry course
It increases much fold in might.
The Negro, who would not dare to stand
Fighting bravely for life and home,
Is worth but to live a traitor's life;
But to die unclaimed by his own.

TO A BUNCH OF CARNATIONS.
(Dedicated to the Donors.)
[Published in the Enterprise, Easthampton.]
I wonder if you, flowers, know
The happiness you bring to me.
I wonder if you have a soul,
And feel my gratitude and glee.
I wonder if your pretty smile
And pleasant face, your graceful form
Were stolen from your donors while
They placed their dainty card hereon.
I wonder if you felt the thrill
Of joy you gave my lonely heart:
I wonder if your petals still
Will live, when their sweet odors part
'Tis sad to think that you must die
And all your beauty fade away,
Not even in a grave to lie
And moulder till some brighter day.
But yours a mission is of love,
Of good, of happiness, of faith:
Sent by the power from above,
You cheer the great, nor scorn the waif.
'Tis sad to think you have no voice,
That you might tell your heart's intent:
'Tis sad to know you have no choice
To leave me e'en your fragrant scent.
I wish I had the power to give
You back unto your root and vine:
I wish you might forever live
To cheer the lonely souls that pine:
But otherwise it has been willed,
And you, departing, leave the race,
Yet, leave our lives with treasure filled
Because your life was love and grace.
March, 1907.
TO A FRIEND.
A sweet little soul have you, my dear,
A heart that is true, in love sincere,
A manner so kind, a grace so true
That hardly could one help loving you.
Nor this do I say without intent;
'Tis not for mere praise nor flatt'ry meant;
It is my belief, from what I've seen
And studied of you through music's screen.
As one cannot know his real worth
While making abode here on this earth,
So you cannot see, perhaps, these traits
Which surely your being permeate.
And I think it not amiss to tell
You of your good traits I see so well,
For, knowing what good we do possess
May urge us yet more to righteousness.
Quite much have I traveled o'er these lands,
Heard many a voice, grasped many hands,
Seen many a face, and read each heart;—
Experience has lent me her art.
So, bringing this knowledge, dearly gained,
To bear on your case, I feel sustained
In saying, as you have read above,
That yours is a worthy soul to love.
With hatred of race this land throughout,
On perjury rounded by the South,
'Tis pleasant, and worthy of much praise
To find souls like yours to light the ways.
The soul has no color but of eyes,
Possesses no malice, no disguise;
The soul knows no creed but love and faith;
It knows only man; it knows no race.
That such is the soul within your breast;
Your actions and deeds do full attest.
And to such a soul alone is given.
That happiness which we call our heaven,
Feb., 1907.
THE BURIAL OF THE PAST.
Let this the funeral of our difference be;
Let each the other tell the soul's desire;
Let each disdain the other's faults to see,
And let our hearts be kindled with that fire
That melts two dispositions into one
And then withdraws there from its greater heat
And leaves the molten mass, its mission done,
With warmth of love in unity complete.
But let us not forget that faults are ours,
Nor be unmindful of their secret growth,
But ever strive with all our latent powers
The ideal of perfection to approach.
Then as our lives are blended in one strain
And two hearts with the selfsame impulse throb,
With one consoling thought, each mind the same,
May we be happy while above the sod.

[Written for The Enterprise, Easthampton, Mass.]
In May we launch our swift canoe,
Unbind the sail and hoist her,
And at the same time bid adieu
To our good friend, the oyster.
May, 1907.
WRITTEN ON A CHRISTMAS CARD.
[To I. H.]
A friendship true is rare indeed,
So, I would cherish thine,
For friendship springs from sincere hearts,
From sentiment divine.

A NOVEMBER SABBATH MORN.
[On Belmont Heights, Springfield, Mass.]
Early on one Sunday morning
Ere the Autumn had grown old,
I arose from peaceful sleep and
Dressed myself to take a stroll.
Down the crooked streets I wandered
Till I met a winding road
Following a deep, walled brooklet
Which, with lazy vigor flowed
Through a pretty, narrow valley,
Draining all the neighboring hills
By a system of large drain pipes
And two busy little rills.
Following this road, I crossed the
Stream and bore off to the left,
Climbing up a hill through which a
Narrow street was being cleft.
Strolling 'cross this meadowed hilltop
In a brisk refreshing breeze,
I imbibed the breath of morning
Wafted to me by the trees.
But the leaves and grass were dying,
Worn out by the summer's toil,
E'en the little breeze was sighing,
For no warmth was in the soil.
Drowsily the sun came peeping
O'er the housetops on the height,
Blushing at his late arising,
Flooding all the heav'n with light.
From the brow of Belmont Heights my
Vision wandered 'cross the vale
To the far-off, peaceful river,
Winding down its crooked trail.
Towering from the valley rose the
Pointed steeples, spires and domes,
As though watching o'er the clusters
At their feet of quiet homes.
Busily the engines glided
'Long their steel roads 'mong the mills,
Or on bridges o'er the river.
As a background, tiers of hills
Stretched their rugged, dark-hued ranges
As a wall on either side,
Stalked with pines, and here a windmill
Sluggishly its labor plied.
O'er this picture hung a blue haze,
Frightened by the rising sun
And retreating from his splendor,
For the day had now begun.
O'er the blue sky, like a snowdrift,
Spread a thin, white, drifted cloud
Veiling o'er the moon's pale visage,
Trailing 'round her like a shroud.
Pale, yet bravely and defiant,
Stood the mistress of the night
Battling with the "great task-master,"
But unequal in the fight.
All the little stars had hidden
When at first they saw him rise,
For they knew that he would scold them
If they stayed out in the skies.
So, in glory, still advancing,
Came he on that Sabbath morn,
Striking with his rays the church bells
Till their tongues chimed forth in song.
Long stood I admiring, wond'ring,
Dreaming o'er the beauteous scene,
Painting it with brush of mem'ry
On my mind's receptive screen.

TO THE WIND OF THE NIGHT.
Wind of the night, thou silent guardian
Of the peaceful hours of life,
Bring unto me some missent message
From some heart o'ercome with strife;
Bring to me some belated message
From some heart o'erfilled with love;
Whisper to me some long-kept secret
Of some soul now gone above.
Steed of the air, thou swift conveyor
Of the seasons of our sphere,
Bear to my heart that youth, that vigor
Born of happiness and cheer.
Breath of the moon, thou great proclaimer
Of the power of our God,
Voice of the trees, and yet the murmur
Of the lowly shrub, the sod,
Breathe to my soul some consolation
Made to soothe a lonely mind,
Tell to my ear some story brightened
With the promises of time.
Leave me not here alone to ponder,
Waft me to some land of dreams
Where I may find a sweet communion,
For life is not as it seems.

DESOLATION.
How desolate is life for those
Who live within the wall of woes;
Who come into this world of care
With naught but sorrow for their share;
Who pine and long for love, for light,
For riches, learning, or for might;
Who dream by night and toil by day,
Nor aught can find to drive away
This restlessness, this grim desire,
Nor e'en to satisfy it's ire!
The coyote on the western plain
Which hardly sagebrush can sustain,
Which knows no moisture save the dew,
Which boasts no tree to break the view,
Contented with the desert is,
For all that he surveys is his.
The lean gray wolf that haunts the cave,
Whose dreadful howl makes e'en the brave
Man shudder when at first he feels
His shriek which near his blood congeals,
That dogs the herd and picks with care
The fattest bullock for his share,
Desires no different life to lead;
For much he finds to sate his greed.
The rabbit, bounding o'er the sands,
Or nibbling sagebrush as he stands
Or crouches, resting from his play,
Quite satisfied is there to stay;
For there his pleasure he pursues
And there he burrows, broods and woos.
The eagle, sailing through the air,
Or screaming from the high cliffs, bare,
Or swooping down upon some flock,
Or perched upon some lonely rock,
Is happy in his loneliness;
For there securely he may rest.
But he who of this human stock
Is happy with his earthly lot,
Who has no troubles, cares, nor pains,
Who knows no loss, but ever gains,
Exists not in this world of strife,
Except in that ideal life;
That life for which men pine and yearn.
So, as some live their years, they learn
That life is bare and desolate,
That all is ruled by cruel fate,
And though they strive to do, to know,
They're choked by penury and woe.

HE WHO LAUGHED LAST, LAUGHED BEST.
A youth there was, of not great education,
Who thought to raise himself above his station;
And so, by constant toil and application
He pulled up some few points in estimation;
And when this he had done
He thought his fame was won.—
A small work he compiled—
And all the people smiled.
But dauntlessly he toiled then all the harder,
For he'd resolved that he would go much farther,
He knew that life was hard for any starter,
And he was not afraid to be a martyr.
So he made up his mind
He'd try a second time;—
And at this paragraph
The people fairly laughed.
But not discouraged by this second failure,
His resolution donned a third regalia
And sallied forth this time as an assailer:
And then began the scoffers to look paler;
For they must now confess
That he had made success.
They saw that they had blundered—
And all the people wondered.
Nov., 1906.
A TALE OF A YOUTH OF BROWN.
Out from the plains of Illinois,
Out from the town of Lincoln's home,
Where the emancipator's tomb
Answers the stare of state house dome,
Came forth a strippling of a boy.
Brown as a chestnut was his face,
Brown as two beans his soulful eyes,
Curly his hair like waves and black,
Bright was his face as summer skies:
He was of Afric's sunburnt race.
"Sweet was his whistle as a birds',"
"Courteous his manner as could be,"
Buoyant his spirits as the air,
Light was his heart, so young, so free,
"Mellow his voice as ever heard."
He was denied his chief desire,
Taken from school, fore'er, perhap,
But he, undaunted by his fate,
Ran away from his mother's lap;
Left to escape his father's ire.
To the great city came this lad,
As yet unskilled in worldly lore,
Sought out employment for himself.
During his leisure he would pore
Over some book, some song he had.
Studied and worked he much by night,
Painted, and sang, and whistled, drew
Pictures and whittled toys from wood,
Did as he thought he ought to do,
Lived as he knew and loved the right;
For he had known a mother's care,
Felt of her anguish and her joy,
Heard his grandmother, late a slave,
Reading of David, shepherd boy,
Guarding his flocks from beast and snare.
Growing, this youth to manhood came,
But he had not what he loved best,
Clamored his heart to learn, to know,
Nor could he feel content, at rest,
For he had vowed to rise to fame.
Finally heard he of a school
Where he might work, and in return
Receive the knowledge which he wished.
Forthwith he went, alas, to learn
That southern prejudice there ruled.
Famed was this school throughout the land.
Even from o'er the seas there came
Youth to be educated, trained,
Not only in the paths of fame,
But in base hatred, man for man.
Sad, but resolved, he left its walls,
Went to a more congenial one
Where he might have a right to live;
He found this right at Williston;
Found justice, freedom in her halls;
Found friendly spirit in her town;
Found helping hands and willing hearts
Brightened, his soul poured forth its strains,
Pleasing the townsfolk with his arts
Until they loved this youth of brown.

MEDITATIONS OF A NEGRO'S MIND. V.
With wailing souls and protests came
Our fathers to this virgin soil,
Deprived of freedom and in chain,
Denied the product of their toil.
Compelled to learn the white man's art,
They learned to love the white man's God,
And though not of his race a part,
They were engrafted to the sod.
For ages they were wronged and robbed
And on the spoils this nation thrived;
For centuries they prayed and sobbed
Until their prayers were recognized.
But, though they broke the iron band
And left us freedom, as 'tis called,
We still are bondsmen in this land,
By unjust laws and treatment thralled.
But this much longer cannot be,
For we will protest and will fight
Until as any one we're free.
And can enjoy our every right.
For is this not our native land?
Have we not toiled for this our home
And bled, and made as brave a stand
In its defense as e'er was known?
We've no more rapists, thieves and crooks,
Nor do more crime, than other folks;
We love as well our arts and books
And labors; we despise the yoke
Of bondage, ignorance and vice;
We are as Christian in our deeds;
And naught can our demand suffice
Which less than fullest rights concedes.
I know not why, because of race,
We should be shunned, proscribed, despised
By those who, though of lighter face,
Are yet our kindred by the ties
Of creed, of native land, and blood.
I know not why we should pay tax
For government and yet a flood
Of senseless protest—these are facts—
Should rise throughout our land's extent
When we demand a voice and part
In offices of government;
Such acts are tyrannous at heart.
The Negroes of the Southern state
Who are denied the right to vote,
To have a court adjudicate
Their wrongs, though stars and stripes do float
Above their heads, are treated worse
Than were the subjects of the crown
Before rebellion moved the curse
And shot the tyrant's army down,
Shall we, who know no other home,
Who speak the native English tongue,
Submit to wrong without a groan
And leave a serf's lot to our young?
No! We shall not. Not even beast
Will be abused without a show
Of protest. We must be released;
We must strike some decisive blow.
If we betray our fathers' trust
Bequeathed to us upon their death
In civil war, may our base dust
Receive but curse from human breath.
Dec., 1907.
A MEMORIAL OF CHILDHOOD.
Those days of childish thought and joy
Will never come to me again,
Yet, there's no power that can destroy
Their image drawn by mem'ry's pen,
Those days of innocence and love
When I knew nothing of the world
Have flitted from me like a dove;
Life has its graver scenes unfurled.
Those happy days at grandma's knee
When I was but a tottering babe
No more can I expect to see,
For long has she to rest been laid.
I knew no sorrows then, nor cares,
For mother for me bore them all
And taught me of the hidden snares,
Lest I might blindly in them fall.
No more will grandpa bring me sweets
And trinkets when he comes from work;
No more shall I run out to meet
My papa in my clean, new skirt.
Those days are gone, and in their place
Are months of toil and years of hope,
But I am strengthened in life's race
By drinking from the springs they ope.

A NOVEMBER EVENTIDE.
(Published in the Willistonian.)
[Written on a Trolly Car.]
The mighty sun had kept his steady course
Across the autumn sky of cold, steel gray,
Before him routing all the frosty chill
And spreading o'er the earth a cheerful day,
And was about to set him down to rest,
To dream of all the hearts he'd filled with light
And leave the silver visage of the moon
To rule o'er his dominion through the night,—
For Luna was his sweetheart, loved of old,
Reflected from himself and fashioned, too,
Yet, fairer than his ruddy face of gold,
She took upon herself a silver hue.
But ere he'd finished quite his daily run,
His pale companion raised her silvery head
From 'neath the rugged top of Nonotuck
And smiled, and great Sol blushed a crimson red.
Still higher rose the goddess of the night,
Her full, bright smile o'erspreading wood and field:
Still lower sank her lover in the west
Until Mt. Pomeroy his blush concealed.
But Luna steered her course across the sky
And in his footsteps, laughing, held the chase,
While here on earth, more fortunate than she,
Sweet Morpheus held the world in loved embrace.

MEMORIAL DAY IN EASTHAMPTON.
[Written for The Enterprise, Easthampton, Mass.]
'Twas kind of the Omnipotent
To blow His warm breath on the day
And keep the rain in heavens pent,
That we in duty sad might lay
Our decorations on the tombs
Of heroes of our cruel wars.
The sun shone forth in splendid gloom;
With drooping heads the trees and flowers
Stood still in thankful prayer, or raised
Their joyful faces toward the heaven
Exulting gratefully in praise
For all the goodness to us given.
No rain-cloud marred the clear, blue sky,
No wintry blast the wind congealed
While white-haired heroes waved on high
The tattered flags from battle-field.
The fifers piped the shrill war note,
Or played the solemn funeral dirge;
A feeble step marked each drum stroke;
A feeble heart each life did urge
As to their comrades' graves they went,
Each with the weight of old age bent,
To pay with laurel wreaths and flowers
A nation's debt of thanks. 'Tis ours
To mourn those hearts which valor claimed,
To shed tears o'er those graves unnamed,
To cheer these heroes with us yet,
Lest their great service we forget.
'Tis ours to soothe their feeble ills
Whose memory each true heart fills:
'Tis ours, when they are passed and gone,
To take their flag and follow on;
And as God gave a day so clear,
So warm, from out this spring so drear,
That we might better pay respect
To those deceased whose graves we decked,
So will our later days be bright,
Though weighed with years, our spirits light,
Because we have revered the gray
Old heroes on Memorial day.

PLEA OF THE NEGRO SOLDIER.
("A Powerful Poem and Foreboding"—Republican.)
Published in Springfield Republican, Feb. 16, 1907. Copied by Boston Guardian.]
America, ungrateful land!
Whose treacherous soil my blood has dyed,
Whose wealth my father's shackled hand
Has hoarded up, who has denied
Me right to live, to vote, to learn,
Whose laws protect me not from wrong,
Who will permit me not to earn
An honest living, who in song
Doth boast a land of freedom, but
Whose flag waves o'er a land of crime,
The makers of whose laws unjust
Themselves are stained with blood and slime
Of murders, lynchings, rape and lies,
And who, while yet the sacred oath
Of office on their vile lips lies,
Will lead a mob of comrades forth
To take some negro, innocent,
Accused perhaps, but never tried,
From custody of government
And burn him, to a pillar tied,
I fear the dawning of thy doom:
I hear the voice of justice cry
From out this wilderness of gloom:
I see the dark clouds in thy sky.
From Boston massacre, my blood
Through all the channels of thy war
Has mingled with thy crimson flood;
Through Yorktown, Erie, Wagner,—far
To El Caney and San Juan Hill,
Where, midst the charges awful din,
With song our voice the air did fill
And make that song a battle hymn.—
The Philippines, so dearly bought,
Are strewn with bodies of my kin;
My comrades have thy glory wrought
In war, in peace, with skill and vim.
'Twas I who rescued from the urn
Of death thy fickle soldier chief;
Tis he who gives me in return
Disgrace, dishonor, no relief
From poverty my feeble years
Must bring me soon; he who deprives
Me of support retirement rears
Up for her faithful soldiers' lives.
My thirty years of living death
In bloody war avail me naught
When prejudice and perjured breath
Of Brownsville 'gainst my name is brought.
And dost thou yet, ungrateful land
Expect my blood and kin to stand
In cowered silence, while thy hand
Continues to despoil our band?
May God forbid that of my race
A single child shall e'er disgrace
His native land, the resting place
Of martyred kin, by fear to face
Injustice by whomever thrown.
The ancient Plebeians of Rome
For treatment such renounced their home
And sought the Sacred Mountain's dome.
The colonies of George the Third
To less injustice war preferred
And fired,—the while the world concurred,—
The shot which round the earth was heard.
Republic cannot long endure
When autocrat can feel secure
To heap injustice on the poor
Or helpless; ruin follows sure.
Three centuries have near rolled by
Since first our fathers' mournful cry
And clank of chains rose to thy sky,
Nor yet have found just cause to die.
Our voice of protest shall not cease
Until thy unjust bonds release
Our rights, that our lives may increase
In riches, happiness and peace.
But I, alas! have given all
In answer to thy urgent call,
Exposed my life to sword and ball,
And now, as o'er me creeps the fall
Of life, I find no recompense
But base discharge, with no defense
Through which to prove my innocence,
Though I've committed no offense.
For this I've given up my home
O'er hapless battle-fields to roam,
I've crossed the ocean's hungry foam,
I've fought disease in hostile loam.
O God of justice and of right!
If thou art deaf and hast no sight,
Lend me Thy weapons and Thy might,
That this last battle I may fight.
Feb., 1907.
MEDITATIONS OF A NEGRO'S MIND. VI.
Justice, hast thou fled and left us
In this cruel, unkind land,
Where these human wolves beset us
As we turn on either hand?
Reason, hast thou taken refuge
In some distant, kinder clime,
Leaving us in all this deluge
Of unjust, uncivil crime?
Mercy, art thou deaf, unflinching
To our hopeless wails and woes
As we're burned and killed by lynching,
Murdered by our hideous foes?
Christian, has thy heart, once tender,
Hardened into dead, cold stone:
Canst thou not some service render,
Or dost thou these wrongs condone?
Conscience, art thou dreaming, sleeping,
Nor reprovest thou these deeds?
Civil progress, art thou creeping
Back into uncivil weeds?
Pride, art thou o'erwhelmed and blinded
By false, prestige, power assumed?
Take heed lest thou be reminded
Suddenly that thou art doomed.
Where is all the honor boasted,
Freedom, principle and right,
Written, sung, proclaimed and toasted
Of this land of wealth and might?
Whittier's dead and Lincoln, Sumner,
Garrison and Lovejoy, Stowe,
Phillips, Brown and Douglass slumber,
While the pleas of "Fighting Joe,"
Keifer, Garrison, the younger,
Higginson, and others few,
Still are scorned, unquenched of hunger,
Yet to justice they are true.
Wisdom, hast thou lost thy power
To convince the ignorant
That as they misuse thy dower
They must certainly repent?
Woe unto this haughty nation
If she falls to keep her trust:
All are equal by creation;
All alike return to dust.
Dec., 1907.
TO CHICAGO.
Chicago, mistress of the lakes,
Controller of our inland trade,
The freest city of our states,
What wondrous strides thy fame has made!
The century has yet one-fourth
Its years to register with time
Since from an humble Negro's hearth
Thou started on thy upward climb;
From farm to Indian trading-post,
To Dearborn's fort, to thriving town,
To city, till now thou canst boast
Of prestige, glory and renown,
When dreadful fire laid waste thy land
Thy courage took a deeper drill
And sank its roots beneath the sand,
And since that time has said, "I will."
As if from magic rose thy blocks
Like mountains towering to the skies;
The lake birds crowded to thy docks;
And o'er thy arms of steel and ties
Came people, money, shops and mills,
Came grain and livestock; 'cross thy plain
Came wagons from the eastern hills;
And from the South, to breathe again
The air of freedom and of life,
Came sons of Africa, escaped
From chains of slavery's deadly strife,
And drank the pure air of the lake.
Oft since Fred Douglass thou hast heard,
A Ransom shielded with thy walls,
A Morris hast thou given birth;
Another Morris filled thy halls
With melodies and music sweet.
Abe Lincoln, once, oft came and went
From hall of statehouse to thy street:
And now a Douglass settlement
Has graced thy great community,
Has hurled its challenge through the land,
Determined with impunity
For equal rights to all to stand.
A Justice Harlan is thy son,
A Celia Parker Woolly, thine,
A Marshall Field,— whose race is run,—
And many of illustrious line.
Thou city of an Indian swamp,
My second birth thou gavest me:
As through thy long streets I did romp
I breathed thy spirit deep and free.
From thee I learned my lessons first
Of worldly care, of manly strife;
From thee I partly quenched my thirst
For knowledge and the greater life.
I've wandered through thy groves and parks,
Thy boulevards and avenues;
I've watched the sailing of thy barks
And mingled with the busy crews;
I've seen thy buildings rent with fire;
I've seen thy towering structures rise,
Each vieing to extend the higher,
In climbing upward toward the skies.
Thou city on a sand-bar made,
I've seen thy wealth and people grow
To double in one short decade;
I've felt thy piercing, cold winds blow;
Oh city of the pioneer,
I love thee for thy great, free heart;
Thou art my foster-mother, dear,
And I am of thyself a part.

HAPPINESS IS HEAVEN.
(To a Friend.)
[Written in a Music Lover's Calendar.]
When music rises sweet from harmony
And steals her soothing strains throughout my soul
And swells its living veins of melody
Until, sublime with ecstasy, they burst
Into a flood of joy, exuberance
And life subduing discord, sorrow, strife,
Then truly am I in the only heaven
That can exist for carnal, mortal man;
For harmony is but the voice of love,
And love is but a sympathetic chord
Of feeling which itself attaches to
The kindred particles of different
Existing organisms and binds them fast
Into sublime, harmonious happiness,—
Securest state of pleasure grown from life:
Therefore is love the leveler of life.
The soul compounded is of life and love,
The one true state of life is consciousness
Of happiness in other beings near
Resulting largely from one's own good deeds;
And, as the rhythmic utt'rance of the soul
Is poetry, so, therefore, music the
Denominator common is of life.
Since heav'n consists of music, life, and love,
Our only heaven, then, is happiness.
Dec., 1907.
A HERO'S DEED.
A southern mob upon a lynching bent,
In old Louisiana's slave-shorn bound,
With murd'rous hands and flaming firebrands went
In lawless chase to hunt a negro down.
Our hero kissed farewell his child and dame,
And bravely vowed to fight their coward band:
His eye possessed a never-failing aim
And steady as yon mountain was his hand.
He knew that they were coming for his life,
So, barricading windows all and doors,
And with his guns all loaded for the strife,
He lay in wait for their approach by scores.
When they had reached and turned into his gate
He fired a shot, which struck the foremost down,
And as he fired he prayed he might shoot straight,
That every shot should bring one to the ground.
At this they made a rush toward his fort,
But his good weapons were of truest steel,
So every bullet sailed into its port,
And soon some eight or ten had ceased to feel.
They started back in horror at his deeds,
For they were all base cowards, every one;
Some tried to sneak up nearer through the weeds,
But even they did not escape his gun.
They tried all kinds of schemes to get him out;
They sent a priest and small child toward the door,
But our black hero aimed his rifle stout,
And both fell wounded gravely, streaked with gore.
He knew his God was with him in the fight
And, therefore, could not be in e'en the priest;
He fought because he knew that he was right;
And thirteen of the mob their blood released.
But finally, by throwing oil and brands,
They set the house afire to burn him 'live
And chuckled 'mong themselves and wrung their hands,
For they thought no escape he could contrive.
Quite soon the shanty was a mass of flames;
The rifle ceased to speak; there were no tones
Except the crackling of the wood and panes:
The fiends were waiting 'round to mock his groans.
But, while they stood intently looking on,
The God of Mercy came and succor gave,
For, while they watched the house burn, he had gone:
The flame and smoke refused to kill the brave.
The fire sent forth a heavy cloud of smoke
To make the hero covering to the wood,
The wind obeyed the flaming tongue that spoke
And wrapped his fleeting form in that dense hood
Until the dismal swamp stretched forth her arm
And, covering him with her verdant shawl,
Fast wafted him beyond the reach of harm
And left him north of Mason-Dixon's wall.
In vain they hunted, when the fire had died,
To find his simmering bones, or ashes gray;
In vain they wondered where he could have, hied
Himself unseen to cheat them of their prey.
But this brave black had made good his escape;
The fierce beasts even hindered not his flight;
Sweet Nature did his thirst and hunger sate
And shield him with her cloak both day and night.
The mighty power that our fate controls
Had spoken and rebuked the dastard mob;
Had sacrificed a dozen hateful souls
To save one guiltless of a race down-trod.
Dec., 1907.
CONSOLATION.
[Written in an Autograph Album, to M. E. G.]
Although at times our spirits seem oppressed
And we seem lonely, sorrowful, distressed,
We may find consolation, after all,
By turning t'ward the pictures on the wall:
So, if you find yourself in lonely pain,
Remember, sunshine always follows rain,
Then turn you to my humble photograph
Upon the wall, or to this autograph,
And fancy there my spirit and my soul
And it, perhaps, your heartache will condole.
Nov., 1907.
AS WE LOVE, SO ARE WE LOVED.
[To M. E. G.]
Though the soil be e'er so fertile,
It will not yield up its fruit
If no showers fall upon it,
If no warmth caress its root.
Though the bud be near to bursting,
It will not its beauty show
If no moisture fall upon it,
If no sunlight lend its glow.
Though the heart be all affection,
It will not its soul outpour
If no fervor be returned it,
If no love knock at its door.
Just a word of loving kindness,
Just a gentle look, or act
In our life, our talk, our writing
May another's love attract.
If we wish to reap love's harvest,
We must shed our hearts' warm rain
Of encouragement upon it,
Or our sowing is in vain.
Dec., 1907.
OUR RECOMPENSE.
Our lives are the sweeter because we have sorrowed;
Our love is more tender because we have pined;
Our sympathy deeper because we have suffered;
Our happiness greater because we are kind.

TO WILLISTON AT PARTING.
(Dedicated to Dr. Joseph H. Sawyer. )
[Published in the Willistonian.]
O Williston, a countless debt I owe
To thee who hast assisted me in life,
For when my eager zeal desired to know,
To do, when lone my heart, engulfed in strife,
For knowledge cried, for opportunity,
For equal right and chance to live and learn,
To educate myself and happy be
Though poor, proscribed, thou badst me come and earn
That lore, nor didst deny me of thine aid.
Thy heart is great and good, ordained of God:
Thy tribute have already hundreds paid
Unto thine ear and passed beneath the sod;
And some are marching feebly to the strains
Of that sweet rhythm of life they learned of thee
As in their youthful days they coursed thy lanes
Of learning, while full grateful at thy knee
Bow I, that thy wise benediction may
In parting fall upon my storm-tossed head,
That thy good wish may pave my hard, rough, way
O'er thorn, o'er wall, o'er grave of hallowed dead.
And when o'er western plain or eastern hill
I hear thy loving voice in later years
Speak words of cheer and courage to me, still
My grateful heart shall lend thee eager ears;
My tender mem'ries shall their petals ope
And show thee there the full bloom of their soul
And breathe their fragrant, sunny breath of hope
And joy into thine air;—and then, the goal.
Jan., 1908.
LOUISE.
Can I forget your loving mien, Louise?
Can I forget your tender, trustful heart?
Can I forget your sacrificing soul?
Ah no! They are of memory a part.
Have I not grateful seemed unto your mind?
Then think not of our meeting with regret,
For I have often thought of you, although
Some years have rounded now since we have met.
Your noble, quadroon face, your pretty eyes,
Your ruddy cheeks, your wavy, chestnut hair,
Your stately form, your womanly deport,
And e'en the music of your voice, are there
Among the pictures of my galleried mind,
Shut up within its chambers, to await
My pleasure to release them to my view,
My hungry turning toward the past to sate.
I feel that this I owe to you, Louise,
For you are yet the dear friend of my youth
Whose kindness and devotion shall not pine
For lack of recognition and of truth.

WOMAN.
Thou, woman, art a jewel of great worth
And yet a worthless jewel if thou wilt:
Thou hast a value rarest of the earth,
But thou art valueless when set in guilt.

THE BIRDIE THAT HAS FLOWN.
[To a Friend.]
A birdie entered in our hall one day
In dainty, sparkling plumage decked, with cheek
Of rosy pink and pretty eyes. Straightway
She glided t'ward my humble station meek
And perched herself in comfort on my chair.
And when she oped her mouth and spoke to me
Her voice, so sweet and musical and rare,
Fell on my ear and lingered, and so free
Did she present me from her silver purse
Of treasure that for joy my heart-beat leaped
And listened to the song she did rehearse
Into my ear inclined; and as she peeped
Into my face with sparkling, smiling eyes
Her heart seemed smitten with my pleasant mien
And poured its story forth without disguise
As I a dainty morsel for this queen
Set down upon the table at my side.
And when her hunger she had fully quenched
She chirped good-bye, then straight without she hied,
And next day came again unto my bench.
And daily as I waited in the hall,
She came and chatted with me in delight
And left her pleasant treasure, soul and all,
That I might dream the sweeter through the night.
But now my bird has flown away and gone
To cheer some other suitor with her lay
And left me but the echoes of her song
To cheer my lonely musings of the day.

IS MACBETH A "GOD IN RUINS?"
[Written as an Exercise in English, at Williston.]
A god, Macbeth? No he is not a god,
Nor demigod; though hero still he be,
He hath no deed to deify performed
That's not o'erbalanced by some fiendish act,
Some dev'lish deed by wicked greed set on.
Unholy rev'rence of ambition's call
Hath robbed him of his virtue's saner self,
Dethroned his God-like qualities of heart
And crowned instead a grim, Satanic head
With blasted, evil, fame-shorn boastful and
Unhallowed glory of a murd'rer's lot:
And yet, he hath a tender, kinder strain
Which doth betimes express its manly self
And seek to overpower its counterpart
Of dark desire, but that she demon of
His earthly tie, that gentle creature turned
To cold, dead stone, also ambition's child,
Unholy in her base desire for name,
Unsexed by evil passion's claim of power,
Unseats his reason from its holy throne
And places there instead to rule his fate
The maddened fury of his baser wish;
And Macbeth's mortal god of right falls dead.

WILLISTON BATTLE SONG.
[Published in the Willistonian.]
Two football teams met one day
Down on the gridiron gay,
One wore the colors to "Worcester" true,
Red and black, as they flew
Out to fight Gold and Blue.
Proudly they ran to the field,
Cheered by the crowd as they wheeled,
But ere the game was done
With dear old Williston
They were compelled to yield,
CHORUS—
Let us give a hearty cheer
For old Williston so dear
And for all her sturdy men
Winning laurels for old "Sem."
May they ever play so well
That our spirits rise and swell,
Let us all join in a rousing, good yell!
Williston! Rah! Rah! Rah! Williston! Rah! Rah!
After the battle was o'er
"Worcester" went home worn and sore;
Williston cheered for the Blue and Gold
While the chapel bell tolled,
And the bonfire smoke rolled.
So may we always in strife,
Whether in school or in life,
Ever play fair and in
All of our struggles win
Williston fame and pride.
Oct., 1907.
THE LATENT THOUGHT.
There is no heav'n such as we're told
With marble halls and streets of gold,
Where angels wing their joyous flight,
Where all are clothed in robes of white.
There is no hell of burning stone
Where wicked souls forever groan
And burn,—nor lives a devil there—
Where all is darkness and despair.
Our conscience is the god we serve;
Our every act it does observe;
Our thoughts originate within
It, and we're turned by it from sin.
The devil is no more nor less
Than mem'ry of our wickedness
Ambitious, covetous desire
Of all its servants does require,
Our happiness is all our heaven;
It is of life the one sweet leaven;
Remorseful misery is our hell;
It is of life the solemn knell.
Our highest aim while life remain
Should be to stop some others' pain,
To do as we would have them do;
To make them happy, love them, too;
For life is gone when last we breathe;
We live no more when this we leave;
And as we live in joy or fear,
We have our hell or heaven here.
If we do good but for the pay
We're offered "of eternal day;"
If we do naught but what is right
For fear of hell's eternal night;
We are unworthy of reward—
We should do good for sweet accord—
And we are moral cowards all.
If we do good, whate'er befall,
In order that because we live
The world may better be and give
Us joy because we've made it so,
No greater should we wish to know;
For Heaven is a state combined
Of music, joy and love refined,
And all these hover round our soul:
If we but try, we reach the goal.
So, if you would in Heaven be,
Do good, be happy and be free;
But if to wickedness you're slave
You'll enter hell before the grave.

SHAKESPEARE MODERNIZED.
Who lynches me maims but this modeled clay;
And injures no one but his narrow self,
Although in principle he wrongs a race,
For souls of martyrs have eternal life;
But he who robs me of my all, my name,
Steals that which cannot make him wealthier,
But slanders me and leaves me poor indeed.

MEDITATIONS OF A NEGRO'S MIND. VII.
The same air purifies our blood,
The same food gives us health and strength,
The same stream quenches all our thirst,
All our emotions are the same,
Our minds imbibe the self-same thought,
Our feelings wounded are the same,
Sweet nature yields our toil as much,
The flowers bloom for us as well,
We're born, we live, we die the same,
When we are dead the self-same sod
Receives our bodies, and our souls
Are happy in the heaven, as yours,
'Tis true that our complexion is
Not light of color as is yours,
But should we, thefore, be proscribed
And ostracised, and scorned, and wronged?
Feb., 1908.
TO ONE UNKNOWN.
To one unknown to me,
A lady, kind and good,
Of old New England stock,
Who saw I loved to read, —
Once on a western train,—
And bought for me a book,
Although she knew me not,
I now indite these lines.
There are some few great hearts
Who have compassion for
A struggling, outcast race,
Whose sympathies are moved
And touched with pity deep
To see a worthy one,
Deprived of equal chance,
Still strive to raise his state;—
And she was one of them.
Some years have passed since then,
But I have not forgot
Her kind and generous act.
Here in this rhymeless verse
A grateful, proud heart sings
His lay of thankful praise
Unto an unknown grace
And bids the silent breeze
To waft his song to her
And whisper in her ear
That it was not in vain
She did an act so kind.
March, 1908.
A LOVER'S PROPOSAL.
My dear, sweet girl; I fancy you
Because you seem sincere and true:
Because you seem in thought so pure;
Because you have an aim in life;
Because you've suffered want and strife;
Because you suffer naught to lure
You from the work you've planned to do:
For Orpheus you've set to woo.
I like you for your honest face;
Your earnestness and easy grace.
I care not for mere outward show
Of features, for 'tis but a thin
Veneering;—lifeless, bloodless skin.
I find more beauty in the glow
Of fervency and love and truth
That lights your face and tints your youth
Than in the facial handsomeness
Of many girls who primp and dress
And spend their time in idle talk;
Who can do nothing well but be
Much talked of in "society;"
Whose greatest pleasure is to mock,
Or imitate some foppish flirt
To wear the finest hat or skirt.
True beauty dwells within the soul,
And only there. The face is cold
Without expression's tints and fires:
'Tis but the mirror of the heart,
Reflecting life's most studied art,
Portraying feelings, thoughts, desires
And longings, agonies and pain,
The unassuming and the vain.
The training of your girlhood days
Is well defined in all your ways:
You could not hide it if you would.
It well becomes you to obey,
To reverence your mother's gray.
I like you, for I think you're good.
I wonder if I'd ever rue
It, should I fall in love with you.
To satisfy me, I shall say
That, if, in future, day by day,
Your life and acts continue to
Be worthy as I think you now
To be, I'll make a solemn vow
That I shall love and honor you
And trust you with my name and fate.
If you will but reciprocate.
April, 1906.
ONLY THE SPAN OF A LIFE.
[To Mrs. J. K. P.]
Only the span of a life has passed
Since we were two little girls
Romping and playing, with ne'er a care,
Finding but joy in our worlds.
Only the span of a life has gone
Since we knew nothing of pain:
After a few more of life's frail days
We shall be painless again.
Only a space of three score and ten,
Filled with some joy with some strife,
Leavened with faith, hope, ambition, love,
Makes up what we call a life.
Only the memoirs of childhood days
Flit through our worn, weary brain
And, as we dream of our happy youth,
Lo! We are children again.
But, as if shadows, they fly away,
Back to their long-guarded cell,
There to continue their romp and play
Till life responds to death's knell.
Only the span of a life has passed,
But we have not lived for naught,
For we can go to our graves at last
Happy for what we have wrought.
May, 1906.
OUR AIM IN LIFE.
We all should endeavor to make others happy,
For life of itself enough sorrow will give:
Our sympathy, happiness, love, all have value—
The world should be better because we have lived.

DEDICATION. 
To the memory of a resolute Father, whose stern Christian Character finds agreeable balance in the pliant devotions of a kindly Mother, and to a galaxy of Brothers and Sisters, whose kind indulgences have inspired my dreams, I dedicate this volume.
Introductory.  
   The letter from the Author of these verses requesting a brief introduction discloses that, in putting before the public this modest little volume, he has, with no little reluctance, yielded to the requests of friends and to his own timid ambition and desire to serve a cause. 
   Yet his timidity denotes no cowardice, for he bravely takes his place with the advanced minority who are waging an unequal but righteous war against sordidness, opportunism and a "popular" sycophancy. Indeed he has forged to the very front in the battle-line — disdaining association with those who, although they may have been intrusted with the "five talents," intellectual, yet they skulk in the rear and exist on cast off loot or thrive by "sutlering" to first one army then the other while they rob the dead and disabled of both. 
   His lips having been "touched with alive coal from the altar" of race patriotism, he could not, if he would, fall away into the company of the panderers — those despicables, the present day "copper-heads," who, like their civil war prototypes, have been aptly described as without patriotism enough to join one army and without courage enough to join the other. 
   In his letter he says also that he makes no apology for seeking the company of those who scorn to profit by conceding, teaching and exemplifying race inferiority and subordination. Militant patriots will be proud to stand with him and the children of the Muses will not be ashamed to have him sit and sup with them. 
   While it is the qualities and efforts above outlined that dominate and make unique this volume, there is herein amusement, exhortation, entertainment and instruction affecting in differing- degrees different temperaments. 
   Critics and dissenters there will be in plenty, for sturdy truth does not generally provoke the loudest plaudits. The cuckoo's song, such as it is, and the parrot's prattle, which it probably does not itself understand, are more pleasing to the multitude than the eagle's scream or the lion's roar. 
Emerson says: 
    "The age wants heroes who shall dare to struggle in the solid ranks of truth; to clutch the monster, error, by the throat; to bear opinion to a loftier seat; to blot the error of impression

Preface. 
   For the first time I make my humble bow to a critical public with fear and trembling fear which naturally arises to a beginner in weighing his strength against countless master-minds, trembling, lest the world should say "Nay." 
   The unfavorable circumstances under which these verses were written could hardly justify my putting them before the public. Some were written, or at least begun in my earliest "teens," when my little world stretched just out across a few acres of corn and cotton to the little creek on the further side of the cow pasture; thence, back and up the lane to the old school house and back home again. Others, a little further on in the "teens," resting on my indulgent hoe or freighted bag between the cotton rows; others, sitting amid the clatter and clang and grime of railroad travel, or walking along the dusty thorofares of the town; or sitting in church under the inspiration of some lecture or sermon; or in the school room mid the bustle and hum of two-score obstreperous scholars; and finally, when sitting in my humblest of chambers, dreaming at my desk above my sister's piano-forte, I have felt some little wave of inspiration winging itself up from the soul of music which touched my heart-chords into song. It was then, if ever, that I may boast the distinction of having heard the rustle of the Muse's wings. 
   These verses just wrote themselves; I have merely been the instrument thru which some peculiar, un- known something has from early childhood been speaking. How near they may reach the mark of real poetry, I know not; but this is my apology: "What I have written, I have written." 
   My greatest reward lies in the hope that some "Chord" herein struck may in some measure redound to the inspiration of some boy and girl to aspire to all things in life that are truly beautiful, essentially pure, and intrinsically good and ideal. 
   If there be some "Discords" here which should seem harsh to some, — know that the harshest note that language owns is mild as childhood's lightest song compared with the pangs and afflictions of the oppressed.
   I cast this little volume from me as an Appeal, — an Appeal to courageous, patriotic men and women of sound moral ideas and ideals of soul. In a measure I represent the wronged and oppressed, and have dared to paint in feeble rhyme the truth which millions feel but dare not speak; and have endeavored to weave my soul-convictions and observations into songs to inspire; hoping to assist in moving the scales from the eyes of the misguided and aid in pointing the way; weaving upon the distant Horizon just enough tissues of "nonsense now and then" to break the stretch and cheer the road. 
   Let no man accuse the author of attempting the un- likely or grasping after the unattainable. He would be ungrateful to his conscience and the God that in- spires it did he not sing the song that floods his heart; and no disfavor will lessen his tender regard for these innocent ebullitions of hope: they are the transcripts of the soul-fires within. 
   Far in the distant somewhere, beyond the sickening shadows and the sordid strife of the world-clod, to joys of Life and Love, sweet visions beckon me. Shall soul of mine not mount? I prune my wings and fly. 
   To the world of critics, know this truth: Nothing herein is written to court the reluctant approval of men; for methinks it seemly, especially at "such a time as this" that they whom God has given tongues must speak not to placate nor please, but to spur and inspire. Likewise, does the writer realize to a most touching degree the awful ban and proscription placed, and by many of his own, upon that class of men who dare have the hardihood and courage to aspire for something in life more than the "loaves and fishes," and to reach out and up for the ideals. 
   Let the world regard this attempt as it may; for like John Brown, the Sainted, — "I expect nothing but to 'endure hardness;' but I expect to effect a mighty conquest even tho it be like the last victory of Samson." 
Sincerely, 
The Author.

Off to the Fields of Green. 
I was the wayward child, you know, 
   As the family records plainly show; 
They all were honored excepting me, 
   The rottenest limb on the family tree. 
"Stubborn," "selfish," so they sneer, 
   "Rather peculiar," "odd and queer," 
"Couldn't be loving, and wouldn't obey,
   Born for his freedom and to have his way," 
Temper! the like was never known, 
   Such as King Leo couldn't down; 
Would fight! althoin every one 
   Thrice whipped he'd be when each was done. 
And when the time for reckoning came, 
   Which one it was to bear the blame. 
Perhaps a lie would stain my lip,
   And then beneath the chastening whip 
I'd reap my dues, and off I'd skip— 
   Off to the fields of green.
Nine stalwart boys to brave the work, 
   One wayward chap to hide and shirk; 
Nine champions bold, with pick and spade 
   One dreaming youngster in the shade. 
What e'er the blame would chance to be 
   It all was sure to fall on me; 
But when the time for feasting came, 
   Ten heroes joined the festal game. 
Thru all the conflict firm I stood, 
   As bravely as a youngster could; 
For thus 'tis said in every age 
   It is a common heritage, 
That one should bear his brother's blame 
   And share alike another's shame. 
A witch stepped in the family pot 
   At times, and things grew hot somewhat, 
And things began to boil and bubble— 
   (I never like to trouble trouble) 
My hound and I to join the chase 
   Would steal away and off we'd race, 
With yelp and yell and quickened pace— 
   Off to the fields of green. 
To chase the hare — what grander joy 
   Can thrill the heart of farmer boy, 
When skies are blue and fields are green,
   And nature wears her robe of sheen 
When flowers gay and tempting shade 
   Combine to make the heart feel glad,
And songs of birds and brooklets gay 
   Combine to chase dull care away? 
But after awhile the summons came 
   To go to school — (Am I to blame 
Because I saw my honored name 
   Inscribed upon the halls of fame?) 
I left my hoe upon the farm, 
   The bucket fell from off my arm, 
Wherewith from out the hillside spring 
   I'd bear the liquid offering. 
I proudly walked mid classic halls, 
   Where classic lore rang from the walls, 
And sweet Pierian Springs sprang up,
   Where young Ambition fain might sup 
The treasured nectar from the bowl 
   To quench the thirst within the soul. 
But while I drank to youthful dreams, 
  Too soon I muddied up the streams; 
For I was young, and youth is rude 
   Untamed by years of hardihood; 
And so we claim boyhood's careers 
   The scapegoat of our after years. 
Demerits forty, plus threescore 
   Stood 'gainst my name — it took no more 
To have my name—(Alas! for shame!) 
   Erased from off the walls of fame. 
I stood before the College Judge, 
   But young ambition didn't budge,
Except to hang my head in shame 
   Of banishment beside my name. 
The sentence read in language bold, 
   My pulse stopped still, my heart froze cold: 
“You're guilty, Sir, of many a flaw 
   And oft have rudely broke the law;
And since you will not keep the rule,
   We now dismiss you from the school!"
Well, since I found it hard to stay 
   And no tears the debt to pay, 
I packed my bag and sailed away— 
   Back to the fields of green. 
But they who pray shall never lack; 
   Thru mercy's prayer they took me back, 
And at the shrine I pledged my truth 
   To be no more the wayward youth. 
And they who once would oft deride 
   The wayward boy now said with pride 
And smiling face and grateful look:
   A clever chap when with a book." 
And since vacation days have come, 
   And school is out, the paths lead home, 
They who once scorned the heedless lad, 
   And called him names that sound so bad 
Now think it not a sacrifice 
   To bend their wills to his advice. 
And with reflection o'er the scene 
   Of by-gone days I stroll the green
With dog and book and yearning soul 
   To reach ambition's hoped-for goal. 
And yet despite the worldly glare 
   Of pomp and wealth, of jewels rare, 
In all the world wherein we rove 
   I boast but one — a mother's love. 
And still a child, to life unknown, 
   I'll be a man some day, I own; 
And then, perchance, I shall obey 
   The things my friends will have to say. 
But long as hope rides o'er the storm,
   And fires of life and love burn warm, 
I seek no watchman on the wall 
   Excepting brave ambition's call. 
With that Great Pilot at the helm, 
   No waves can my little bark o'erwhelm; 
I'll bravely breast the raging waves, 
   And gently sail the deep, dark caves 
Till I shall reach my Haven sweet 
   And lay my trophies at His feet; 
And by that fair Celestial throne 
   I'll wait to hear His sweet "Well done." 
And should I reach that Happy Land 
   Where Christ sits at His God 's right hand, 
Where — when the heavenly trump shall call 
   The sons of earth both great and small 
To give account of what they've done, 
   What battles fought, what victories won
The sheep run in to the Shepherd's fold, 
   The goats go shivering out in the cold, 
Where the good shalllie in pastures green, 
   And the young lambs on His bosom lean—
May I not blush to hear my name, 
   May I not hang my head in shame; 
But there rejoice that He hath smiled 
   To welcome in the wayward child, 
Where free from toils and pain and care, 
   Where all is love and all is fair— 
If I meet none save my mother there 
   Then off to the Fields of Green. 
The Birth. 
When pregnant darkness ruled the pale 
   His Spirit on the darkness shone; 
Chaos in travail rent the veil— 
   The morning broke, and Earth was born.
Wail on a Wicked Bachelor. 
Ho, every one who would be wise!  
   Come, hearken to my wail; 
The hero if ye should despise, 
   Spare him who tells the tale. 
A bachelor lived in our town, 
   As sour as the rest; 
He won distinction and renown, 
   As one ill-tempered pest. 
A selfish life this bachelor led, 
   Within his lone retreat; 
The hungry thrice per day he fed 
   When he sat down to eat. 
He claimed no comforts for his lot, 
   No bounties he desired; 
The outcast shared his humble cot, 
   Whenever he retired. 
He grumbled with both quick and dead, 
   As he alone could wish; 
He on the waters cast his bread, 
   When he went off to fish. 
A proverb heard this wicked soul, 
   “Go to the ant; be wise;”
Straight to his aunt he went and stole 
   Her gold before her eyes.
At length he sought a wife to wed, 
   To share his ill-got pelf; 
He found a wizen, witch-like maid 
   As wicked as himself. 
They growled and grumbled night and day, 
   Each struggling to be free; 
Too much alike in every way 
   For either to agree. 
At last she took his coffee cup, 
   And doped it on the sly; 
And when he drank the final drop 
   At once fell back to die. 
And when upon his dying bed, 
   His head bent to his breast,
He lifted up his feeble head 
   And made one last request. 
He asked her that his money go, 
   To bachelors who were free: 
She hurled one sharp, defiant, “no!
  I'll spend it all on me."
Once more he lifted up his head, 
   Defiant eye met eye; 
He sprang up from his bed and said: 
   "I just refuse to die!"
Criticism on Biography. 
Among the many things in life 
   Which I should like to know— 
Is how can men e'er reach the top 
   Who started down so low? 
He who was born in palace halls 
   And rocked in riches’ arm, 
When he grows up his life begins: 
   “I started on a farm.”
He who was born with wealth and lands 
   Inherited from his kin— 
Rises to fame and he began: 
   "Most destitute of men." 
He who was born mid charms of gold, 
   His cup with nectar sweet, 
When he grows up his life begins:
   "I broke rocks on the street." 
He whose rich voice and princely form 
   The senate halls adorn, 
"Was once a bootblack on the street, 
   And on a farm was born." 
He on whose brow no drop of sweat 
   Has ever wet a hair, 
"Toiled on life's weary, rugged road 
   With head and feet lay bare."
And so I read biographies, 
   They fill me with surprise; 
Half of it all is, I conclude, 
   A good write-up of lies. 
A Spade is Just A Spade. 
As I talk with learned people, 
   One remark they often make 
Quite beyond my comprehension, 
   But I yield for conscience sake; 
That 'tis best not be too modest 
   Whatsoever thing is said: 
Give to everything its color. 
   Always call a spade a spade. 
Now I am not versed in Logic, 
   Nor these high-flown classic things, 
And am no adept in solving, 
   Flighty aphoristic slings; 
So this proverb seems to baffle
   All the efforts I have made— 
Now what else is there to call it 
   When a spade is just a spade?
Be True. 
Deep down within this failing frame 
   Dwells an immortal Voice, 
It keeps the soul with hope aflame, 
   Makes languid life rejoice. 
Be true to Life and Love we must, 
   Sweet conscience's voice obey, 
Preserve with care His sacred dust—
   The everlasting Yea 
Speaks from beneath this crumbling clod, 
  "To Truth be true — obey." 
Judge not this crude external clod, 
   Too rude in clay 'tis wrought: 
Within with the Eternal God 
   And Life the soul is frought. 
The clod may crumble, not to die, 
   But that it may reveal 
That Conscious Self to God so nigh— 
   That Undying Ideal 
Lives thru the sinful, sordid strife. 
   Foretells a brighter day— 
Be true to Self, to Love, to Life, 
   To Truth be true — obey.
Too Much Religion. 
There is too much time for doctrine, 
   Too much talk of church and creeds; 
Far too little time for duty, 
   And to heal some heart that bleeds. 
Too much Sunday Church religion,
   Too many stale and bookish prayers;
Too many souls are getting ragged, 
   Watching what their neighbor wears.
What's the diff'rence twixt a washing 
   Whether in a creek or bowl,
Since the love of Christian duty 
   Reigns supreme within the soul? 
All the unction and the washing 
   That the Church on earth applies 
Won't suffice to clean a sinner 
   If his heart is choked with lies. 
There is too much talk of Heaven, 
   Too much talk of golden streets, 
When one can't be sympathetic 
   When a needy neighbor meets. 
Too much talk about the riches 
   You expect to get "up there," 
When one will not do his duty 
   As a decent Christian here.
There is too much Sunday goodness 
   When you gather at the Church, 
While next day you spurn a brother 
   Who has fallen in the lurch. 
There is too much mournful preaching, 
   Talking of the things to come; 
How can you live straight in Heaven 
   When there's crookedness at home? 
And you needn't think the angels 
   Have no other work to do, 
But to stitch on fancy garments 
  To be packed away for you; 
For some people live so crooked, 
   Those robes may refuse to fit. 
Let us have less talk of Heaven 
   And do right a little bit. 
The Falling of A Star. 
‘Tis the story of a woman, 
   Born and lapped in riches' arms, 
Wealth and honors, fame and fortunes 
   Lavished all their worldly charms. 
All the charms the world could offer 
   Brought their revenues of gold,
And the wealth from every quarter 
   Sheltered underneath her fold. 
So she lived in royal splendor, 
   And with gaudy equipage; 
Servants waited round her portals, 
   She a queen of lord and sage. 
Men of wealth and worldly wisdom 
   Poured their treasures in her shrine; 
If they might but only woo her, 
   And around her table dine. 
Thus to woo this favored maiden, 
   And to win her fair young hand,
Men of every stage and station 
   Came to her from every land; 
But in vain their hands they offered, 
   Save the one of wealth and fame; 
Nothing great was there beside it— 
   Virtue, honor, but a name. 
Vanity and vain desire 
   Raised her high upon the stage, 
And to fortune's temple wafted 
   In her gaudy equipage. 
Strangely, truly, vain as mortals,
   With an eye of sullied lust,
Took the crown from fortune's mansion,
   Laid art's temple in the dust. 
When society's fashions won her
   It was on a ball-room floor, 
Where she made her first appearance— 
   It was pleasure—nothing more; 
But the vanity of pleasure 
   And the thirsty greed of men 
Proved too great and strong a tempter— 
   She was tempted there to sin. 
There amid her first carousing— 
   (What a sad and solemn thought!) 
When she drank the health of pleasure 
   That the cup was poison frought. 
So she drank; and O for woman, 
   When she stoops to take a sup, 
Seeing not the deadly poison 
   Lurking deep within the cup! 
What can recompense the folly? 
   O, the grave and solemn shame 
The moment vice and desecration 
   Enter in her sacred frame! 
Fair her face was as a sunbeam, 
   And a stately queenly form; 
Every fibre in her features 
   Added lustre to her charm; 
But her mind was as polluted 
   At the stagnant pools of sin, 
And her heart was stained and foul 
   As the crimes she bred within.
Alas! her fortunes proved a vapor, 
   Like the glories that have flown; 
They who ran to offer treasures 
   Turned their heads in bitter scorn. 
Fame and fortune, wealth and riches 
   Wait their wings and take their flight; 
Pomp and pride can not sustain them, 
   Unsupported by the right. 
And she fell from fame and fortune 
   Like a meteor from the throne, 
To the depths of dark perdition, 
   Lost, forgotten, and unknown. 
O, the vanity of fashion! 
   If our hearts would disenthrall! 
Vaunting pride and vain ambitions 
   Are forerunners of a fall. 
Outward form and hues external 
   Are too often vainly wooed; 
Many a fair and dainty flower 
   Harbors poison in its bud; 
Many a fair and polished temple, 
   Seemingly where angels dwell 
Is the portal to destruction, 
   And the by-path down to hell. 
Truth and pride are not congenial; 
   (And to prove the assertion true, 
Beauty is not akin to virtue,
  Save where virture paints the hue.)
What a solemn trust in woman! 
   How like Heaven she should prove! 
Something more than merely human, 
   But a part of things above. 
Last and best of God's creation, 
   Let the world not on thee frown; 
Pride of Heaven and earth, O woman, 
   Prove thyself creation's crown. 
To “The Guardian” of Boston, Mass. 
God called thee in a dreadful time, 
   [Thy]* race's life was crushed; 
Thy earliest note brought hope sublime. 
   When bridled tongues were hushed 
Against the wrongs ten millions face 
   With hearts bowed, bleeding, torn— 
Thou rose like Atlas with thy race 
   Upon thy shoulders borne. 
The blood of heroes spurs thee up, 
   The shades of martyrs gone 
Return to bless thy bittered cup, 
   And bid thee live — fight on; 
The spirits of the dead arise 
   Vile treason to dethrone— 
The God of all eternities 
   Still bids thee live — fight on.
And in this awful, awful hour, 
   When manhood's but a name— 
When greed of gold and lust for power 
   Have sold a race to shame, 
Great God, sustain the warrior's arm 
   Who strives in freedom's cause, 
And save a race from sordid harm 
   By Thy eternal laws. 
Our strength is tied, our tongues are still, 
   We are but free in name, 
Crushed is our pride by wrongs that chill—
   Results of slavery's shame; 
In blinding darkness still we grope, 
   Not slaves and yet not free; 
With bleeding souls in prayer and hope 
   We wait and watch for Thee. 
Great God! and shall the traitor live 
   In such an awful hour? 
O, could some hero quit the grave 
   To down deception's power! 
Up men with vengeance in your sword 
   The hypocrit to slay! 
The Harpies on his flesh shall goad, 
   And on his vitals prey. 
As "Liberator" saved the slave, 
   Thou "Guardian" guards the free—
Uncompromising, stalwart, brave, 
   And still more strong to be; 
Fight on ! the right shall yet prevail, 
   The God's are all with thee; 
The spoilor and his snares shall fail, 
   The captive shall go free. 
No base proscription tinged with greed 
   Doth curb thy upward flight; 
Not color, kindred, kind, thy creed. 
   But "Fight with might for right"; 
Thy righteous cause no bribe shall tinge— 
   How brave 'neath awful ban 
To dare to make a coward cringe, 
   And dare to be a man! 
Wrong's Reward. 
It is writ in truth eternal. 
   And the stars of heaven tell. 
That he who dares to do the wrong 
   Has pitched his tent toward hell; 
For his steps shall lead him downward, 
   And his tottering limbs shall fall, 
And the wrath of God's defiance 
   Shall surround him like a pall. 
It was sung at earth's awakening, 
   ‘Twill be sung when earth is past, 
That the cup of worldly pleasure 
   Is embittered at the last.
‘Tis more deeply still recorded— 
   Dread Junction 'gainst the strong— 
Men like Autumn leaves shall tremble 
   When they dare to do the wrong. 
Decked with thorns the Right may suffer, 
   Wrong may triumph with his crown: 
At the stake the Truth may falter, 
   But His Providential frown 
Breeds eternal retribution, 
   Tho the debt may linger long, 
But the dread recoil is coming 
   To the man who does the wrong. 
King and Queen may rise and revel 
   In the wealth of life they hoard, 
‘Neath their sway the slave may swelter 
   Underneath his master's load— 
Potentates may reign in power, 
   Vile at heart, but great in song; 
But the Gods hold vindication 
   ‘Gainst the man who does the wrong. 
Lo! the avenging arm of Justice 
   Holds aloof the awful stroke; 
But in pity still He stays it— 
   'Tis to man a mocking joke. 
O, when patience is exhausted! 
   Wearied out redemption's song! 
Men like Autumn leaves shall tremble 
   When they dare to do the wrong.
Money. 
The Song of the Worldly Man. 
O money, mighty, gilded King, 
   To thee with all my might I cling. 
Before thy gilded throne I pray. 
   Thy merry jingle cheers my way. 
Almighty dollar, God of power, 
   Across the world looms up thy tower; 
And men and nations bend the knee, 
   And life is sacrificed to thee. 
Who is this God I must obey 
   When pride of money cheers my way? 
I hold the world, what more is there 
  That I should bend my knee in prayer?
'Tis by my gold that nations rise, 
   And temples tower to the skies, 
And mighty kingdoms wax and wane, 
   But thou, my gold, dost still remain. 
And over man thy sway still rules, 
   Contempt of sages and the pride of fools. 
And happy I, tho fool, obey 
   And fall submissive 'neath thy sway. 
And yet, somehow, I love thee, Gold, 
   A mighty power thou dost withhold; 
By thee I rule the headless clan,
   And purchase nations to a man;
I rob the church and steal her name, 
   And lead the christian off to shame; 
I soothe one heart, another break, 
   I give her bread, her virtue take. 
Bat what care I for right or wrong? 
   Give me my gold, my wine, my song! 
What more can life or Heaven hold 
   Than pride of mine? my Gold—my Gold! 
I crave no joy that mortals hold— 
   I love my Gold—I love my Gold! 
Where Air of Freedom Is. 
Where air of freedom is 
   I will not yield to men— 
   To narrow caste of men 
   Whose hearts are steeped in sin.
   I'd rather sell the king,
   And let his goods be stole,
   Than yield to base controle 
       Of vile and godless men. 
Where air of freedom is 
   I will not yield to men. 
   I'd rather choose to die 
   Than be a living lie— 
   A lie in all I preach,
   A lie in all I teach, 
   While Truth within my heart 
   Its burning fires dart 
   To burn my mask of sin. 
   I'd rather vict'ry win 
   Thru martyr's death than grin 
       At wrongs of godless men. 
Where air of freedom is 
   I will not yield to men. 
   I spurn the alms of men, 
   The livery of kings; 
   I own far nobler things. 
   I'd rather choose to own 
   The pauper's garb and bone, 
   The eagle's eye of truth, 
   The lion's strength of youth, 
   The liberty of thought, 
   A free man's right unbought, 
   A conscience and a soul, 
   Beyond the king's controle 
   Than be the lord of slaves, 
   Of quaking, aching slaves, 
   Of senseless, soulless knaves, 
   Or seek to revel in 
   His ill-got wealth and fame,
   His world-wide name or shame, 
   His liberty to sin— 
        I will not yield to men.
Immortality. 
Whether a place or a condition, 
   Or however the future be— 
I know there is a Heaven of bliss 
   Prepared somewhere for me; 
And if the lake be burning where 
   "The hell worm never dies" 
I have this consolation still— 
   That's for my enemies. 
Ode To Ethiopia. 
Think not, O Ethiopia, 
   Thy gift to greatness small; 
Within the courts where glory dwells 
   Hangs high upon the wall 
The scroll of fame whereon thy name 
   In burning truth sublime 
Tells of thy deeds which shall survive 
   The crumbling years of time.
Tho earth ungrateful for the blood 
   Thy sons have fed her soil, 
And man forget the virtue of 
   Thy ever matchless toil; 
Eternal Truth shall weave in song 
   Thy gift to martyrdom 
To be the theme of angels in 
   The crowning years to come. 
What grander boast than boast of mind, 
   Of might, of heart and soul? 
What nobler triumphs dare to find 
   Adornment on life's scroll 
Than conquests wrought mid stripes and chains 
   Despite the chastening rod? 
Thy ebon Royalty remains 
   The sanction of a God. 
Go, Saxon, from Gibraltar search 
   To shores of Hebrides, 
Search from fair Hellas on the South 
   Beyond the Northern Seas, 
You find no such heroic race 
   As thy black fellow man— 
We fling defiance in thy face, 
   The black man leads the van.
Thy palest son e'er bleached by snows 
   Blown from fair Caucasus height 
Can boast no richer laurels won 
   Than by the black man's might; 
No generation, kindred, kind, 
   Nor race, nor tribe, nor clan, 
Has triumphed mid such threatening doom— 
   The black man leads the van. 
O Ethiopia, my pride, 
   I love thee as a bride, 
The ebon richness of thy hues— 
   I clasp thee to my side; 
From thy rich blood brave kings have sprung 
   And choicest queens are born,  
Thy velvet beauty dearer far 
   Than palest lily grown. 
Tho savage might may lead thee forth 
   And spoil thy happy isle, 
And weld the chains to mock thy pride, 
   Thy fairy lands defile; 
Thy master soul 'neath shattered dreams 
   Doth still shine forth serene—  
Despite the dreams that might have been,
   Thou art thyself, O Queen. 
The Church Seeker. 
I have thought of the denominations 
   Abounding on every hand, 
And wondered just who is in the right way
   That leads to the blest Promised Land;
When each calls the other in error, 
   To comprehend seems pretty hard, 
While all seek to reach the same Heaven, 
   And worship the very same God.
Now, there stands the one with his dogmas. 
   One jot to none else he concedes;
Another fixed in Confirmation, 
   Another confessions and creeds. 
They pass to and fro with their doctrines, 
   In form pouring forth their complaints, 
Enough to quite frighten the sinner, 
   And well-nigh embarrass the saints. 
I think I would like to be Quaker, 
   Forgetting the things of the sod, 
And silently sit in His temple 
   And hold close communion with God. 
And then when His Spirit should move me, 
   I'd wash in the blood from His side, 
Then meekly I'd lay down my burden 
   At the cross of the pure Crucified.
I should want the grave Bishop confirm me, 
   His priest standing close by my side, 
And swear to the meek Convocation— 
   My conscience should then be my guide. 
Then taking the harp and the psalt'ry 
   I'd chant the sweet: “Praise, ye, the Lord," 
The "Thirty-nine Articles" guide me 
   Straight on to the Kingdom of God. 
Then I'd like to just lay down my ritual,
   With none save the Testament New, 
And empty my soul of emotion, 
   As only a Baptist can do. 
Then take me right down to the Jordan, 
   And bury me deep 'neath the wave; 
Then washing myself of defilement, 
   I rise newly-born from the grave. 
I would like a pure Methodist sprinkling, 
   For so spoke His prophet to men;
“I sprinkle clean water upon you,
   And ye shall be free from your sin." 
Then I think of anointment of Aaron— 
   The ointment ran down from his head, 
Like dews running down from Mt. Herman— 
   Then I feel sweet atonement is made. 
I'd be just a good Baptist-Quaker, 
   Confining my service to none,
A true Methodist-Presbyterian, 
   And orthodox Christian in one,— 
A Catholic-Episcopalian, 
   Withal, a confirmed Proselyte 
Of pure Congregationalism— 
   I'd then stand a chance to be right. 
I could just quit them all and then listen 
   When the old folks spread open their soul, 
And sing of the aches and the sorrows, 
   And the balm that doth sweetly console; 
Then just float right on into Heaven, 
   On the wings of the soul-thrilling song. 
And then sit right down in the Kingdom 
   By the ransomed in that blood-washed throng. 
To The Hypocrit. 
   I would rather pass over 
      The infidel's creeds,
   Or pardon with pity 
      The meanest of deeds, 
   Than once coincide 
      With the king's haughty airs, 
   Or dare to be moved 
      By the hypocrit's prayers.
   The man who complains 
      When the world is all song, 
   Or dares to sit mute 
      When the world is all wrong— 
   Who barters his freedom 
      Vile honors to win, 
   Deserves but to die 
      With the vilest of men. 
   I've respect for the sinner 
      Standing boldly aloof; 
   I've respect for the skeptic 
      Demanding his proof; 
   For their sins are uncovered, 
      Their creeds are all known, 
   If I should fall victim, 
      The fault is my own; 
   But the man who will cloak 
      In a flattering disguise, 
   And preach what he knows to be 
      Slanderous lies, 
   Is unworthy to rest 
      ‘Neath the commonest sod; 
   He is mocked by Eternity, 
      And scoffed by his God.
To W. E. Burghardt DuBois. 
   Let darts assail his plaited mail, 
       Who stands alone for right; 
   Let scorns of men and hisses rail 
   Against his armor—all will fail, 
       Nor threat, nor thrall shall fright,— 
   Hero is he who dares assail 
   The wrong till wrong shall quake and quail, 
   Who stands mid lightning and the gale 
       Alone with God and Right.
             -----------------------
O Ethiope, arise, shake off thy wail, 
   For unto thee is born a Galahad— 
Thy peerless Knight to win the Holy Grail, 
   In whose undaunted strength thy sons are glad. 
He bids thee rise above the sordid sod, 
His trenchant sword doth carve the rising road 
       That leads to hills of God. 
Du Bois brave, we love thee for thy might, 
   We glory in thy cultured, winging soul; 
All thine beyond the "Veil" fair realms of light. 
   And thou wouldst have us seek the highest goal. 
Thy noble soul is not content with bread, 
But Manna from the hills of God instead. 
       Where Heaven's love is shed.
With thunder thou dost thunder back at wrong, 
   Thy great ideals will make a nation free; 
Thy lightnings pierce the evils of the strong, 
   And thou dost make no tame apology. 
While moles may not attain unto thy flight, 
Both men and angels follow thee to light, 
       O noble, princely Knight. 
Or fame, or blame, thou givest man his due, 
   Nor flinch when Justice bids thee strike the wrong; 
Thou givest right and wrong their proper hue, 
   Demanding what most rightly doth belong. 
Tho baser men assail thee, thou dost stand, 
Tho no vast armies follow thy command— 
       God's still at thy right hand. 
And thou dost not accept inferior place, 
   For thou art part of God like other men; 
Nor dost thou grin at wrongs done to thy race, 
   Nor seek thru fawning art applause to win. 
Thou playest well and best the master role. 
Illuming baser parts with gift of soul— 
       Thou playest for men, not mole. 
And what is wealth or worldly praise to thee? 
   (Thy eagle wings—they stretch too far for men) 
Thou seekest for a higher liberty,
   And carest not the fickle crowd to win. 
Thy kingdoms are the stretch of moral worlds, 
Adorned with freedom's intellectual pearls, 
       Where light of God unfurls.
O Child of Night, all Heaven bids thee fly;
   And soaring high pluck from thy wings a quill, 
And dip it in the stars of Heaven's sky; 
   And pen thy race's name on Heaven's Hill. 
Then angels' harps attuned to chords unknown 
Shall chant the pulsing strain from throne to throne 
       Of one so nobly born. 
The Warbler and the Worm. 
High over the vale the warbler perched, 
   The whole surrounding main he searched; 
All creatures else he would engage, 
   As if the world were built his stage. 
He poured his heart full out in song, 
   He warbled thus the live day long, 
Nor thought what time or tide might bring; 
   His theme was but to soar and sing.
A worm was plodding in the wood 
   A-hoarding in his Winter's food; 
And thought the warbler vain and wrong 
   To waste the precious hours in song. 
A critic bold with voice as firm, 
   Spoke out his wrath, thus did the worm: 
“’Twere better far for all thy kind, 
   If thou wouldst leave thy song behind; 
Thy lazy lay's a dodge to shirk— 
   The noblest duty lies in work.”
The warbler paused awhile to hear 
   What truth the worm's dull note might bear—
“I pity thee, poor toiling worm, 
   Doomed to the dust to slave and squirm. 
Thou crawlest the earth—thy glory ends 
   Where royal rule of mine begins.”
And once again his lay began, 
   The whole gamut of song he ran. 
The bird's rebuke in language gruff. 
   Chagrined the worm to make rebuff:
“I am the monarch of the soil, 
   And find a comfort in my toil. 
I knead the soil and work for man,
   That he may feed and clothe his clan; 
I am forerunner of the plow— 
   Far less a benefactor thou.”
And so the worm turned to his load, 
   And plodded on along the road. 
The warbler proudly spread his wing, 
   And perched on higher bough to sing,
As if to spurn the worm's dull fee
   And better show his royalty; 
And conscious of a nobler pride, 
   He thus to plodding worm replied:
“And what is life without a song 
   To cheer the road you plod along?
My song gives ease unto thy load, 
   Nor do I crave the things you hoard: 
My kingdom is the stretch of wing, 
   With royal right to soar and sing; 
The realms of light and life are mine, 
   A kinship with the things devine;
I spurn the dismal vale you plod, 
   I mount up to the hills of God.”
And proud to be a warbler born, 
   He raised his note and still sang on. 
And warbling warbler warbles song,
   And worming worm doth worm along; 
Each conscious of superior worth, 
   Each priding in a nobler birth. 
And man is warbler, also worm, 
   He soars and sings and stoops to squirm;
He worms along to get his food, 
   And sings to make it sweet and good. 
At morn he wrings from earth her fee, 
   At evening turns to minstrelsy. 
Where none will toil — a sickly throng, 
   And worse with none to cheer with song. 
The Black Soldiers. 
Have you heard the story of the conflict? 
Has the song of poet told it true— 
How the Blacks have fought to win their freedom, 
How they died with those who wore the blue? 
All the rhyme and measures of the poet 
Fail to add true lustre to his name, 
Nothing save the flashes of his musket 
Justly light his hidden scroll of fame. 
   It was in the struggle of the sixties. 
When the chains of thraldom held him tight, 
Must he wear oppression's stripes forever? 
Shall he seek his freedom in the fight? 
Came the message "Men of might are needed, 
Dark Rebellion creeps upon the land; 
No blacks need apply,” the orders stated,
“Only whites are suited to command.”
But the conflict deepened at Manassas, 
And "disunion" stared them in the face, 
Foes of freedom struck a blow of triumph, 
Stained the nation's banner with disgrace. 
And like forest fire raging onward, 
East to West Rebellion led the van, 
Leaving in its pathway grim destruction— 
A country found her slave was more than man. 
Gladly beating plowshares into swords, 
Beating hooks for pruning into spears, 
He became the Demon of the battle,
Dreading not the battle's burning fears. 
Thus he plunged into the bloody conflict, 
Still undaunted by its death and heat, 
Wrote the name of "Freedom" 'cross the heavens 
Saved the Union from a dread defeat. 
   Who will say the black man is no soldier? 
Who will say he is not brave to fight? 
Stript of every chance of fair distinction, 
With no armor save his naked might— 
Thrown upon the belching breech at Pillow, 
Atlas-like the nation's load he bore; 
And at blazing Hudson still a martyr, 
Dying with the banner at the fore. 
In the sternest struggle e'er recorded 
Torch and ax were laid upon the tree— 
He was first in dying for his country. 
Freeing it and, yet, himself not free.
O, could pen of poet paint the story, 
How amid the dread, uoquenching flood, 
Caring naught for fame and less for glory, 
With his musket wrote his name in blood. 
   Listen to the story told at Wagner, 
Before whose guns like leaves brave heroes fell, 
How the Fifty-fourth of Massachusetts 
Conquered and outbraved the fires of hell. 
Day and night they march and falter never. 
Hungered and aweary from the strife, 
Knowing naught of comfort nor of shelter, 
Counting not the priceless boon of life. 
Down upon them rained the shells of Wagner, 
In their tracks the blood was streaming down—
Who will bear the flag upon the ramparts?" 
Did the black man falter with a frown? 
Forward sprang the gallant sergeant Carney, 
With a brave resolve to do or die— 
"I will bear it up," the Sergeant shouted, 
“Or else report to God the reason why!" 
Fearlessly he grasped the starry standard,
Only as a god or demon could, 
And upon the bloody heights he pinned it, 
Fixed it fast and sealed it with his blood. 
Wounded thrice they bore him from the conflict, 
Bleeding, torn, his comrades gathered round. 
As they cooled his bleeding brow he murmured: 
“The old flag never touched the ground."
Love's Unchangeableness. 
The kingdoms of ages have gone, 
   They crumble and lie with the sod; 
Like leaves their rich glories are strewn— 
   They return to their doom or their God. 
And where is the pride of the past, 
   The glories of earthly domains? 
They fall 'neath the withering blast— 
   And yet, O, yet love still remains. 
And what of fair Athens and Rome, 
   The pride that they once boasted of? 
They fade as fades beat of the drum. 
   Into common clay they dissolve. 
And Babel to dust doth return, 
   The builders took His name in vain; 
But flames of fair friendship still burn, 
   And pleasures of love still remain. 
We watch the bright trend of the age, 
   And gather its wisdom and lore, 
Commune with the Savage and Sage, 
   And snatch from Dame Science her store; 
But wealth and all wisdom may fail. 
   And Want follow fast in their train; 
Still over the wreck and the pale, 
   The emblem of love will remain.
To Booker T. Washington. 
   Who would condone the wrong, 
      Or else for private gain 
   Speaks what his heart disproves, 
      Who would his conscience blunt 
   And accept a lie for truth, 
      Or else accept inferior place 
   When God hath made us men,— 
      Mocks the God who made him. 
   Rebukes the highest attributes 
      That distinguish man from beast. 
   And makes himself less than man.

And what doth shade of Douglass think of thee?
   (Since shades of martyrs o'er the present brood) 
His pure, exalted Muse of liberty 
   Is raped by menial, cringing servitude. 
Can worldly gain be more than righteousness? 
Is wealth supreme, and right and manhood less? 
       Shall gold rule godliness? 
What hope is in what thou dost advocate? 
   Cite history to prove what thou dost preach; 
Did nation ever rise to noble state 
   By groveling fore'er as thou dost teach? 
Can Ethiopia e'er hope to rise 
If she for others' wrongs apologize— 
       If she submit to lies?
Since worlds began to move and men contend, 
   The right of life and liberty were first; 
Free and respected they who would not bend— 
   To kiss the rod were to be deemed accursed. 
And wrong has never bowed his head to right 
Except beneath the sword of those who fight; 
       To such will come the light. 
"The life is more than meat," the Saviour said, 
   "The body more than raiment" that we wear; 
To aim of life is not for gold nor bread, 
   But for a nobler life man to prepare. 
And better far that man should die unborn 
Than sell the soul he cannot call his own 
       To reign on Mammon's throne. 
Thy life has been a curse upon thy race, 
   Nor hast thou spoken save to trade for gold; 
Thy servile creed hath brought thy race disgrace, 
   But brought to thee the millions thou dost hold. 
Ah! nobler far to fill a nameless grave 
Than reign a hired tool, a pliant knave— 
       'Twere better die than slave! 
"In word and deed unmanned," and yet unshamed, 
   "From birth till death enslaved" to other men; 
Our highest ends and aims thou hast defamed— 
   Who freedom prize seek more than bread to win. 
The freedom bought at cost of millions' blood 
Is bartered out the world's vile pelf to hoard, 
       As Judas sold his God.
When fearful storms our brightest hopes would blast 
   Thou leavest our fated ship alone at sea, 
And into silence slink till all is past, 
   Or else thy arm doth join the enemy; 
The crisis past — we dying see thee rise 
Upon the arm that doomed our energies— 
       Thy race thy sacrifice. 
And what has followed in the wake of thee? 
   Her civil, moral, intellectual death, 
Her franchise rights, the boon of liberty, 
   They die defeated by thy blighting breath— 
The dwarfing of her best and brained schools, 
Dread ostracisms, crimes, and lynching rules, 
       Thy race the prey of fools. 
And valiant men shall mock thy idol god— 
   ‘Twas lust for power defeated men of old; 
And moth and rust shall eat thy ill-got hoard, 
   Or thieves break thru and prey upon thy gold. 
So long as Freedom sheds her potent flame,
Men will arise to hiss the traitor's name 
       Who sold his race to shame.
Evolution. 
The Scientific men declare 
   That man from monkey came; 
But prided Christian minds regard 
   The theory with shame, 
And marvel now presumptuous men 
   Blaspheme Jehovah's name. 
And men who hold these varied views 
   With arguments have tried, 
And clashed on learning's battle ground 
   To justify their side; 
But when at last could not agree 
   Each said the other lied. 
And theologs have spent their oil, 
   And spared no search nor pain
To cement all the scattered links 
   Thruout creation's chain 
To put to naught the theory 
   The scientists maintain. 
The horse began the size of fox, 
   At first his toes were five; 
Alike thru years the lower forms 
   To higher forms arive; 
And in the clash of weak and strong 
   The fittest will survive.
The weaker creatures died out 
   Beneath their stronger foe, 
Who metamorphosed himself somewhat 
   As upward he did grow— 
Thus parent stocks were modified, 
   Zoology will show. 
Fair Science still comes to our aid; 
   We find as we pursue, 
The flea into grasshopper jumped, 
   Then frog—and on he grew 
To flying-squirrel—opossum next— 
   Then into Kangaroo. 
And, musing o'er his helpless state, 
   The poor disgruntled snail 
Took to the water and became 
   A thing of more avail; 
He changed to minnow,—shad—then shark,
   To porpoise—into whale. 
The lightning-bug bemoaned his size— 
   A change he underwent; 
He grew to humming-bird,—then snipe, 
   And still was discontent; 
He grew to grouse—to pheasant next, 
   And then to peacock went. 
And even so man might have been 
   An insect or a worm; 
No higher thought could he conceive
   Except to eat and squirm; 
Till one day eating he grew fat, 
   And found his voice was firm. 
Then Evolution soon commenced 
   And, growing fast, began 
From worm—to mouse—then rat—then fox 
   (From speck into a span) 
And up he climbed—to wolf—then dog— 
   Then monkey—into man. 
Then speaks in wrath the theolog 
   The scientists to damn; 
“Your reasoning is blasphemy— 
   Your theory a sham; 
You may be monkeys grown from worms— 
   God made me as I am!”
Now I'm not free to spend my views 
   For fear I may regret; 
But still despite how man came forth. 
   One can not well forget, 
The evolution's incomplete— 
   Some men are monkeys yet. 
Nor am I judge which thing is true, 
   I know not of the facts; 
But men have monkey antics yet, 
   And some have monkey acts; 
And some lack nothing save the tails 
   To curl above their backs.
The First Lie. 
I was twelve or somewhat younger, 
   Pompey just a lad thirteen; 
We as brothers played together, 
   Watched the cows out on the green. 
Days of youth at times were sweetest, 
   Oft they soured into gall; 
In our climb for youthful honors, 
   We would often have a fall. 
It was in the heat of Summer, 
   Out beneath the orchard boughs, 
Where we sat ''jack-stones" a-playing, 
   As we watched the grazing cows. 
But the games went all contrary,
   And I lost them all somehow; 
I prefered a charge of cheating, 
   And we fell into a row. 
Stones at once commenced to flying, 
   And the missiles flew apace; 
When I stopped to find a swear-word 
   His fist landed in my face. 
Stars began at once to twinkle, 
   But I clinched him like a man, 
And we fought and tugged and tussled, 
   Only as two brothers can. 
When the same blood meets in battle, 
   Sympathies are laid aside;
And we fought like brave young demons, 
   Till each other bled and cried. 
Father dropped his reins to listen, 
   Soon he stood as referee; 
As he rushed down thru the orchard, 
   He brought sprigs from many a tree. 
Vengeance shone on his forehead, 
   As he trod the orchard path; 
In his face was writ our judgement, 
   In his brow paternal wrath. 
But before he used his weapons,
   Both agreed by wink of eye,
To combine to foil judgement, 
   Thru the medium of a lie. 
Quick as thought the scheme was settled, 
   Neither of our eyes yet dry;  
Pompey swore we both were playing— 
   I at once confirmed the lie. 
Ah! the old man stood dumbfounded, 
   Palor o'er his features came, 
Knowing we had broke his teachings, 
   And had lied to hide the shame. 
But we clung to our decision,
   Nothing then could disunite; 
“But,” said he, "you both were crying, 
   And there must have been a fight!"— 
“Father, we have not been fighting; 
   We were playing and at peace, 
And the water you discover 
   Must have come down off the trees.”
“If you rascals can afford to 
   Look at me and tell such lies— 
I am too amazed to whip you!" 
   And he left us in surprise. 
Ah! we saved the day that evening, 
   Tho since then the years divide, 
Still reflection doth condemn me, 
   For I fear — somebody lied! 
The Voice in the Wilderness. 
   Deep as God's eternal years, 
   Sad as Christ's atoning tears, 
   Dread as heart-string rent apart, 
   Are the pangs that thrill and smart 
   Deep within the black man's heart. 
      Years of unrequited toil, 
   In the mould and mill to moil: 
   He to bear the lash and load, 
   Hunger's grip and spoiler's goad; 
   Toil and grime his lot by day, 
   Fill the mart where others prey; 
   He to bear the dust and heat, 
   Smooth the road for others' feet;
   He like patient ox to plod, 
   Bruised beneath the chastening rod, 
   Tho the load be crushing hard, 
   Still forbid to call on God. 
   He to give his blood and brawn, 
   And himself another's pawn; 
   He to die for others' good, 
   Feed another's soil with blood; 
   He to ask nor fare, nor fee, 
   Neither life nor liberty; 
   He to make the weak man strong, 
   His reward, abuse and wrong. 
      This the recompence they give, 
   Hounds to hunt the fugitive 
   Fleeing from the cruel lash, 
   Where Oppression leaves his gash; 
   Where the mob doth burn and lynch, 
   Where his blood their thirst doth quench;
   Where, despite the boast of laws,
   Men are wronged without a cause. 
   This my country? cruel Dame! 
   O for a mantle to hide her shame! 
   O for tears to wash her guilt 
   For the blood her hands have spilt! 
   This the land my heart must pride 
   Where my father bled and died! 
   Land that boasts of slavery, 
   Cruel Hate and tyranny? 
   Where the poor unheeded die, 
   Christianity a lie,
   Human brotherhood a snare, 
   Liberty a vague despair; 
   Where to be with right is wrong, 
   Where the weak crushed by the strong;
   Where to be a man is crime, 
   Where the worthy dare not climb; 
   Where the Inquisition's paw 
   Serves to execute the law; 
   Where manhood is but a name, 
   Where the fool is raised to fame, 
   And is lifted up in song 
   If his creed should serve the strong; 
   Where the weak must bend and bleed, 
   Premium put on lust and greed. 
      Even in the halls of state 
   True men dare not advocate 
   Justice for the poor and weak, 
   They are doomed if once they speak; 
   Even they who rule the throne 
   Help the hellish business on. 
   Public sentiment will not 
   Dare forgive the bane and blot 
   Should, perchance, co-workers meet 
   To adjust the wrongs of state, 
   And in mutual friendship feel 
   That the nation's highest weal, 
   That the people's greatest good 
   Demands united brotherhood. 
      Yet within the dens of vice 
   All may offer sacrifice;
   All may freely enter in
   Where the paths lead down to sin. 
   All in fellowship may blend 
   Where the lures of lust contend, 
   Where the harlot spreads her arms, 
   And where vice displays its charms; 
   Where the serpent hides his stings, 
   And upon the victim springs; 
   Where the'biting. viper darts, 
   Where the adder's poison smarts, 
   All in brotherhood may dwell 
   On the road that leads to hell. 
   This the land demands my praise 
   And the service of my days? 
      This the "land of liberty?" 
   This the land that men call ''free"? 
   Free, indeed, if they be strong, 
   Freer still to do the wrong;
   Free to persecute the weak, 
   I Free to doom and damn the meek ; 
   Free to rob and cheat, and lie 
   With no fear of penalty; 
   Free to revel in the gain. 
   Wrung from hearts that plead in vain. 
      Raise the drooping heart, O God, 
   Grant the humble foot of sod 
   Where the wail of war is o'er, 
   Where the din is heard no more, 
   Where from blood men's hands are clean, 
   Where the spoiler is not seen,
   Where his curse no more is heard, 
   Where men's hate no more is stirred, 
   Where the fowler's snare is not, 
   Where men's jealousies forgot, 
   Where the meek uninjured may 
   Look unto their God and pray,— 
   There to spend one hour of peace 
   Where brute force and lying cease. 
   From the cruel, crushing blows,
   From the blighting, blinding woes,
   From the cruel curse of foes,
   Grant, O God, a day's repose. 
Remember Brownsville. 
Ah! it came like bolts of lightning 
   From a sky without a cloud, 
And it fell with dread disaster, 
   And a crash severe and loud; 
Shocked the sense of men and angels 
   With its morbid stench of sin — 
'Twas the blow that fell at Brownsville 
   On those brave black soldier men.
O, the thought that makes it cruel 
   ‘Twas the gallant "Twenty-Fifth," 
Stripped of marks that stood for honor, 
   And the guns they conquered with. 
Twenty years and six a soldier, 
   Loaded heavy with rewards,
And the guns that decked their shoulders 
   Had become their idol gods. 
Ah! 'twould be not half so cruel, 
   But they served their country well, 
Saved the life of him who slew them, 
   Snatched their country back from hell. 
Ethiope doth pin a flower 
   On her gallant soldiers' graves, 
And she drops a tear in mourning 
   For the slaying of her braves. 
From the hill tops to the valleys— 
   Everywhere the murmurs roll; 
It is "Brownsville," "Brownsville," "Brownsville," 
   It has stirred the Negro's soul; 
For he feels the wrong and outrage, 
   And he meets it with a frown— 
And this mighty Ghost of “Brownsville”— 
   It will never, never down. 
And of all the wrongs and outrage 
   Long, long will the race recall 
The deep burning shame of "Brownsville," 
   "Most unkindest cut of all;"
And for once he is loth to pardon, 
   "Holy vengeance" is his theme— 
The un-Holy Ghost of "Brownsville" 
   Is the Demon of his dream. 
"Remember Brownsville" is the slogan, 
   It will be for coming years; 
There lies curse without conviction, 
   Therein lie impending fears. 
Blacks will learn to test their power, 
   Nor will bribe of office please; 
For this baneful Ghost of "Brownsville"— 
   It will never give him ease. 
Like the raging ghost of Banquo 
   That will live and never down, 
So this dreadful Ghost of "Brownsville" 
   Stalks the land from town to town. 
May it spread in big proportions, 
   Till it win a race renown; 
For this awful Ghost of "Brownsville" 
   Will live on and never down. 
Let the winds waft their good fortune,
   Let the "evil days" bring wrong; 
Black men will "Remember Brownsville," 
   It shall be the life of song; 
Martyr-like he serves the scaffold, 
   Bears the cruel lash of shame; 
By the wounds his heart endureth 
   His oppressors rise to fame.
And we pine for acts of tyrants 
   And for Nero's cruel heart; 
While the dread Sicilian Vespers 
   Makes atoning tear drops start; 
But a race's heart is bleeding 
   For her braves which "Herod" slew; 
And the Blacks will look on "Brownsville" 
   As their St. Bartholomew. 
The Mob Victim. 
And it was in a Christian land, 
With freedom's towers on every hand, 
Where shafts to civic pride arise 
To lift America to the skies. 
And it was on a Sabbath day, 
While men and women went to pray. 
I passed the crowd in humble mode 
In going to my meek abode. 
From out the crowd arose a cry, 
And epithets began to fly; 
And thus like hound they took my track—
My only crime—my face was black. 
And so this Christian mob did turn 
From prayer to rob, to rack and burn.
   A victim helplessly I fell 
To tortures truly kin to hell; 
They bound me fast and strung me high, 
Then cut me down lest I should die 
Before their savage zeal was spent 
In torturing to their hearts' content. 
They tore my flesh and broke my bones, 
And laughed in triumph at my groans; 
They chopped my fingers, clipped my ears 
And passed them round for souvenirs. 
And then around my quivering frame 
They piled the wood, the oil and flame; 
And thus their Sabbath sacrifice 
Was wafted upward to the skies. 
   A little boy stepped out the crowd. 
His face was pale, his voice was loud:
“My ma could not get to the fun,
And so I came, her youngest son, 
To get the news of what went on." 
He stirred the ashes, found a bone—
(A bit of flesh was hanging on) 
He bore it off a cherished prize, 
A remnant of the sacrifice. 
   Alas! no doubt, the heathen reads 
Of Christian lands of noble deeds 
By men with Christian hardihood 
To shield their race's womanhood; 
   And yet around my burning frame, 
Quivering by the scorching flame,
Their women danced around the scene, 
And each was christened "heroine.” 
They took my flesh as souvenirs, 
And showed their pride with yells and cheers. 
   And this where men are civilized, 
And idol worship is despised; 
Where nations boast that God hath sent 
The angel of enlightenment. 
But while you sing America's pride, 
Where men for liberty have died,
Compare the strain with double stress 
To her reward for harmlessness, 
When burning flesh makes sporty time,
And innocence is greatest crime. 
   O heathen minds on heathen strand,
What think you of a Christian land,
Where men and boys and women turn 
From prayer to lynch, to rob and burn, 
And oft their drowsy minds refresh 
Thru sport in burning human flesh? 
Yet none dare tell who led the band; 
And this was in a Christian land.
Here and Hereafter. 
Now you preach a lot of Heaven, 
   And you talk a lot of Hell, 
But the future never troubles me—
   ‘Tis plain as tongue can tell; 
And it's mighty poor religion 
   That won't keep a man from fear; 
For the next place must be Heaven, 
   Since 'tis Hell I'm having here. 
Song to Our Women. 
To women of my race I sing; 
   I feel your sadly solemn state; 
Your honor—life's most sacred thing, 
   Hangs helpless 'twixt a dreadful fate, 
O women of a struggling race,
   How blest to keep your vestures clean, 
When gilded bribes you needs must face, 
   And hounded by the race of men.
They shun you if you dare to stand, 
   And hiss your name if you are strong; 
Reject your pride, they kiss your hand,
   And hate you when you share their wrong. 
To social planes ye must aspire, 
   If man's protection ye would claim; 
Ye then must serve his base desire— 
   Your heritage, a shattered name. 
He fain would pluck your choicest gem, 
   And rich your way with garlands pave; 
Of gold he'd give a diadem, 
   Yet spurn you when you fall his slave. 
And men of other races see
   Your fearful plight that must prevail; 
They see your want and poverty, 
   And gold is heaped at feet of Baal. 
They hate the blood that made you black, 
   Yet love you for a sweeter tie; 
Like hound they trail upon your track— 
   The only refuge is to die. 
O God! what dread condition this. 
   When gold is heaped 'twixthell and Thee; 
To stand we meet the world's mad hiss, 
   To fall is gold — and infamy.
Dunbar. 
The Muses tuned his harp with song— 
   Too sweet a strain to linger long, 
The tension of the chords too great 
   For longer life to compensate. 
He lived and loved like lamb at play, 
   He dreamed and sang his life away. 
A genius of the lyric art, 
   He gave to man his all—his heart. 
The world, unwilling to inspire, 
   Crushed his best music in his lyre, 
And gave to broken rhyme the praise— 
   The merry music of his lays. 
And yet he lifted up his race, 
   And gave it undisputed place 
Among the masters of the age, 
   And gave himself as heritage. 
The chord is broken in the lyre, 
   Quenched is the Muse's vestal fire; 
The oil that fed the vestal flame 
   Illumes in Heaven the Poet's name. 
And still, Sweet Singer, thou art near, 
   Thy merry music still doth cheer 
The firesides, the camp, and road, 
   And gives a lightness to the load. 
Sweet Spirit of a purer sphere, 
   We saw thee pass with holy tear; 
But hope doth wring from tears their sting—  
   In better life thou still dost sing.
The Song of The Free.
The prayers of the wronged and oppressed rose on high; 
   He bowed down the heavens and heard the sad cry; 
The earth shook and trembled, the mountains were moved; 
   His might broke the shackles from those whom He loved. 
Up from the dread darkness of hell and despair, 
   Up from the dark dungeon like bird from the snare; 
And up from oppression and death of the sword— 
   I rise to sweet freedom and light of the Lord. 
And up from death's valley with wickedness soiled, 
   Where women and children are robbed and despoiled; 
Where virtue is helpless 'neath lust of vile men, 
   I rise where the glories of freedom begin. 
I sing the sweet songs and I breathe the pure air 
   Of life long denied in the Vale of Despair; 
My chains have been melted in Liberty's flame, 
   I leave my vile shackles in hands whence they came.
I look to the hills and my strength comes apace, 
   I gird up my loins and prepare for the race; 
And Liberty's angel's unfolding the scroll, 
   While sweet bells of freedom wake fires in the soul.  
And slavery is conquered and crushed is its creed; 
   The souls of God's children no longer shall bleed; 
For He hath decreed it and sealed it on high— 
   The wicked and all his devices shall die. 
The wicked may triumph and prosper a day,
   But on the dread morrow are wafted away; 
The wind he hath sown doth sweep over his path, 
   And Death wraps around him God's mantle of wrath. 
He lets the devices of wicked men run, 
   And offers to pardon before set of Sun; 
Then in His dread vengeance confirmeth the Law— 
   His might doth lie hidden in weapons of war. 
The pale horse has stumbled, the rider is thrown, 
   And Slavery's Demon of strength hath been shorn; 
The spoiler's arm broken, his quiver laid bare,
   And feet of the fowler are caught in his snare. 
The cries of the captive are turned into song, 
   And daylight is sweeter since night has been long;
The wrong must be righted His word doth affirm, 
   And nations are spoiled at the turn of the worm. 
The snare has been broken, the captive set free, 
   He eats the ripe fruits of a pure liberty; 
He girdeth for battle, his march doth begin 
   Along with the phalanx of other free men. 
He dare not look back on the sins of the past, 
   The future doth call with a loud trumpet blast; 
His newly-born ship is put out to the sea, 
   To gather the harvest of sweet liberty. 
And Ethiope's tears and her sorrows subside, 
   Her sackcloth and ashes alike laid aside; 
She joins in the anthem of her newly-born,
   And visions of gladness her features adorn. 
And this be the song the triumphant may sing, 
   And this be the glory that humbly I bring; 
Thy cup shall run over—O, trust in His word; 
   Thy might is sufficient with strength of the Lord. 
And man yet shall heed the Original Plan, 
   And look on his brother as man unto man; 
Let Love be the motto, or else come to shame, 
   For all of God's children are one and the same.
Song to The Pilot. 
An Appeal to The Leaders of Men. 
Hard by his post in the speeding train 
      Sat the brave engineer. 
What if each moment more speed he gain! 
      Peerless he knows no fear. 
High at the station the flag was up,
Warning of danger the train to stop; 
      Beyond the town 
      The bridge was down— 
He met the yells of the crowd with a frown. 
Madly he drove in the yawning deep, 
Hard by his post lying fast asleep; 
      Unnumbered dead 
      Find wat'ry bed— 
Who knows the stone where his loved one is laid? 
   Pilot at helm but fast asleep; 
   List to the tones of the dismal deep— 
   Many fond hearts in the depths asleep— 
      Pilot, awake! awake! 
Onward thru life in our fleeting train, 
   Who is at the helm to guide? 
Some sleeping pilot? We sail in vain, 
   Drifting along the tide; 
Warnings of danger we fail to read, 
Flag on the sign post we fail to heed.
      The depths below
      Of sin and woe
Harbor a danger which no heart can know. 
Swiftly we sail our journey along, 
Gaily we sing our soul-cheering song: 
      Who knows the fate 
      Lying in wait? 
Who is at the helm of the old ship of state? 
   Who is at the helm to guide aright 
   Safe from the perils of the night? 
   List to the chimes from the bells of night— 
   Calling, awake! awake! 
High on life's plain where dominion slings 
   Arrows of power down, 
Who dares to chide the vain pride of kings, 
   Or scorn the tyrant's frown? 
O brilliant statesman, the pride of the years, 
God gives thee power to dry our tears. 
      The humble sigh, 
      To God they cry— 
How canst thou crumbs of God's justice deny? 
Heroes are they who the nations would save; 
Liberty sits in the crown of the brave. 
      Whose soul so great 
      To advocate 
Justice and right at the old helm of state? 
   Who is at the helm to guide aright 
   Safe from the dangers and snares of the night 
   Into that haven, Eternity bright? 
      Pilot, awake! awake!
Steptoe Brown. 
I always liked the doctrine that the people often teach: 
That "All that glitters is not gold," and "Practice what you preach." 
And still I think the poet might have added to his theme, 
That folks as well as other "things are not just what they seem." 
   Now Steptoe Brown of our town was loved by bad and good, 
But as a Christian didn't walk as others thought he should. 
Not that his hands were tainted with the blood of fellowman, 
Nor yet because some worldly sin had visited his clan. 
He wore no robe of righteousness, his hands were clean, no doubt, 
But secrets of his silent life he never would let out. 
   He made no boast of piety nor advertised his creeds,
He spent his life in doing the most unpresuming deeds. 
His heart was free and open and no Christian could deny,
His sympathy was near to soothe the humble children's cry; 
His hand was offered to the weak to lift them out the lurch, 
But still complaint was made because he seldom went to church. 
   And like a tale of gossip that upon the wind is spent, 
This little grudge was wafted round and gathered as it went; 
Till soon it had developed that the real talk of the town 
Was centered round none other than this non-churchgoing Brown. 
And when prayer meetings opened and "determinations" told 
Of all the things they hoped to do by members young and old, 
Each told his ''hope of heaven" with a sobbing and a tear, 
While cool and quiet Steptoe Brown sat posing in the rear. 
When one by one began to hint of happenings in the town 
All their "determinations" changed to reprimands of Brown, 
While he still unmolested having nothing much to say 
Kept living out his destiny in his own quiet way.
   Some thought it strange the preacher always took the side of Brown, 
And never said a word to run his reputation down. 
As deep within the rugged mounds there sleep the golden grains, 
So deep within the rugged life there lives within the veins 
A nobler impulse born of God as from the heart it springs, 
It lives for good could we but know life's hidden secret things. 
   And so the thing kept working to its sad and bitter end, 
But Brown swelled the collection plate — the preacher was his friend,
Till finally the church rose up and called the preacher down 
And threatened revolution, so he ceased defending Brown. 
"A false pretender, hypocrit, backslider," was the cry,
"Eternal torment shall be his, alas! when he shall die." 
They fiercely plied their Gospel whip and pounded him quite well, 
And then consigned his needy soul to one eternal hell. 
   But many a righteous member in later days did find
Their time cut short and had to leave this "hypocrit" behind; 
And when at last they found they had this solemn debt to pay 
They sighed for Brown to see that their remains were put away. 
And finally the preacher, too, lay down to pay his debt,  
His face turned up in agony, his eyes with tears were wet; 
He sighed "My race is finished, but, O Lord, my task's not done, 
For I have failed to save a soul Thy adversary won." 
He turned his eyes to heaven and he closed them with a frown— 
His dying words were these, "O Lord, my soul is grieved for Brown." 
   And when he entered Heaven's gate and looked the records o'er. 
He looked to find his members who had gone on just before; 
He found them not, but yet he found charged up against their name, 
They had slandered all their neighbors and were doomed to woe and shame. 
"Alas!" he groaned, "my flock is lost and doomed to misery, 
If righteous man is hardly saved where can that sinner be?"
And so to see what shame fell Brown I'll look the records o'er: 
Here's where he helped a beggar oft and shelt- ered many poor, 
And here he soothed a broken heart, and strange the thing appears,
He gave the orphans meat and bread and dried the widow's tears." 
And as he closed the register he sighed and dropped it down. 
And there stood gazing in his face this very Steptoe Brown. 
Dixon Shall Not Play Tonight. 
It was heralded thru the city, 
   News that shocked the Christian ear, 
And in letters bold placarded, 
   That the "Clansman" would appear; 
But the sturdy strength of Justice 
   Lent its force to Christian men,
Who rose up in indignation 
   To repel this power of sin.
Black men cleared the decks for action, 
   Joined as one a thousand strong, 
Told the Mayor of that City 
   That the "Clansman" was all wrong; 
In their brow was grim decision. 
   In their strength was manhood's might;
Sang they out in one dread chorus: 
   “Dixon shall not play to-night!”
And the news spread thru the City 
   Like wild fires in the West, 
Touched the moral sense of thousands. 
   Moved the soul within each breast. 
There as pilot stood the black man. 
   Looking unto God for right; 
He protested unto Heaven— 
   "Dixon shall not play to-night !" 
Wrung and wronged by moral slander. 
   Once the Negro's soul was stirred, 
For the moral death of millions 
   Lay within that woeful word; 
Thus to shun the dread contagion 
   And avoid its bane and blight, 
Christian bells took up the chorus—
   “Dixon shall not play to-night!" 
Prayers of thousands rose to Heaven 
   'Gainst this moral pestilence; 
And a cloud hung o'er the city 
   Pouring out a sweet incense;
Spoke a voice behind the shadows— 
   “God is on the side of right; 
Sing it out among the people, 
   Dixon shall not play to-night!" 
So this caravan of evil 
   Packed their tents and went away; 
Moral plague was once averted, 
   For the ''Clansman" did not play. 
Moral forces held that city 
   With their iron grip of might; 
On the gates shone forth the warning— 
   Dixon shall not play to-night!" 
And this preacher of the Gospel, 
   Ere he rang a race's knell, 
Met his Waterloo thru black men, 
   And like Lucifer he fell. 
On the one side Wrong and Slander, 
   On the other God and Right; 
And for once if not forever, 
   Dixon did not play that night.
The Poet's Adieu. 
Adieu, my little Volume, 
   Whate’er fate may impend, 
The Spirit that be in thee 
   Thy rightful course defend. 
Should fame or favor bide thee, 
   Goodwill of men betide thee, 
Thy humble Muse still guide thee— 
   Trust not tame praise alone. 
Go forth — if men refuse thee, 
   If Slander’s tongue abuse thee, 
If cruel Fate should bruise thee, 
   Rise up and struggle on!

DEDICATION 
 Dedicated to the following lovers of 
 both white and black humanity : 
 Hon. Henry Watterson, 
 Bishop Charles Edward Woodcock, 
 Col. Bennett H. Young, 
 Prof. E. H. Mark and 
 Mr. Robert E. Woods. 
MY SOUTH. 
 {To Gavin H. Cochran, Esq.) 
 Men said thy hopes were buried in thy needs, 
 They pitied Death for wooing thee, my South ; 
 They now behold in thee a life that leads 
 Through genius quickened at the cannon's mouth. 
 Thy idle strength, when pitted 'gainst thy fate. 
 Renewed the mansion, vivified the farm, 
 Kept timid hearts from growing desolate 
 By teaching valor through a missing arm. 
 Thou seest millions lurking in thy hills, 
 Thou seest comfort peeping from thy soil. 
 Thou knowest now that he alone fulfills 
 Self's highest aim who keeps in league with toil. 
 Thou earnest heirship to all elder worth, 
 Thou winnest guerdon of all times to be ; 
 Thou boldest up thy wealth to all the earth. 
 There comes reply: ''Alas, we did not see." 
 Above the hand whose mission is to smite, 
 Beyond the tongue that galls that it may snare. 
 Thou standest forth, peaked ever in the light 
 Of self-evolving self that cries: ''Beware." 
 Earth's farthest bounds shall know thee as thou art. 
 Thy humblest sons make spoil of thy increase ; 
 Our country, searching for its patriot heart, 
 Shall find it hid between thy love and peace. 
 Go star these ever in the public eye ; 
 Go wed these ever to the public mind ; 
 Go ever teach that sin and lethargy 
 Will leave a people shrunken, halt and blind. 
I would behold in thee world-conquering ken, 
 Would fain be dazzled by thy steady flame ; 
 Would cry aloud : "Thy women and thy men 
 Weave life a robe that puts past dreams to 
 shame." 
 "MARSE" HENRY WATTERSON. 
 Who makes a law may force a means to curse, 
 Who puts it forth may blight the universe ; 
 For what is man that he should say to man : 
 "Do thus and so, or feel the scourge and ban?" 
 Who builds a tower of crumbling theories 
 Must list his Babel in its mongrel keys ; 
 For truth is onward, while a guess but hears 
 Its name re-echoed in a thousand years. 
 Who dares to whisper that his God and he 
 Are all-in-all of aristocracy, 
 Proves him a tyrant with a tyrant's power 
 And slays that tyrant in his boasting hour. 
 Nay, not of these is he of pregnant phrase, 
 Nay, not of these is he of toil-won bays. 
 Socratic spirit and Platonic pen 
 Win him first heirship in the ranks of men. 
 He sees as clearly as the Magi saw 
 That love is living, and that life is law. 
 He knows as fully as the prophets knew 
 Faith in man's struggles makes the strength of two. 
 My South that suffers and my South that bears 
 A triple measure of the Nation's cares, 
 Use but one weapon, and thy battle's won — 
 The love and faith and poise of Watterson. 
GRANT AND LEE. 
 The South's the sin? The North's the glory? 
 Laugh out of court the hackneyed story. 
 The sin took root in the nation's heart. 
 And North and South played a dual part. 
 The North and the South wore a cheek of shame, 
 Till a life of woe wrought an earth of flame. 
 And who were the heroes? All who fell, 
 Whether North or South, in the nation's hell. 
 And who were the heroes? Great souls who fed 
 The nation's maw with the nation's dead 
 Till the nation's blood slew the nation's curse. 
 And made man free as the universe. 
 Neither Grant of the North nor Lee of the South 
 Shall link his name with the cannon's mouth. 
 Neither Lee of the South nor Grant of the North 
 Shall stand accused when the blame goes forth. 
 In the South's warm heart, on the North's just 
 tongue, 
 A dual epic of peace is sung 
 With regret for the bond and hope for the free. 
 And a God-like love for Grant and Lee. 
 COL. BENNETT H. YOUNG, CONFEDERATE 
 VETERAN, TO THE NORTH. 
 The Northerners have often censured us. 
 And we of Southern blood have held in scorn 
 Their manhood's value and their motive's aim ; 
But slaying faith heals not our country's wound. 
 This broader day, upon this border line, 
 Should pulse anew our nation's severed heart. 
 And hail the hand that clutches North and South. 
 And hail the tongue that choruses the two, 
 And hail the thought that draws our feet together. 
 And hail the deed that makes us one forever. 
 UNCLE REMUS TO MASSA JOEL. 
 Listen, Massa Joel ; 
 I'se er callin' ter you ; 
 Callin' in de sunlight, 
 Callin' in de dew, 
 Callin' whar you uster be. 
 An' callin' whar you ain't. 
 'Specks de Lawd dun called you blessed. 
 An' de angels calls you saint. 
 Heah me, Massa Joel ; 
 I'se er mournin' fer you ; 
 Mournin' when de day is old, 
 Mournin' when it's new, 
 Mournin' whar you uster sing. 
 An' whar you uster pray. 
 'Specks de worl' is full ob mournin', 
 But de heabens, dey is gay. 
 Meet me, Massa Joel; 
 Fse er comin' ter you ; 
 Comin' wid er load ob sin 
 Fer de sinner's due; 
 Comin' whar I sho' kin borrer 
 Er little loan ob grace. 
 'Specks de Lawd gwine call us brudders 
 When He sees us face ter face. 
PRESIDENT WILLIAM M'KINLEY. 
 Blessed art thou. Fate linked thee with her sons, 
 Ye form the trinity of martyred ones; 
 A nation's praise is jealous of its grief, 
 Therefore thy glory's day cannot be brief. 
 So poorly schooled in littleness wast thou 
 No party stamped its ethics on thy brow. 
 So future-sighted was thy leadership 
 Earth's farthest bounds hailed it with welcome lip. 
 Thy life work was to lift men far above 
 Mere selfishness to a pure country love. 
 Thou didst become, dwarfed not by creed or clan, 
 A modern miracle, a nation's man. 
 The good of yesterday we have unsought, 
 To-day lives in to-morrow's generous thought ; 
 So the fanatic's tongue, the assassin's knife 
 Can find no way to chill a nation's life. 
 THE BIRTH OF AMERICAN SONG. 
 So long, O, Hermit Muse, so long 
 Didst thou preside o'er British song 
 Men came to think it grievous wrong 
 To roam elsewhere, 
 And take the rugged Western throng 
 Into thy care. 
 True Song, like selfishness and pride, 
 Is to the human race allied; 
 And, how soe'er it be decried. 
 Will spring amain, 
 And in its turn be beautified 
 By joy and pain. 
So, circumscribing thy swift feet 
 With their abundance of conceit, 
 They sternly held it most unmeet 
 For thee to stray ; 
 But, caged within their dim retreat, 
 Shouldst dwell for aye. 
 They forged on envy's anvil bands 
 To keep thy strong and affluent hands 
 From scattering throughout the lands 
 Song's jubilee. 
 Thou saidst: "Each great soul understands 
 Its liberty." 
 Straightway their envy's force was spent; 
 Straightway toil left embellishment; 
 Straightway soul -rifts and thought were blent 
 Straightway the birth 
 Of Song whose own importance sent 
 It through the earth. 
 THE CONFEDERATE VETERAN AND THE 
 OLD-TIME DARKY. 
 I seed him on de corner dar 
 Er-lookin' lak he's gwine ter war. 
 I wondered ef he thought it sin 
 Ter fight dem battles ober ergin. 
 De way he greeted de passers-by 
 Showed me de kindness in his eye. 
 De way he listened ter my woes 
 Tuk all de fight outen his clones. 
BISHOP THOMAS U. DUDLEY. 
 A force was he in the thoroughfare, 
 A light where gloom abode, 
 A prophet-seer, whose Godlike care 
 Made precious the human load. 
 Ever the heart of trustful youth 
 Kept his faith's longings real ; 
 Ever the gleam of a truer truth 
 Led on his fair ideal. 
 His brother's need was the Master's call, . 
 And his was his brother's tear, 
 And his the word or alms for all. 
 And his the Master's cheer. 
 A word for man is a word for God, 
 However blind chance doth play; 
 He saw this truth turn the chastening rod 
 Into life for the common clay. 
 What message of truth would you have us bear, 
 O, seer, as we journey along? 
 "I would have you lessen the whole world's care, 
 Be glad, and so be strong. 
 "Since human aims flaw human creeds 
 That narrow race to clan 
 Find God in universal needs. 
 If each would be a man. 
 "Our darkening wisdom may not show 
 Where flares the Eternal Dawn, 
 But this we know — if aught we know — 
 They who live here live on." 
THE BOOK^S CREED. 
 Reader, listen ere we go, 
 I will furnish line and page ; 
 You must bring a soul aglow 
 And an eye that scans the age. 
 I am but a shadow sent. 
 Telling of a shape that's gone; 
 I am just an instrument 
 All mankind may play upon. 
 If you would behold the shape, 
 You must carve it all alone. 
 I, as shadow, will be crepe 
 On your door till you are grown. 
 All my myriad silent keys 
 Are responsive to the touch 
 That has lived the mysteries 
 Former masters knew as such. 
 I am but a skeleton. 
 Flesh and blood and soul and speech 
 Were the property of one — 
 Now the property of each. 
 If you see a Godlike eye. 
 Give it not an ancient name. 
 Would you stamp a wanton lie 
 On the helmet of your fame? 
 If you hear a charming tongue. 
 Do not think it from the dead. 
 This old world proclaims it young 
 Through your heart and through your head. 
If I am a ghastly find, 
 You are poor beyond compare — 
 You of empty heart and mind, 
 Dweller in a world of air. 
 You are dead to all the Then, 
 You are dead to all the Now, 
 If you hold that former men 
 Wore the garland for your brow. 
 Time and tide were theirs to brave, 
 Time and tide are yours to stem. 
 Bow not o'er their open grave 
 Till you drop your diadem. 
 Honor all who strove and wrought, 
 Even to their tears and groans ; 
 But slay not your honest thought 
 Through your reverence for their bones. 
 Reader, listen ere we part. 
 Search to know and know to read; 
 And, by owning brain and heart. 
 You will live this simple creed. 
 WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON. 
 His country seared its conscience through its gain, 
 And had not wisdom to behold the loss. 
 It held God partner in the hellish stain, 
 And saw Christ dying on a racial cross. 
 What unto it the shackled fellow-man, 
 Whose plea was mockery, and whose groans were 
 mirth? 
Its boasted creed was : "He should rule who can 
 Make prey of highest heaven and dupe of earth." 
 From out this mass of century-tutored wrong 
 A man stood God-like, and his voice rang true. 
 His soul was sentry to the dallying throng, 
 His thought was watchword to the gallant few. 
 He saw not as his fellow-beings saw ; 
 He would not misname greed expediency. 
 He found no color in the nation's law, 
 And scorned to meet it in its liberty. 
 He saw his duty in his neighbor's cause, 
 And died that he might rise up strong and free- 
 A creature subject to the highest laws, 
 And master of a God-like destiny. 
 The thunder of a million armed feet, 
 Reverberating till the land was stirred, 
 Was but the tension of his great heart-beat. 
 The distant echo of his spoken word. 
 He speaks again : ''Such as would miss the rod 
 That ever chastens insufficiency, 
 Must purge their lives and make them fit for God, 
 Must train their liberty and make it free." 
 GAVIN H. COCHRAN, THE CHILDREN'S 
 FRIEND. 
 He felt the child-heart throb beside his own, 
 And question of its lot by right divine. 
 His answer was : "Thou shalt not ask alone ; 
 I, too, will claim all things that be are thine." 
He knew the child-thought in its wanderings, 
 Its timid ventures and its scattered might, 
 And gave his years to find the force that brings 
 Through childhood's struggles manhood's crown- 
 light. 
 He saw that child-life on its winding slope 
 Must gaze a-back or scan the heights above 
 As teachers see in it the wide world's hope. 
 And God's true symbol of his matchless love. 
 GEN. CASSIUS M. CLAY. 
 "Give me an heir," the Century plead, 
 "With the brain of a man and the will of a god; 
 With a soul that will flash with the word that is said, 
 And a hand that will strike, 'though the heavens 
 nod. 
 "When the storm blows not, and the way is clear. 
 And man is to man as star to star. 
 Let the sage come forth with his thought-bred fear. 
 And plans that are meek as the grass blades are. 
 "When soul meets soul and disdains to hate. 
 When thought meets thought and clashes not. 
 The priest may sweetly, sternly prate 
 Of a saintly way and a Godless lot. 
 "When w^eal must lessen the cry of woe, 
 And blood must sanction the will of heaven. 
 My heir must conquer the foremost foe ; 
 To slay, faith-spurred, is the age's leaven." 
 So the Century hurled thee, a living flame, 
 To blaze thy way to the heart of man. 
 Now, at its end, thou art a name 
 That shines wherever greatness can. 
AS IT IS. 
 With a rope of glass I am bound to time. 
 Its strength is the measure of life. 
 I move. It cuts. Stern Law says: "Mine," 
 And my Soul moans : . "Strife ! Strife ! Strife !" 
 A weakling I. God's prophets say 
 All share in His goodness still. 
 He speaks. I hear. Life acts. I slay. 
 Now whose is the slaying will ? 
 A weakling I. My brother is halt 
 And stands in my destined path. 
 I pass. He dies for his faultless fault. 
 Now whose is the slaying wrath? 
 A weakling I. My brother is strong 
 And stands in my destined path. 
 He yields it not. I tarry long 
 As many a pilgrim hath. 
 On, and I fall bv my brother's sword, 
 Back, and I die through his death, 
 I hold my ground with never a word, 
 A begging God for a breath. 
 The air I breathe comes over the dead, 
 The light of the sword is mine, 
 The stronger man has a prayer in his head 
 That says : "God, prosper thine." 
 I blunder about and know not how. 
 I fall and know not when. 
 The stronger man has kept his vow, 
 And God has kept his ken. 
The corpse that rots, the strong man there, 
 And my self-slain self are one. 
 So man has fared. So man must fare 
 Till his little day be done. 
 Perchance foul worms in God's sunlight 
 May house in my unhoused bones. 
 Perchance God's wrath in a world of night 
 May measure my dead Soul's groans. 
 With a rope of glass I am bound to time. 
 Its strength is the measure of life. 
 "Frail man is mine. All law is mine," 
 Says God. My Soul, whence strife? 
 ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE. 
 All earth is a poet. 
 All nature doth know it. 
 Each firefly doth show it, 
 Each frost-work doth rhyme. 
 Poor man who the fool is, 
 And prone as the pool is, 
 May yet learn God's rule is : 
 All prose is part crime. 
 The dust that we tread in, 
 The swirls we are sped in. 
 The throes we are wed in. 
 Were dust, dust and dust. 
 If out of God's treasure 
 There came not a measure 
 Of rhythmical pleasure 
 In sibilant trust. 
Thy gift was a yearning 
 That paradised learning, 
 And ended in turning 
 All seasons to Junes 
 Through death that caresses, 
 Through hatred that blesses, 
 And love that distresses, 
 And words that are tunes. 
 A Milton may ghoul us, 
 A Shakespeare may rule us, 
 A Wordsworth may school us, 
 A Tennyson cheer ; 
 But thine is the glory, 
 Star-sprung from the hoary. 
 Flame-decadent story 
 Of the munificent ear. 
 COL. W. C. P. BRECKINRIDGE. 
 Great in the riches the world-brain has wroughl", 
 Great in the gilding of a candid thought. 
 Great in the knitting of the headless throng, 
 Great in the music that outrivals song. 
 Great in his striving for his cherished clan, 
 Great in his welcome to his fellow-man, 
 Great in the working that is sacrifice, 
 Great in the longing that proclaims the Christ, 
 He has left us a heritage, mothered of Pain, 
 To be hoarded by mankind and given to mankind 
THE TEACHER PRE-EMINENT. 
 To test Himself God spoke the heavens unfurled; 
 To please Himself He formed this nether world; 
 To warn the world He sanctified the Preacher; 
 To save the whole He called the inspired Teacher. 
 THE CHILD. 
 It is a story that it cannot tell. 
 It sees a point, and then it sees it not. 
 Behold the only human miracle — 
 The Teacher's leading it to grasp the plot. 
 rt is a jewel lost in its own worth; 
 The search is aimless, and the loss is twain. 
 The Teacher's absence, and a puzzled earth ; 
 The Teacher's touch, and all is found again. 
 THE OLD PEDAGOGUE'S WELCOME TO 
 THE NEW. 
 I welcome ye, fine masters of today; 
 Move in your track and renovate and save. 
 I am so wedded to the good old way 
 Your theories were fitter o'er my grave. 
 TRUTH. 
 Truth is the unmixed coin God issues out ; 
 His wisdom mints it for life's tutoring; 
 It is the antidote for fear and doubt; 
 And soothes man with omnipotence's ring. 
DELAY AND TRUTH. 
 Delay in anger bit the sphere of truth, 
 And, in so doing, broke his wisdom tooth: 
 Therefore, it is, when truth comes rolling by, 
 Delay looks not, cowed by the memory. 
 THE LITTLE CHILD THAT LEADS. 
 ("A little child shall lead them.") 
 Our earth-girt souls grow faint and gaunt and 
 hollow. 
 And more and more unblessed our jarring creeds, 
 Because we fail to humbly, wisely follow 
 The little child that leads. 
 Our thoughts lack courage and our words lack 
 meaning. 
 And less and less we value noble deeds 
 Until we are at one with Christ's esteeming 
 The little child that leads. 
 Toil-deepened truth is ever clearer, dearer, 
 All life is holier for its common needs, 
 As we in brotherly thought and act draw nearer 
 The little child that leads. 
 CHICAGO. 
 You meet Chicago ere you meet it ; 
 You greet Chicago ere you greet it. 
 You wonder but to wonder 
 How life is life and death together, 
 How man and beast and work and weather 
 Are blundering without a blunder. 
You see Chicago, if you see it, 
 With sphere-bound eyes that wholly free it 
 From forceless force's commanding. 
 You see its greatness throb in centers; 
 You see the doom of him who enters, 
 A-coining hope for understanding. 
 Chicago woos time's active hour 
 And turns its ashes into power 
 That makes to-day to-morrow, 
 Quickened with all life's stress compresses. 
 Lightened with all life's forethought blesses, 
 And burdened with a sorrow's sorrow. 
 THOMAS MOCK. 
 O, plain man, plain man, double manned, 
 Through love of home and love of peace, 
 And love that opes a clinched hand 
 And hastens sorrow's sure surcease — 
 Thy plainness charmed me to the end. 
 My neighbor-friend. 
 O, faithful son who gladly stood 
 A guard at the parental door. 
 And let naught in or out that would 
 Not brace its portals more and more. 
 Thy sonship spurred me to the end. 
 My neighbor-friend. 
 O, neighbor, always neighborly, 
 And dowered with a gift that leads 
 The neighbor-eye to quickly see 
 A neighbor's plight, a neighbor's needs. 
 Thy neighbor-spirit knew no end, 
 My neighbor-friend. 
O, spirit touched by childhood's woe, 
 O, spirit moved by childhood's glee, 
 O, spirit that did gladly go 
 Unto thy death for charity, 
 Thy aim shall lead me to the end. 
 My neighbor-friend. 
 The man who finds his native worth, 
 And holds it in life's sun to leaven 
 Is great enough to sweeten earth 
 And good enough to merit heaven. 
 This thought did cheer thee to the end, 
 My neighbor-friend. 
 To President Taft's Young Son, Master Charlie, On 
 Sending Him a Copy of "The Sequel to the 
 Pied Piper of Hamelin." 
 Master Charlie, read my story 
 Of the Piper in his glory. 
 And bethink you how his striped. 
 Ancient vestments looped and dangled 
 From his limbs that crooked and spranglod. 
 As he piped, piped, piped. 
 Master Charlie, see the city, 
 Odd and quaint as oldest ditty, 
 And bethink you, little man, 
 How the children laughed and whistled 
 Through the streets, by deeds epistled. 
 As they ran, ran, ran. 
 Master Charlie, see the people 
 Grave and grim as church's steeple. 
 As they reached the magic hill, 
And bethink you how they wound it 
 Time and time until they found it 
 To be still, still, still. 
 Master Charlie, see the Council 
 That refused to pay an ounce till 
 Every rat was out of sight ; 
 But I'm telling you the story 
 Of the Piper in his glory. 
 As I write, write, write. 
 SEQUEL TO THE "PIED PIPER OF 
 HAMELIN." 
 {To Thomas G. Watkins, Esq.) 
 The last sweet notes the piper blew 
 Were heard by the people far and wide ; 
 And one by one and two by two 
 They flocked to the mountain-side. 
 Some came, of course, intensely sad, 
 And some came looking fiercely mad, 
 And some came singing solemn hymns, 
 And some came showing shapely limbs, 
 And some came bearing the tops of yews, 
 And some came wearing wooden shoes. 
 And some came saying what they would do, 
 And some came praying (and loudly too), 
 And all for what? Can you not infer? 
 A-searching and lurching for the Pied Piper, 
 And the boys and girls he had taken away. 
 And all were ready now to pay 
 Any amount that he should say. 
 It seems that just relentless Fate 
 Ransacks her ever ample store, 
And issues out the roughest ore 
 To all who basely hesitate. 
 The people stood at the mountain-side, 
 And listened to hear the merry strain 
 That gathered them from far and wide, 
 But they listened all in vain. 
 And if they could have heard his music. 
 Why some of them were really too sick 
 To tell just what his notes were saying, 
 Or know it was the piper playing. 
 Their heads were many, l3ut their hearts were one ; 
 And so the thoughts that came and went 
 Served only to kindle their discontent 
 Into a flame ere the set of sun. 
 Some thought that they could open wide 
 Another portal in the mountain-side 
 And then that they could pass right through 
 And find the children and piper, too. 
 At last a stalwart man arose 
 And spoke as one who would interpose : 
 *'Rouse up, good sirs, like gallant people, 
 And quake no longer with consternation ; 
 But ring the bells from every steeple, 
 And summon the mayor and corporation." 
 The bells rang out as never before 
 Within that ancient city; 
 They seemed to tell it o'er and o'er — 
 To tell that tale of pity. 
 And steadily the angry people 
 Stood gazing at each lofty steeple. 
 The stalwart man cried out again : 
 "Death's servant is procrastination; 
Your grief and tears are all in vain, 
 Go, summon the mayor and corporation." 
 The people started in twos and threes 
 To seek the mayor and corporation, 
 And found them all upon their knees. 
 Imploring expiation. 
 The mayor winked and the mayor blinked; 
 And the councilmen, they listened. 
 The mayor's eyes gazed at the skies, 
 And the councilmen's eyes, they glistened. 
 "You are all to blame," the people cried, 
 With a look of detestation, 
 *'You know full well that you have lied. 
 And sold our rising nation. 
 "As enemies we hold you all. 
 Despite your loud lamenting; 
 Upon your recreant heads shall fall 
 The burden of repenting. 
 "Through you the little ones we nursed 
 Were taken we don't know where to ; 
 "Through you our city has been cursed — 
 Deny it if you dare to. 
 "And you shall know that parleying 
 With that outlandish piper 
 Shall be to you as deep a sting 
 As that of any viper." 
 They mayor bowed low, and then said, "Oh !" 
 And the councilmen said, "What is it?" 
 The mayor grew red and huskily said: 
 "I do not like this visit." 
 The mayor's teeth clattered, and the mayor's tongue 
 chattered, 
And the councilmen's did also ; 
 The mayor floundered, and the mayor wondered 
 How a brave man's voice could fall so. 
 The mayor did sup from no golden cup 
 That he could drown his grief in ; 
 The councilmen saw with deepest awe 
 Nothing to find relief in. 
 The mayor looked straight at the massive gate 
 (And it was a look of pity), 
 Then turned his face to leave the place. 
 And bid farewell to the city. 
 The councilmen turned, and their red cheeks burned, 
 As the bells rang out in the steeple ; 
 And they heard the beat of a thousand feet, 
 And saw the angry people. 
 Who came by dozens and scores that way. 
 Intent upon their human prey. 
 They hadn't a single word to say. 
 But, oh, it was a woeful day 
 For the mayor whose hair was turning gray. 
 Some seized the mayor by the throat 
 As roughly as they could do. 
 And tore the buttons off his coat 
 To show him what they would do 
 Unless he eased their mental strain 
 By finding the boys and girls again. 
 And some arrested the corporation. 
 And poured into their ears 
 So free a strain of denunciation 
 It roused their latest fears. 
 Till one and all wished through and through 
 The piper would come and take them too. 
 And then they marched through that ancient city, 
 With the mayor right before them, 
 And the corporation who sang a ditty 
That threw a madness o'er them, 
 And stirred their ire so it crept out 
 And put their better thoughts to rout. 
 "Let's drive them into the Weser waters," 
 Some cried out angrily 
 "Unless they find our sons and daughters. 
 And bring them back this way." 
 "Agreed ! agreed !" said high and low, 
 "Right into the waters they shall go !" 
 They marched them down to the river's brink. 
 And roughly drove them in ; 
 But before the shortest one could sink 
 An inch above his chin 
 They heard a muffled deafening note. 
 Such as might come from a lion's throat. 
 And all the motly crowd grew mute. 
 For it was a blast from the piper's flute. 
 He stood on the edge of Koppleberg hill 
 And blew till the feet of the people grew still, 
 And those of the mayor and corporation 
 Began to move as by incantation. 
 He took the flute from his honeyed lips 
 And pressed it between his finger tips. 
 And straightway a vapor began to rise 
 That tickled the nose and blinded the eyes ; 
 And when the people could see again 
 They looked for their victims all in vain. 
 And all about it they ever knew 
 Was that the piper had drawn from view. 
 And the mayor and corporation too. 
 How often is the tide of sin 
 Averted ere it reaches us 
 By ways just as mysterious 
 As those in the case of Hamelin! 
The people went to their homes as mute 
 As since has been the piper's flute, 
 And never was known to even dispute, 
 Among themselves or others, 
 As to how such things could come about. 
 Or whether or not they had a doubt 
 Concerning how they would turn out 
 For fathers, sons, or mothers. 
 The years passed by, as years will do. 
 When trouble is the master. 
 And always strives to bring to view 
 A new and worse disaster; 
 And Sorrow, like a sorcerer, 
 Spread out her melancholy pall 
 So that its folds enveloped all, 
 And each became her worshipper. 
 And not a single child was born 
 Through all the years thereafter; 
 If words sprang from the lips of scorn 
 None came from those of laughter. 
 So hour by hour, and day by day, 
 The city's inmates passed away. 
 And left but one, then old and gray. 
 And that was he the piper left 
 That fatal day behind him, 
 Of whatsoe'er he was bereft, 
 He never strove to find him. 
 But wisely let the prowler go 
 Where'er his whim might take him, 
 And kiss his magic flute and blow 
 For all who might forsake him. 
 Ats^ alas, there came a time 
 Too sad for even the saddest rhyme, 
 When this one mortal became immortal, 
 And flitted away through the heavenly portal. 
Without a soul outside or in 
 Stood poor deserted Hamelin, 
 Devoid for once of human sin. 
 You know a message went to Rat-land 
 By that strong rat that swam the Weser ; 
 And lo ! a race of rats was at hand 
 Outnumbering all the hosts of Caesar. 
 They came by ones and twos and threes, 
 And then in larger companies — 
 As single fours and double scores 
 And hundreds up to fifty, 
 And thousands up to twenty-five, 
 And all seemed more and more alive, 
 And hence were double thrifty. 
 They swarmed into the highest towers, 
 And loitered in the fairest bowers, 
 And sat down where the mayor sat, 
 And also in his Sunday hat; 
 And gnawed revengefully thereat. 
 With rats for mayor and rats for people, 
 With rats in the cellar and rats in the steeple, 
 With rats without and rats within. 
 Stood poor, deserted Hamelin. 
A BLACK SONG
DEDICATION 
 Dedicated to the following lovers of both 
 black and white humanity: 
 Dr. Booker T. Washington, 
 Rector Leroy Ferguson, 
 Dr. C. H. Parrish, 
 Alexander Morris, Esq., 
 Rev. Thomas F. Blue and 
 Prof. John H. Jackson. 
DR. BOOKER T. WASHINGTON TO THE NATIONAL NEGRO BUSINESS LEAGUE. 
 'Tis strange indeed to hear us plead 
 For selling and for buying 
 When yesterday we said: "Away 
 With all good things but dying." 
 The world's ago, and we're agog 
 To have our first brief inning; 
 So let's away through surge and fog 
 However slight the winning. 
 What deeds have sprung from plow and pick ! 
 What bank-rolls from tomatoes ! 
 No dainty crop of rhetoric 
 Can match 'one of potatoes. 
 Ye orators of point and pith, 
 Who force the world to heed you, 
 What skeletons you'll journey with 
 Ere it is forced to feed you. 
 A little gold won't mar our grace, 
 A little ease our glory. 
 This world's a better biding place 
 When money clinks its story. 
 TUSKEGEE. 
 Tuskegee blazes in the nation's eye ; 
 Tuskegee lifts plain labor to the sky ; 
 Tuskegee grounds and towers prosperity. 
 Tuskegee started as an uncouth name; 
 Tuskegee stood a race's scorching blame ; 
 Tuskegee leads that race to deathless fame. 
 Tuskegee sees the merit in a clod; 
 Tuskegee meets false worth with spur and rod ; 
 Tuskegee lifts the Negro nearer God. 
 Tuskegee trains the hand to train the head; 
 Tuskegee lives the laws the ancients read ; 
 Tuskegee saves the living that are dead. 
 Tuskegee wins all foemen, one by one; 
 Tliskegee stars the work that is begun ; 
 Tuskegee's other name is Washington ! 
 NED'S PSALM OF LIFE FOR THE NEGRO. 
 Dis is Ned dat am er-speakin', 
 Wid no wuds dat's cute an' fine. 
 Dis is Ned dat am er-seekin' 
 Light fur dis heah race o' mine. 
 I don' know as I'se er prophit —

 Dis race feelings gwine ter die. 
 'Tain't er thing dat has er color — 
 Tse gwine lib ter see it ain't.

  Kase you's not er wukin' saint. 
 When you wuks so dat de folks is 
 Boun' ter lib by whut you does, 
All dey feelin's an' dey jokes is 
 Fur de man dat once you wuz. 
 Folks will 'cept you when you takes 'em 
 By supplyin' all dey needs; 
 Dey will paint you when you makes 'em 
 Jes' de color o' yo' deeds. 
 Atter while dey will be treatin' 
 You de bery bes' dey can, 
 An' you'll nebber 'gret de meetin' 
 Wid yo' brudder feller man. 
 Yes, dey's feelin' 'twixt de races, 
 An' hit's gwine ter las' until

 Ways ter let dis race be born. 
 I'se got faith 'nuff in de Marster 
 Fur ter know He'll do His part; 
 Ef we stomps out dire disarster 
 Wid er wukin' brain an' heart. 
 THE NEGRO'S CHRISTMAS PRAYER. 
 On this. Thy natal day, O God, 
 Make me forget each ancient care 
 That erstwhile loomed where'er I trod, 
 And robbed me of thy generous fare. 
Frail man is great — and doubly great — 
 So long as he can gaze a-down 
 The path that wrecked his sole estate 
 And speak it just without a frown. 
 It must be true that man is wise 
 When he from out the shattered past 
 Plucks keys to ope the paradise 
 That holds his future hard and fast. 
 This is Thy spirit, earthly housed, 
 This is Thy vision, earthly kenned. 
 With these at hand I am aroused 
 To chase life's phantom to the end. 
 I gaze upon my fellow man, 
 I think that I am such as he. 
 O, God, if Thou hast made a span 
 To bridge his greater self to me, 
 I do not ask the reason why, 
 I do not ask the logic's course ; 
 I turn me from an alien sky 
 To battle with an alien's force. 
 If shadows are the substance here. 
 If God to man is naught to God, 
 Hope looks a-back, faith sinks in fear. 
 And vengeance sways Heaven's chastening rod. 
 A little space, a little breath, . 
 I ask no more. I would not take 
 A feather from the wings of Death 
 To trick with Life for my poor sake. 
 I do not ask for vision clear 
 Enough to pierce the future's maze, 
I only ask a heart sincere, 
 And sense enough to crown my days. 
 Now, grant, O, God, Thy servant's prayer, 
 ^ Grant it as Thou dost wisely see ; 
 Then, as the seasons roll, my fare 
 Shall take the name of charity. 
 THE OLD NEGRO TEACHER TO THE NEW. 
 I has bin er backwoods teacher 
 In my day. 
 I has bin er jackleg preacher 
 In er way. 
 I has hustled frum de jump, 
 I has 'rated frum de stump 
 An' I has full many er bump 
 Frum de fray. 
 I has I'arned ter fret an' clamer 
 Ober slights. 
 I has I'arned ter read de grammer 
 Ob my rights. 
 I has also I'arned ter go 
 'Bout dis Tarnin' sorter slow; 
 An* Fse proud ter lib ter know 
 Dese delights. 
 Ask me questions 'bout my knowin' 
 In de books? 
 Ask de rooster 'bout his crowin' 
 While he cooks. 
 I jes' called de chillens in. 
 An' I sed you mus'n't sin, 
 An' straightway de change begin 
 In dey looks. 
Dis you say wuz no beginnin* 
 Ob er school? 
 Let me tell you all dat sinnin' 
 Meks de fool. 
 When our fools thinks dey is bigger 
 Kase dey Tarns ter read an' figger 
 Jes' es well go pull er trigger 
 Till dey's cool. 
 'Course I had no way ter teach 'em 
 How ter parse, 
 An' I had no way ter reach 'em 
 Up ter Mars. 
 But dat blueback spellin' book 
 An' de strap upon de hook 
 An' my daily business look 
 Left what? Scars? 
 Better gib de boys er flayin' 
 Now an' den 
 Dan ter see 'em daily strayin' 
 Ter de "pen." 
 Fer de youngsters dat I sees 
 Libin' 'bout heah at dey ease 
 Won't be wuf two black-eye peas 
 In de en'. 
 You has bin ter school an' college 
 I suppose. 
 An' you has er lot ob knowledge 
 Dat you knows. 
 Will you let de few dat's tryin' 
 Jine de many dat is dyin' 
 An' so heah ten millun cryin' 
 Ob dey woes? 
Younger brudders, you is leadin' 
 Us ter-day. 
 May we heah no fur-fetched pleadin' 
 Dat mought slay; 
 Fer you knows dat we mus' be 
 Whar de white man's eye kin see 
 An' his cash is scattered free 
 In our way. 
 THE NEGRO CHILD AND THE STORY BOOK 
 See it settin' dar alone, 
 Gently swayin' to an' fro, 
 Readin' in an undertone 
 ^Bout de things of long ago? 
 See its eyes a-fillin' up? 
 Heah it giggle now an' den? 
 It is sippin' frum de cup 
 Dat has nourished mighty men. 
 See dat frown upon its brow? 
 See dat curl upon its lip? 
 It is fightin' frum de prow 
 Of an ancient battleship. 
 It is winnin' wid its frien'. 
 It is losin' to its foes. 
 It has quitted ere de en', 
 An' is lost in polar snows. 
 Bless its soul, it's free ag'in, 
 An^ is journeyin' afar. 
 All creation is a-spin 
 An' its kerridge is er star.

 Heah it sigh a heavy sigh? 
 It is thinkin' 'bout de sheep 
 Dat'll be parted by-an'-by. 
 See dat smile creep frimi its month 
 Till it kivers up its face? 
 It is picturin' de South 
 As a lastin' bidin' place. 
 When it looks frum left to right 
 An' is scratchin' of its head, 
 Jes' be sure it wants de light 
 For to see it safe in bed. 
 When its thoughts are true as go!', 
 An' its ways are cute as wit, 
 It has read what Remus tol', 
 It has lived what Aesop writ. 
 When true rhythm sways its heart, 
 An' a jingle primes its tongue, 
 It is Dunbar's subtle art 
 Frum a joyous scabbard flung. 
 When its spirit dares to dare. 
 An' its darin' dares to win. 
 It is thrivin' on de fare ^ 
 Of de story tol' widin. 
 Let us buil' roun' de story-book. 
 Let us buil' for de story-child, 
 Lest our worl' space shrink to a nook, 
 An' our lives grow gross and wild. 
THE NEGRO'S EDUCATIONAL CREED. 
 The Negro simply asks the chance to think, 
 To wed his thinking unto willing hands, 
 And thereby prove himself a steadfast link, 
 In the sure chain of progress through the lands. 
  He does not ask to loiter and complain 
 While others turn their life blood into worth. 
 He holds that this would be the one foul stain 
 On the escutcheon of this brave old earth. 
 He does not ask to clog the wheels of State 
 And write his color on the Nation's Creed. 
 He asks an humble freedman's estimate. 
 And time to grow ere he essavs to lead. 
 THE LOAFING NEGRO. 
 Whut's use wukin' when you kin 
 Libe lak white folks 'out dey care? 
 Eat lak dem an' dress up in 
 Same fine clo'es dey useter wear? 
 Chicken leg an' good hambone, 
 Homemade bread an' pasty pie, 
 Yo' gal brings ter you erlone : 
 No use wukin' till you die. 
 When you's full jes' walk erbout 
 Lak de worl' wuz made fer you, 
 An' hit could not run widout 
 You libed lak you wants ter do. 
 Matters not whut cums er goes, 
 Matters not who's up er down, 
 All you need's er suit ob clo'es 
 An' er chance ter do de town. 
THE DON'T-CARE NEGRO. 
 Neber min' what's in your cran'um 
 So your collar's high an' true. 
 Neber min' what's in your pocket 
 So de blackin's on your shoe. 
 Neber min' who keeps you comp'ny 
 So he halfs up what he's tuk. 
 Neber min' what way you's gwine 
 So you's gwine away frum wuk. 
 Neber min' de race's troubles 
 So you profits by dem all. 
 Neber min' your leaders' stumblin' 
 So you he'ps to mak' dem fall. 
 Neber min' what's true to-morrow 
 So you libes a dream to-day. 
 Neber min' what tax is levied 
 So it's not on craps or play. 
 Neber min' how hard you labors 
 So you does it to de en' 
 Dat de judge is boun' to sen' you 
 An' your record to de "pen." 
 Neber min' your manhood's risin' 
 So you habe a way to stay it. 
 Neber min' folks' good opinion 
 So you habe a way to slay it. 
 Neber min' man's why an' wharfo' 
 So de worl' is big an' roun'. 
 Neber min' whar next you's gwine to 
 So you's six foot under groun'. 
NEGRO LOVE SONG. 
 I lobes your hands, gal ; yes I do. 
 (Fse gwine ter wed ter-morro'.) 
 I lobes your earnings thro' an' thro'. 
 (I'se gwine ter wed ter-morro'.) 
 Now, heah de truf. I'se mos' nigh broke; 
 I wants ter take you fer my yoke; 
 So let's go wed ter-morro'. 
 Now, don't look shy, an' don't say no. 
 (I'se gwine ter wed ter-morro'.) 
 I hope you don't expects er sho' 
 When we two weds ter-morro'. 
 I needs er licends — you knows I do — 
 I'll borrow de price ob de same frum you, 
 An' den we weds ter-morro'. 
 How pay you back? In de reg'ler way. 
 When you becomes my honey 
 You'll habe myself fer de princ'pal pay, 
 An' my faults fer de interes' money. 
 Dat suits you well? Dis cash is right. 
 So we two weds ter-morro' night, 
 An' you wuks all de ter-morro's. 
 THE NEGRO'S NEW YEAR PRAYER. 
 A backward glance, a lion's daring, 
 A long regret, a sage's bearing. 
 Are the sure steps to onward faring. 
 To-morrow's luck's to-day's devising, 
 To-day's to-morrow's ghost uprising, 
 The future's promise emphasizing. 
New Year we reckon thus : Intruder, 
 The past taught us and left us shrewder, 
 Wilt thou teach us and leave us ruder? 
 An age's zeal may make what naught is, 
 An age's fruit may stop ere aught is, 
 An age's faith may wane when it sought is. 
 Not so its gentleness. It measures 
 The God free-bound in man. It leasures 
 His restlessness into soul-treasures. 
 Grant but this boon. New Year, and set us 
 Above an erring past. There let us 
 Match stars with faults, lest God forget us. 
 RIVALRY. 
 John an' Mandy's prancin' 'long 
 Lak dey's good an' rich ; 
 All her fine clo'es fit up wrong, 
 Eb'ry rag an' stitch. 
 Each one's spahkin' de udder so, 
 Cyarn't tell how dey lobe will grow. 
 She mout marry my beau dat wuz, 
 Don' keer ef she does. 
 John an' Mandy's 'proachin' neah 
 Eak dey means it all ; 
 He's er whisp'rin' so's I heah 
 De sweet wo'ds dat fall. 
 Now ef Mandy knowed ernuff. 
 An' she warn't so big an' rufT, 
 I'd gibe her my beau dat wuz ; 
 Trounce me ef I does. 
John an' Mandy's standin' still, 
 His eyes fixed in hers; 
 Seems ter me dey has one will, 
 Now dey moufs is burs. 
 Each one tells de udder dat 
 It knows 'zac^kly whar hit's at; 
 I gibe her my beau dat wuz? 
 Kill me ef I does. 
 John an' Mandy's man an' wife; 
 Parson Grim say so. 
 He done tied 'em on throo life 
 'Till de last trump blow. 
 I'se not gwine ter be er fool. 
 More big fish is in de pool ; 
 I don' miss er beau dat wuz ; 
 Bless me ef I does. 
 HONEY, WHUT'S YOU ASKIN'?

 Make lastin' my day-dreams ob you ; 
 So, good wife, whut's you askin'? 
 TO THE MEMORY OF MRS. SALLIE BROWN. 
 God gives man bent of will and scope of vision 
 To weave life's earthy threads into a whole ; 
 And lest he miss a glimpse of things elysian, 
 He gives him woman with her heaven-lit soul. 
 Fame may bedazzle him ; alluring power 
 May seize a prostrate world and say: *"Tis thine." 
 This is but chaff beside his nature's dower, 
 Woman, to reassure that life's divine. 
 Woman is weak that she may test man's heart. 
 Betimes she's strong that she may test his brain. 
 In weakness or in strength she plays a part, 
 Man's ever-rising worth cannot attain. 
 Wise unto knowledge that shall spur the thought. 
 Wise unto wisdom that shall sweeten prayer; 
 Wise unto God-like insight who has sought 
 To star his darkness with a woman's care. 
 In life she leads. In death she beckons on 
 To higher aims and more completed duty, 
 Until her vanished self becomes a dawn, 
 Reflecting on his path hope, shrined in beauty. 
LAZY SAM. 
 Don' know my name? It's Lazy Sam, 
 Proud o' dat name. You bet I am. 
 How did I git it? Guess my mammy 
 Long time ergo jes' called me Sammy. 
 Guess all de folks whut heahed ob it 
 Thought me an' dat name wouldn't fit; 
 So dey jes' added one whut suits, 
 Jes' like de heels does ter de boots. 
 How does I manage ter git so fat? 
 Yo's mighty 'quisitive ter ax all dat. 
 I talks fer wuk an' sleeps ter grow. 
 An' eats fer sauce. Now does you know? 
 I's mos' nigh tired o' foolin' wid you. 
 Folks thinks dat Fse got nuthin' ter do, 
 But tell dem whut I is er ain't, 
 I'se Lazy Sam. Is you er saint? 
 Jes' one word mo'? Well, heah it is: 
 You jes' go 'long an' min' yo' biz. 
 Be nice an' sweet an' sma't an' ca'm. 
 An' I'll look atter dis Lazy Sam. 
 THE VICIOUS NEGRO. 
 Dere ain't no ^arthly use I hoi' in totin' 'roun' er gun. 
 When twenty smells de powder, an' de bullets hits 
 but one. 
 An' he turns in an' dies befo' de shooter sees de fun. 
I uster tote er gun 'long time, until I Tarned ter - 
 know 
 Er n-----'s nebber in it 'less he makes up all de 
 show; 
 So twitch 'im till you draws de crowd, den cyarve 
 'im high an' low. 
 He'll p'int his vengeance at you, but he'll 'preciate 
 de fact 
 Dat you has sense whut shows you how ter mix up 
 blood an' tact, 
 So folks will alius 'mind him ob his 'lation ter de act. 
 De coon dat dahs ter 'spute wid me until my blood 
 runs hot 
 I chokes until his tongue crooks up inter er silent 
 knot. 
 Den ef he's gen'l'man 'nufif ter stan' I cyarves 'im on 
 de spot. 
 I don' keer fer yo' pow'ful names er whut yo' 'sitions 
 'notes, 
 I only keers fer bre'sts an' ahrms an' heads an' 'vitin' 
 throats. 
 So I kin cyarve dem reckless wid dis razah dat I 
 totes. 
 o 
 "DEM PHILLUPEENERS." 
 Well, Phillupeeners, how's yo' health? 
 I don' ax how's yo' playin', 
 I 'specs de angels heahs by stealth 
 An' coins it in a sayin'. 
 I 'specs dey's plannin' big ovations ; 
 I 'specs dey'll send sum invitations 
 To all de music-lovin' nations 
 To bless you Phillupeeners. 
Jes' heah 'em once, an' afterwerds 
 Yo'll heah 'em, heah 'em ever, 
 De notes dey plays will come in herds 
 An' heah 'em, heah 'em ever. 
 Dey '11 fust be best, an' den dey'U flee 
 Right on to find de next degree, 
 An' still right on until you see 
 Music, not Phillupeeners. 
 If you would live anudder life 
 An' still live dis you lives heah, 
 If you would turn yo' loss an' strife 
 To gains dat always gives heah, 
 If you would lose yo' appertite 
 Fer all de things dat plagues de sight, 
 An' think up straight an' feel upright, 
 Jes' heah dem Phillupeeners. 
 De white man plays until you dreams 
 Yo' life's a kind o' story; 
 De white man plays until you seems 
  To peep right into glory. 
 Dat's good enough. Dis world widout it 
 Would go wid mournin' wropped about it, 
 But laziness! He jes' cyarn't rout it, 
 Like dem brown Phillupeeners. 
 Heah's to de music dat you plays 
 Upon dem inst'uments, 
 Heah's to de music dat you lays  
 Up fer yo' own contents. 
 Pleah's to yo' sense dat makes yo' luck, 
 Heah's to yo' Phillupeener pluck, 
 An' heah's good will from Old Kaintuck 
 To all you Phillupeeners. 
I'SE JES' ER LITTLE n-----. 
 I keeps er sharp eye on de folks I sees — 
 De big- folks dat habe bo't de bery breeze; 
 But why should I be totin' 'long wid dese? 
 I'se jes' er little n-----. Dat is all. 
 I looks in at de glass an' sees er face 
 Dat 'pears ter say: ''De n-----'s got er place 
 He boun' ter keep." Dat quits me frum de race. 
 I'se jes' er little n-----. Dat is all. 
 De white boy tug an' wuk an' go th'oo school. 
 Ob course he kyarn't erford ter be er fool. 
 But why should I be wuk's obleegin' tool? 
 I'se jes' er little n-----. Dat is all. 
 Don' tell me 'bout de good things ober dere ; 
 Fur eb'ry one o' dem is in de air, 
 An' neber will be sauce ter my po' fare. 
 I'se jes' er little n-----. Dat is all. 
 I'se gwine ter habe er good time now, you bets. 
 Dis world's not gwine ter owe me eny de'ts. 
 I pities all my folks who wuks an' frets. 
 I'll be er sho' 'nuff n-----. Dat is all. 
 BIG IKE AND LITTLE IKE. 
 One mawn ole marse, he say ter me : 
 "Ike, whar you bin las' night?" 
 "Ole marse," I say, "I climed er tree 
 An' drinked till I gits tight.

So Big Ike 'clared he's gwine ter show 
 Er little n-----'s skeered ter do 
 Sum movements he's gwine ter put 'im throo. 
 "I clim'ed de tree, ez I sed befo', 
 An' Ike, Big Ike, he gaze,

 An' drink dat pint an' brace dat tree.

 Jes' press on Ike till he couldn't see." 
 Den marse, he says: ''Well, Ike, how's dat?" 
 I looks, an' dere stan' Ike ; 
 Ike say: "You lies! You'll be er cat 
 In de big tree on de pike !" 
 I 'splains ter Ike, an' marse say: "Sin!" 
 I 'splains ter marse, an' Ike he grin,

 My name clean outen de heabenly books. 
 Den marse, he says: "Go 'long wid Ike." 
 Ike looks, an' den I goes. 
 I foun' myself flung ober de pike 
 On er lim', jes' erlibe wid woes.

 An' bring er fife an' bring er drum. 
 Dey kicked up dus', an' pranced an' sung 
 Right under de tree-tops whar I hung.

 She shake her haid, den take de han' 
 Ob Pete, my ribal. He take her fan, 
 An' all prance off wid er look at me 
 Dat said: "Grow inter de lim' ob de tree. 
 THE CHRISTMAS TREE. 
 (To my friend, R. W. Thompson.) 
 Heah, ole ooman ! Heah is me, 
 Den cum wid yo' Chris'mus tree. 
 Heah, ole ooman! Whar's you at? 
 Shake de snow offen my hat.

 All de playthings an' de trees.

 Now our Liz kin habe sum fun. 
 Rich folks, dey owns all creation, 
 Sabe de po' folks' po' relation. 
Met our naber cumin' 'long 
 Wid er tree not wuth er song. 
 He wuz braggin' all de while 
 'Bout his tree an' 'bout his chile. 
 You could lose his tree in dis 
 Jes' lak sorrer's lost in bliss; 
 An' de chile whut he wuz praisin' 
 Won't be wuth de trouble o' raisin' 
 Now, de tree is in its place, 
 Kiber up our darlin's face. 
 Kiber up her hands an' feet, 
 Don't her toes look nice an' sweet? 
 Musten' let her eben heah 
 Ob de good things whut is neah. 
 Is my talk er gittin' louder? 
 Well, I'se proud an' gittin' prouder. 
 B'lieve I'll take her out o' bed. 
 An' hoi' up her sleepy haid 
 Ter de things up on de tree, 
 Co'se she'll not erwake ter see. 
 Cum heah, darlin'. Look up dar ! 
 Eb'ry playthin' is er star 
 Shinin' down on you ter please you. 
 Sleepin' still? I b'lieve I'll tease you. 
 Tickle all yo' little toes, 
 Kiss you on yo' stumpy nose, 
 Run my fingers throo yo' haih, 
 Loos'nin' all de kinks up dar. 
 Rub yo' black face 'g'inst my own 
 Till you cries : "Let me erlone." 
 Is you 'wake? You is an' sholy 
 Looks lak angels whut is holy. 
Eat dis candy an' dis cake. 
 Blow dis horn an' keep erwake.

 Scatter 'roun' dis little pack. 
 Use dis pencil an' dis slate, 
 Wid 'em I'arn ter calkerlate ; 
 Kiss yo' doll an' kiss her tresses, 
 An' her hat an' all her dresses.

 Gwine ter cry? Yo' teahs is sweet, 
 Lak de toes whut slits you feet. 
 Take dis chile, good wife, an' wrop it 
 Warm in bed befo' I whop it. 
 NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS. 
 I is fifty, more er less, an' it's cuttin' ter my pride 
 Not ter know ef I is stationed on de lower er upper 
 side, 
 But I hopes I'se on de lower wid er gap dat's good 
 an' wide. 
 I has alluz bin er lober, an' I alluz has bin jilted. 
 All de nos I has rece'bed would make er quilt, full 
 stuffed an' quilted; 
 So my co'tin's but er mem'ry, an' my pride is kinder 
 wilted. 
 Dese is strokes dat makes de wise men scratch dey 
 nakid pates an' wunder, 
Dese is strokes dat men in gin'ral 'fuse ter libe an' 
 Stan' up under, 
 Dese is strokes dat robs de lightnin' ob de right ter 
 owe de thunder. 
 Dar is strokes dat is more pow'ful den yo' I'arnin's 
 institutions. 
 Dey jes' grin's you till you feels lak you's de four 
 win's distributions. 
 Dey is tryin' ter walk de chalk line ob yo' New Yeah 
 resolutions. 
 Knowed 'er man who swahed 'fo' gracious he wuz 
 gwine ter libe up higher 
 Den de swillin' ob' good licker till he kilt de base 
 desire ; 
 An' he ended full ob whisky 'cross de back log in de 
 fiah. 
 Knowed er nuther man who sed he would fergibe his 
 enemies, 
 An' he started out ter do it jes' es happy es you 
 please ; 
 But he foun' without opponents he could neber be at 
 ease. 
 Why dis strikin' out at randum,, when dis talk is all 
 fer me? 
 I has practiced resolutin' on de Ian' an' on de sea 
 Till my failures fin's me guilty on de charge ob 
 perjury. 
 I is sho' my heart is tender, an' I wants ter mend my 
 ways. 
 I jes' lobes ter heah folks singin', an' I 'oners folks 
 dat prays. 
 But frum New Yeah resolutin' I is free de res' my 
 days. 
'Cause you see I'se tried de ole ones till I'se put 'em 
 all ter rout; 
 An' ef new ones probed successful dey would leabe 
 my niin' in dou't, 
 Ef it eber could grow wise enuff ter fin' my new self 
 out. 
 REPORTING THE SERMON. 
 Heahed er sermon tudder night 
 Frum de Reb'rent Rastus White. 
 You wus dar? Don' I know dat?

 Wid er speech he's boun' ter make 
 'Stid ob stoppin* fer yo' sake?

 (Needn't 'gin to scrape an' bow) 
 Reb'rent Rastus sot us thinkin' —

 An' ter spy de better Ian' —

 Brudder Rastus cumin' dis way. 
 He kin make it bettern me, 
 An, you's boun' ter wait ter see,

 I'll jes' drink until I rise 
 Ter sum sort ob paradise. 
 Rastus cumin'? B'liebe I'll bore him. 
 Bar's de empty bottle 'fore him. 
Let us hide heah in dese weeds. 
 Rastus, Rastus, show yo' deeds. 
 Now he's lookin' on de groun', 
 Now he's list'nin' fer sum soun', 
 Now he's hid it in his clothes, 
 Now he's stuck it ter his nose, 
 Now he smacks his lips an' shows dat 
 He would like ter know whar mo's at. 
 Thoo dat bottle held er drouf 
 Rastus, you mus' hoi' yo' mouf. 
 Ef you 'spouse de temp'rence cause,

 You's wid us? You better be. 
 Cum right on an' let us see. 
 Bress de Lawd fer dis chance meetin', 
 We's dun drunk. Now, let's ter eatin'.

PREFACE
To those, and they are many, who, in their best moments, seek not the evil but the good, who strive to see all that is best in nature and humanity, this little volume will be welcome. In these days when passion and prejudice seem to overshadow the sense of justice it is good to turn to these pages. They breathe the most fascinating and admirable characteristics of a race that can sing most effectively and simply the songs of nature, sound the humble heart beats of contentment, and play upon the lyre of native philosophy and mellow wit. 
All the misfortune, the injustice and the crushing disadvantages of centuries have failed to crush out the song of the negro. Mr. Henderson in “Humble Folks” sings and smiles again. His poetry is the poetry of simplicity, his melody wholly inspired, his theme well within his point of view and essentially genuine, wholesome and real.

Editor of the Columbus Dispatch,

Ef yo’ wan't to please de ol' man,

An' jes' stretch his mouf an' grin,

Ah's jes' ez full er mischief,
An'ah's jes' ez full er fun!

An' still keep mah 'liggen
An' won't do no sin.
Ah's sebbentee two ah reckons,
An' er li'l mo' beside!
Hard in de mussle
An’soople in de hide!
Ef er mule would kick me,
De way ah now feels,
Ah could sock him 'twix his eyeballs
An' knock him off his heels!
Ah sometimes gits to tinkin'
'Bout de ol' Verginny Reel!
An' how ah uster hop it,
Wid ol' Aunt Nancy Steel.

An' dis ol' man, mah good chillen,

SOFT FALLS THE NIGHT.
TO GEORGE M. WINWOOD JR., Springfield, Ohio.
Soft falls thenight-
And chases 'way
The slowly dying
Summer day.
The sun from his
ethereal height,
Is curtained by
The shades of night.
Soft falls the night-
The birds that tune
Their songs with nature
In commune
Now hush their lays
Seek silent rest,
Within their downy
Leafy nests.
Soft falls the night-
Sweet peace divine
In each heart comes
To be enshrined,
While angels pause
On earth to show'r.
The blessings of the
Sovereign power.
Soft falls the night-
A peaceful sleep
O'er earthly mortals
Doth now creep.
They rest now from
Their day's pursuit-
The world is still,
The world is mute.
Soft falls the night-
The verdure green
Now glistens with
A dewy sheen.
The flowers droop,
Their petals close,
They dream away
In sweet repose.
Soft falls the night-
Lo! breaks the dawn,
And nature 'wakens
With the morn,
Exulting!y
Sends up her lays,
Her symphonies,
To God in praise.
"ANNOYANCE."
TO DR. ALBERT COOPER AND M. MCDONALD.
Go way Sambo! Stop er pesterin' me!
Ah haint er gwine to tell yo' no mo'.
De nex' time yo' ax me fo' mo' short cake,
Ah's gwine to smack yo'plum out dat doh!

An' let 'em git yo'
Ef yo' don't walk chalk-
Dat's whut ah'll do!
Whah's yo’ been,
Yo' nappy head,
'Roun' lickin' lasses
Off de white chile's bread?
Ef yo' don't leave de white
Chile's trash erlone
Ah'll wollup yo', hyah me!
Till yo' holler an’ moan.
Yo' mus' hab two stummicks
An' er ha'f beside.
Whah does yo' put
All dat stuff, in yo' hide?
Yo' eat an' eat
Till yo' eyes bulge out!
It's er sprize to me
Dat yo’ hain't got de gout.
Ah 'll short cake yo',
Wid dis big raw hide.
Ef yo’ don't lemme ʼlone
An' go outside.
Yo' hain't no count
But to sleep an' eat
Jes' lookee dah!
At yo' dirty brac feet!
No wonder yo's got
Sich gutts in yo' feet.
Yo' don't do nuffin'
But sleep an' eat.
But ah guess dat's er weakness
An' er trait of Ham.

HE IS NOT DEAD.
Weep not! He is not dead
'Though sepulchered, the tenement of clay,
The severance of the silver chord
Means but new birth to live alway.
Decrepit, so made by fleeting years,
Fatigued, with faltering step
He climbed life's weary way,
Beyond the enshrouding mists
His soul cleaves the vaulted skies,
Merged in the realm of supernal day.
The great white throne embellished with
The choiring throngs resounding
With the rhythm of spheres,
Welcomed this soul that took it's flight
From earth 'mid grief and falling tears.
Indelibly stamped upon life's way
He left his impress for his race to live
When stars grown ancient dismissed from
vaulted skies
With fulgent suns sink no more to rise.
Gilded upon the heavenly scroll,
Fulgent as the spheres that roll
Onward and onward through space,
His sacred name there finds its place.
The shedding of Christ's blood on Calvary
Was for such as he, who lived the life
The great tribunal approbates, that swings
awide
The golden gates.

To Mr. J. T. Ricks, Springfield, Ohio.
When de moon streams down
On er kam still night,
Let me sot by de moss-cubbahd stream,
An' plink out de ditties ub mah ol' banjo,
While mah soul steals erway in o' dream.
Jes' git out dah whah de solemness come,
Whah de kentry am still ez def;
When de honeysuckles sleep an' dey hide dey-

An' de li'l winds blo' dey bref.
Whah de bullfrog hollers neef de ol' pine tree,
An' de kill-dee an' de lonesome quail call,
Whah de owl hoots slo' ez de moon draps lo'
Ez de night shades slip an' fall.
Whah de willers hang lo',
An' dey 'pears to weep
Ez de night bird's plaint come down,
An' de li'l brooks skip in jubilee
While murmurrin' out dey sound.
Dat am sech er place whah I longs to be,
When de night am still an' kam;
When all de worl' seems los' in def
An' lef' yo'whah yo' am.

To POSTMASTER JAMES H. RABBITTS, Springfield, Ohio.
When de shadows ub de evenin'

'Cross de lonely fields an' meadows,
Cums de cattle's lowin' soun’;
An' de vespah bells am ringin'
An' dey blen' in tuneful lay,

Widout res' mus' toil an’ toil;

Dah's a sadden feelin' takes yo',

An' de scene at night when gaddahd

Fo’ to ax de mahstah's kyah,

THE SOLILOQUY OF SATAN.
Sovereign! Am I! By God's decree
Of Hell for all eternity,
Where joy and peace are never known,
Nor light of day is ever thrown.
My kingdom, burneth with the fire,
Will flame and burn when time is done,
When chaos and confusion reign-
Extinguished are the stars and sun.
There demons rage in strife and woe,
Enthralled like swine in my domain,
Where invocations, pleas and prayers
To God for succor rise in vain!
See how they grope within the throes!
And gnash their teeth like dogs that bite!
Then weep like orphans at the bier
When dawns on them there is no flight!
Weep, ye cursed, weep and groan!
Thy sins? Seas of tears can not atone!
Plead till the years are sepulchered!
In Hell ay, mercy hath no throne! 
Heartless am I! My spirit knows
No justice, mercy, feeilng, none! 
Hatred and envy and dire revenge
Have come to me-my spirit won!
I laugh at misery, woe and pain
Of those, my captives, held in chain! 
Ay! when the sun and studding stars
Have left their sockets waned and paled!
Still! captives will they e'er remain
In Lucifer's charnal travail.
Lucifer is called the roaring lion! 
Seeking whom he may devour!
Presence o'erpowering! Bold! as the blast!
Who's never known to shrink or cower.
Accursed by Him dropped from the throne,
Where naught but love and peace art known,
Because rebellion seized my heart
And made me thrust at Him my dart!
"Thou hast rebelled, proud Lucifer!"
Depart! with those thy favorite hosts! 
From thy imperial sacred place,
Go down in shame, ruin and disgrace!
Ay, such was true! And mine the fate!
Thrust! Through the portals, through the gate,
Down! the precipitous road to Hell,
Forever there to live and dwell!
Hell leaped for joy; her hosts proclaimed:
“Proud Lucifer droppeth to his shame!”
Reverberations; the wails, the shrieks,
The tempest struggling up the steeps!
Seethed! surged! and burned! ten thousand folds,
The depthless sea of sinful souls! 
Mine the prerogative to remain?
Nay! naught but submission to that decree
Of Him who shapes all destiny! 
The author of immortality.
Ah, Lucifer, why didst thou give
The demon thralldom of thy soul
To bring down judgment on thyself,
To bar thee from the streets of gold?
Ah! Lucifer! Behold, behold!
That vast, resplendent white-robed throng!
There once thou stood'st immaculate
In praise and eulogy and song.
Bedazzling in God's holiness, outrivaling me-
teoric light,
Whose fulgence pierced the dark’ning gloom,
Dispersing ebon shades of night!
Fool! Has thou been, proud Lucifer!
To God thou yet shall bend in tears,
Brought to the gravity of thy fate
Clothed in the mantle of dire fears!
Who is this King of supreme reign
Whose throttling might holds Hell enchained?
'Tis He! my everlasting foe!
Who sinks me to these depths below.
Judge of the court tribunal high! 
Oh for my place in yonder sky!
Could my entreaty move Thy will
For reinstatement 'round Thy throne,
Gladly would I flee to Thee,
Where dwell the glories of thine own.
Oh drops of mercy-dews of love
In benediction from above,
Fall on Lucifer this hour,
From Heaven's holy sacred tower.
The soul of Lucifer now weeps
With surcharged heart bleeding and torn,
In sackcloth and ashes behold! behold!
The vain proud Lucifer doth mourn!
Behold me in this sin-cursed plight!
Eternal iKng, disperse this night!
Cast aside the threat ’ning clouds
And lead me to Thy glorious heights!
Hark! the music of the spheres! 
In spotless white at God's right hand,
Float strains of that grand tribal band! 
The hosts are marching! Hear their song!
Great King of Glory! Oh, how long! 
How long must Lucifer remain
Divorced from the glories of Thine own
Forgiveness can there be for me
Again to sit around Thy throne?
Doth Lucifer, like the widow, mourn!
Like swaddling babies drop a tear!
Arouse ye coward! Doff thy fears! 
Inspire thy soul again to cheers!
Away with retrospection now!
Come! welcome sweet forgetfulness! 
Blot from the memory of Lucifer,
Those season's of his blissfulness! 
For every tear that I have shed,
For every plea struck from my tongue,
Summon thy most destructive powers,
Let souls from earth this hour be flung!
Ha! again did Lucifer turn fool,
Forget himself and play the ass! 
Furies of Hell burst forth anew! 
Obey!  the mandates of my blast!
I, the personification of all!
That's naught but perverse to the good,
To weaken at unguarded time-
Allow myself to whine and brood!
To think that I could condescend
To drop to humiliation's shrine,
While founts of grief and sorrows flowed
When memory didst my soul remind.
To rend my soul to depths extreme,
To fall repentant at His stream,
This vain, proud sovereign power of Hell! 
Susceptible to such a spell! 
Away, with all that tends to good!
Misery and torture to man for food!
Scoff at the pleading ones in tears
And mock the faltering one that fears! 
Let devastation fill the land!
Death! Death | ride on! Spare not a soul!
Strike down! the unsuspecting one,
For my captivity, my fold! 
Brilliance of conquest is for me!
Cursed! be the throngs of liberty!
Their freedom stirs my soul to wrath,
An effervescent aftermath.
Lucifer, rule on in infamy!
Prowl! the recesses of earth!
Barter! for the living souls,
For those as yet not given birth!
Oh, ye of Adam's progeny! 
Ye knoweth not! this hellish sage,
Who thwarts the subtlest of man
To give him torture for his wage!
Oh could I seize earth in my grasp
And crush her as the potter's clay,
While o.er the battlements like swine
Behold men fall in fear, dismay!
Ay, when the judgment day shall dawn
The light from every sphere hath gone,
The firmament clouds, sinks, disappears,
To be forgotten as the years,
When throttling forces seize the earth,
And fires consuming have their birth,
Catastrophe thrown to relief,
While I with cohorts gloat beneath,
Then! will my reveille break the spell,
And cohorts martialing forth from Hell,
At my dictation mandates all! 
Like vultures seize, bind and enthrall! 
Oh when ye plead and cower in tears,
Receive ye then my mocks and jeers! 
I'll sink thee to the depths unknown,
Reward for sinful deeds, thou’rt sown!
Then, will my soul well to the heights,
Where bliss is law, where bliss is might!
Quickened by misery, woe and pain
Of groveling souls in my domain! 
Away! Away! No reasoning power
Could change this demon for one hour!
Well might'st thou try to move God's throne,
As try to touch this heart of stone!
Such! is the law of Lucifer!
Written in blood of suffering souls;
Inexorable, unmoved am I
As He who thrust me from the sky!

ROSEMARY AND PANSIES 
AT THE GRAVE OF ONE FORGOTTEN 
 In a churchyard old and still, 
 Where the breeze-touched branches thrill 
      To and fro, 
 Giant oak trees blend their shade 
 O'er a sunken grave-mound, made 
      Long ago. 
 No stone, crumbling at its head, 
 Bears the mossed name of the dead 
      Graven deep; 
 But a myriad blossoms' grace 
 Clothes with trembling light the. place 
      Of his sleep. 
 Was a young man in his strength 
 Laid beneath this low mound's length, 
      Heeding naught? 
 Did a maiden's parents wail 
 As they saw her, pulseless, pale, 
      Hither brought? 
 Was it else one full of days, 
 Who had traveled darksome ways, 
      And was tired, 
 Who looked forth unto the end, 
 And saw Death come as a friend 
      Long desired? 
 Who it was that rests below 
 Not earth's wisest now may know, 
      Or can tell; 
 But these blossoms witness bear 
 They who laid the sleeper there 
      Loved him well. 
 In the dust that closed him o'er 
 Planted they the garden store 
      Deemed most sweet, 
 Till the fragrant gleam, outspread, 
 Swept in beauty from his head 
      To his feet. 
 Still, in early springtime's glow, 
 Guelder-roses cast their snow 
      O'er his rest; 
 Still sweet-williams breathe perfume 
 Where the peonies' crimson bloom 
      Drapes his breast. 
 Passing stranger, pity not 
 Him who lies here, all forgot, 
       'Neath this earth; 
 Some one loved him—more can fall 
 To no mortal. Love is all 
      Life is worth. 
THE SHEPHERDS' VISION 
 Upon the dim Judean hills, 
      The shepherds watched their flock by night, 
 When on their unexpectant gaze 
     Outshone that vision of delight, 
 The fairest that did ever rise 
 To awe and gladden earthly eyes. 
 From no far realm those shepherds came, 
      Treading the pilgrim's weary road; 
 Not theirs the vigil and the fast 
      Within the hermit's mean abode ; 
'Twas at their usual task they stood, 
 When dawned that light of matchless good. 
 Not only to the sage and seer 
      Life's revelation comes in grace; 
 Most often on the toiler true, 
      Who, working steadfast in his place, 
 Looks for the coming of God's will, 
 The glorious vision shineth still. 
HEREDITY 
 Our dead forefathers, mighty though they be, 
 For all their power still leave our spirits free; 
 Though on our paths their shadows far are thrown, 
 The life that each man liveth is his own. 
 Time stands like some schoolmaster old and stern, 
 And calls each human being in his turn 
 To write his task upon life's blackboard space; 
 Death's fingers then the finished work erase, 
 And the next pupil's letters take its place. 
 That he who wrote before thee labored well 
 Concerns thee not: thy work for thee must tell; 
      'Tis naught to thee if others' tasks were ill: 
 Thou hast thy chance and canst improve it still. 
 From all thy fathers' glory and their guilt 
 The board for thee is clean: write what thou wilt! 
THE WOOD FIRE 
 O giant oak, majestic, dark, and old, 
      A hundred summers in the woodland vast, 
      From the rich suns that lit thy glories past, 
 In thy huge trunk thou storedst warmth untold; 
 Now, when the drifted snows the hills enfold, 
      And the wild woods are shaken in the blast, 
      O'er this bright hearth thou sendest out at last 
 The long-pent sunshine that thine heart did hold. 
 Like thee, O noble oak-tree, I would store 
      From days of joy all beauty and delight, 
      All radiant warmth that makes life's summer bright, 
 So that I may, when sunniest hours are o'er, 
 Still from my heart their treasured gleam outpour, 
      To cheer some spirit in its winter night. 
A NEW YEAR'S HOPE 
 I dare not hope that in this dawning year 
 I shall accomplish all my dreams hold dear; 
 That I, when this year closes, shall have wrought 
 All the high tasks that my ambitions sought, 
 And that I shall be then the spirit free, 
 Strong, and unselfish, that I long to be. 
 But truly do I hope, resolve, and pray 
 That, as the new year passes, day by day 
 My footsteps, howsoever short and slow, 
 Shall still press forward in the path they go, 
 And that my eyes, uplifted evermore, 
 Shall look forth dauntless to the things before; 
 And when this new year with the old has gone, 
 I still may courage have to struggle on. 
TO A SILVER DOLLAR 
 Pale coin, what various hands have you passed through 
      Ere you to-day within my hand were laid? 
      Perchance a laborer's well-earned hire you made; 
 Some miser may have gloated long on you; 
 Perhaps some pitying hand to Want out-threw; 
      And, lost and won through devious tricks of trade, 
      You may have been, alas! the full price paid 
 For some poor soul that loved ydu past your due. 
 No doubt 'tis well, O imaged Liberty, 
      You see not where your placid face is thrust, 
 Nor know how far man is from being free, 
      Bound as he is by money's fateful lust, 
 While to his anxious soul like mockery 
      Seem those fair, graven words: "In God we trust." 
PREPARATION 
 "I have no time for those things now," we say; 
 "But in the future just a little way, 
 No longer by this ceaseless toil oppressed, 
 I shall have leisure then for thought and rest. 
 When I the debts upon my land have paid, 
 Or on foundations firm my business laid, 
 I shall take time for discourse long and sweet 
 With those beloved who round my hearthstone meet; 
 I shall take time on mornings still and cool 
 To seek the freshness dim of wood and pool, 
 Where, calmed and hallowed by great Nature's peace, 
 My life from its hot cares shall find release; 
 I shall take time to think on destiny, 
 Of what I was and am and yet shall be, 
 Till in the hush my soul may nearer prove 
 To that great Soul in whom we live and move. 
 All this I shall do sometime but not now— 
 The press of business cares will not allow." 
 And thus our life glides on year after year; 
 The promised leisure never comes more near. 
 Perhaps the aim on which we placed our mind 
 Is high, and its attainment slow to find; 
 Or if we reach the mark that we have set, 
 We still would seek another, farther yet. 
 Thus all our youth, our strength, our time go past 
 Till death upon the threshold stands at last, 
 And back unto our Maker we must give 
 The life we spent preparing well to live. 
GHOSTS 
 Upon the eve of Bosworth, it is said, 
      While Richard waited through the drear night's gloom 
      Until wan morn the death-field should illume, 
 Those he had murdered came with soundless read 
 To daunt his soul with prophecies of dread, 
      And bid him know that, gliding from the tomb, 
 They would fight 'gainst him in his hour of doom 
 Until with theirs should lie his discrowned head. 
 To every man, in life's decisive hour, 
      Ghosts of the past do through the conflict glide, 
 And for him or against him wield their power; 
 Lost hopes and wasted days and aims that died 
 Rise spectral where the fateful war-clouds lower, 
 And their pale hands the battle shall decide. 
THE RAINBOW 
 Love is a rainbow that appears 
 When heaven's sunshine lights earth's tears. 
 All varied colors of the light 
 Within its beauteous arch unite: 
 There Passion's glowing crimson hue 
 Burns near Truth's rich and deathless blue; 
 And Jealousy's green lights unfold 
 'Mid Pleasure's tints of flame and gold. 
 O dark life's stormy sky would seem, 
 If love's clear rainbow did not gleam! 
HEROES 
 Men, for the sake of those they loved, 
      Have met death unafraid, 
 Deeming by safety of their friends 
      Their life's loss well repaid. 
 Men have attained, by dauntless toil, 
      To purpose pure and high, 
 The darkness of their rugged ways 
      Lit by a loved one's eye. 
 Heroes were they, yet God to them 
      Gave not the task most hard, 
 For sweet it is to live or die 
      When love is our reward. 
 The bravest soul that ever lived 
      Is he, unloved, unknown, 
 Who has chosen to walk life's highest path, 
      Though he must walk alone; 
 Who has toiled with sure and steadfast hands 
      Through all his lonely days, 
 Unhelped by Love's sweet services, 
      Uncheered by Love's sweet praise; 
 Who, by no earthly honors crowned, 
      Kinglike has lived and died, 
 Giving his best to life, though life 
      To him her best denied. 
 THE RECOMPENSE 
 O ancient ocean, with what courage stern 
      Thy tides, since time began, have sought to gain 
      The luring moon, toward which they rise in vain, 
 Yet daily to their futile aim return. 
 Like thee do glorious human spirits yearn 
      And strive and fail and strive and fail again 
      Some starlike aspiration to attain, 
 Some light that ever shall above them burn. 
 Yet truly shall their recompense abide 
      To all who strive, although unreached their goal: 
 The ceaseless surgings of the ocean tide 
      Do cleanse the mighty waters which they roll, 
 And the high dreams in which it vainly sighed 
      Make pure the deeps of the aspiring soul. 
THE TEST 
 "He fears not death, and therefore he is brave"— 
      How common yet how childish is the thought, 
      As if death were the hardest battle fought, 
 And earth held naught more dreadful than the grave! 
 In life, not death, doth lie the brave soul's test, 
      For life demandeth purpose long and sure, 
      The strength to strive, the patience to endure; 
 Death calls for one brief struggle, then gives rest. 
 Through our fleet years then let us do our part 
      With willing arm, clear brain, and steady nerve; 
      In death's dark hour no spirit true will swerve, 
 If he have lived his life with dauntless heart. 
TO A DEAD BABY 
 Pale little feet, grown quiet ere they could run 
      One step in life's strange journey; sweet lips chilled 
      To silence ere they prattled; small hands stilled 
 Before one stroke of life's long toil was done ; 
 Uncreased white brows that laurels might have won, 
     Yet leave their spacious promise unfulfilled— 
     O baby dead, I cannot think God willed 
 Your life should end when it had scarce begun! 
 If no man died till his long life should leave 
      All hopes and aims fulfilled, until his feet 
 Had trod all paths where men rejoice or grieve, 
      I might have doubt of future life more sweet; 
 But as I look on you, I must believe 
      There is a heaven that makes this earth complete. 
THANKSGIVING 
 Our Father, whose unchanging love 
      Gives soil and sun and rain, 
 We thank Thee that the seeds we sowed 
      Were planted not in vain, 
 But that Thy hand the year hath crowned 
      With wealth of fruits and grain.
 But more we thank Thee for the hope 
      Which hath our solace been, 
 That when the harvests of our lives 
      Have all been gathered in, 
 Our weary hearts and toil-worn hands 
      Thy welcoming smile shall win. 
 We thank Thee for the cheerful board 
      At which fond faces meet, 
 And for the human loves that make 
      Our transient years so sweet; 
 We thank Thee most for hopes of heaven 
      Where love shall be complete. 
 Though on some dear, remembered face 
      No more the hearth lights shine, 
 We thank Thee that the friends we loved 
      Are kept by love divine, 
 And though they pass beyond our gaze, 
      They do not pass from Thine. 
 If at the harvest feast no more 
      Our words and smiles shall blend, 
 We thank Thee that, though sundered far, 
      Our steps still homeward tend, 
 And that our Father's open door 
      Awaits us at the end. 
 UNDER ROOFS 
 Between us and the starred vasts overhead
 Broad-builded roofs we spread, 
 Thus shutting from our view the wonders high 
 Of the clear midnight sky; 
 Yet all our roofs make not more faint or far 
 One ray of one dim star. 
 Our souls build o'er them roofs of dread and doubt, 
 And think they shut God out; 
 Yet all the while, remembering though forgot, 
 That vast Love, changing not, 
 Abides, and, spite of all our faithless fear, 
 Shines nevermore less near. 
FOREVER 
 We sigh for human love, from which 
      A whim or chance shall sever, 
 And leave unsought the love of God, 
      Though God's love lasts forever. 
 We seek earth's peace in things that pass 
      Like foam upon the river, 
 While, steadfast as the stars on high, 
      God's peace abides forever. 
 Man's help, for which we yearn, gives way, 
      As trees in storm-winds quiver, 
 But, mightier than all human need, 
      God's help remains forever. 
 Turn unto Thee our wavering hearts, 
      O Thou who f ailest never; 
 Give us Thy love and Thy great peace, 
      And be our Help forever ! 
IF CHRIST SHOULD COME 
 If Christ should come to my store to-day, 
 What would he think, what would he say? 
 If his eyes on my opened ledgers were laid, 
 Would they meet a record of unfair trade, 
 And see that, lured by the love of pelf, 
 For a trivial price I had sold myself? 
 Or would he the stainless record behold 
 Of perfect integrity, richer than gold? 
 If Christ should come to my school-room today, 
 What would he think, what would he say? 
 Would he find me giving the self-same care 
 To stupid and poor as to rich and fair, 
 And striving, unmindful of praise or blame, 
 Through tedious tasks to a lofty aim, 
 Guiding small feet as they forward plod 
 In paths of duty that lead to God? 
 If Christ should come to my workshop to-day, 
 What would he think, what would he say? 
 Would his eye, as it glanced my work along, 
 See that all its parts were stanch and strong, 
 Closely fitted, firm-welded, and good, 
 Of flawless steel and of unwarped wood, 
 As sound as I trust my soul shall be 
 Wben tried by the test of eternity? 
 If Christ should come to my kitchen to-day, 
 What would he think, what would he say? 
 Would he find me with blithesome and grateful heart 
 And hands well-skilled in the housewife's art, 
 Bearing sordid cares with a spirit sweet, 
 And making the lowliest tasks complete? 
 Cometh he not, who of old did say, 
 "Lo, I am with you, my friends, alway"? 
 O thought that our weary hearts must thrill, 
 In our toilsome ways he is present still! 
 At counter and forge, in office and field, 
 He stands, to no mortal eye revealed. 
 Ah, if we only could realize 
 That ever those gentle yet searching eyes 
 Gaze on our work with approval or blame, 
 Our slipshod lives would not be the same! 
 For, thrilled by the gaze of the unseen Guest, 
 In our daily toil we would do our best. 
GIFTS 
 Myrrh and frankincense and gold— 
 Thus the ancient story told— 
 When the seers found Him they sought, 
 To the wondrous babe they brought. 
 Let us—ours the selfsame quest— 
 Bear unto the Christ our best. 
 If to him, as to our King, 
 We the gift of gold would bring, 
 Be it royal offering! 
 Gold unstained by stealth or greed, 
 Gold outflung to all earth's need, 
 That hath softened human woe— 
 Helped the helpless, raised the low. 
 Frankincense for him is meet, 
 Yet no Orient odors sweet 
 Are to him as fragrant gift 
 As white thoughts to God uplift, 
 And a life that soars sublime, 
 Sweet above ill scents of time. 
 Last, from out the Magians' store, 
 Myrrh, as for one dead, they bore; 
 While, perchance, their lifted eyes 
 Viewed afar the Sacrifice.
 Let us to the sepulcher 
 Bring a richer gift than myrrh: 
 Love that will not yield to dread 
 When all human hopes have fled; 
 Faith that falters not nor quails 
 When the waning earth-light fails, 
 Saying, "Shall I be afraid 
 Of the dark where Thou wast laid?" 
 BENEFACTION 
 If thou the lives of men wouldst bless, 
 Live thine own life in faithfulness; 
 Thine own hard task, if made complete, 
 Shall render others' toil more sweet; 
 Thy grief, if bravely thou endure, 
 Shall give men's sorrow solace sure; 
 Thy peril, if met undismayed, 
 Shall make the fearful less afraid. 
 Each step in right paths firmly trod 
 Shall break some thorn or crush some clod, 
 Making the way more smooth and free 
 For him who treads it after thee. 
HISTORIC GROUND 
 No song lends these calm vales a deathless name; 
      No hero, to a nation's honors grown, 
      Claims as his birthplace these rude hills unknown; 
 No pomp of hostile armies ever came, 
 Marring these fields with storied blood and flame; 
      And yet the darkest tragedies of time, 
      Of love and death the mysteries sublime 
 Have thrilled this tranquil spot, unmarked of fame. 
 Here the long conflict between good and ill 
      Has been fought out to shame or victory, 
      Darkly and madly as in scenes renowned. 
 Ah, though unnamed in human records, still 
 Within the annals of eternity 
      This place obscure is true historic ground! 
A MOUNTAIN GRAVEYARD 
 What a sleeping-place is here! 
 O vast mountain, grim and drear, 
 Though, throughout their life's hard round, 
 To thy sons, in long toil bound, 
 Thou from stony hill, and field
 Didst a scanty sustenance yield, 
 Surely thou art kinder now! 
 Here, beneath the gray cliff's brow, 
 Sleep they in the hemlocks' gloom, 
 And no king has prouder tomb. 
 Far above the clustered mounds, 
 Through the trees the faint wind sounds, 
 Waking in each dusky leaf 
 Sobs of immemorial grief; 
 And while silent years pass by, 
 Dark boughs lifted toward the sky 
 Like wild arms appealing toss, 
 As if they were mad with loss, 
 And with human hearts did share 
 Grief's long protest and despair. 
 No tall marbles, gleaming white, 
 Here reflect the softened light; 
 Yet beside the hillocks green 
 Rude, uncarven stones are seen, 
 Brought there from the mountain side 
 By the mourners' love and pride. 
There, too, scattered o'er the grass 
 Of the graves, are bits of glass 
 That with white shells mingled lie. 
 Smile not, ye who pass them by, 
 For the love that placed them there 
 Deemed that they were things most fair. 
 Now, when from their souls at last 
 Life's long paltriness has passed, 
 The unending strife for bread 
 That has stunted heart and head, 
 These tired toilers may forget 
 All earth's trivial care and fret. 
 Haply death may give them more 
 Than they ever dreamed before, 
 And may recompense them quite 
 For all lack of life's delight; 
 Death may to their gaze unbar 
 Summits vaster, loftier far 
 Than the blue peaks that surround 
 This still-shadowed burial ground. 
AFTER THE LAST LESSON 
 How wonderful he seems to me, 
      Now that the lessons are all read, 
 And, smiling through the stillness dim, 
      The child I taught lies dead! 
 I was his teacher yesterday— 
      Now, could his silent lips unclose, 
 What lessons might he teach to me 
      Of the vast truth he knows! 
 Last week he bent his anxious brows 
      O'er maps with puzzling Poles and Zone; 
 Now he, perchance, knows more than all 
      The scientists have known. 
 "Death humbleth all"—ah, say not so! 
      The man we scorn, the child we teach 
 Death in a moment places far 
      Past all earth's lore can reach. 
 Death bringeth men unto their own! 
      He tears aside Life's thin disguise, 
 And man's true greatness, all unknown, 
      Stands clear before our eyes. 
THE ROAD TO CHURCH 
 Rutted by wheels and scarred by hoofs 
      And by rude footsteps trod, 
 The old road winds through glimmering woods 
      Unto the house of God. 
 How many feet, assembling here 
      From each diverse abode, 
 Led by how many different aims, 
      Have walked this shadowy road! 
 How many sounds of woe and mirth 
      Have thrilled these green woods dim— 
 The funeral's slow and solemn tramp, 
      The wedding's joyous hymn. 
 Full oft, amid the gloom and glow 
      Through which the highway bends, 
 I watch the meeting streams of life, 
      Whose mingled current tends 
 Toward where, beyond the rock-strewn hill, 
      Against the dusky pines 
 That rise above the churchyard graves, 
      The white spire soars and shines. 
 Here pass bowed mem with blanching locks, 
      World-weary, faint, and old, 
 Mourning the ways of reckless youths 
      Far-wandering from the fold. 
 There totter women, frail and meek, 
      Of dim but gentle eyes, 
 Whom heaven's love has made most kind, 
      Earth's hardships made most wise. 
 Apart, two lovers walk together, 
      With words and glances fond, 
 So happy now they scarce can feel 
      The need of bliss beyond. 
 Gaunt-limbed, his shoulders stooped with toil, 
      His forehead seamed with care, 
 Adown the road the farm hand stalks 
      With awed and awkward air. 
 The sermon glimmers in his mind, 
      Its truths half understood, 
 And yet from prayer and hymn he gains 
      A shadowy dream of good 
 That sanctifies the offering 
      His bare life daily makes— 
 His tender love for wife and child, 
      And toil borne for their sakes. 
 Thus through the bleakness and the bloom, 
      O'er snows and freshening grass, 
 Devout, profane, grief-worn or gay, 
      The thronged church-goers pass, 
 Till, one by one, they each and all, 
      Their earthly journeyings o'er, 
 Move silent down that well-known road 
      Which they shall walk no more.
THE PATCHWORK QUILT 
 In an ancient window seat, 
 Where the breeze of morning beat 
 'Gainst her face, demure and sweet, 
 Sat a girl of long ago, 
 With her sunny head bent low 
 Where her fingers flitted white 
 Through a maze of patchwork bright. 
 Wondrous hues the rare quilt bears! 
 All the clothes the household wears 
 By their fragments may be traced 
 In that bright mosaic placed; 
 Pieces given by friend and neighbor, 
 Blended by her curious labor 
 With the grandame's gown of gray, 
 And the silken bonnet gay 
 That the baby's head hath crowned, 
 In the quaint design are found. 
 Did she aught suspect or dream, 
 As she sewed each dainty seam, 
 That a haunted thing she wrought? 
 That each linsey scrap was fraught 
 With some tender memory, 
 Which, in distant years to be, 
 Would lost hopes and loves recall, 
 When her eyes should on it fall? 
Years have passed, and with their grace 
 Gentler made her gentle face; 
 Brilliant still the fabrics shine 
 Of the quilt's antique design, 
 As she folds it, soft and warm, 
 Round a fair child's sleeping form. 
 Lustrous is her lifted gaze 
 As with half-voiced words she prays 
 That the bright head on that quilt 
 May not bow in shame or guilt, 
 And the little feet below 
 Darksome paths may never know. 
 Yet again the morning shines 
 On the patch-work's squares and lines; 
 Dull and dim its colors show, 
 But more dim the eyes that glow, 
 Wandering with a dreamy glance 
 O'er the ancient quilt's expanse; 
 Worn its textures are and frayed, 
 But the hands upon them laid, 
 Creased with toils of many a year, 
 Still more worn and old appear. 
 But what hands, long-loved and dead, 
 Do those faded fingers, spread 
 O'er those faded fabrics, meet 
 In reunion fond and sweet!
What past scenes of tenderness 
 And of joy that none may guess, 
 Called back by the patchwork old, 
 Do those darkening eyes behold! 
 Lo, the deathless past comes near! 
 From the silence whisper clear 
 Long-hushed tones, and, changing not, 
 Forms and faces unforgot 
 In their old-time grace and bloom 
 Shine from out the deepening gloom. 
MY BROTHER  
(1882—1903) 
 Dead! and he has died so young. 
 Silent lips, with song unsung, 
 Still hands, with the field untilled, 
 Lofty purpose unfulfilled. 
 Was that life so incomplete? 
 Strong heart, that no more shall beat, 
 Ardent brain and glorious eye, 
 That seemed meant for tasks so high, 
 But now moulder back to earth, 
 Were you all then nothing worth? 
 Could the death-dew and the dark 
 Quench that soul's unflickering spark? 
 Are its aims, so high and just, 
 All entombed here in the dust? 
 O, we trust God shall unfold 
 More than earthly eyes behold, 
 And that they whose years were fleet 
 Find life's promises complete, 
 Where, in lands no gaze hath met, 
 Those we grieve for love us yet! 
IN FULLER MEASURE 
 "Dying so young, how much he missed!" they said, 
      While his unbreathing sleep they wept around; 
      "If he had lived, Fame surely would have crowned 
 With wreath of fadeless green his kingly head; 
 The clear glance of his burning eyes had read 
      Wisdom's dim secrets, hoary and profound; 
      While his life's path would have been holy ground, 
 Made thus by all men's love upon it shed."
 Doubtless could he have spoken for whom that rain 
      Of teardrops fell, "How strange your sad words are!" 
      He would have said; "In fuller measure far 
 All that life gave to me I still retain; 
      Love have I now which no dark longings mar, 
 Fame void of strife, and wisdom free from pain." 
OCTOBER 
 O sweetest month, that pourest from full hands 
 The golden bounty of rich harvest lands! 
 O saddest month, that bearest with thy breath 
 The crimson leaves to drifts of glowing death! 
 In fields and lives, the fall of withered leaves 
 Darkens the glorious season of ripe sheaves, 
 For Life's fruition comes with loss and pain, 
 And Death alone can bring the richest gain.
BENIGNANT DEATH 
 Thanking God for life and light, 
      Strength and joyous breath, 
 Should we not, with reverent lips, 
      Thank Him, too, for death? 
 When would man's injustice cease, 
      Did not stern Death bring 
 Those who cheated and oppressed 
      To their reckoning? 
 Would not life's long sordidness 
      On our spirits pall, 
 If our years should last forever, 
      And the earth were all? 
 On us, withered with life's heat, 
      Falls death's cooling dew, 
 And our parched souls' dusty leaves 
      Their lost green renew. 
 Ah, though deep the grave-dust hide 
      Love and courage high, 
 Life a paltrier thing would be  
      If we could not die! 
THE UNRETURNING 
 If our dead could come back to us, 
      Who so desire it, 
 And be as they were before, 
      Would we require it? 
 Would we bid them share again 
      Our weakness, foregoing 
 All their higher blessedness 
      Of being and knowing? 
 For them the triumph is won, 
     The fight completed; 
 Do we wish that the doubtful strife 
      Should be repeated? 
 Would we call them from the calm 
      Of all assurance 
 To the perils that might prove 
      Past their endurance? 
 God is kind, since He will not heed 
      Our bitter yearning, 
 And the gates of heaven are shut 
      'Gainst all returning. 
WHEN A HUNDRED YEARS HAVE PASSED 
 When a hundred years have passed, 
 What shall then be left at last 
 Of us and the deeds we wrought? 
 Shall there be remaining aught 
 Save green graves in churchyards old, 
 Names o'ergrown with moss and mold, 
 From the worn stones half effaced, 
 And from human hearts erased? 
 When a hundred years have fled, 
 Will it matter how we sped 
 In the conflicts of to-day, 
 Which side took we in the fray, 
 If we dared or if we quailed, 
 If we nobly won or failed? 
 It will matter! If, too weak 
 For the right to strike or speak, 
 We in virtue's cause are dumb, 
 Some soul in far years to come 
 Shall have darker strife with vice, 
 Weakened by our cowardice. 
 Every struggle that we make, 
 Every valiant stand we take 
 In a righteous cause forlorn, 
 Shall give strength to hearts unborn. 
 When a hundred years have gone, 
 Darkness and oblivion 
 Shall our ended lives obscure, 
 But their influence shall endure. 
 Other eyes shall be upraised 
 To the hills on which we gazed, 
 And the paths o'er which we plod 
 Shall by other feet be trod, 
 While our names shall be forgot; 
 Yet, although they know it not, 
 Those who live then, none the less, 
 We shall sadden or shall bless. 
 They shall bear our boon or curse, 
 They shall better be or worse, 
 As we who shall then lie still, 
 Have lived nobly or lived ill. 
FALLEN LEAVES 
 Beneath the frost-stripped forest boughs, the drifted leaves are spread,  
 Vanished all summer's green delight, all autumn's glory fled. 
 Yet, gathering strength from that dead host, the tree in some far spring 
 Shall toward the skies a denser growth, adarker foliage fling. 
 Ah, if some power from us, long dead, should strengthen life to be, 
 We need not grieve to lie forgot, like sere leaves 'neath the tree! 
DECEMBER SNOW 
 The falling snow a stainless veil doth cast 
      Upon the relics of the dying year— 
      Dead leaves and withered flowers and stubble sere— 
 As if it would erase the faded past; 
 So on our lives does death descend at last, 
      Hiding youth's hopes and manhood's purpose clear, 
      And memories faint, to dreaming age most dear, 
 Beneath its silence, blank and white and vast. 
 The sun shines out, and lo! the meadows lone 
 Flash into sudden splendor, strangely bright, 
 More fair than summer landscape ever shone; 
      Thus, gleaming through the storm clouds, faith's clear light 
      Transforms death's endless waste of silence white 
 To beauty passing all that life has known. 
TRUST 
 I came, I go, at His behest, 
 So, fearing not and not distressed, 
 I pass unto that life unguessed. 
 Little the babe, at its first cry, 
 Knows of the scenes that near it lie; 
 Less still of that dim life know I. 
 But Love receives the babe to earth, 
 Soft hands give welcome at its birth; 
 And so I think, when I go forth, 
 There too shall wait, to cheer and bless, 
 Love, warm as mother's first caress, 
 Strong as a father's tenderness. 
TOWARD SUNRISE 
 When, in old days, our fathers came 
      To bury low their dead, 
 Unto the far-off eastern sky 
      They turned the narrow bed. 
 They laid the sleeper on his couch 
      With firm and simple faith 
 That cloudless morn would surely come 
      To end the night of death; 
 And thus they sought to place him where, 
      When life's clear sun should rise, 
 Its earliest rays might wakening fall 
      Across his close-sealed eyes. 
 Like a faint fragrance lingering on 
      Throughout unnumbered years, 
 Still in our country burial-grounds 
      The custom sweet appears; 
 Still, when the light of life from eyes 
      Beloved is withdrawn, 
 The sleepers' dreamless beds are made 
      Facing the looked-for dawn. 
 There, as the seasons pass, they seem 
      Serenely to await 
 The certain radiance of that Morn 
      That cometh soon or late. 
GOOD NIGHT 
 Dear earth, I am going away tonight 
 From your long-loved hills and your meadows bright; 
 I know I should miss you when I am dead 
 If a better world came not in your stead. 
 For the sweet, long days in your woodlands spent, 
 And your starry dusks, I shall not lament; 
 For greater than all the wonders you show, 
 O earth, is the secret I soon shall know. 
 Good night ! And now as I fall asleep 
 I give you the garment I wore to keep; 
 You will hold it safely till morning dawn 
 And I rise from my slumber to put it on.

VIRGINIA DREAMS
A Dream
I had a dream one winter's night,
It filled my soul with pure delight;
Ne'er ran my tho'ts in strains so sweet,
I'm filled with rapture to repeat.
Oh could I dream that dream again,
'Twould be a song, a sweet refrain;
Oh could I wake to find it true,
'Twould then my happy tho'ts renew.
Dreams, sweet dreams of the past,
Which o'er our lives bright shadows cast;
Yet, sometimes in their course they change,
And pleasure clouds they disarrange.
What disappointments we do meet,
In dreaming dreams, yea, dreams so sweet;
Joy and happiness flow in streams,—
We wake to find it but a dream.
What is this mysterious way
In which we think we spend a day,
Awakening ourselves amid delight
Finding out 'tis not day but night.
'Tis a fancy which o'er us does creep,
When in that state of rest called sleep,
The light of imagination which does beam
And form what we always term a dream.
A dream is a miniature life,
Often lived in a single night;
When pleasant, this tho't oft does gleam,
Oh could we live just as we dream.
When Daddy Cums from Wuk
Cum here, Mandy, what's you chewin',
Take dat bread right out yo' mouf,
Do you know what you'se doin'?
You'se de worry ob dis hous'.
Put dat bread right on de shef dar,
Case 'tis much as we kin do
To gib you bread at meal time
Till hard times is fru.
En Ike, you shet dat safe do'!
Take dat spoon right out dem beans!
'Member well, you git no mo'!
Y'all de wo'st chaps eber seen!
Yo' daddy'd be distracted
Ef he knowed jis how y'all eat,
Case it takes mos' all his earnings
Jis to keep you brats in meat.
Now, 'member well, you ebery one,
No br'ad between yo' meals you eat,
Beans nor 'taters, no not one!
Cabbage or bacon meat.
En, la sakes! here cums little John,
Mudder's baby boy,
Wid my ham bone under arm,
Lickin' it wid joy.
Gib it to mudder, honey,
Cum, let's wash yo' face;
Jane, you set de table,
And fix t'ings all in place.
Yo' daddy'll soon be in de do',
He'll be hungry, too,
Hurry, Jane, don't be so slow!
Ike, min' dar what you do!
Chillun, wash yo' faces,
Put on dem aprons new;
Be kerful, now, don't tar dem,
What eber else you do.
Gib me my linsey dress, dar,
Does you heah, my lad?
Yo' mammy mus' be lookin' good
When she meets yo' dad.
Jane, take de rabbit off de stove,
De hominy en 'taters,
En git dat smalles' chiny dish,
For de stewed tomaters.
Leabe dat gravy dish alone!
Mincin' in it on a sly,
La sakes! mussy me!
Who eat dat punkin pie?
You boys stop dat fightin'!
Sich noise I neber heahd,
Put de stools up to de table,
Not anodder word!
All de eatins minced in!
Dat's de kind o' luck
I seems to hab wid you kids
When daddy cums from wuk!
I Wish I Was a Grown Up Man
I wish I was a grown up man,
And then I'd get a chance,
To wear those great high collars,
Stiff shirts, and nice long pants.
I wish I was a grown up man,
Not too big and fat,
But just the size to look nice
In a beaver hat.
I'd wear the nicest vest and gloves,
And patent leather shoes,
And all the girls would fall in love,
And I'd flirt with whom I choose.
I wish I was a grown up man,
I'd try the girls to please,
I'd wear a long jimswinger coat,
Just below my knees.
I'd wear eye-glasses, too,
And wouldn't I look good?
I'd be the swellest dude
In this neighborhood.
Some day I'll be a man,
And have everything I say,
And give my heart to some nice girl,
And then I'd go away.
The V. N. and C. I.
Near the City of Petersburg,
As seen by the passers-by,
In the neighborhood of Ettricks,
Stands the V. N. and C. I.
A building loved by many,
Who've toiled within her walls,
And tried to respond with pleasure
To every beck and call.
Her situation is beautiful,
As loftily she stands
Facing the Appomattox,
So picturesque and grand.
Then in the month of September,
As the days glide swiftly by,
Students leave their various homes,
For the V. N. and C. I.
And ere many hours have passed
They're sheltered within her walls,
Their minds from pleasures cast,
To answer to her calls.
And for days, weeks and months
Earnestly they work,
On their different studies,
Trying none to shirk.
After the wintry days have passed
The birds sweetly warble and sing,
While students resume their daily tasks
They're told of the coming Spring.
And then on the campus green,
Of V. N. and C. I. may be seen,
Students who every day win fame,
Playing the many outdoor games.
Girls with tennis employed,
Always enjoy it much,
Boys with baseball o'erjoyed,
As with bat they give it a touch.
After a few years shall have passed,
And boys and girls have finished their task,
No more their faces will be seen,
Or voices heard on the campus green.
In various sections their lots will be cast,
Fond recollections they'll have of the past,
As days, months and years glide slowly by
They'll ever remember V. N. and C. I.
Old Maid's Soliloquy
I'se been upon de karpet,
Fo' lo, dese many days;
De men folks seem to sneer me,
In der kin' ob way.
But I don't min' der foolin',
Case I sho' is jis as fine
As any Kershaw pumpkin
A hangin on de vine.
I looks at dem sometimes,
But hol's my head up high,
Case I is fer above dem
As de moon is in de sky.
Dey sho' do t'ink dey's so much,
But I sho' is jis as fine
As eny sweet potato
Dat's growd up from de vine.
Dey needn't t'ink I's liken dem,
Case my match am hard to fin',
En I don't want de watermillion
Dat's lef' upon de vine.
Case I ain't no spring chicken,
Dis am solid talk,
En I don't want anything
Dat's foun' upon de walk.
Case ef I'd wanted anything,
I'd hitched up years ago,
En had my sher ob trouble.
But my min' tol' me no.
I'd rader be a single maid,
A wanderin' bout de town,
Wid skercely way to earn my bread,
En face all made ob frowns,—
Den hitched up to some numbskull,
Wid skercely sense to die,
En I know I cud'n kill him,
Dar'd be no use to try.
So don't let ol' maids boder you,
I'll fin' a match some day,
Or else I'll sho' 'main single,
You hear me what I say!
I specs to hol' my head up high
En always feel as free
As any orange blossom
A hangin' on de tree.
Thoughts
Had I the wings of a bird,
I'd make it a constant duty
To fly far above the earth
And gaze on it's wondrous beauty.
Had I the mind of a poet,
I'd always try to write
Poems of thrilling beauty
To fill some mind with delight.
I'd love to stroll in distant lands,
Among the rocks and rills,
And see the works of Nature's hands
And gaze on the distant hills.
I'd love to listen to the birds
That sing their songs of praise
And make some poor souls happy
In their saddest days.
It would be to my delight
To stand at the river side
And gaze on the placid water
As it slowly and playfully glides.
I'd love to write of the beautiful,
I'd love to write of the brave,
And read the minds of others,
And note their winning ways.
I would not judge the beautiful
By the beauty of their faces,
By suppositions or the like,
Or their pretended graces.
It brings to my mind once again
The maxim that I love,
And one of the sayings as of old,
"Beauty is that beauty does."
Krismas Dinnah
We's invited down to brudder Browns,
On a Krismas day,
To an ol' time Krismas dinnah,
So de imbertation say.
De deacons en der wives was dar,
De parson en his wife;
En all dem folks did sho' look good,
You kin bet yo' life!
De wimmin folks was dressed to de'f,
Wid ruffles en wid laces,
En har all hangin' down in curls,
Wid powder on der faces.
Der dresses had sich great long trains,
We stood back wid de res',
As dey marched into de 'ception hall,
To keep from steppin on der dress.
En de men folks wasn't fer behin',
I'se here to tell,
Dey was dressed, too, in der bes',
Lookin' kin' o' swell.
Dey wo' dese long jimswinger coats,
Wid big leg pantaloons,
High silk hats wid broad red bands,
En 'rived dar prompt at noon.
Dey wo' dem low-cut vests,
Wid great broad white necktie,
En each man wo' an eye glass,
Stickin' on one eye.
Ol' man Edmond Jones was dar,
Dressed jis like de res',
It w'ud hab tickled you so much,
To hab seen him look his bes'.
Him en ol' man Slyback,
Was an hour behin',
Dey was ol' an walked so slow,
Dey c'ud'n come in time.
Still, when dinnah time did come,
Dem two was in de line,
Marchin' to de chune ob music,
Keepin' ol' folks time.
Den dey stood up at de table,
Till de blessin' it was said,
At de tappin ob de bell,
Dey all did bow der heads.
Parson Reuben Jones was called,
To say de blessed wuds,
En as he 'gin to cle'r his throat,
His inmos' soul was stirred:—
"Heabenly Fodder look down on us,
En dis earfly blessin',
We thanks De fer dis possum roas',
All brown wid ash-cake dressin,—
''We thanks De fer dis sausage,
En squirrel cooked wid beans,
En all dis nice fried chicken,
Dese onions en dese greens;—
"En as we goes to eat it,
Wilt Dou be our frien',
To keep us all from dyin',
We ax dis, en amen."
De wimmen folks was helped fus',
To all de kins ob meat,
En den we men was helped,
As we sot dar in our seats.
Den we 'menced to eatin'.
Dat was a stuffin' time,
Case no one said a wud
To pass away de time,—
Jis' 'cept to ax fer eatin's,
Den in a quiet way,
Dey w'ud cle'r der throats
En hab a wud to say.
You talk about folks eatin'!
But neber in my rouns'
Has I eber eat up so much grub
As I did at brudder Browns.
De wimmen dey was near de stove,
En I tho't dat dey wud melt,
But dey jis kept on a' eatin'
'Till dey had to loose dey belts.
En when dem folks did git up,
Dat table was cleaned up right,
Possum carcass, chicken bones,
Was all dat's lef in sight.
The Negro Has a Chance
As my mind in fancy wanders,
While we figure on Life's stage,
While in queries deep we ponder,
O'er the past years ripe with age;
While sipping slowly from Life's cup,
And in tho'ts deepest trance,
This question often rises up,
"Has the Negro had a chance?"
'Tis true, they lived one life,
Thro'out the darkened age,
When 'mid events full of strife
They wrote upon life's page;
In darkest hours of the night,
Their soul would seem entranced,
Wondering if some time in life,
The Negro'd have a chance.
But now those days have gone,
And on Life's page are blank,
And sons of ages newly bern,
Are being placed in rank;
Just as they file in line,
To make a slow advance,
They read in front this sign,
"The Negro has a chance."
The doors are open wide,
That He may enter in,
And time ripe to decide,
Where in life he will begin;
And as he slowly turns Her page
He gives a quickened glance,
And sees in every avenue and age,
The Negro has a chance.
With outstretched arms the college stands,
And with inviting voice,
She gives the Negro Her demands,
To make befitting choice,
Of the station He would choose in life,
To make himself advance;
Now we've cleared away the strife,
And the Negro has a chance.
Our race needs fitted teachers,
Their knowledge to impart,
And elevated preachers,
With the work of God at heart;
Men whose noble work
Will have power to enhance,
Men who dare not shirk,
But bravely grasp the chance.
Then heed ye to this call,
Which means for a race success,
And what e'er may befall,
Bravely stand the test;
Let not fickle minds
Check your brave advance,
When every event shows the signs,
That the Negro has a chance!
The preacher needs your aid,
To help save Negro souls,
For the price so dearly paid,
That he may reach the goal;
He begs with earnest heart
That you lend a helping hand,
That in this work you take a part,
And heed the Lord's command.
The doctor gives a call
That you come into his field,
And as the sick and wounded fall
To their weakened voice you yield;
He sees your help he needs
As o'er his field he gives a glance,
And your steps he'll not impede,
But the Negro give a chance.
The lawyer opens up his book,
The leaves all dim with age,
And as he gives a steady look,
And turns from page to page,
He sees a page all blank,
And calls the Negro in;
Says he, "you fall in rank,"
In law you must begin.
The skilled mechanic works his way
As he performs his part,
He toils away from day to day
And well displays his art;
He loves his work with all his soul,
And in it he confides,
But soon before he's reached the goal,
The Negro's at his side.
The merchant takes his stand,
With ready merchandise,
He meets the world's demands,
And each day sells and buys;
But soon upon the scene
The Negro makes his way
And in the merchant's scheme
He, too, must have a play.
The carpenter now stands aside
To give the right of way
As slowly in the Negro glides,
Now he must have his day;
In carpentry he'll show his skill,
We may see this at a glance,
His soul with ecstacy does fill,
As he sees his future chance.
The tailor in his shop we find,
And as he cuts and sews,
He has his work upon his mind,
For the art in it he knows;
The Negro, too, has learned this art,
And so with weary brain
He toils away with earnest heart
That a living he may gain.
So, all these stations must be filled
As we journey on thro' life,
And we must struggle with a will
And aim to banish strife;
And when we've reached the topmost round
We'll send up notes of praise
To him our happy tho'ts resound,
To him these songs we'll raise.
And Negro, yea, of Africa's strand,
Ye strong men make advance,
We do of you make this demand:
With vigor grasp your chance!
Let not these happy moments pass,
But make good of each one,
And when you've reached the realms at last,
And work on earth is done,—
You'll soa 'mid scenes of beauty,
You'll live in seas of love,
When you've done your duty
To reach that land above;
And, Negro, be not far behind,
But on, yea, on, advance!
And when you've reached that dearer clime
You'll show you've had a chance.
De Day Befo' Thanksgibin'
Thanksgibin' day am now at han'
In my imagination,
I see de tuckies take a stan'
Aroun' de ol' plantation.
En jis befo' dis great, great day,
Dey form dey selves in line,
En in a sore o' serious way,
While one am markin' time,—
Dey marches 'roun de big hous',
De gobbler front ob line,
To sho' de folks dat dey aint skeered
Ef 'tis Thanksgibin' time.
De lady tuckies follows on,
En, my! dey puts on airs,
As ef dey neber min's dis worl'
Wif all it's toils en cares.
Dey's fixin' now to sho' off,
Case dis am de fus chance
Since dey's had much meat on der bones
Dat dey cud hab a dance.
De gobbler gibes a gobble,
Den all de tuckies prance,
I tell you way dey wobbles,
Dey knows sumpin' 'bout a dance.
De folks all in de big hous'
Am comin' to de do'
To see what de tuckies am about
Dat's causin' sich a sho'.
De ol' gobbler waits
Till dey git outside de do',
Now he's lafin to hisse'f,
Case dey gwine to hab a sho'.
De ladies ob de hous'

De tuckies gwine to run dem,—
Run dem sho's you born!
Quietly dey tries to strut
'Roun de ladies ob de hous',
While dey stans dar a grinnin'
To see what dey's about.
Soon de gobbler gibes a gobble,
En at de ladies start,
Ol' Missus, how she wobbles,
I hear de beatin' ob dey hearts.
Dey am makin' fer de hous',
Miss Carrie front ob line,
De odder ladies follow,
While de tuckies clos' behin',
Soon dey falls into de do'
In a sort ob mos'ac style,
De gobbler heads de list,
Dey a yellin' all de while.
Missus calls out, Dinnah!
Come here; come here! quick!
And kill this turkey gobbler!
Come and kill him quick!
En when I got dar, what a sight!
De ladies in a pile,
De gobbler pickin' wif his might
On Missus lubely chile.
I grab de gobbler by de nake,
Pull him fru de hall,
Tol' him take de las' view
Ob Missus lubely walls.
I took him to de wood pile,
Whar lay de cuttin ax,
En calls out, come here! Ephraim chile!
En gib dis boy a whack!
Tomorrow am thanksgibin' day,
En sho' as I is able,
Dis tuckey in some stylish way,
Will be on Missus' table.
Ephraim raises up de ax,
En wif all his might
He gibes de fatal whack
Dat takes de tuckies life.
En Missus says till yit,
As long as she is libin',
She neber will forgit
De day befo' Thanksgibin'.
The Story of Lovers Leap
[At Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, one of the famous resorts of the South, may be seen the historic Lovers Leap, which gave the inspiration for this poem.]
To the state of West Virginia,
During the Summer days bright,
Countless numbers are wending their way
To the Old Greenbrier White.
A famous resort of the South,
Which for years has held her fame,
And dame and sage of every age,
Honor White Sulphur's name.
'Tis here many lovers meet,
And stroll on her carpet green,
As the eve grows old, tales of love unfold,
And many just sweet sixteen.
Happy moments they do spend,
Yea! moments of delight,
As hearts in union blend,
They praise Greenbrier White.
Now for the places of interest,
Of one I'll venture to speak,
Which seems by far most visited,
Long known as Lovers Leap.
Where two lovers, once upon a time,
Whose love was true and tried,
Both with determined minds,
Ne'er to be denied,—
Climbed to this very high precipice,
Looked o'er the rugged steep,
Decided within a few moments,
To make the fatal leap.
Said they, "together we'll end our lives,
Rather than to part,"
Within their minds they did contrive
To make the fatal start.
All was quiet and undisturbed,
The hour was growing late,
For awhile they uttered not a word
As they tho't to meet their fate.
Their's was a love so true,—
Not for a day,—
Love that ever seems anew,
That never dies away.
This love began in childhood days,
As days so glided by,
They felt that for each other
Gladly would they die.
Perhaps many minds have wondered,
Why on this eve so late,
This maid and lad with hearts so sad,
Decided to meet their fate.
But the parents of this couple brave,
Firmly did object,
And tho't that both the lad and maid,
Their wishes should respect.
For a while o'er this they did bother,
Why think of the trials of life,
Now comes the words of our Father,
"Forsake all and cleave to thy wife."
Did it not seem hard for them to live,
Alone thro' the trials of life,
Could he on account of others give,
The dear one he wished to call wife?
No, "But together we'll strive to live
Or together we'll strive to die,
'Twill be a pleasure our lives to give,
And so with our wishes comply."
So, 'twas fully decided,
And on one evening late,
To the Leap they slowly glided,
The two to meet their fate.
On! on! to the fatal spot,
The couple made their way,
To bring to an end the plot,
Before another day.
As they reached the craggy edge,
The couple hand in hand,
Carried out their fatal pledge,
Their own, their last demand.
Side by side the couple lay,
Hearts that had beat as one,
Ceased upon that final day,
Their toils on earth now done.
And e'er since that gloomy hour
The story has not failed to keep,
It seems some magnetic power
Holds sway o'er the famous Leap.
Ne'er shall the hist'ry be forgot
By those who the story seek,
But ever famous will be the spot,
Well-known as Lover's Leap.
Why Should the American Negro Be Proud?
Why should the American negro be proud?
This question was asked in tones clear and loud,
The Negro who once was in fetters a slave
Now passes in freedom from birth to his grave.
Why should the Negro with eagerness yearn
For wisdom which teaches men how to discern,
Why should they with faithful hearts plead
Or yearn for wisdom that they may succeed.
Does not the same God who rules on high
Instill in the hearts of all mankind to try,
Is not the same God the Negro protector,
Why says, "Of persons I'm no respecter."
Then, should persons in ignorance plead
To know why the Negro wants to succeed,
When Nature's law in common states—
That human beings have similar traits.
The Negro for wisdom puts in a petition,
That intelligently he too may live;
That he may gain such recognition
That intelligence might give.
In ignorance they lived for years,
When they had not the chance to learn;
That ignorance to them bro't bitter tears,
And now for wisdom they yearn.
The best of this race make good their chance,
This story, schools and colleges tell,
Each year may be seen their steady advance
As their numbers in greatness swell.
Then should the American Negro be proud,
When each day he makes an advance,
As gradually he's moved away the cloud
Which for years denied him a chance.
Then, why not encourage him each day,
When he tries to make most of his life,
And live in a friendly feeling way,
Casting aside all malice and strife.
Would not life be a pleasure,
If the races would manifest
Such interest in each other
That none would advancement detest.
Would not our lives be glorious
If friendship ruled the land,
Making our efforts victorious,
Regardless of race or clan.
What will become of the Negro
When friendship's ebb is low,
What will make him a hero
In the midst of an embittered foe.
The Negro must learn, if he would improve,
And remove the many defects
Which cause other races to term him rude,
And for him to lose their respect.
Among the White race he has some friends
Who urge him onward each day;
Gladly a helping hand they lend
As he onward works his way.
Yet in the distance not afar
He sees a heavy cloud
Moving slowly o'er the land
Where Negroes are justly proud.
Will the storm's effect prove serious?
To know we can only wait;
For in ways almost mysterious
Sometimes comes a nation's fate.
Then, Negro, Oh! Negro, cease repining,
'Tis said each cloud has a silver lining;
Pray to the God who rules on high,—
He has the power to clear the sky.
It is He who rules the universe,
And guides it's affairs for better or worse;
All earthly affairs are in His hands,
The whole earth moves at His commands.
'Twas by His aid and thro' His power
The Negro has made an advance;
He aids them thro' their trying hours
That they might have a chance.
Should not the American Negro be proud
When he has been given a start,
And tho' he discerns some heavy clouds,
He should toil with an earnest heart.
Yea! toil with an earnest heart
And deeds of evil shun,
'Tis said that we're remembered
By all that we have done.
Then, Negro, toil on, act well your part;
Bravely stand the test;
Do your duty, be earnest at heart;
Believe what happens is best.
And when your task on earth is done,
And time for reward is at hand,
When at last the victory's won,
And you view yon happy land,—
In happiness, in boundless love,
You'll spend eternity in realms above;
After having stood the test,
You'll enjoy, above, the rest, sweet rest.
De Leap Yeah Party
Was you at de hall las' night,
To de Leap Yeah Party?
I reckon dat I was,
But didn't I eat hearty?
I wouldn't hab missed gwine dar,
Fo' sumpin purty fine;
Dem folks was sholy lookin' good,
En had one sumptious time.
En ebery which a way you went
About de day befo',
Some one was standin' at yo' fence,
Or knockin' at yo' do'.
Axin dese here questions:
Is you gwine out to-night?
What color is you gwine to w'ar,
Yaller, blue or white?
Is you gwine to twis' yo' hwar up high,
Or let it cum down low?
Is you gwine to walk dar,
How's you gwine to go?
En ob all de questions,

As dey met me wif upon de street,
En eben at my do'.
Till I jis took to thinkin'
As I walked aroun'
Dat dis would be de grandes' t'ing,
Dat eber cum to town.

En primpin' up to date,
Leaben all de wuk undone
Fo' fear dat dey'd be late.
En when I got into dat hall,
Goodness! what a sight,
De same as pictures on de wall
De folks did look dat night.
Cud'n tell ol' folks from de young,
Case all was lookin' gay,
Chattin' to der fellows
In a stylish kin' o' way.
En you better had been kerful,
Dar'd been one de bigges fights
Had you called eny body ol' folks
On dat Leap Yeah Party night.
Eben to de ol' men,
Who'd always had der canes,
To keep f'om fallin' in de streets,
Or slippin' in de rain,—
Had flung dem all away dat night,
En cum in struttin' too,
Wid long tail jimswingers on,
En I said, Who but you?
It wud hab tickled you so much,
'Til you on your knees wud fall,
Could you jis hab seed dem folks
A settin' in dat hall.
Like sardines in a box,
Dem folks was sholy packed,—
Hardly room to draw yo' breaf,
'Lieve me,'tis a fact!
De music it was playin', too,
Like ragtime at a ball,
De folks could hardly hold dey feet,
But de parson viewed dem all,—
En dey was skeered to move dem,
Or make a silent tread,
So dey kept time wid de music
By de bowin' ob de head.
When eatin' time did cum,
Dey all was at de table,
Puttin' 'way de grub,
As fas' as dey was able.
Gibin no tho't to dem aroun',
En not a wud dey said,
Stuffin' dey mouths wid chicken,
Tater salid, ham en bread.
De odder folks wid hungry looks,
Sot waitin' fo' der turn,
Hoping dar'd be sumpin' lef,
As dey gazed wid faces stern.
As dey finished ob der eatin',
Dey moved up f'om der places,
En turnin' dey did meet,
A number ob smilin' faces.
Now 'twas der turn to eat,
Sich a scrumagin' dey had,
En dem dat failed to git seats,
Did turn wid faces sad.
Dey soon got thro' der eatin',
Case de hour was growin' ol',
Dey heahd de clock a strikin',
En de mornin' hour it told.
Dey called out fo' der coats en hats,
Wid faces gay en bright,
En eber dey'll remember,
Dat Leap Yeah Party night.

Dat Mule ob Brudder Wright's
Dar's plenty t'ings to write erbout,
Bof in en out ob skool,
'Cept taken fo' a subject,
En ol' en stubborn mule.
But de one I specs to write erbout,
Ain't ob de stubborn kin';
A fus class critter out en out,
Beats eny mule in line.
At eny kin' ob wuk he's good,—
Kin put him to de plow,
Or take him out to haulin' wood,
He'll wuk from hour to hour.
Hitch him wid anodder mule,
Or let him pull alone,
Eny whar you put him
Dis ol' mule is at home.
You see him to de buggy,
In de mornin's cle'r en bright,
Put him to de cart,
It is his heart's delight.
Eny whar you take him,
He'll make hisse'f at home,
Eny whar you hitch him,
He'll stan' en will not roam.
Will I tell you who he 'longs to?
Sho, wid delight,
He is de splendid property
Ob brudder Henry Wright.
Dar's odder mules in town,
But none so gay en spry,
Hitch him to de sulky
En he kin sholy fly.
Not one lazy bone
Do dis mule posess,
In any kin' ob wuk
He kin stan de tes'.
Dar's plenty mules in town,
But none so out ob sight,
As dis thoro' bred Kintucky
Ob brudder Henry Wright's.
Dar's none wid no sich name,
Dat's trabbled on his way,
No, none wid no sich fame
As you read ob dem each day.
Dar's odder mules in town,
But none kin take de flight,
Or make a steady roun'
Like dis ob Henry Wright's.
Ef you wants to see some pacin',
Jis call on dis ol' mule,
When it cums to out right racin'
You'd t'ink he'd been to skool.
Dar's plenty mules aroun',
But none no whar in sight,
Not eben in dis town,
Like dis ob Henry Wright's.
No odder mule in town
Does know de roads so well,
No matter what you take him
Dis mule can always tell.
He likes to wuk in sunshine,
He likes to wuk in rain,
At night or eben day time,
He always seems de same.
He neber jumps out ob de road,
When de 'mobiles cum his way,
Eny whar he has a load
Dis mule aint 'fraid to stay.
Nuffin cud'n skeer him,
At night or eny time,
A match fo' dis ol' mule
Wud be hard to find.
Dar's odder mules in town,
But none no whar in sight,
Dat sho cou'd win de crown
Like dis ob Henry Wright's.
Sometimes
Sometimes the days seem dark and dreary,
We wonder what is life;
Sometimes of work we soon grow weary,
All pleasures seem but strife.
Sometimes of aiming we grow tired,
And finally give up all,
Leaving the mind once inspired,
Heedless to a call.
Sometimes we give no thought to those
Who in some way we might aid;
Sometimes others' pains and woes
Are at our mercies laid.
Sometimes if we'd stop to think
And count the good deeds we do
To help those on Poverty's brink
We'd find them to be few.
Sometimes a good act we might render
By saying some kind words,
To those whose hearts so tender
By kindness has ne'er been stirred.
Sometimes 'twould help us to resolve
That each day while we live,
Some difficult problem we will solve,
Or aid to others give.
And thus instead of wondering,
And making all efforts strife—
Instead of always pondering,
To find out what is life,—
By our actions, by the deeds we do,
Each day while we live,
Let them be many, or let them be few,
We make life what it is.
To See Ol' Booker T.
Way down Souf whar de lillies grow,
Is the lan' I wants to see,
En to dat lan' I specs to go,
Jis to see ol' Booker T.
I specs to take my faithful mule
En hitch him to de cart,
En fo' dat famous cullered skool
I's gwine to make a start.
I'll take a box and pack my lunch
En start wid my ol' mule,
Case I know 'twill be a long time
Fo' I reach dat Cullered Skool.

But sing en feel so free,
Jis longin' fo' de day
To see ol' Booker T.

Wont gib out on de way,
Befor' I reach dat skool,
Case I tell you dat wont pay.

Ain't no lad, you see,
But befo' I leabes dis lan'
I mus' see Booker T.
So I pray de Lawd to keep
Bof me en my ol' mule,
En spar us till we git
To dat Cullered Skool.
En gib our eyes de light,

Dat Alabama lan' so bright,
En dear ol' Booker T.

Case I heahed he'd been to sea,
En all de fer off lan's did roam,
Dis same Booker T.
Dat eben kings en queens so great
Did strive to shake his han'
En welcome Booker T.
To der native land.
Now, you know he mus' be great;
Well, I's gwine dar to see,
En ef I git dar soon or late,
I'll ax fo' Booker T.
Dey say dat is de bigges' skool
De same as eny town,
En neber was so many chaps
Eber seen aroun'.

En how to write en read,
En figger in de 'rithmetic,
En ebery t'ing you needs.
Dey teaches you to plant de co'n,
En eben how to plow;
I tell you, man, as sho's you born,
I'm on my way dar now.
En when I near dat skool,
En all dem chaps I see,
Dey better had keep cool,
En not make fun at me.
I sho' will bus' der heads,
Case my only plea
Is dat fo' I's dead
I mus' see Booker T.
Right in his office I will go,
En dar I'll take a seat,
En ax fo' Booker T., you know,
En res' my w'ary feet.
I'll tell him I has jis now 'rived,
From ol' Virginny lan',
En took dat long en lonesom' drive
To shake his willin' han'.
En dar I'll set en look at him,
En he will look at me,
En fo' my eyes get dim.
While I kin cl'erly see.
I'll take his gracious han'
Widin my trimblin' grasp,
En praise de Lawd I reached de lan',—
I's finished up my tas'.
"I's seen dis great, great cullered man,
I's ready now to go;
You've done a great wuk in dis lan',
Is why I lubs you so."
So now my eyes I clos' to res',
I's happy, yea, so free;
I's took de journey, stood de tes'
En seen ol' Booker T.
Dedicated to Dr. W. H. Sheppard
[The returned missionary, who spent twenty years in Africa.]
On, on to the darkest continent,
As the Adriatic sailed,
In Eighteen Hundred and Ninety,
Many sad good-byes were wailed.
When two brave sons left their homes,
Their kindred, yea their blood,
To wade in Africa's unknown,
And overwhelming flood.
A caucasian and a negro,
United heart and soul,
Bound for Ethiopia's soil,
Yea Africa's distant goal.
As from the New York shore
The steamer slowly starts,
Sheppard and Lapsley bade good-bye
To sad but anxious hearts.
On, on, as the steamer glides,
'Mid the rippling water's whirl,
On to the wild and savage land,
The darkest in the world.
Yet, in that darkened land
Were millions, yea unfed,
Who never had been told
Of Christ the living bread.
But God had sent a message,
To these men so brave,
To go in Ethiopia's land,
And try these souls to save.
Gladly they heeded His command,
To go 'mid danger and strife,
And work in that distant land,
Yes, at the cost of life.
And so in Ethiopia's wild,
These two men so brave,
Prayed for Ethiopia's child,
Struggling a soul to save.
For weeks, yes, months they struggled,
Working day and night,
Until at last, how happy,—
There came a ray of light.
One soul had come to Christ,
One made to understand,
The blessed Savior's voice,
And heed to His command.
These leaders true and brave,
Prayed to Him on high a prayer,
To thank Him for this blessing,
And for His tender care.
But ere many months had passed.
There came a sad, sad day,
A cloud o'er Africa's land was cast,
For one had passed away.
A leader now was gone,
One whom they did love,
Rev. Lapsley had been called
To that home above.
His comrade also missed him,
For he was left alone,
To dwell in Ethiopia's land,
Afar from friends and home.
A work he had left unfinished,
Which he had resolved to do,
But Sheppard decided by God's aid
To carry the work on through.
So he started out one day,
With Africa's savage band,
Determined to make his way
To the Forbidden Land.*
Months they spent on the way,
To carry a ray of light
To Heathen who knew no day,
In a land where all was night.
After toiling daily,
With Ethiopia's sons,
Many were brought to Christ,
A victors crown was won.
They built a house of worship,
And toiled day after day,
Soon Ethiopia's sons
Had learned the narrow way.
They, too, began to preach,
And teach their fellowmen,
And for these blessings great
Their prayers did upward blend.
And in this land so dark,
Where never had been light,
The lame, in Christ, were made to walk.
The blind were given sight.
To Sheppard they gave great praise,
He'd ventured on their soil,
And Ethiopia's sons had raised
Thro' years of earnest toil.
For twenty years he struggled,
In Africa's darkened land,
Giving them the light
As they heeded his command.
Way off in Africa's land,
Let us in fancy look,
To see a heathen band,
Who'd never seen a book,—
Now preaching Christ and teaching,
With minds all free and bright,
All Hail to thee, oh Sheppard,
Who carried them the light.
A great work thou hast done,
To thee we give great praise,
Many laurels thou hast won
For thy remaining days.
De Wintah Styles
Come in, Aunt Jemima,
Oh no,'taint wof while,

To go into dem stores,

De same as eny queen.

En on dey hats ol' tuckey tails,

Dey's settin' back a lookin',
En waitin' fer de chance.
Den de Lawd will say "enuf,"
En take dem up on high,
Whar he kin set de fashions
To rule dem in de sky.
Ambition
When e'er we enter Life's open field,
Or life's duties are at hand,
When e'er to Necessity's voice we yield,
Or heed to her just commands.
'Tis then we need that power,
Which will aid us most in life,
And in every trying hour,
Will serve to banish strife.
'Tis then we need to exercise,
Those emotions of the soul,
Which will help us in our efforts rise
And reach Life's distant goal.
'Tis then we need to cultivate,
'Mid trying conditions,
Powers that will elevate
As real ambition.
Ambition to help the old in life;
Ambition to aid the young,
To lift from hovels, banish strife,
And aid every one.
To be an aid in every task,
And every petition,
As long as life shall last,
Cultivate ambition.
Christmas Times
When are the children all happy and gay?
When do they ne'er grow tired of play?
When do their mouths seem like bells in chimes?
It is the merry Christmas times.
When do the little boys all get good?
And bring in coal and cut all the wood,
And every command of their parents mind,
'Tis just a week before Chistmas times.
That is the time when all of the work
Is done without a grumble or shirk.
The little boys then ne'er turn and twist,
When mother says, "Son, come here and do this."
Let the word be said, he's at her command,
Not once does he frown, or attempt to stand,
But goes at her bidding, happy and gay,
For it will soon be Christmas day.
And then old Santa, thro' all the snow,
Will come to those who've been good, you know;
Down the chimney he'll come and will not stop,
Till he fills each stocking full to the top.
When his task is o'er he takes his stand
Gazing at little ones in Dreamland,
Who in that land, all happy and gay,
Their minds all fixed on Christmas day.
And in a few hours, with merry hearts,
Little ones out of their warm beds dart,
All happy and gay, hearts full of cheer,
To see what's been bro't by Santa dear.
How happy is each little mind,
When every stocking full they find,
And presents scattered on the floor,
How could they ever ask for more?
No, no, but for many a year,
Christmas time to them will be dear,
And e'en in their prayers they make a pause
And ask many blessings on Santa Claus.
De Men Folks ob Today
Ob all de subjicts I kin read,
Or reason on so well,
De one I cum tonight to plead,
Is de one I likes to tell.
'Tis all about dese men folks,
Who's losin' all dey sense,
You needn't look at me and sneer,
Case it's a lack fer common sense.
Dey's done los' all dey manners, too,
En nebber rais' de hats,
Dis losin' sense, jis thrills me thru',
Dey's wo's den eny chaps.
Why, when I was a comin' up,
En I aint so ol' as yit,
De men folks didn't seem sich bluffs,
En neber had sich fits,—
As de men folks ob today,
Puttin' on sich style,
In der hiferlutin' way,
Goodness, 'taint wof while.
Case when you courts de wimmen,
Dey don't lub you fo' yo' clo's,
Dat wud be a sinnin',
En ebery body knows.
Dey lubs you fo' yo' winnin' ways,
En not fo' dressin' fine,
Lub fo' clo's dese days don't pay,
Is what's been on my min'.
You stylish dudes who's settin' roun',
Ef you wants to marry,
Take off dem stylish frocks en gowns,
Use common sense, don't tarry.
Put on some good ol' wukin' clo's,
En git yo' se'f a job,
En don't be hangin' 'roun each day,
Wid some lazy mob.
You take dis good advice,
You, Dick, Tom en Harry,
En soon you'll hab a wife,
Ef you wants to marry.

So I jis dressed to-night fo' him,
Case he seems to lub me so,

But hates to tell him so.
So I'se gwine out to-night
To sho' my lub is tru';

Yo' soul, it seems to rise,
Till you see de angel throngs

'Twould tak' a 'mence big scroll
To sum up what dey teach.
Dey sings de nices' songs

As I goes from do' to do'.
Dey makes big speeches, too,
En dey soun' so bery high,

Dwellin' in de sky.

Superstitions
I ain't superstitious,
But dis I sho' do know,
Dat ef a rooster walks his se'f up
En crows right in y'o do',
Dar's sho' someone a comin'
Say jis what you might,
Dar'll be a stranger at yo' hous'
Fo' de cumin' ob de night.
I ain't superstitious,
But dis I know is tru',
Say what you will, en do what you'll do;
Ef yo' lef' han' itches,
You may t'nk it funny,
But you sho' soon gwine er git
A little sum ob money.
I ain't superstitious,
'Tis ignance I'll vow,
But sho's you're born,
Dis is tru' some how,
Dat ef you starts a place,
En has to turn back,
En fo'gits to make a cross,
En spit right in yo' track,
Some bad luck sho' will follow,
Dis t'ing sho' is tru',
Ef you don't believe me,
I tell you what to do:
Jis go some whar fo' fun,
En den turn back to see,
Some bad luck sho' will follow,
'Tis tru' as it kin be.
I ain't superstitious,
But I tell you what I've seen,
Ef you eats at a table
What dar's jis thirteen,
You min' what I say,
As sho's dar's a sky
One ob dat thirteen
Will be sho to die.
I ain't superstitious
But here's annoder fact,
En dis t'ing sho is tru'
No matter whar you's at,
Dat if you starts a place
En a black cat crosses you
'Tis sho en sartin bad luck
No matter what you do.
I can't be superstitious
En sho I ain't to blame
But if you cum in one do' ob de hous'
En don't go out de same
Your min', it sho is bad luck,
You kin turn dis way en dat
But bad luck sho will follow
No matter whar you's at.
I ain't superstitious
But some t'ings I do know,
Ef you sweeps yo' hous' out arter dark
'Tis bad luck fo' you sho,
En please don't spill no salt,
It jis as sho is tru'
Dat sumpin's gwine to happen,
Min' what I say, too.
I ain't superstitious
But I tell you fus en las'
It sho is awful luck
To break a lookin' glass;
Bad luck fo' seven years
Is de title read;
Dat sho is one t'ing dat I fears—
One t'ing dat I dread.
I ain't superstitious
But dis ain't no lie,
Ef a bird flies in de hous'
Dars some one gwine to die;
'Tis jis as true as it kin be
En when you see de bird
Some one's gwine to leabe dat hous',
Case die am de word.
I ain't superstitious
But let yo' lef' eye quiver,
Trouble sho will follow,
You jis well 'gin to shiver;
En let yo' lef' foot itch
'Tis jis as tru' fo' sho,
You jis well pack yo' satchel,
Case on strange lan' you mus' go.
I ain't superstitious,
But dis I sho do know,
In de ebening arter dark
Ef you hears a rooster crow
Hasty news am cumin,
'Tis tru' as it kin be,
En you jis well wa'r a long face
En set en wait to see.
I ain't supersitious,
It's ign'ance, 'tis a fact;
It jis sho's, too,
Dat fo' 'telligence you lack,
But when settin at de table,
La sakes! don't sneeze,
It's a sho sign ob death,
Say what you please.
I ain't superstitious
En eberybody knows
Dat I ain't superstitious
Eny whar I goes,
But y'all sho kin tell
En read between de lines,
I ain't superstitious
But I do beliebe in signs.
Poet of Our Race
[Dedicated to the memory of Paul Laurence Dunbar.]
Oh, Poet of our Race,
We reverence thy name
As thy hist'ry we retrace,
Which enfolds thy widespread fame.
We loved thee, yea, too well,
But He dids't love thee more
And called thee up with Him to dwell
On that Celestial shore.
Thy sorrows here on earth,
Yea, more than thou coulds't bear,
Burdened thee from birth
E'en in their visions fair.
And thou, adored of men,
Whose bed might been of flowers,
With mighty stroke of pen
Expressed thy sad, sad hours.
Thou hast been called above,
Where all is peace and rest,
To dwell in boundless love,
Eternally and blest.
And, yet, thou still dost linger near,
For thy words, as sweetest flowers,
Do grow in beauty 'round us here
To cheer us in sadest hours.
Thy thoughts in rapture seem to soar
So far, yea, far above,
And shower a heavy downpour
Of sparkling, glittering love.
Thou, with stroke of mighty pen,
Hast told of joy and mirth,
And read the hearts and souls of men
As cradled from their birth.
The language of the flowers,
Thou hast read them all,
And e'en the little brook
Responded to thy call.
All Nature hast communed
And lingered, yea, with thee,
Their secrets were entombed
But thou hast made them free.
Oh, Poet of our Race,
Thou dost soar above;
No paths wilt thou retrace
But those of peace and love.
Thy pilgrimage is done,
Thy toils on earth are o'er,
Thy victor's crown is won,
Thou'lt rest forever more.
To Professor Byrd Prillerman
[President of West Virginia Colored Institute. ]
Dar's a skool in West Virginny,
Dat I hears dem call de Farm,
Whar dey raises ebery t'ing to eat,
En has de bigges' barns,—
Whar de ho'ses en de cows,
In restin' spend de night,
And w'ar away de hours,
To dey own heart's delight.
'Tis dar dey teaches eberyt'ing
In de wuken line,
As much as folks kin well take in
Upon de common min';
Dey l'arns you how to cook,
Dey l'arns you how to sew;
In fact, dey teaches eberyt'ing
Dat you wants to know.
Has you eber seed de president
Ob dat skool, de Farm?
De man who bosses eberyt'ing,
From de skool room to de barn;
I tell you he's a great man,
To meet him you kin see
De 'telligence beamin' from his face
As blossoms from a tree.
He's hammered on de chillun's heads,
Fo', lo, dese thirty years,
Poundin' knowledge in dem
'Mid dumbness en 'mid fears;
He's bro't dem from de dunce stool
Ob ignance en disgrace,
En trained dem in his skool
To lead folks ob de race.
He's one de oldes' teachers,
In West Virginny State,
En what dat man don't know
Ain't worthy to relate;
So, when you wants to go to skool
To be sho to l'arn,
Go to dat Cullered Institute
Dat some folks call de Farm.
Sister Johnson's Speech
I went to chu'ch, 'tother night,
De silvah moon was shinin' bright;
Brudder Johnson en his wife was dar,
Dey went wif Jane en me en ma.
Sister Johnson, she jumped up to speak,
She said dat sinners ought to seek
To git the 'ligon ob de soul
Dat shined out in dem bright as gol'.
She said dat sinners ob dis day
Tho't so ob dress en looked so gay
Dat when it cum de Lawd to seek
Dey hearts and souls was pow'ful weak.
En, too, so Sister Johnson said,
De Lawd He am de staff en bread;
He feeds de soul, en fills it, too,
En makes you eber feel anew.
She said, you little gals en boys
Who sets in chu'ch en makes a noise,
You needs to come into de fol'
En git de 'ligon ob de soul.
You needs to fix yo' soul up new,
You better min' what I say, too,
You frisky little gals and boys,
Who likes to set and make a noise.
Sister Johnson she speaked what she know'd
Case she has trabbled on de road,
En speaked to folk in crowded hous',
Where chillun set jis like a mouse.
She's speaked to folks in cities, too,
En towns en villages a few;
She tol' dem 'bout dey low disgrace
En tried to raise folks ob de race.
She says she means to set a zample
En gibe you folks a little sample
Ob how to serve de Lawd outright,
In mornin' or de darkes' night.
De Lawd He made de shinin' moon
To light you fru dis worl' ob gloom;
He made de sun to shine fru day
En light you on de narrow way.
He made dis worl' so cle'r en bright,
He made de darkness ob de night;
He made de grass to look so green
En de snow dat 'pears so white and clean.
En, brudders, as I now do speak,
My voice am gitten low en weak,
But I hopes my talk will be a blessin'
En dat from it you'll l'arn a lesson.
En as I goes from place to place,
I'll try to raise folks from disgrace,
En soun' my notes in cleares' tones,
Befor' I takes de train fer home.
I'll let dem know I takes my stan'
Fer 'spectability ob de lan'
En ef dey still keeps on der ways,
A mighty fog I specs to raise.
James Hugo Johnston
On a hill near Petersburg,
Facing the old historic town,
There lives a model Negro—
One who's won renown.
A man we should be proud of—
President of a school;
He holds full sway in his modest way,
Of reserved and dignified rule.
'Tis just such men the world needs,
One whose record stands
Unblemished by a darkened deed,
Clear, wavering thro' the land.
Live on, thou brave and honored sire,
That many thy paths may retrace,
To keep them from the deepened mire
Of folly and disgrace.
Live on, thou noble son of Ham—
On, on, thro life's rugged ways;
With steps clear and unfaltering,
Deserving of thy praise.
The Strawberry
At first we see the tiny leaves
And no one at their coming grieves,
But watch so eager each day and hour
For the coming of the little flower.
Each day, then, to the strawberry bed
The feet of little ones do tread
And around the bed they gather soon,
Watching for the strawberry bloom.
The little blossoms so sweet and small
They watch until each petal falls;
How happy they feel, then; oh, how merry,
When they find the first strawberry.
Happier beings were never seen
As they gaze on the little berry green,
With happy hearts and faces strange,
Wondering when it's color will change.
After a few days shall have passed
Still resuming their daily task
To the strawberry bed again they tread
To see who can find a strawberry red.
And as they find them, how happy at heart,
As strawberries in their little mouths dart;
Romping about, full of frolic and glee,
With little mouths full as they can be.
Soon they leave the strawberry bed
After eating all the berries red,
Thanking God, and Heaven above,
For the little berries that they love.
As We Sow We Shall Reap
As we go about the toils of life,
As we witness each day, it's burdens and strife,
Thinking not of days of the future or past,
Knowing not where in life our lots may be cast,—
'Tis then in life's broad and fertile field,
In tho'tlessness to fate we yield;
Not deeming it wise our tho'ts to cast
On any works or deeds of the past.
Still tho'tlessly we struggle along
Amid Life's great and fearless throng;
Thro' darkened caves, o'er rugged steeps,
Thinking not that as we sow we reap.
But later on, when years have flown,
And of life's cares we've weary grown,
'Mid silence, tho'ts in our minds do creep,
That as we've sown, we now do reap.
We think of our heavy burdens and cares,
It seems to us more than we can bear;
It pains our heart, we utter a groan,
Yet, we're reaping what we have sown.
Oh, if we only could blot out the past,
And e'en it's memory in some sea cast,
Oh, could we but live this life again,
Such burdens would not on our minds remain.
But now our eyes are dim with age,
We near the last line of life's page,
We'll seal it's contents with a groan,—
Reaping—reaping what we have sown.
Before your eyes grow dim with age,
You, who are on Life's busy stage,
Each day you labor, do mindful keep,
That as you sow you will surely reap.
What's de Use ob Wukin in de Summer Time at All
What's de use ob wukin in de Summer time at all,
When de sun am bilin' hot en de sweat begins to fall;
What's de use ob diggin' in de fields ob co'n en 'taters,
Plantin' squash en beans en pickin' ripe tomaters.
What's de use ob pickin' in de field's ob huckleberries,
Or pullin' at de trees, pickin' off de cherries;
What's de use ob wukin or plowin' in de heat,
Eatin' ha'f-cooked meals en blisterin' yo' feet.
What's de use ob habin houses in de summer time,
'Tis plenty good out doors when de blessed sun do shine;
When de fields is clothed wid green, de meadow en de lane,
You need no kin' ob shelter 'cept in fallin' ob de rain.
'Tis mighty hard a wukin when de sun am beamin' down
En not a spot ob coolness to be seen aroun',
When ebery way you turn, de sun am shinin' hot,
En ebery inch ob flesh am a bu'nin' spot.
'Tis mighty hard a walkin' in fields ob turned up groun',
For miles en miles a plantin', out ob hearin' ob de town,
A sowin' ob de wheat or plantin' ob de co'n;
It sho is bitter meat en hard wuk sho's you born.
'Tis fearful hard a-stayin' in de field de livelong day,
When de hours am slowly passin' en you hab so long to stay;
En you wuk so bery hard when you stop you hardly know
De way to take fer home dat wont seem kin' o' slow.
But arter t'inkin' ober all de change is got to cum,
I spec's I'll take de Summer, wid all de shinin' sun;
Case when de winter sets his foot upon dis naked earf,
He brings about much sadness to take de place of mirf.
Den de hard times cum a peepin' en a movin' in fer sho,
Sho'in' ob his grinnin' teeth, knockin' at yo' do';
'Tis den he tries to rob yo' ob trunk en clo's,
En soon you fin' yo'se'f a-settin' out ob do's.
De chills dey soon cum ober you, you fin' no whar to go,
As you wander 'long about de street en seek from do' to do';
No wuk to do, no shelter, not a crus' ob bread to eat,
No good warm clo's to sooth' de chill, no shoes fer naked feet.
'Tis den I see de use ob wukin in de sun,
It matters not how hot, no day I'll eber shun;
'Tis den I see de need ob plantin' wheat en co'n,
En puttin' up fer winter, 'tis a fact, as sho's you born.
'Tis den I know de need ob drappin' squash en 'taters,
Plantin' beets, en plantin' beans en pickin' ripe tomaters;
'Tis den I see de good old need ob pickin' huckleberries,
En pullin' down de limbs a-gatherin' ob de cherries.
For all dis helps, I tells you, when Winter cums wid col',
En starts His round ob freezin' en starvin' many souls;
It keeps away old hunger when He cums wid starin' face,
En leabes you a sufferin' en starvin' in disgrace.
En now I'll tell you one en all, de Summer time am hot,
I'd sooner be a little warm den freezin' 'bout in spots;
I'd radder be out in de field when de sun an beamin' down,
En wuk de blisters on my hand as I make a weary round.
I'll take ol' Summer any time on my list fer sho,
Den fool wid winter in His wrath when He knocks upon de do';
I'll take de heat en sweat en plant de fields ob co'n,
Radder'n face ol' Winter's breff in de coolness ob de morn.
No day will eber 'pear so long, no field so bu'nin' hot,
But what I'll plant de co'n en fill in ebery spot;
No idle moments will I spar' but days ob earnest toil,
To sho de blessed benefits ob wukin in de soil.
Case Summer time to me am dear en 'tis den I spec's to wuk
En ef I has de time to spar' 'tis Winter time I'll shirk;
I'll try to 'scape His freezin' days en b'ar me burdens free,
Take Winter time in all His ways but Summer time fer me.
The Lost Teddy Bear
Well, Teddy, I have found you,
It's been one week to-day
Since I missed you, Teddy dear,
While in the yard at play.
I wandered far and wide,
And knew not where to go
To find you, Teddy, dear,
But, oh, I missed you so.
I know some naughty boy
Stole you, dear, from me,
And if I only knew
Who that boy could be,—
I'd scold him, yes, I'd scold him,
And I'll just bet he'd not dare
To interfere again
With my dear little Teddy bear.
And, oh, you were so nice and clean,
One would scarcely know
That you were the same little Teddy
Lost one week ago.
But still I welcome you, my dear,
And will wash you nice and clean
And try forget that you were lost
And believe it all a dream.
So, again I embrace you, Teddy,
For I love you just the same,
And tho' you look so dirty,
'Twas the boy, you ain't to blame.
Meal Time
Liza! call dat chile
En make her wash her face
En cum on to de table
So Pap can say de grace.
You let de chillun hab der ways
And soon dey'll manage you,
Ef you don't try to check dem,
Come on, Bob en Sue!
Yo'all set up to de table,
'Twill take a ha'f a day
To get y'all to yo' meals,
Cumin in dat way.
Don't make sich noise wid dem stools!
Does you hear me, Jane?
Ef 'twarn't fer we ol' folks
You chillun wud raise Cain.
Set up straight dar, Jimbo!
We all is ready, Pap!
Stop dat whisperin' Lisha!
En pull off dat air cap.
Yo' all cud'n sho keep still
'Till Pap cud say de grace;
I don't know what's gwine to cum
Ob dis young cullud race.
Sal! git de spoon en git mo' hash—
Don't spill it on de flo';
Take up all de co'n cakes,
I t'ink Pap wants some more.
Abe, don't stuff yo' mouf so full,
You sho kin git some mo';
Be kerful wid dat buttermilk—
Don't spill it on de flo'.
En pass de cakes aroun',
Don't t'ink all'bout yo' self;
Try to l'arn some manners,
You ugly little elf.
You kids done eat enuf!
Git up from dat table
En clean dem dishes up
As fas' as you is able.
En you sweep de kitchen good,
Be quick about it, too;
'Twill be time fer anodder meal,
Befo' you chaps git thro'.
Dedication Day
[Read at the dedication of the new Mt. Zion Baptist Church, Staunton, Va.]
What means this vast assemblage here,
Of people great and grand,
Who've come to us from afar and near,
At the heed of one's command.
Why come ye to Mt. Zion's walls,
Ye folks in grand array?
"We've heeded to the pastor's call,
'Tis Dedication Day."
List! hear ye not those songs,
Which pour forth streams of love?
It seems that some angelic throng
Has sent them from above.
Why are these souls with music stirred,
What means all this, I pray?
Can it be you haven't heard,
'Tis Dedication Day?
The work of a hand is finished,
The toil of a day is done,
One's labor is diminished,
Yet a great work to be done.
We stand 'mid beauty and splendor,
And gaze on these sacred walls,
While our hearts many thanks do tender,
To Him who dost heed our calls.
You've struggled, yea, toiled unceasing,
To complete a glorious work,
Each day new efforts increasing,
Daring not shrink nor shirk.
Part of your toils are at an end,
And part, yea, just begun,
As your feeble efforts blend,
In love to the Holy One.
And now you have assembled here,
'Mid efforts good and great,
With happy hearts, minds full of cheer,
A gift to dedicate.
To dedicate, means to give to God,
And may He who inspires us to live
And trod each day earth's lowly sod,
Instill in us power to give.
And as we our minds in holiness lift,
We offer to Him above,
A sacred, yea, a noble gift,
In high honor of His love.
For 'twas He who gave you power
To erect this building grand,
A monument to tower,
A glory to this land.
Let all unite in these songs,
Yea, your feeble voices lift,
And help this mighty throng,
To dedicate this gift.
And thank your God above
For the true-hearted leader sent;
He's led seven years in love,
Calling sinners to repent.
He's toiled for Mt. Zion's daughters and sons
That they might a true people be,
That they live in love to the Holy One,
Has been his prayer and constant plea.
'Tis Moses He sent to lead you,
That you heed His gentle command,
He'll lead you safely thro',
Till you've reached the promised land.
A man inspired by God,
He a noble work has done;
He'll reap his just reward,
When the harvest time has come.
And to Mt. Zion's daughters and sons
I pray that your life may be,
An emblem of the Holy One,
From strife and malice free.
And may the good Savior above,
Bless this congregation great,
As they in prayers and songs of love,
This building dedicate.
And to all who've helped in the cause,
You've won for yourself renown;
I pray you abide in His laws,
He'll add many stars to your crown.

ROSARY OF FANCIES
The Sculptor's Vision
A sculptor musing sat one eve,
When crimson clouds began to weave
Their sunset drapery in the sky;
Cold was his studio and bare,
But golden sunbeams lingered there,
And robins caroling flew by.
A vision on his dreaming broke;
With parted lips and eyes that spoke,
A statue stood of beauty rare,
And chiseled with such exquisite care,
It seemed no mortal hand had share
In what was like embodied prayer.
The sculptor woke to find his dream
Of loveliness was but a gleam
Of what the future might unfold;
And then resolved to labor late,
Until his work his dream could mate,
And daily carved with joy untold.
But sometimes sorrow mingled there,
For naught he fashioned could compare
With that chaste form which ev'ry night,
Would come to give him impulse new,
To bid him seek the pure, the true,
And lead him to a clearer light.
Nor wrought the sculptor all in vain;
The statue grew despite his pain,
In curves of beauty, strength and grace;
And so he loved his magic art,
His very soul seemed to impart
A something human to the face.
Yet was the vision fairer still;
Its subtle presence seemed to fill
The space before his troubled gaze.
It beckoned him to heights unknown,
And charmed him like the undertone
That floats through many olden lays.
And on he toiled from hour to hour,
Exerting all his skill and pow'r,
With fondest love and trust and prayer;
But as the work in beauty grew,
Strange longing haunted him anew:
For lo! his ideal was more fair.
As in his strife, is it not thus
That we are baffled, all of us,
In seeking clearer, truer light?
Then let us, like the sculptor, still
Pursue our toil with deathless will,
Advancing toward a glorious height.
And when our ideal grows more fair,
More earnest should be all our care
To carve with added grace and skill;
And then the task that we pursue,
Will serve to give us impulse new,
Our souls with calm content to fill.
Fancy and Imagination
Golden mists o'er Cloudland wreathing
Arabesques of shining sheen,
Sunny airs of violets breathing,
Lure weird Fancy, Cloudland's queen.
Lo! she hastens, flower-encircled,
Dainty, pensive, winsome fay,
Her fair brow all rose-empurpled,
While around flutes pour soft lay.
There is she--Imagination!
Gazing upward in her dreams;
Rapt, intent on meditation,
Sculpturesque, yet thrilled, she seems.
Planets lure her in their spaces,
Stars strew gold dust on her path;
She has looked them in their faces,
And a hint divine she hath.
Rare pellucid hues of dawning,
Iris tints of summer skies,
Streak fair Fancy's couch; glad Morning
Bids her ope her lovely eyes.
Wind-songs quaint Eolus showers
Round her home of golden mist;
Sweet she sings them in her bowers,
And the Silence harks, I wist.
All the pomp of constellations
Wakes Imagination's gaze;
World apart in meditations,
Sits she living wondrous days.
She can hear the chiming measures
Of the stars with stately tread,
The celestial strains she treasures,
Rev'rently she bows her head.
Tired heart! when life is dreary,
And the years drag slowly on,
Summon airy Fancy, weary
Is she never, hear her song!
Soul unresting, tossed with sorrow!
Just one strain of harmony
From Imagination borrow,
Calmest joy she'll yield to thee.
Repose
On every height there lies repose--Goethe.
An angel with a voice like summer show'rs,
Or woodbird melodies in tranquil hours,
Brought me one day a wondrous, radiant rose
Called in those happy isles but this: Repose.
Its fragrance was the balm of early flow'rs,
Fresh with the magic of the Spring's new pow'rs;
Its petals quivered with a soothing trill,
Like the soft murmur of a mountain rill.
Its hues were exquisite as dawning skies
When the first splendor greets the watcher's eyes,
Or as the sea-shell seen through silver spray,
Or as the last bright tint of fading day.
The angel said: "Not now may this thine be,
I only came to offer it to thee;
Not as a gift but as a hard-earned meed,
I give it to all those who feel its need."
One moment fast I held it, and a light
Like to an aureole, gleamed golden-white
O'er all around; while blended echoes clear,
Stealing in unison, fell on my ear.
"How may I gain this priceless flow'r?" I cried.
The angel in a flute-like voice replied,
"Neither by works nor penance, prayer nor pain,
Canst thou this rare celestial flower gain.
"But when love of mankind and duty flow
In one all-perfect song, one golden glow,
When purest echoes soar from purest aims,
Then will I come once more to head thy claims."
The angel vanished on a sunlit cloud,
But still his words were speaking to me loud.
I bowed my head, resolved to claim the rose
Called in those happy isles but this: Repose
The Mist Maiden
Is it an idle fantasy,
That in the twilight's violet gloom,
When waves are singing out at sea,
And shadows fill the room,--
The mist assumes before my gaze,
A human form of exquisite grace,
And by the melancholy haze,
Is veiled a peerless face?--
A maiden loved when life was new,
Her soul was trust, her eyes a prayer;
She faded quite. Can it be true
I see her in the air?
Her eyes are crystals, dropping tears,
Her hair reflects the silver moon;
Will ecstasy or sudden fears
Conquer my heart more soon?
She stands in statuesque repose,
A chiseled vision, calm and fair;
She smiles: my full heart overflows,
The maid dissolves in air.
May's Invocation 
After a Tardy Spring
With her buskins tipped with dew,
Came a fair, enchanting fay,
Tiptoeing the forest through;
Who was it but smiling May?
Wide she waved her sylph-like arms,
As with Dian's grace she ran,
Laden with a thousand charms.
Then to urge her plea began:
Lilies, lilies! come, wake up!
Ring your dainty, perfumed bells.
Hasten! yellow buttercup!
Rouse! throw off Dame Winter's spells.
Sweet-faced pansies, wake from dreams!
Raise your melancholy eyes.
They are veiled too long, it seems;
'Tis no time for reveries.
Come shy violets, and ye,
Bonnie daisies! why so late?
Look! the sunbeams kiss the lea,
Do not longer drowse and wait!
Ay! the Sunshine is my knight
Who has lavished all his gold
For you laggards. What a plight
That ye grasp not wealth untold!
Now she stayed her speech to shed
Fom her curved horn nectar rare,
On each willing, waiting head;
Then resumed her wistful prayer.
Swallows, robins, orioles!
Tender thrush of liquid lay,
Why not here? the breeze-harp rolls
Far, inspiring tones to-day.
Bobolink, O tarry not!
See! the twigs are edged with green;
In the meadow there's a spot
Dear unto thy heart, I ween.
Doves from out your downy nest,
Coo, O coo a matin soft;
Just a hint of life's unrest
Echoes through your music oft.
Lark! I languish for thy note;
Where in hiding may'st thou be?
With thy silver-cadenced throat
Lead the Springtime's minstrelsy.
Flow'rets, flow'rets, warblers, haste!
April came with languid call;
Not a moment can ye waste!
Wake ye! wake ye! wake ye all!
The Poet's Ideal
"Spirit! what art thou erecting
On the heights of contemplation,
Where the vistas blue and shadowy,
Fade in airy clouds away?
At the fane of meditation
Art thou bowed to-day?"
"Lo! I climbed in floating ether
When the first tints of the dawning,
O'er the pale stars chaste in grandeur,
Shed a stream of liquid light;
In the azure calm of morning
Gleamed a vision bright.
"Twas air-fashioned: faint, dissolving,
Seemed its statuesque proportions,
Yet imperious and majestic
Were its gestures and its mien;
And all beauty seemed distortions
To this,--fairest ever seen.
"Round its head a circlet shaping,
Wove a cloud its golden tissues,
Where these words were writ in splendor:
'Ideal Beauty is my name;
I from life draw finest issues,
Wouldst thou do the same?'
"Poised aloft on heights serenest,
There she stands,--that radiant vision.
At the fane of meditation,
Wouldst thou know, O questioner?
Lo! I bow in calm decision,
Yield my thoughts to her.
"'Mid the vistas blue and shadowy,
'Mid the ether iris-tinted,
I erect Ideal Perfection,
And then worship at her shrine;
To the poet she has hinted
Sense of things divine."
The Perfect Orchestra
Up to those heights where angels rest,
Where dreams and yearnings unexpressed
Mount like the mist of day,
Ascends a solemn symphony
Soft gliding through the ethereal sea,
From mortal realms away.
Men moved by ecstasy or pain,
Conscious of all life ne'er can gain
Or rapt in visions fleet,
Musicians are: but through the hush
Of harmonies transcendent, rush
Hints of the incomplete.
On instruments unlike they play;
Some wake the lute with gentle lay,
Some touch the viol's string,
While others with unconscious art,
From the sad organ's deep-toned heart
Accents all soothing bring.
The noble thoughts, the earnest prayers
Of ev'ry one that meekly bears
The tangled skein of life,
Each holy prompting unto good,
Great aspirations oft withstood,
Yet cherished 'mid the strife,--
And truth that, like the lily's bowl,
Glistens with dew within the soul
And balmy fragrance show'rs,
Hopes that have made earth seem so glad,
Loves irresistible though sad,
Like brilliant thorn-clad flow'rs,--
These are the chords that beat and throb
Through the dream-quiet, like a sob
Tremulous with complaint.
As slow they flutter toward the goal,
Rare coils of mystery unroll
Melodies pure and quaint.
"Unheard this strange, imploring psalm,
Save by some pensive seer, who calm
Leans on his dripping oar;
Safe-anchored on an island far,
Where life's unrest, its fev'rish jar
Can trouble nevermore.
To him in peaceful waves it comes,
Soft as the silver river hums
The silence to beguile.
From contemplation of the stars
Just peeping through the sunset bars,
He turns to list a while.
But angels on those heights sublime
Where naught save unison can climb,
Bend eager, loving ears;
Glad in mankind such good to see,
For there the music soareth free,
Piercing the spangled spheres.
Responding to this asking song,
This mystic music heard so long,
They lend their sympathy,
Which through the concord softly floats,
Like to a flute's clear, trilling notes
Heard on the moonlit sea.
The orchestra more perfect made,
The strains mount up where streets inlaid
With rare mosaic wind;
One cadence still is missing there,
The sweet Eolian's trembling prayer
No soul on earth could find.
Ascending near the radiant throne,
Sorrow pervades the music's tone,
Sorrow ne'er heard before;
Its quiver stirs the asphodels
And roses, where the streamlet wells,
Encircling all the shore.
God, who alone translates our pain,
Listens and gives unto the strain
His benediction calm;
And quickly that mysterious boon,
Like an Eolian's wind-played tune,
Makes perfect all the psalm.
Wood Carols
When woods are odorous at eve
With violet perfume, and are fair
With leafy vistas stretching far,
Tinged by the golden air,
The mirrored clouds come down to catch
The warbling of a thousand streams;
And music weird like chords confused,
Heard in unquiet dreams,--
Floats through the arches from the clear
Wind-harps astir among the trees,
While in lone depths the nightingale
Trills soothing melodies.
Doves tenderly the prelude coo
To plaintive anthems yet unsung,
And leaves respond with dreamy sway,
That late all passive hung.
Waves of tremolo sweetness make
The warm air palpitate with sound,
Until the woods are quivering
With music all around.
Each note enfolding one more soft--
Of some enchanting whole a part--
Wakes the unuttered harmonies
Of ev'ry restless heart.
When undertones of strange unrest
Within us moan like babes in pain,
Come nightingale of silver song,
And trill thy sweetest strain.
When thought lies gently on the soul
Like dew impearled upon a rose,
Come tender doves of cadence rare,
And lull us to repose.
A Dream of Elfland
Sweet elfin music comes to me,
Across a glen embowered deep,
In rugged green. What fantasy
Did give it voice--like dreams in sleep--
Through fluted winds? An airy flood
Of cadences, dainty and soft
As rose leaves flutt'ring to the sod,
Enfolds the sense and feelings oft.
Through what air-woven lyres blow
The winsome elves? Chords interlaced
In sweetest rhythm lull me so,
Surely Titania must have graced
That weird rehearsal. Did they sup
On drowsy poppy flowers, ere
They sent vibrations o'er the strings,--
A breath of music, passing rare?
The elves, they strike such witching strains
They lull sad Sorrow fast asleep;
What heart is torn, what soul complains,
While they each sense in music steep!
Unwind your sylvan symphonies,
Ye weird musicians, breeze-like play,
Until your dulcet harmonies
Waft us to magic isles away.
Dawn's Carol
Fair Morn unbars her gates of gold;
Night's shadows lie, a thousand fold,
Upon the hills, the purple mist
By pure Aurora's radiance kissed,
Becomes a dream of color: now
Uplift the heart and bare the brow.
Such moments for us seem to weave
Hope's loveliest tissues; we perceive
The soul's illumination, caught
From some fair mood of Nature fraught
With harmony of sight and sound,
In majesty diffused around.
On the Picture of a Child
Sweet child amid the apple boughs,
How tenderly life looks on thee!
And Mother Nature brings her gifts,
Yes, e'en the loveliest that may be,
To tempt thy innocent regard.
How blue the heavens smile above!
How crimson is the rose's depth!
How beaming is the glance of love,
Resting on thee, thou sportive fay;
Thou learnst new lessons 'mid the leaves;
All golden-lettered is the page
The flitting sunbeam deftly weaves.
Do fairies hang their glow-worm lamps
To light thy path adown the dell?
And does the lily in the vale,
To thee ring soft her magic bell?
The violet, and what brings she
To scatter o'er thy charmèd way?
Delicious perfume; and the lark
Prolongs his note to cheer thy day.
There is a radiance in thine eyes
That well disarms all vague unrest;
Thou hast few yearnings undefined,
Thy childish griefs are soon confessed.
Prayer in thy soul is simple trust,
And love is all thy life, sweet child!
The woodbird's song is not more free,
His artless lays more undefiled
Than thine. Thy sunny countenance
Is naught save gladness, yet we know
The thoughtful years come on apace;
After Spring's green, the Winter's snow.
And for thee, tender one, we ask
That when the hours of trial near,
As come they must, undaunted thou
Wilt dare to meet them without fear.
And that the dew within thy soul,
Of innocence and rev'rent love,
May be as fresh as now, until
Thou wear'st a crown of light above.
A Dream Within a Song
The schooners with their pale green lights
Glance up and down the river;
I clasp my hand in Memory's own
And hush my heart's sad quiver.
Glad twilight birds chirp overhead,
And soft their gray wings flutter;
We pluck rare purple grapes, sweet friend,
And loving words we utter.
Wan statues stare in gardens fair,
Proud in their cold beseeching;
I stretch my hands to grasp a prize,
Too far off for the reaching.
The thrush sits lonely on a spray
Hard by a pure white flower;
I hear a strain, oh deadly sweet,
Float, swan-like, through the bower.
The breeze has sped on noiseless wing,
The river's restless growing,
The singer greets us on this bank,
With music round him flowing.
The trees with red leaves garlanded,
The river's banks are shading;
I call the singer, but alas!
He, phantom-like, is fading.
One silver star has crowned the eve,
Closed are the drowsy flowers;
I clasp my hand in Memory's own,
And leave these fatal bowers.
Song
O sweet, sad, singing river,
Why dost thou chime forever
In answer to my weary heart's unrest?
Wilt thou not be confiding,
Or is thy music hiding
Some sorrow that can never be confessed?
O melancholy river,
Why do thy young leaves quiver
So plaintively along thy silent shore?
Are they some bird lamenting,
That for a while consenting
To warble to them, now far off would soar?
O sweet, sad, singing river,
My heart cannot dissever
Itself from tender hopes that round it cling.
O lily-crownèd river,
Love, though discrowned forever,
Wears lilies the enchanted Past will bring.
A Picture
Her ringlets glistened like the gold of morn,
And framed an oval outline statue fair,
Save where a shell-blush lingered for awhile,
Sending its ripples to the wavy hair.
Upon her features grace had shed its charm,
And in her smile sweetness to naught gave way;
'Twas like a streak of sunshine thrown across
The motionless repose of early day.
No sorrow rested on the calm, pure brow,
But thought held undisputed empire there.
Eyes like the dusky blue of evening skies,
Gazed in a dream or in a quiet prayer;
And through her aspect something noble shone,
That proved the soul to charity had grown.
Sunset Picture
The Sun-god was reclining on a couch of rosy shells,
And in the foamy waters Nereid's tinkled silver bells,
That lent the soft air sweetness, like an echoed seraph song,
Floating with snowflake hush the aisles of Paradise along.
The Sun-god wove bright flowers, gold and purple in their hue,
And to the smiling Nereids tenderly the blossoms threw;
The sapphire seas were shadowy, like an eye with dreamy, thought,
Where all the soul's mute rapture, a prisoned star, is caught.
The billows' rainbow splendor, like a strange, enchanting dream,
In fading, softened slowly to a trembling pearly gleam;
And soon the wondrous Sun-God, and the Nereids and the sea
Had vanished; one gray-tinted cloud alone remained to me.
An Idyl of Spring
The air, the dream-inspiring air
Is floating, flutt'ring all around;
Delicious waves of pent-up sound
Gush forth like some long cherished prayer.
         The woodlands gleam
         With many a stream,
         The skies are blue,
         A promise new.
Wake heart! Hope hastens with the Spring!
Aerial pinions waft her near;
A fairy palace crystal clear,
Round which the rosy sunbeams cling,
         Cannot compare
         With castles fair,
         She builds at morn
         By clouds upborne.
In greenest vales the lily wakes,
The violets in the breezes share,
And oh! the strange, enchanting air
Through pipes fantastic music makes.
         And we so free,
         By reverie
         Are caught in chains
         Of exquisite pains.
O treach'rous, dream-inspiring air!
Yet wherefore mar the joy it brings?
Do we complain when the bird sings,
Because his song dies on the air?
         Like mist our dreams
         Vanish, it seems,
         But they were sweet,
         Although so fleet.
A Group of Musings
I
Sunrise Thought
Aurora gazed from out her shell-pink bower,
And down the aisles of light sent a fair Hour
With roses in her dainty hands, and hark!
A lark's sweet trill disarms the twilight dark.
II
Noonday Thought
The tranquil waters slept 'neath Nature's smile,
Watched by the sunlit skies, as, free from guile,
The tender infant sleeps, while o'er its bed
The mother, yearning dreamer, bends her head.
III
Sunset Thought
The crescent moon with silver sheen aglow,
Was set in the far skies, a chiseled bow;
And in the western courts, what riot rare
Of magic hues and tints beyond compare!
IV
Starlight Thought
Vistas between the shadowy pines were bright
With scintillating stars, and all the night
Was claimed by Reverie; rapt 'neath her spell,
Thoughts come to us whose charm no tongue can
On a Nook Called Fairyland
Is't here the fairies haunt the place,
And o'er the green with witching grace
Trip to the merry roundelay?
Is't here the shepherd pipes his note
Where fair the water lilies float,
And plaintively the pine trees sway?
This is a value of dreams: anigh,
In dreamy cadence flutt'ring by,
Soft woodland murmurs grow apace.
The clouds so pure, drift there on high,
Repose seems gazing from the sky
With wistful beauty in her face.
Yes, this is fairyland! but where
May be the sportive elves who share
This sylvan solitude? To-day
No footstep lingers on the green,
The quiet song of waves, I ween,
Echoes no more the roundelay.
Life is not spent in Fairyland;
The Spirit that this beauty planned,
Gave each a duty to fulfill.
We may, light-hearted, like the fay,
Sing gladsome songs from day to day,
If we fail not to do His will.
On the Concord River
Under the hemlocks Fancy came
And took me in her tender arms;
She sang her sweetest, calmest lays,
And wrapped my spirit soft in balms.
Her chaste aerial form was clad
In shining vestments, and her tread
Was still as snowflake music; e'en
The lily did not bow her head.
Her eyes with misty splendor gleamed,
Shining like fountains in the sun;
She comes,--breath of music sweet,
To tune my life to unison.
Beneath the hemlocks folded close
In Fancy's tender arms, I lie,
And drifting, dream enchanted dreams,
While soft the river murmurs by.
Cloud Fantasy
I floated on a cloud one day,
An amber cloud, whose rhythmic sway
Held all my senses in a dream.
I saw the trembling vesper stars
Clinging and peeping through the bars
Of purple-gold and pearly gleam.
'Mid silver spaces caught in air,
Floating upon the cloudlets fair,
While swinging were the rhythmic cars,
Soft rapture did my senses greet,
A music tremulously sweet,--
The harmony beyond the stars.
Suspended in the ether there,
My spirit uttered voiceless prayer
To the great Being of the Light.
As darkness came star-vistas oped,
My soul that erst in shadows groped,
Rose tranquilly from height to height.
Invocation to the Muse
Take it not back! the priceless gift!
The joy that all my heart would thrill,--
Creation's ecstasy in forms
Which a mysterious soul did fill.
Has Fancy drained her silver rills,
And hushed her tuneful birds the while?
Imagination stayed her flight,
Poised on near hills to wait the smile,
That bids her, with the arrow's speed,
Dart past the clouds in ether far,
Nor pause, till faint with ecstasy,
She chants, lured by some chanting star?
Where is the strange, celestial lyre
O'er which my willing soul would play?
Give back once more, the golden lyre,
I would be thine alone to-day!
Comes not the incense from the fire
Upon thine altar lit, O Muse?
There lies the votive offering,
Wilt thou the sacrifice refuse?
I bring this morn the liquid dew,
Caught from Aurora, as she flung
Her benison of dainty light
O'er skies where shad'wy curtains hung.
I bring the music caught from hearts--
Strange minor chords, sad yet so sweet,
Which pain has seared with ceaseless clasp,
And gladness with a clasp so fleet.
I bring the music caught from souls
A flame with hope and deepest love,
And kissed by Life with throbbing lips
Into the peace of calmest dove.
Is not the offering complete,
With complement of joy and pain?
Transformed into a stream of light,
It floats,--harmony again.
I raise my eyes imploringly,
Come, holy Rapture, as before!
I kneel in supplication mute,
Oh! be the gift but mine, once more!
'Tis mine! 'tis mine! the altar glows!
The lyre quivers, touched by thee,
O Muse benignant! Low I bow,
Wrapped in a veil of mystery.
Before thy fane on sacred hills,
My daily orison I'll pour;
I have thy promise, gracious Muse,
Mine is the gift forevermore!
The Vision of Eve
When from the gates of Paradise fair Eve
Turned her reluctant steps with saddest mien,
A sense prophetic stayed her blinding tears,
And thus she yearning cried, her sobs between:
"Could I but see adown the coming days!
Yet, though I may not win that boon, alas!
One question haunts me with resistless charm,
What will my daughters be when æons pass?"
She bowed her head, then as with rev'rence spoke:
"A hope has seized my spirit, e'en though late
It cometh. Ay! and will my fault be less
By what they may achieve of good or great?
Are all my cherished longings to be vain?
I cannot know what grander purpose lies
Beyond the misty verge that bounds my view."
She ceased, with supplication in her eyes.
Again we see the Mother of mankind,
Yet not discrowned and mournful as of yore;
From amethystine battlements she leans,
Wide-eyed with wonder and admiring awe.
Far past the planets, past the swinging stars,
Past worlds on worlds that spin in ether there,
Her glances wander to the circling earth,
Lying below swathed by the purpling air.
Lo! what is it she sees? Forms like to hers,
When erst she paced fair Eden's flow'ry courts;
But on each brow there sits a something new,
A something mystical. Is it the thoughts'
Deep impress which the centuries have left?
The seal of alternating joy and woe,
Of care and grief, anon of hope and love,
Marked by the ages as they come and go?
And ever on and on the glances rove
Of our first mother. Now the marble yields
In Eve-like contours 'neath the skillful touch
Of one; another well the sceptre wields;
And one self-poised, regnant in dignity,
In philosophic councils holds the sway.
Upon the battlefield, one kneels to stanch
The crimson life-blood as it ebbs away.
And thus the dreamer spoke: "Are these my kin,
And has the world so grown since those sweet days
In glorious Paradise when Time was young?
Are these my daughters who with sweeping gaze,
Can scan the sheeny Heavens for a sign
Of God's deep wisdom writ upon the skies?
Are these indeed my children, all my own?
What strange, enchanting visions meet my eyes?"
She hears the rhythmic strains of one who caught
The Muse's most majestic melodies;
The lofty heights, the shining altitudes
Her latest children climb, with pride she sees.
"Ah! my prophetic hopes were not in vain,"
Cried Mother Eve with eager eyes aglow;
"Yet could I dream of this when Time began?
The deeds my daughters dare I could not know."
She paused, and soon her rapt soliloquy
Died like a zephyr o'er a leafy lawn;
She gazed once more from jeweled battlements
Far down the firmament, e'en as the Dawn
Blushed in the east; and when the magic hues
Began in music warfare to engage,
Throughout the spheres a chiming measure thrilled,--
The vibrant music of the newer age!
Ode on the Twentieth Century 
(A Dream-Prophecy)
   What seer is this,
Who gazing calm athwart the deep
Where pent-up storms and thunders sleep,
   Nothing can miss?
O'er sweeping with his falcon glance vast tracks,
Chaotic, dim, mysterious.
   What lacks
His prescience brooding o'er a cycle new?
What vaster view
Saw ever seer of eld wrapped in a trance?
What pageant more majestic to enhance
His spirit's yearning mood?
   To distant caves
   The mighty ocean laves,
To airy grottoes, where the lightning wakes,
His searching glance is sent.
Serene, absorbed, attent,
He meditates;
Forecasting what may be in days unborn--
Days that with sunrise freshness all impearled,
   With wings unfurled,
Pause to alight upon a waiting world.
"What may they bring us, Seer?
   Unto thy vision clear
   Is all revealed?
What of those mystic spheres
   Th' unfathomable years
So close have sealed?
What cult is taught in Venus?
   Shall we know
Whether there come and go
Fair mortals on that soil unknown,
To manly stature grown?
Are hearth-fires kindled on that planet-isle,
And o'er the sacred pile
Does incense rise to some Divinity?
Look closer, Seer, and see!"
O the wonder of the vision!
O the marvel of the sight!
What shores and streams Elysian!
What scenes with splendor dight!
The seer is rapt: enkinled
His brooding glance has grown;
Then solemn made he answer,
With myst'ry in his tone.
"I grope: the scales are yet
Upon my asking eyes;
Forebodings of surprise
My spirit seize; then let
Naught rude disturb my consecrated mood.
*          *          *          *          *
"'Tis come! 'tis come! the vision grows apace!
The scales have fall'n, and behold! I trace
   Wonders sublime;
   The scroll of Time
With deeper mysteries will be o'er-writ.
"The world is spanned by bridges
Builded of rainbow rays;
O'er foam and wat'ry ridges,
They glitter, glitter to the moon.
They'll lead the foot full soon
To dwellings past the Pleads,
To Cassiope's bright seat.
A thought! and lo, we gaze
Amid a planet's haze.
Could motion be more fleet?
"And harken! Down the chiming spheres
To list'ning ears,
An anthem comes from Jupiter's vast plain--
A matchless strain.
   "A message from a star!
   Harness the winged car
With other steeds than any seen before.
Why heed our lagging pow'rs?
   Star-wisdom will be ours;
E'en in a flash of thought
   Intelligence be brought,
   Undreamed of lore.
I see a hall of weird magnificence,
All studded o'er with scintillating gems
Of rarest lustre; 'tis a temple whence
Flows wisdom like a river; nothing stems
The rushing of its richly freighted waves.
Lo! 'tis on Saturn's isles where stately stands
That gleaming hall, and countless student bands
Are flocking thither in air-chariots brought
To learn the subtlest thought
   Of star and planet lore,
   All unrevealed before.
"Wisdom from worlds erstwhile beyond our ken.
Stupendous! marvelous! what deeds of men
Evoke this guerdon? Lo! the Deity
Makes man-to praise
His boundless majesty.
These works beyond compare
   His signet bear.
And all the alchemy of Earth's vast depths,
Magic in coruscating jewels hid,
Secrets but vaguely hinted by the winds,
Marvels beneath the Ocean's wavy lid,
Have yielded to man's craving; myst'ries sealed!
Since sun and moon and stars from Chaos wheeled,
   Are now revealed.
"I cease to gaze. I cannot struggle more
With mighty sights and sounds that wingèd come
From space illimitable, and my eyes
Grow misty 'neath th' effulgence. I am dumb.
I cannot fathom what so near me lies--
Wonders unseen, unheard, unknown before."
The curtains falls again, the quest is o'er.
MEDITATIONS
The Hour's Glory
(Suggested by Emerson's Essay, "Works and Days.")
Each hour has some glory all its own,
Some silver lull of streams unheard before,
Some glimpses rare of Nature's loveliness,
Some song with sweetness newer than of yore.
Each hour waiting spirits, Peace and Hope,
Stand near us if we wave them not away;
Each hour questions haunt us, bearing balm
Imprisoned in the potent yea or nay
Each hour is a Sibyl, weird and strange,
Of eye prophetic and of backward glance;
Each is a restless bird checked in its flight,
A whisper that will nevermore entrance.
Each hour souls may catch celestial pæans
Of subtle meaning, stealing from afar;
As when through shad'wy deeps of purple skies,
In voiceless harmony star follows star.
Each hour may gain beauty from the Past,
And with the Future's coming glory gleam;
But in the light of this, all radiance fades:
Each hour is a Truth and not a Dream.
Reverie
The brook glides on to the river,
The river glides to the sea;
Each seeks for a broader channel,
For broader channels, we.
If we throw the tiniest pebble
From the fringed, sylvan shore,
The river in widening circles
Flows onward,--so calm before.
The zephyr softly trembles
The glist'ning waves along;
The gentle drip of the rain drops
Makes sweeter their quiet song.
Word-pebbles flung by the heedless,
Will ripple the calmest life;
But the kindly hints of friendship,
Like zephyrs, soothe the strife.
And the priceless tears that only
From sympathy can flow,
Like raindrops, cool the fever
Of the troubled waves below.
The brook glides on to the river,
The river glides to the sea;
Each seeks for a broader channel,
For something more yearn we.
For a fuller, deeper knowledge
Of the mystery life enfolds,
That puzzles as does the process
By which the sculptor moulds.
The child to the skies' rose-tracery
Lifts often his earnest eyes,
Now, lit with a sense of its beauty,
And now, with a vague surprise.
So erst gazed we on these marvels,
Nor thought of the Master-hand
That colors the delicate moonbeams,
And seashells among the sand.
So we, still like little children,
Have read not one-half the scroll,
Have learned not one-half the lesson
Life gives to the thoughtful soul.
Oh! when will all joy be perfect?
Oh! when will all thought be free?
Why question? We glide like the river,
Toward a vast, vast sea.
The brook glides on to the river,
The river glides to the sea;
Our yearnings will blend with the chorus
Of God's ocean, Eternity!
God's Ways, Not Our Ways
Men choose a crystal goblet filled with wine,
   That thirst and sense of beauty in all haste
May be indulged; but soon the wine is spilled
   Or proves unpleasant to the sated taste;
The crystal chasteness of the goblet slow
   Grows dimmer, and thus beauty is a loss;
And man full weary, to the wayside flings
   That wealth of pleasure which has turned to dross,
Close hugs a wooden bowl--no substitute
   For grace and radiance--and with pleading eyes,
Begs his Creator humbly to send down
   One drop of water from the plenteous skies;
God grants the boon, man drinks and is content.
Most men refuse to tread on this or that,
   In their attempts to climb where angels are;
Some fain would walk on roses, some on down,
   Some reach on waves of light the nearest star;
But from the devious modes that they devise,
   One has adjusted been to ev'ry need;
The fiat born of Wisdom goeth forth,
   And man must reck not that his feet will bleed;
Nor dare to say in lofty arrogance,
   "Walk thou in that path, I will walk in this!"
For he who would attain where angels bathe
   Their willing souls in affluence of bliss,
Must climb on Patience ' ladder up to God.
Nature's Minor Chords
The stirring of a feathery cloud
May wake a thought of richest worth,
The dew upon the lily's rim
To deepest reverie give birth.
Half glimpses caught in idle hours
Of shifting lights upon a stream,
Some sudden glory in the skies
May give the soul a magic dream.
The scent of wood-glades when glad Spring
Is penciling the dainty leaves,
Like subtlest music, round the heart
A web of strange enchantment weaves.
The robin's carol to the dawn
Soothes like the answer to a prayer;
The cushat's melancholy plaint
May change our mood quite to despair.
In Nature's wondrous orchestra,
The quiver of a single strain
Will poise a thought, and give the soul
Most exquisite repose or pain.
At Nature's Shrine
Sweet Nature, give me holy dreams,
Caress thy child once more!
Thy holiest cadence softly chant
As thou didst oft of yore.
Amid these mountains silence-sealed,
Beneath this tender sky,
Soothed by thy harmony divine,
Forever would I lie.
Now creeps the mist,--a violet veil,
Above the sacred hills;
The rainbow shimmers in the east,
Low coo the sparkling rills.
My soul so soothed beneath thy touch,
O Nature, chaste and calm,
Would bow before these solemn fanes,
And pour its grateful psalm.
These mountains veiled in mystery,
These skies with meaning fraught,
Rest in the hollow of His hand,
Whose tones Creation caught.
As the strange music of the shell
Tells of the mighty sea,
So these all to our rev'rent souls,
Great Father, speak of Thee!
Cloud Song
O snowflake clouds, O feath'ry clouds,
Sailing through deeps of sky,
Look through the boughs, the apple boughs,
Come to the earth more nigh.
Bring me a rift of sunshine gold,
To circle round my brow;
In breezy robes I fain would drift
To some blest island now.
Catch me the dew from those fair hills
Where ye are wont to rest;
Bring me the rose from Summer skies,
When Day dreams in the west.
Gather the rainbow's mingled hues,--
A blush of purity;
Give me the sparkle of the waves
Of the mysterious sea.
O snowflake clouds, O feath'ry clouds,
Sailing through deeps of sky,
Can ye not bring a hint of song
And drop it from on high?
Some tender song the seraphs sing,
So soothing, I could dream
That the sweet light of Paradise
On my life-path did gleam.
My Easter Dove
There came a dove, an Easter dove,
When morning stars grew dim;
It fluttered round my lattice bars,
To chant a matin hymn.
It brought a lily in its beak,
Aglow with dewy sheen;
I caught the strain, the incense breathed,
And uttered praise between.
It brought a shrine of holy thoughts
To calm my soul that day;
I caught the meaning of the note
Why did it fly away?
Come peaceful dove, sweet Easter dove!
Above earth's storm and strife
Sing of the joy of Easter-tide,
Of light and hope and life.
Questioning
Can life's best consciousness of joy
Quite charm the soul without alloy?
Or will its hidden depths be stirred
All unawares, by some chance word,
To deep regret or nameless pain,
With fev'rish yearning in its train?
Ay! as the shadows fleck the grass
When through his courts the Sun doth pass,
So in the measure Life must dole
To th' insatiate, asking soul,
Shade gives to bloom its best relief,
Joy comes the sweeter after grief.
Each struggle toward a clearer light,
Each noble impulse unto right
Makes struggle easy, effort grand;
Lo! when we seize with eager hand
The regal rose and meet the thorn,
We heed not though our flesh be torn.
For life's best joy may not all be
Intense delight though e'er so free
From hint of sorrow, but the calm
That soothes the spirit, like a psalm
Of benediction floating by
In strains serenest caught on high.
Hidden Essence
Some gold lies veiled behind each evening cloud,
Some beauty hides in every quiet stream,
Some love entwines its tendrils round each soul,
With all the rare devotion of a dream.
Some rose looks forth from ev'ry curled bud,
Some note drifts warbling to the last one's need,
Some song thrills deeply ev'ry woodbird's heart,
Some dew-soft incense haloes each true deed.
Some azure-winged Hope with starry gaze,
Floats viewless near, when joy begins to wane;
Some lustrous tint through each tear-prism gleams,
Some peace reposes 'neath each torturing pain.
A Fragment
Our fancies are but joys all unexprest,
The rhythm of a carol strange and sweet.
Who would resign his yearning for the best
The arts severe can yield? all incomplete
As is the airy fabric of our dream,
Yet bask we in its rose-encolored gleam.
Take from our life its palpitating hope,
Rob it of those mysterious undertones,
That like the changing angels, fondly grope
Toward harmonies celestial, stifle moans
That, uttered in our longing, half reveal
The soul's deep struggles and far more conceal,--
And what is left us? What avails the lute
When the sweet player's fingers all are cold?
So would it be with us if Hope were mute,
No longer with her magic to unfold
Our dreams' aerial splendor and transform
Their misty shadows to a radiance warm.
Then let us, ever watching rev'rently,
Quaff the pure incense of the morning star,
Heed the impassioned skylark's reverie,
Soaring and singing in the ether far;
And bathe out life each hour in beauty new,
By guarding fresh the soul's impearlèd dew.
Star Song
O sailing stars!
Through pearly bars
Of fleecy cloudlets fair,
With liquid gleam,
Ye drift,--a dream
Of beauty in the air.
Ye sailing stars!
Bright silver cars,
Moving with rhythmic pace,
Can spirits rare
Float through the air,
With more majestic grace?
O stars so calm!
Were life a psalm
Attuned to harmony,
On wings of light,
To some blest height
As calm, our souls would flee.
Easter Carol
Lilies swinging censers fair,
In the dreamy Spring-tide air,
Purer seem your bells this morn:
Roses on the dewy lawn,
Tinted with the hues of dawn,
Ye are sweeter: flow'rets say,
Why are ye so rare to-day?
    Oh why, oh why!
Robin, tender robin, say,
Why art thou so glad to-day?
Never has thy note to me
Borne beneath its melody,
Such inspiring mystery.
Warbling robin, softly say,
Why are thou so glad to-day?
     Oh why, oh why!
Silver-throated lark, reply!
Far off in the azure sky,
Wherefore does that song of thine,
Soaring in a strain divine,
Strangely thrill this soul of mine?
Fluting lark, reply, reply!
Is't to bear my soul on high?
    On high, on high!
Questioner! the birds reply,
Christ ascends to-day on high,
From the sadness and the gloom,
From the shadows of the tomb.
For His glory sweeter bloom
Rose and lily; this is why
Strains divine thrill through the sky,
    'Tis why, 'tis why!
Pure as is the lily's bowl,
List'ner! ever be thy soul!
Fragrant as the rose thy life,
Kindliness o'ercoming strife;
Jesus' vict'ry gives new life.
Then uplift thy drooping brow,
Join in Nature's gladness now!
     Sing now, sing now!
Yes! the Easter-tide is fair,
Strains triumphant flood the air;
So bright garlands we entwine
For the Son of God Divine.
Then rejoice, O soul of mine!
With the chanting birds and flow'rs,
Consecrate these blessed hours,
    Rejoice! rejoice!
An Ideal
An evanescent hue whose pearly gleam
Transfigures all it glows upon, a dream
Of forms aerial, chiseled so fair
That angel fingers must have lingered there.
A scent as of celestial roses blown
From consecrated meadows, many a tone
Sublime in ecstasy and rev'rent hush,
An exaltation that no wrong can crush.
A hint of harmonies in life's strange psalm,
A sense of Heaven's completeness, all its calm;
A shining goal suffused with radiant light,--
Such the Ideal that lures from height to height.
The Hermit and the Soul
The hermit in his cave beside the sea,
In mood contemplative, the mystery,--
Ay, all the wondrous meaning fain would trace
Of swinging stars sphered in unfathomed space.
The soul in life's dim cave beside the sea,
Is pond'ring likewise all the mystery,
The solemn something that the years unfold,
A riddle never new, yet never old.
Ah! musing hermit, wake from out thy dreams!
See 'mid the stars refulgent, one that streams
With sheen sublime; the shepherds, ages gone,
Saw it illume the plain one frosty morn.
Ah! restless soul, immortal dow'r is thine!
Christ came to earth, the Son of God Divine,
To solve the myst'ry: therefore cease thy strife,
Light from the cross leads on to endless life.
Compensation
How the majestic stellar lights of Heav'n
   Gliding in rhythm through the aisles of space,
Shed cheering radiance on the waiting earth,
   When all day long the Sun has hid his face.
How glowed the painter's soul with rapture mute,
   When after weary toil and vague unrest,
The Head Divine upon his vision broke,
   And rare contentment closed a loving quest.
Men who dare mighty deeds with dauntless will,
   Oft meet defeat, not glorious victory;
But the uplifting souls to undreamed heights,
   May not of poorest laurels worthy be.
There is a heroism born of pain,
   Whose recompense in noble impulse lies;
And sometimes tears that e'en from grief did flow,
   Are changed to joy-drops in pathetic eyes.
From out the din of mighty orchestras,
   The sweetest, purest tones are oft evolved;
So from the discord of our restless lives,
   May come sweet harmony when all is solved.
A Vision of Moonlight
O silver splendor, marvelous!
   Transfigured is the rare blue sky,
Where cloudlets crowned with amber mist,
   Glide to a whispered music by.
What seem they, circling round the spheres,
   Swans that majestically sway?
Or weird white ships far out at sea,
   With lamps hung up to light the way?
Or are they rather, like the bright,
   Fantastic wreaths of feathery spray,
Revealing gleams of ringlets gold,
   Tossed by the mermaids in their play?
A pearly shimmer lies within
   The rose's petals folded up;
Shy lilies peep through river-reeds,
   With liquid sweetness in their cup.
A fleecy, opal-tinted veil
   Hangs on the waters sleeping calm;
Fountains of rainbow sheen fling high
   Their cadence mellowed to a psalm.
As hope upspringing in the breast
   Irradicates the human face,
E'en so the moonlight's mystic glow
   Sheds o'er all things unwonted grace.
The soul is nobler for great thoughts,
   The heart is richer for love's boon,
The flowers are brighter for the dew,
   The sky is rarer for the moon.
O solemn silence! do the leaves
   Stop rustling to enjoy the scene?
Do waves, all tremulous with sound,
   Pause to adore, their hymns between?
O tranquil moonlight! as some strains
   Suggest a master-spirit's song,
Thy beauty pure, impalpable,
   Must to celestial spheres belong.
O glory royal, marvelous!
   Thou may'st perhaps the shadow be
Of glory all-surpassing, that
   Streams from God's throne eternally.
Sea Cadences
Many are thy tones, O Ocean,
Filling us with strange emotion
As we hear the murmurs wild;
   In their weird and solemn power,
   Thou dost send them ev'ry hour
To thy yearning, list'ning child.
Like a voice subdued and tragic,
Many of thy songs bring magic,
Others to us hoarsely call;
   Some are sweet and fraught with gladness,
   Some have strains akin to sadness,
Yet we prize and love them all.
In the heart nigh crushed with sorrow,
Dreading the unknown to-morrow,
Wishing past the drear to-day,
   In the soul its burden bearing
   While the lip a smile is wearing,
They have waked an answering lay.
Thou hast psalms of glad thanksgiving,
Choral anthems for the living,
Dirges for the silent throng;
   For the beautiful who, lying
   Where the mermaids low are sighing,
Nevermore shall join thy song.
There is freedom in thy dashing
As thy waves the rocks are lashing,
Singing loud their mad refrain;
   Of unrest the chords are telling,
   And from many a soul's depth welling,
Comes an echo to the strain.
Like some lone heart's plaintive throbbing,
Leap the billows, wildly sobbing,
Flinging to the pulseless air,--
   Now, a cadence hushed and calming,
   Now, a peal fierce and alarming,
Now a wail of deep despair.
As the sad mysterious surges
Chant their melancholy dirges,
In a whisper ne'er repressed,
   So within the realm of feeling,
   Hopes and longings softly stealing,
Moan forever unexpressed.
When thy sweetly chiming chorus
Throws its fascination o'er us,
We would fain translate it all;
   But in vain is e'en our trying,
   For thy notes are never-dying,
And they baffle as they fall.
Soft thy hymns of awed devotion
Float on waves of ceaseless motion,
To the throne of God above.
   Many are thy tones, O Ocean,
   Filling us with strange emotion,
Tuning souls to praise and love.
A Thought on Lake Ontario
The lucent lake was lit with sheen,
Shining the crested waves between,
And through the purpling air
   The young birds trilled their lightsome lays,
   To join the hymn of Nature's praise,
And earth was passing fair.
The summer sky was liquid blue,
The lake's deep gleam, a sapphire hue
Of gem-like radiance rare;
   It seemed a quiet dream of rest,
   The billows on its mighty breast
Swayed in accordant prayer.
I deem Apollo ne'er had! seen
More wondrous depths of glist'ning sheen,
Than thine, O dreamy lake!
   Nor has his lyre swept the deep,
   Wherein more magic shadows sleep,
Than those thy ripples wake.
No Triton in the rosy dawn,
Blew sweeter music on his horn,
Than thy soft melody;
   No Nereid seeking ocean caves,
   Blew lighter foam across the waves
Of the impassioned sea.
When glist'ning in the sunset-rose
Thy tinted waves suggest repose,
All troubled yearnings cease;
   When life is discord and unrest,
   We come to seek upon thy breast,
A hint of perfect peace.
Sky Picture
Through pearly deeps of sky, cloud-mountains rose
Amid the haze, a land of tinted snows;
A dream of beauty where the palest gold
And rarest azure did their bloom unfold.
It was a vision fair, set in the air,
Where form and color kissed through violet mist.
Hymn to the Thousand Islands
O islets green, Nature's immortal gems,
Ye smile--a thought of God--rare diadems
Framed in majestic waters! Here and there
Ye sparkle, tiny emeralds, from the air
Dropped by chaste angel fingers in the deep.
Were ye, when first Creation woke from sleep,
An anthem sung at sunrise to the Light,
Like Memnon's statue at the dazzling sight?
Dotting the placid waters, marvels ye,
A masterpiece of sculptured scenery!
Ye are a fragment of the mighty plan,
Linking in rhythm divine Nature and man.
Ye are a cadence of perpetual praise
To Him who guards the soul through endless days.
On the Rapids of the St. Lawrence
The gurgling waters foam and play,
And whirl and dash the live-long day
In jets of spray.
They roll and dance, and laugh and sing,
They are forever on the wing,
A restless thing!
What tale of pathos do they tell,
As onward they tumultuous swell,--
Is it a knell,
A lay of love, or joy or woe,
Enacted in the long ago?
We cannot know!
The emerald waters rage and boil,
And madly Whirl in wild turmoil,
Unending toil
Is theirs: they hint of strange unrest,
They foamy waves upon their breast
Seem sore distrest.
They leap and toss their mad caps high,
They rave and plunge and sadly sigh;
Yet to the sky
Their weird antiphonies ascend,
And with celestial anthems blend,
As up they wend.
Voices of the Rain
Hear the dreary, dreary rain,
Beating 'gainst the window pane!
Causing little ones to shiver,
Causing aged forms to wither,
Murm'ring through the dying ember,
Making fireless homes more somber.
   O the dreary, dreary rain!
Hear the cheerful, cheerful rain,
Laughing through the golden grain!
Waking cowslips in the meadow
Which the stately oaks o'ershadow;
Fanning soft the fainting flowers
That have dropped their heads for hours.
   O the cheerful, cheerful rain!
Hear the tearful, tearful rain
Sobbing o'er the battle-plain!
Where the warrior fought in glory,
Where death closed life's tangled story
Teardrops kiss his matted tresses,
Tears, instead of love's caresses.
   O the tearful, tearful rain!
Hear the music of the rain,
In the brook and stormy main!
On the roof it softly patters,
Tones concordant far it scatters.
Children tucked away to slumber,
Hear its notes and count their number.
   Pretty music of the rain!
Hear the solemn, solemn rain,
Moaning o'er the burial plain!
Chanting low a dirge, and sighing
For the loved so missed in dying.
When above them flowers are paling,
Hear its sad, monot'nous wailing.
   O the solemn, solemn rain!
Our Task
If we could know the mystery
   Hid in the skylark's wondrous song,
If we could hear the dulcet psalms
   The sheeny stars have sung so long,--
We yet must turn to other sounds,
   To human voices oft in pain;
To dissonance which should be tuned
   To truest harmony again.
We cannot know, O fluting lark,
   What lent thy song its ecstasy;
We yearn, in meditative mood,
   To fathom all the mystery
Of Nature's tireless orchestra.
   Ay! but that joy we can forego,
For there is need of list'ning ears
   Where other voices charm us. So,
With vision clear and purpose pure,
   Humanity's broad scheme we'll trace;
A wrong to right, a sob to hush,
   To see a brother in each face
That lifts itself toward God's blue dome
   In suppliant hope,--thus life expands
To sweet fruition, till the waves
   Of Time are lulled on golden sands.
Echo Reverie
(At Echo Lake, White Mountains.)
Along the lake the bugle rings,
   And hark! what harmony of sound
Breaks through the mountains: silv'ry clear
   The chorus is diffused around.
It multiplies from cliff to cliff,
   A weird antiphony, so sweet
The magic tones, the heart throbs high,
   Entranced with unison complete.
Ay, listen! now it steals again:
   From peak to peak the music rings,
Wave upon wave; until the soul
   Thrilled and subdued, in rapture sings.
One echo wakes, it dies away;
   Soft, softer, hushed, till in a dream
Of ecstasy divine we muse,
   Floating adown the peaceful stream.
O holy echo! sweet and clear,
   Thou tell'st of the Creator's hand
That swung the singing planets there
   In distant orbits, when were planned
These mountains: thou dost but repeat
   Some fragment of the harmony
The morning stars together sang;
   O wondrous, echoing mystery!
Lines Written on a Farewell View of the Franconia 
Mountains At Twilight
Blue mists surround the mountains now,
   In shadowy splendor slowly fades
Their perfect outline; each pure brow
   Is battled in mystery; the shades
Of pensive twilight gather round,
   The timid stars forbear awhile
To lift their misty curtain; sound
   Thy lyre, O souls! 'neath Nature's smile.
The Coming of Spring
The buds from winter's frost-work lift
Their dainty heads; a golden rift
Of sunshine from the misty space
Of Cloudland comes apace.
And we are sealed in dreams to-day.
Look! fair Spring beckons! wherefore stay?
Deep in the forest's mystery,
Strange visions we would see.
The young bird twitters on his nest;
His tender notes so long represet,
Soar to the ether, clear and calm,
A pure, exultant psalm.
The youth charmed by the whisp'ring leaves,
Tells life's sweet secret 'neath the eaves,
And finds more fair than sunset skies
The Springtime in her eyes.
What colors deck the woodland shade!
What airy pencilings! the glade
Is rich with lily-bells whose glow
Seems borrowed from the snow.
She comes fair Spring, with rhythmic pace!
Say, have you looked her in the face?
Her glance is ecstasy, her smile
All sorrow can beguile.
In reveries almost divine,
What visions bright before us shine!
Lo! erst we yearned: we see fulfilled
The fantasies we willed.
She comes our chant of praise to hear,
Sweet, airy Spring, and lingers near;
Without her dreams, her nameless hope,
How sadly would we grope!
We raise our heads, our hearts elate
Meanwhile, and fit to toy with fate.
How can life's changes e'er distress
While clasped in Spring's caress.
Failure
What is failure? When the maiden
   Pensive, reading from the page,
Breathes the crushèd roseleaf's fragrance
   And far more than counsel sage
Does its subtle odor woo her
   On to happy fields of light,
Where love's tremulous requirements
   All are reconciled quite,--
Has the sweet rose missed its mission,
   With its petals rudely torn?
Nay! its perfume brought a vision,
   Fairer than the fairest morn,
To the dreaming maiden: therefore
   Grieve not rose, thy doom was best;
Murmur not to carry to her,
   After tumult, hints of rest.
What is failure? When the poet
   Hears his verses harshly scorned,
Can he yet forget the rapture,
   That upon his spirit dawned,--
As the cadences so holy
   Lulled his senses in a trance,
And aerial fingers dainty
   Swept his lyre? Ay, perchance
He but loves the strains the better--
   Tender nurslings from the skies--
And although no ruth awaits him,
   Newer glory fills his eyes.
What is failure? Ah! we know not!
   'Tis but an indiff'rent thing;
Sometimes to unrest an impulse,
   Sometimes angels on the wing.
Calling us to finer raptures,
   Chanting for us nobles strains,
From the world's dissatisfaction
   Gleaning for us priceless gains.
The Triple Bension
Come to guard us, come to bless us,
Holy, mystic sisters three!
On our bowed heads pour a chrism,
Daughters of the Deity.
Crown us with your triple chaplet,
Roses red and lilies fair,
Dark green leaves entwined around them,
Fragrant with May's tender air.
We are waiting--suppliants needy--
For your beauteous three-fold gift,
That to heights of calm completeness
Our beseeching souls can lift.
How can we without your favor
Make of life what it should be?
Come then, guard us, aid and bless us,
Daughters of the Deity.
Be our souls as pure and stainless,
Blending all the perfect hues,
Sacred Faith, as is the color
We shall ever for thee choose.
Be our paths as green with verdure,
Yearning Hope, as thine must be;
And our lives as flushed with radiance,
As thine, O blessed Charity!
Verses to My heart's Sister
We've traveled long together,
O sister of my heart,
Since first as little children
All buoyant, we did start
Upon Life's checkered pathway,
Nor dreamed of aught save joy;
But ah! To-day can tell us
Naught is without alloy.
Rememb'rest thou the gambols
Of those sweet, early days,
When siren Fancy showed us
Our dreams through golden haze?
Ah, well thou dost remember
The mirth we then did share,
The sports, the tasks, the music,
The all-embracing prayer.
Somehow my own sweet sister,
Our heart-strings early twined;
Some rare bond of affection
Of tastes and aims combined,
Made us, e'en in our Springtime,
Soul-sisters fond and leal;
And how that love has strengthened
The years can well reveal.
We've seen our loved ones vanish
Far from our yearning gaze,
Into the peace of Heaven.
O those sad, saddest days,
When we two clung together,
So lonely and forlorn,
With our crushed hearts all quiv'ring,
All bruised, and scarred and torn.
So nearer clung we, sister,
And loved each other more;
The tendrils of our natures
Twined closer than before.
We could speak to no other
Of those sweet, holy things,
So tender yet so nameless,
Which sorrow often brings.
The troubles that have thickened
Around our daily path,
We've borne together, sister,
And oft when courage hath
Grown feeble, and the future
Was dark with naught of cheer,
Could one have faced the conflict
Without the other near?
And sister, dear Heart's-Sister,
When all the mystery
Of this strange life is ended
In Immortality,
We'll love each other dearly
As now we do, and more;
For sacred things in Heaven
Grow richer than before.
And shall not those sweet loved ones
Missed here so long! so long!
Join with us in the music
Of an all-perfect song?
We feel a gladder cadence
Will thrill their rapt'rous strain,
When we are with them, sister,
All , ne'er to part again!
So now as here we linger,
May ours be happy days!
O generous-hearted sister,
In all Life's winding ways
May we have joy together!
And this I fondly pray,--
God bless thee, dear Heart's-Sister!
Forever and for aye!
Among the Berkshire Hills
The hills in emerald robes of richest dye,
Decked e'en most regally, slope to the sky
In daintiest curves and many a lakelet calm
Sleeps in the vale below, while like a psalm
The silv'ry waters murmur; all around
Majestic silence reigns, save when the sound
Of some fair warbler stirs the air with song,
Sweet as if they to Heav'n's isles did belong.
Yea, in eternal grandeur stand the hills
Wrapped oft in misty veils of blue; the rills
Trickle in motion musical, meanwhile
The landscape shimmers golden 'neath the smile
Of Nature in her kindest mood; she seems
Benignant to these peaceful slopes; rich gleams
Of sunshine flicker o'er them, shadows chase
In shapes fantastic and with rarest grace,
The light across these mountains; far and near,
Like to a silver ribbon winding clear,
The Housatonic mirrors back the skies,
And through the quiet meadows gently hies
To join the music of the solemn band,
Played by the sea. Touched by th' enchanted wand
Of magic beauty lies fair Stockbridge Bowl,--
A lake whose calm brings rest within the soul.
There Nature comes to us with ev'ry phase
Of loveliness, and charms away our days,
Until refreshed the wearied spirit grows,
Lulled to unwonted harmony nor knows
It aught of restlessness amid such peace;
Unrest and care have there a swift release:
Nature has vesture of a thousand hues,--
Skies sapphire blue, bright waters, pearly dews;
Her panorama changes with the hours.
'Twas morn: above the hills shell-tinted flow'rs
Were strewn along the pathway of the sun,
Just peeping o'er the slopes, his race begun.
'Twas noon: the leaves were dancing in the breeze;
Clouds clad in sheeny tissues, kissed the trees,
Crowning the summits, while to the glad gaze
Stretched out a rare perspective dim with haze.
And o'er the hills one fair cloud calmly slept,
Fair as an angel dreaming; blue mists crept
In sinuous curves above the stately heights,
Which gleamed resplendent in the shifting lights.
'Twas sunset when a charm the earth enshrouds;
A setting exquisite of tinted clouds
Illumined changing scenes of mount and glade;
And all the majesty of light and shade
Bewildered with its beauty, while afar
Looked o'er the heights one silver vesper star.
And soon the moonlight touched the hills with sheen,
Bathed them in mystery which Night's chaste queen
Dispels around her. Thus the vision grows,
And the enchanted gleams that Nature throws
O'er mountain, valley, grove and laughing rills,
We see in regal beauty 'mid these hills.
Through colonnades of pines the vistas green
Invite the gaze to linger, while between
The shadows slant, and through the golden air
Each scene dissolves into one still more fair.
All this calm loveliness can but enthrall.
We dream amid these solitudes, and all
Th' unuttered p raise of many a soul ascends
In thanks to Him who here such glory sends.
Evening Prayer
Father of Love!
We leave our souls with Thee!
Oh! may Thy Holy Spirit to us be
A peaceful Dove!
Now when day's strife
And bitterness are o'er,
Oh! in our hearts all bruisèd gently pour
The dew of life.
So as the rose--
Though fading on the stem--
Awakes to blush when morning's lustrous gem
Upon it glows;--
May we awake,
Soothed by Thy priceless balm,
To chant with grateful hearts our morning psalm,
And blessings take.
Or let it be,
That where the palm trees rise,
And crystal streams flow, we uplift our eyes
To Thee!--to Thee!
Retrospection
What do the long years bring us,
The weary, restless years?
Hopes, dreams unrealized, yet balm
To stay the bitt'rest tears.
Some gold tint in the prism,
Some kind words softly said,
Some hint of love most tender
E'en when glad joy has fled.
Not grief perchance, nor sorrow,
And yet a vague unrest
Will mingle with our musings,
A pang all unexpressed.
The minstrel's song though gladsome,
Enfolds a minor strain;
Each throbbing joy brings with it
Inevitable pain.
For through the cleansing fires
Our shrinking souls must go,
Ere we the wholesome lesson
Of life can really know.
Then let us be undaunted,
Leaving to God the end,
Rememb'ring, more than sparrows,
We find in Christ, a friend.
At Christmas-tide
Gleamed a resplendent star
Over the hillsides far,
While shepherds watched by night
On the peaceful height.
Softly the gold-light fell
Over the vale and dell,
While angels warbled clear
"Lo! the Christ-child's here!"
Wise men brought there with them,
Sweet Child of Bethlehem,
Rare gifts to offer Thee,
For Thou mad'st them free.
"Peace!" list the magic word
Now through the ages heard;
"Good-will!" it echoes still
With the olden thrill.
Sweet Child in mercy sent,
Jesus, grant us content.
Evermore may we be
Near to truth and Thee!
Broken Heart
Ah blow! thou art the last, the last!
Grief cannot harm me any more.
I'm weary now that hope is past,
My heart is broken at the core,
Ay, at the core.
Then call me henceforth, Broken Heart!
It is the name most meet for woe.
Since I can ne'er with Sorrow part,
I care no other name to know.
Ah! call me so.
I never thought my life would be
All poisoned by a fatal dart,
But now no joy can rescue me.
Yes! call me ever Broken Heart,
Sad Broken Heart.
Jesus says, "Broken Heart be mine;
I'll take thee, shattered as thou art.
Come rest upon my Love Divine,
Come weary, weary Broken Heart,
Never to part.
"The world has wounded, Heaven will not;
Life sore has pricked thee, Broken Heart,
Her page is dark with many a blot.
Alas! thy bitt'rest tears will start,
Poor Broken Heart!
"Then come, O wherefore wouldst thou wait?
Carry thy cross and follow on.
I am thy portion, early, late;
Haste Broken Heart, this very morn,
This happy morn.
"Sweet peace I give thee, Broken Heart,
'Twill be a cure for ev'ry woe.
None e'er has loved thee, Broken Heart,
As I have loved thee long ago,
Ah no! ah no!
"Does earth still weave her subtle charm?
Oh! will thou not with Sorrow part
For soothing, everlasting balm?
Do I suffice thee, Broken Heart?
Speak, Broken Heart!"
"Yes, Jesus, Thou art all I need,
I'll gladly rise and follow Thee.
Life sore has pricked me, made me bleed,
But now Thy Child I am to be,
Yes! Thine to be".
"Ay, dearest child, my blood for thee
Will heal thy heart's poor broken core;
My blood that floweth full and free,
Will in thy soul rich blessings pour,
Forevermore!
"Then hold my hand, dear Healèd Heart!
I'll lead thee to thy home and then
We never, nevermore shall part."
"O Jesus, hear my soul's Amen,
Amen, Amen!"
Prayer
O Christ, who in Gethsemane
Didst all alone in anguish pray,
"Father, if it be possible,
Let this cup, Father, pass away,"--
O holy Christ, who rose serene,
Sublime in victory to cry,
"Not as I will, but as Thou wilt!"
Let us in faith on Thee rely.
Did not the stars in far off space,
Upon their silver axes pause
To hear those words? Was not the air
Calmed by the myst'ry and its cause?
O Christ, veiled in Humanity!
O Victor over deepest woe!
When we, like Thee, endure the pain,
Let us, like Thee, submission know.
Grant us a vict'ry like the Thine,
O'er all the storms that rage within.
Teach us, O Christ, we humbly pray,
The trust that fain would conquer sin.
And when life's discords all are hushed,
Blended in perfect harmony,
Call us, O pitying Son of God,
Take us, O blessed Christ, to Thee!
Shadow and Sunshine
Poor heart, unsatisfied!
Poor soul, trying and tried!
Trying to reach the goal,
And tried art thou, O soul,
In all thy ways.
Seeking where'er it be,
Something to solace thee;
Choosing whatever part,
Unfilled art thou, O heart,
Through length of days.
Wherefore these shadows sent?
Wherefore these hours of Lent?
Wherefore the rugged rock,
The fire, the stumbling block,
The vale of tears?
Earth's gilded pleasures lure;
Canst share them and endure
True to thy nobler self,
Soul, with thy mine of wealth,
For many years?
Listen! discouraged heart,
Loath with thy pain to part;
Hear, O sad, tearful soul,
Seeking the radiant goal,
Christ's holy plea.
"Thy strength e'en weakness is;
Perfect in Me thou liv'st.
I am the Way, the Truth,
Come without further proof,
Come unto Me!"
Rest thou shalt find and peace,
And joys that never cease;
Light o'er the mountain comes,
Voices from distant homes
Echo the song.
When most despondent ye,
Louder the voice shall be;
Bliss-crowned the radiant goal
Sought by thee, sorrowing soul,
So long, so long!
Soul Incense
As round the rose's heart the golden threads
Of summer sunshine gently wind themselves,
And deeper, richer grows the native tinge,
More beauteous in its kindling loveliness,
So round the human heart unconsciously
The tendrils gold of love entwine themselves,
And make it sweeter, richer, holier far
Than 'twas before; and as on deep'ning blooms
The gaze of man delights to rest awhile,
So on the heart lit by love's radiant glow,
The angels look with glance serene and pure.
As unseen dews descend and softly rest,
Like to a jewel, upon each green spray,
And leave it sparkling with unwonted sheen,
E'en so the unseen dews of sweet content
And holy consecretion, crystal beads,
Of many a lowly soul the shadows dim
Illume, and like the balmy breath of morn,
Make it resplendent with the changing gleam,
Of priceless jewels,--stars within the soul.
As lightly dripping rain the fragrance woos,
Alike of blossoms waking to the sun
And blooms mature, that through the silent grove,
Their fresh bath o'er--rock in the cooling breeze
And make it redolent with fragrance rare,
So deeds in silence done and kind words said,
The influence of a pure and holy life
Shed on each pathway their aroma rare.
As birds uplift their gorgeous-tinted wings,
Rich as the purple flush of autumn days,
And seek the mellow climes of orange bow'rs
Ere uncongenial gales their plumage beat,
So from the harsh, forbidding sons of men,
Whose ears are not attuned; to catch her song,
The child with spirit sensitive and rapt,
Turns lovingly to those whose sympathy,
Like chords responsive, catch the sweet refrain,
And send it throbbing back, a silver link,
Uniting kindred souls in union blest.
SONNETS
To my Mother
(January 1, )
Sweet Mother! rare in gifts of tenderness!
Thou who didst nurse my child-life into bloom,
And for each native grace made ample room
To blossom in love's light,--how can we bless
The Power that gave thee to us! In the stress
Of life's great conflict, what could e'er illume
Its mystic shadows and its deepest gloom,
Like smiles and loving words from thee! No less
Than widest sunshine is thy sympathy.
O precious Heart! so rich in sacrifice,
And--boon beyond compare--supremest love,
May Heaven's choicest blessings rest on thee,
Rarer than jewels of the costliest price!
And Peace brood o'er thy path like calmest dove!
Life
Life! Ay, what is it? E'en a moment spun
From cycles of eternity. And yet,
What wrestling 'mid the fever and the fret
Of tangled purposes and hopes undone!
What affluence of love! What victories won
In agonies of silence, ere trust met
A manifold fulfillment, and the wet,
Beseeching eyes saw splendors past the sun
What struggle in the web of circumstance,
And yearning in the winged music! All,
One restless strife from fetters to be free;
Till, gathered to eternity's expanse,
Is that brief moment at the Father's call;
Life! Ay, at best, 'tis but a mystery!
Aspiration
We climb the slopes of life with throbbing heart,
And eager pulse, like children toward a star.
Sweet siren music cometh from afar,
To lure us on meanwhile. Responsive start
The nightingales to richer song than Art
Can ever teach. No passing shadows mar
Awhile the dewy skies; no inner jar
Of conflict bids us with our quest to part.
We see adown the distance, rainbow-arched,
What melting aisles of liquid light and bloom!
We hasten, tremulous, with lips all parched,
And eyes wide-stretched, nor dream of coming gloom.
Enough that something held almost divine
Within us ever stirs. Can we repine?
Incompleteness
What soul hath struck its need of melody,
From life's strange instrument whereon it plays?
Are the aspiring strains of weary days
E'er gathered in their full intensity,
Swelling a psalm incomparable, free
To utter all their yearning? Nay! the lays
Moan on inadequately, for the ways
Of God in shaping souls we may not see.
Mid baffled hopes we cry out in our need,
And wrestle in the shadows, wond'ring when
Such dissonance can e'er be sweet, and how.
But soon the watching Father will have freed
Our earthly ears to catch the music: then
The chrism of perfect peace shall bathe each brow.
Self-Mastery
To catch the spirit in its wayward flight
Through mazes manifold, what task supreme!
For when to floods has grown the quiet stream,
Much human skill must aid its rage to fight;
And when wild winds invade the solemn night,
Seems not man's vaunted power but a dream?
And still more futile, ay, we e'en must deem
This quest to tame the soul, and guide aright
Its restless wanderings,-- to lure it back
To shoals of calm. Full many a moan and sigh
Attend the strife; till, effort merged in prayer,
Oft uttered, clung to-- when of strength the lack
Seems direst-- brings the answer to our cry:
A gift from Him who lifts our ev'ry care.
Niobe
O Mother-heart! when fast the arrows flew,
Like blinding lightning, smiting as they fell,
One after one, one after one, what knell
Could fitly voice thy anguish! Sorrow grew
To throes intensest, when thy sad soul knew
Thy youngest, too, must go. Was it not well,
Avengers wroth, just one to spare? Ay, tell
The ages of soul-struggle sterner? Through
The flinty stone, O image of despair,
Sad Niobe, thy maddened grief did flow
In bitt'rest tears, when all thy wailing prayer
Was so denied. Alas! what weight of woe
Is prisoned in thy melancholy eyes!
What mother-love beneath the Stoic lies!
The Two Musicians
Love plays a lute, and Thought an organ grand.
These tones are stately, those a restless strain,
Seeming by cadenced joy to measure pain,
And capture Fancy by the soft airs fanned.
Thought sends his plans thrilling through the land;
The worshipers that bow before his fane
Find rest in contemplation, spirit-gain
In sweetest harmonies. Yon rapturous band,
Kneeling to catch the music of the lute,
Have yearning in their eyes, yet something there
That baffles all our reas'ning; is it peace,
Or only glances with beseeching mute?
Sometimes it deepens into holy prayer.
Enchanted Love! thy music never cease!
The Poet's Ministrants
The smiling Dawn, with diadem of dew,
Brings sunrise odors to perfume his shrine;
Blithe Zephyr fans him; and soft moonbeams twine
An aureole to crown him, of a hue,
Surpassing fair. The stately stars renew
Majestic measures, that he may incline
His soul unto their sweetness; whispers fine
From spirit-nymphs allure him; not a few
The gifts chaste Fancy and her sisters bring,
Rare is the lyre the Muses for him wrought,
A different meaning thrills in ev'ry string,
With ev'ry changing mood of life so fraught.
Invoked by him, when such the strains that flow,
How can the poet e'er his song forego!
Milton
O poet gifted with the sight divine!
To thee 'twas given Eden's groves to pace
With that first pair, in whom the human race
Their kinship claim: and angels did incline--
Great Michael, holy Gabriel-- to twine
Their heavenly logic, through which thou couldst trace
The rich outpourings of celestial grace
Mingled with argument, around the shrine
Where thou didst linger, vision-rapt, intent
To catch the sacred mystery of Heaven.
Nor was thy longing vain: a soul resolved
To ponder truth supreme to thee was lent;
For thy not sightless eyes the veil was riv'n,
Redemption's problem unto thee well solved.
Shakespeare
We wonder what the horoscope did show
When Shakespeare came to earth. Were planets there,
Grouped in unique arrangement? Unaware
His age of aught so marvelous, when lo!
He speaks! men listen! what of joy or woe
Is not revealed! love, hatred, marking care,
All quivering 'neath his magic touch. The air
Is thick with beauteous elves, a dainty row,
Anon, with droning witches, and e'en now
Stalks gloomy Hamlet, bent on vengeance dread.
One after one they come, smiling or scarred,
Wrought by that mind prismatic to which bow
All lesser minds. They by thee would be fed,
Poet incomparable! Avon's Bard!
Raphael.
Great Painter! to thy soul aglow with thought,
Celestial forms their glory did reveal.
Not unrewarded wast thou left to kneel
At Beauty's sacred altar; not for naught
Thy gift of consecration hadst thou brought,
We see thee pensive, radiant, and there steal
Soft shadows, mystic lights; th' angelic seal
Is on thy dreamy brow; thy soul hath caught
The essence of the harmony it craved.
Behold the Mother and the Child Divine!
What rapt repose! what majesty serene!
Thy spirit tuned to contemplation, laved
In founts of light. For thee we would entwine
The asphodel bright with celestial sheen,
Beethoven
O great tone-master! low thy massive head
Droops, heavy with the thoughts that fain would weave
Themselves in interlacing chords, that leave
Sublimest music. Inspiration sped
On dainty pinions to thy natal bed,
And warbling notes did all the silence cleave
As for a benediction; well believe
The votaries that hie where thou hast led,
In thy supreme endowment. Who as well
Can make the Orphic echoes? Thou dost muse,
And harmony, the sweetest, is evolved.
In grave sonatas rich with surging swell,
In matchless symphonies-- but thou couldst choose--
The mystery of music thou hast solved.
The Tireless Sculptor
E'en as the sculptor chisels patiently
The marble's jagged edges, day by day,
Striving to smooth all blemishes away,
Till-- when from ev'ry flaw the stone is free,
And naught save perfect contours does he see--
Embodied harmony and beauty may
Atone for all the weary hours' delay,--
So Life, the sculptor, moulds unceasingly
The soul of man. How often in recoil
The spirit shrinks, nor can through prescience know
Of coming grace and majesty. 'Tis willed
The scars should deeper be, until the toil
And chiseling are adequate; when lo!
God's all-unfathomed plan is quite fulfilled.
The Soul's Courts
Within the soul's courts is a temple fair,
And garnished with immortal bloom of light
Than em'rald star-sheen fairer. To the sight
It rises, dazzling as some vision rare,
That haunts the artist, ere it fades in air.
There sits Reserve, a maid of sober mien,
Guarding the sacred portals. All unseen
Th' angelic ministrants that linger where
She holds control. Within, a little space,
There kneels sweet Reverie with calmest eyes;
And Love all crowned with dewy asphodels,
Through green isles wanders in unconscious grace,
His face all luminous with glad surprise,
While from his lips transcendent music wells.
Limitations
The subtlest strain a great musician weaves,
Cannot attain in rhythmic harmony
To music in his soul. May it not be
Celestial lyres send hints to him? He grieves
That half the sweetness of the song, he leaves
Unheard in the transition. Thus do we
Yearn to translate the wondrous majesty
Of some rare mood, when the rapt soul receives
A vision exquisite. Yet who can match
The sunset's iridescent hues? Who sing
The skylark's ecstasy so seraph-fine?
We struggle vainly, still we fain would catch
Such rifts amid life's shadows, for they bring
Glimpses ineffable of things divine.
The Venus of Milo
O peerless marble marvel! what of grace,
Or matchless symmetry is not enshrined
In thy rare contours! Could we hope to find
The regal dignity of that fair face
In aught less beautiful? We would retrace,
At sight of thee, our willing steps where wind
The paths great Homer trod. Within whose mind
Wast thou a dream, O Goddess? Nearer pace
Brave Hector, reckless Paris, as we gaze;
Then stately temples, fluted colonnades
Rise in their sculptured beauty. Yes! 'tis Greece,
With all the splendor of her lordliest days,
That comes to haunt us: ere the glory fades
Let Fancy bid the rapture never cease.
The Quest of the Ideal
Fair Hope with lucent light in her glad eyes,
Fleet as Diana, through the meadow speeds;
Nor dewy rose nor asphodel she heeds,
For lo! unwonted radiance in the skies
Bids her not pause. The silv'ry shimmer lies
'Mid blooming vistas, whence the pathway leads
To heights aerial. The glow recedes
As panting Hope toils on, while awed surprise
Fills her sweet glances; will the vision fade
Ere she can reach it? Nay, 'tis lovelier far,
Rarer perspectives open to her gaze;
Then hasten on, expectantly, glad maid!
The splendor still will tremble there afar;
Yet count this quest the holiest of thy days
An Ocean Musing
Far, far out lie the white sails all at rest;
Like spectral arms they seem to touch and cling
Unto the wide horizon. Not a wing
Of truant bird glides down the purpling west;
No breeze dares to intrude, e'en on a quest
To fan a lover's brow; the waves to sing
Have quite forgotten till the deep shall fling
A bow across its vibrant chords. Then, lest
One moment of the sea's repose we lose,
Nor furnish Fancy with a thousand themes
Of unimagined sweetness, let us gaze
On this serenity, for as we muse.
Lo! all is restless motion: life's best dreams
Give changing moods to even halcyon days.
Emerson
On shinging heights where Thought with stately tread,
Leads on her willing votaries to fanes
Of holy inspiration, and Truth deigns
The radiance of her presence rare to shed,
In Solemn consecration thou wast led,
Spirit serene; and on the dewy plains,
Where Solitude in chastest grandeur reigns,
Thy musings e'en most daintily were fed.
Round thee winds played the choicest symphony,
And vistas of celestial beauty gleamed
Along thy pathway: so we weeping, say--
Though here with us thou may'st no longer be--
"He now has climbed the mount of which he dreamed,
Into the splendors of Immortal Day."
To Laura
In Mem'ry's fairest court a shrine is set,
Round which the fragrance of a sweet life clings,--
The essence of such rare and holy things
As Love alone can sanctify. The fret
And turmoil of the world avail not yet
To quench the sweetness; for an angel's wings
Are ever hov'ring near, and longing brings
A vision loved that makes the eyelids wet.
Dear sister, in those realms of radiant light
Where thou hast grown to know a richer lore
Than that of earth, sometimes remembrest thou
The hours of our companionship so bright
With joyance? Ay, but we shall meet once more,
And at God's throne in praise together bow.
CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM
To My Father
A leaf from Freedom's golden chaplet fair,
We bring to thee, dear father! Near her shrine
None came with holier purpose, nor was thine
Alone the soul's mute sanction; every prayer
Thy captive brother uttered found a share
In thy wide sympathy; to ever'y sign
That told the bondman's need thou didst incline.
No thought of guerdon hadst thou but to bear
A loving part in Freedom's strife. To see
Sad lives illumined, fetters rent in twain,
Tears dried in eyes that wept for length of days--
Ah! was not that a recompense for thee?
And now where all life's mystery is plain,
Divine approval is thy sweetest praise.
William Lloyd Garrison
Written for the Occasion of the Garrison Centenary,
December 10, 1905
Some names there are that win the best applause
Of noble souls; then whose shall more than thine
All honored be? Thou heardst the Voice Divine
Tell thee to gird thyself in Freedom's cause,
And cam'st in life's first bloom. No laggard laws
Could quench thy zeal until no slave should pine
In galling chains, caged in the free sunshine.
Till all the shackles fell, thou wouldst not pause.
So to thee who hast climbed heroic heights,
And led the way to where chaste Justice reigns,
An anthem,-- tears and gratitude and praise,
Its swelling chords,-- uprises and invites
A nation e'en to join the jubilant strains,
Which celebrate thy consecrated days.
Wendell Phillips
A knight of "silver tongue" and stately grace,
Dowered with th' immortal gift of fearlessness,
Whose falcon glance bent to detect distress,
Perceived a brother in each human face,
And deemed the lowliest worthy of a place
In the world's honors,-- such was he. T' impress
Men's minds with lofty purpose seemed success
To this great soul; and to uplift a race
From depths of sorrow compensation vast,
For much life leaves unrecompensed. The seal
Of heroism on his brow more fair
Than leafiest laurel was. Deeds that outlast
The warrior's victories his days reveal,
And unto him we render rev'rence rare.
Charles Sumner
Thine was a brain of Nature's finest mould,
Great Sumner! and thy spirit-poise as rare.
Born-- not to idly dream but nobly dare--
With all the mind's vast forces well controlled,
Thou, like Olympian Jove, didst wisely hold
Stern empire over justice. Thine the care,
That right should rule, and wrong, however fair
In outward seeming, should be shunned. Untold
The influence of thy magnanimity.
Alert in action, sage in counsel thou,
A statesman truly, not alone in name,
Thy regnant soul spurned ev'ry false decree.
Honor was graven on thy shield, and now
We fain would honor thee with loud acclaim.
Robert F. Shaw
When War's red banners trailed along the sky,
And many a manly heart grew all a flame
With patriotic love and purest aim,
There rose a noble soul who dared to die,
If only Right could win. He heard the cry
Of struggling bondmen and he quickly came,
Leaving the haunts where Learning tenders fame
Unto her honored sons; for it was ay
A loftier cause that lured him on to death.
Brave men who saw their brothers held in chains,
Beneath his standard battled ardently.
O friend! O hero! thou who yielded breath
That others might share Freedom's priceless gains,
In rev'rent love we guard thy memory.
Toussaint L'Ouverture
To those fair isles where crimson sunsets burn,
We send a backward glance to gaze on thee,
Brave Toussaint! thou wast surely born to be
A hero; thy proud spirit could but spurn
Each outrage on thy race. Couldst thou unlearn
The lessons taught by instinct? Nay! and we
Who share the zeal that would make all men free,
Must e'en with pride unto thy life-work turn.
Soul-dignity was thine and purest aim;
And ah! how sad that thou wast left to mourn
In chains 'neath alien skies. On him, shame! shame!
That mighty conqueror who dared to claim
The right to bind thee. Him we heap with scorn,
And noble patriot! guard with love thy name.
BALLADS AND OTHER POEMS
Rhyme of the Antique Forest
In the antique forest dreary,
Where the thrushes never weary,
Sang when Dawn with touch uncertain
Streaked with gold night's sable curtain,
Sang until the owlet muttered
At the faintest notes they uttered,
In the antique forest lonely,
Dwelt a pensive maiden only.
Was she maid, or sprite, or fairy,
Nature fashioned her so airy?
Wide her tresses, amber-tined
As if sunbeams through them glinted.
Reveries were calmly brooding
In her eyes and not intruding,
And her smile for every sweetness
Seemed to supplement completeness.
Had enchantment's wand waved o'er her
That the world lay strange before her?
Larks that cleave the ether singing,
Bore with song her musings winging
Toward the far unknown: would never
Stately knight or a warrior sever
Chains that bound one pure as sunrise,
Exquisite as perfect moonrise?
Rills within the forest glimmered,
Golden-green the leafage shimmered;
Grottoes dim with mossy ceiling,
Seemed some Dryad-haunt revealing.
Mid the tangled fretwork drifted
Hints of azure, zephyrs lifted
Fragrance from the strange wood flowers,
Dreaming in their sylvan bowers.
Lilies fair as snowflakes falling,
Roses Eastern climes recalling,
Buds whose liquid fire seemed vying
With the sun when day's a-dying
Blossoms diamond-tipped and creamy
In their heart's depth, all swung dreamy,
'Mid the forest trees emplanted
Where the light throught mazes slanted.
Lofty, foliage-empowered,
Stood the castle; fountains showered
High in air their glist'ning brightness,
Where the deer for every lightness
Leaped with noiseless footstep, staying
Oft to list to echoes straying
Through the court, as void of dwelling
Stray weird spirits sorrow telling.
Years agone these courts resounded
With the voice of eagle, hearts bounded
To the tones of love, eyes brightened
Under music's spell, mirth lightened
Ev'ry wasting care; yet sorrow
Lurks behind each joy, to-morrow
Oft belies to-day, and gladness
Seems projected into sadness.
One fair eve the Countess Una
Gazing on the sky where Luna
Dipped her silver horns, saw stealing
Through the woods a form revealing
Myst'ry in its pace; ay, nearer
Came a page and beckoned; clearer
Grew the light, and something told her
He had brought grief to enfold her.
At his words she tottered shrieking;
And full soon home bore they reeking
In his heart's blood, one who never
Quailed in battle now forever
Hushed in death. Sir Hubert, bravest
Of his kinsmen, yet the gravest,
Save with his bride-wife, when tender
Were the acts his love did render.
Soon there came despair to banish
A sweet babe, and grief did vanish
'Neath the mother-love enkindled
E'en to rapture; sorrow dwindled
To a holy mem'ry. Fairer
Grew the child and ever rarer
Her angelic smile, beseeching
Cherub mates beyond her reaching.
Yet while still her footsteps tender
Tottered round the hearth, to render
Joy unto the mother, slowly
Neared Death's angel and a holy
Peace came with the parting blessing
Una gave her babe; refreshing
Were the promises from Heaven
That to those who seek are given.
Sweeter grew the child, yet sadness
Seemed her comrade more than gladness
Called Bianca, all the fairness
Of the name betokened rareness
Of her spirit's chasteness, dovelike
Was her aspect and most lovelike
All her speech to those around her,
While a something weird enwound her.
In the shad'wy halls the maiden
Wandered lonely, ever laden
With her fresh soul's mystic dreaming.
Lore the still stars in their gleaming,
Taught her, and the rushing river,
Violets young and dew, the quiver
Of the wind-harps 'mid the branches,
And the sunset's golden lances.
And a gentle monk came teaching
Wisdom found in books, yet reaching
More the line of contemplation
Than aught active; meditation
On the sweep of moon-rays caught him
Fancy-bound, and! life had brought him
Inward visions; so his guiding
Made her dream-life more abiding.
As the years sped on, revealing
All her spirit's worth, came stealing
Something of that nameless longing
To a maiden's life belonging,
When the air seems palpitating
With Love's tender message; mating
Birds sing matins soft and tender;
All to Love the heart would render.
'Twas the magic sunset hour;
In the West a golden dower
Of rare filmy light was burning;
Radiant was the earth. Returning
From a ramble came the maiden
To her dream-nook. With sleep laden
Fell her drowsy lids, while thrushes
Sang amid the river rushes.
In the woods a knight was straying,
Lost in musing. Sunlight playing
O'er a mossy path invited
Him to linger. Birds alighted
Near him with their choicest chanting;
Sunbeams, like lit pearls, were slanting
O'er the water's wavy billows,
While the breeze sang in the willows.
Then the knight approached the bower
Where the maiden, like a flower,
Lay a-dreaming; there he started
At the vision; ne'er faint-hearted
Was he, but the thought came leaping
As he gazed upon her sleeping,
Was she maid, or sprite, or fairy,
Nature fashioned her so airy?
Rose-encolored, oval-moulded
Was her profile; eyelids folded
O'er her eyes hid deepest meaning
From the knight above her leaning.
Then she raised them very slowly,
In their sapphire depths some holy
Thought slept; was she supplicating
Spirits for her mandate waiting?
Thus they met, the maid descending
From her dream-nook; and the blending
Of their thoughts became a prelude
To Love's symphony. Each fair mood
Of the one e'en was reflected
In the other, till perfected
Was their intercourse, revealing
Depths of rare and tender feeling.
And their days passed by in gladness
With no note of aught of sadness
In their life-song. So one morning
When the dainty hues of dawning
Streaked the skies, they went a-straying
Through the meadows, where were playing
Wind-lyres through the trees, and dancing
Sunbeams o'er the lake were glancing.
Came a stately lady riding
On a palfrey, near the gliding
Waters of the stream. She started
When the two she saw, departed
Swiftly with a brow of ire,
And to brave the raging fire
In her breast, the reins firm tight'ning,
Sent the maid a glance like lightning.
Then Bianca, pale and trembling,
Yet spoke joyous words, dissembling
Thus her fear; for on the morrow
Must the knight speed forth, and sorrow
At the parting made those hours
Sacred ones. Of choicest flowers
He a garland wove, the fairest
One to crown with buds the rarest.
Months had sped. Sir Guy was eager
To return, but battle's rigor
Held him, and the maid grown weary
At his absence, to the dreary
Forest went one breezy morning;
There, without a sign of warning,
Came the stately lady, sweeping
Wide her flowing skirts and leaping
To a height of wrath and madness,
When she saw the maid; the sadness
Of her aspect no compassion
Waking in one so by passion
Swayed. In harshest tones she uttered
Cruel words: "O be not fluttered,
Maiden. Is Sir Guy departed?
Go he must, the craven-hearted.
"I his wife am, lady fairest.
Though thy face be of the rarest,
Me he wedded, to me plighted
Perfect troth. Now wronged and slighted,
Come I all his sin revealing,
Sin that will not near concealing.
All the tender love he gave thee,
From his treach'ry cannot save thee."
'Neath the maiden's dreamy Iashes
Something gleamed like lightning flashes
In her sapphire eyes; then slowly
Lifting them, so pure and holy,
To the lady's gaze, all keenly
Piercing hers, she with a queenly
Mien arose, plaintively saying,
"Naught is left us twain but praying."
In her soul where sorrow mingling
With despair sent the blood tingling
Through her veins, arose a vision
Of the love that made Elysian
All the future; and the yearning
Of her heart, the sudden turning
Of life's roseate page, made sadness
Something e'en akin to madness.
Then the false one swifty glided
Through the woods. He she derided,
Dreamed not that the maid he cherished,
Felt 'twere best her love had perished
Ere it burst to sweetest blooming.
Now as day grew near to nooning,
In a boat to seek the friar
Went she, while the weird wind-lyre
Sent its plaint across the billow.
Bowed with sorrow as the willow
Bends in tempests, long she uttered
Wails of grief. Her gold hair fluttered
O'er the boat's edge. In the gloaming
Rose the convent, sea birds roaming
Flung their wild lament to greet her.
But the monk ne'er came to meet her.
For the boat was fiercely driven
On the rocks, its sides all river.
By the lashing. And the maiden
With a heart so sorrow-laden,
What of her? Weak, wan and bleeding,
On a crag she lay, sore needing
Much that loving hands can render,--
Ministrations sweet and tender.
Soon a fisherman espied her,
And he gently knelt beside her.
Lifting carefully his burden
With no thought of aught of guerdon,
To his hut he sped; the morrow
Saw her eased somewhat of sorrow.
Ay, her humble friends found gladness
In their task to soothe her sadness.
One rare day when all the thrushes
Sang, and 'mid the river rushes
Lilies raised their lovely faces,
While anon in shady places
Silence held her resign, the maiden
With her soul so sorrow-laden,
Sought a fav'rite leafy bower,
Jess'mine-twined, with many a flower
Decked, and when the sunbeams sprinkled
Sprays of dainty light, while wrinkled
Were the waves the winds were kissing,
Mute she sat there, love's tones missing;
While her heart was sorely yearning
For a lost joy and returning
To a past with rapture gleaming,
Sweet and fairer than all dreaming.
Wrapped in melancholy's mazes,
Who is it that long time gazes
At her winsome beauty, heeding
Naught save that rare face, and needing
But a glance to send him kneeling
At her feet, his love revealing?
Just a breath, and something told her
He was waiting to enfold her.
In his arms where all of sadness
Quickly died, a little gladness
Soothed her, and the list'ning lover
Heard the tale that sought to cover
All his life with shame. Then nearer
Drew he to him one the dearer
For her pain. Now all her longing
Found its balm in love's new dawning.
For he told her Blanche the scornful,
Was his cousin, and the mournful
Tale rehearsed of parents planning
Their betrothal, only fanning
Him to discontent and leaving
In her heart a scar; e'en weaving
Round her life a spell of madness,
While his pulses leaped to gladness
When he freedom found. The father
Seeing his distress, would rather
Break the bond, and so they parted,
He and Blanche the haughty-hearted.
Then Bianca at the story
Felt her soul grow calm. The glory
Of the magic sunset hour
Threw a halo o'er her bower.
Ring-doves cooed with matchless quiver,
In their love-notes; swift the river
Sped, its silv'ry cadence chanting,
While the liquid sunbeams slanting
Down the mountain's chiseled ridges,
Made the dells a flame, the edges
Of the lucent lake enkindled.
In this peace all sorrow dwindled
Into nothingness. Together
With the thought that naught could sever,
Now their lives united, gladly
Spoke the happy lovers; sadly
Had the past been spent, now sweetest
Music in their souls rang; fleetest
Were Time's footsteps and the hours
Idyls fair as fairest flowers.
Soon a boat the lovers entered;
Toward the castle where were centered
All their early joys, fast speeding
Went they, all the wrath unheeding
Of the low'ring sky, till pealing
Burst the thunder, and the reeling
Of their boat awoke a shiver
In their breasts as raged the river.
And the wind howled loud and scattered
Far the rigging, and the tattered
Masts hung round them. Then the maiden,
Erst so worn and sorrow-laden,
And rent with emotions, slowly
Drooped and in her soul a holy
Calmness followed Love's fruition.
So, in accents of submission.
Told she to Sir Guy that never
Could their lives be joined, yet ever
Would he know that earth's affection
Rarest grew in Heaven's perfection.
Then the lover, tossed with sorrow
At her words, seemed but to borrow
Strength to brave the tempest's power.
So e'en at the sunset hour
Touched they land and la! the mutt'ring
Of the tempest ceased and flutt'ring
Cloudlets edged with rosy fringes,
As the Sun oped golden hinges,
To step in to rest, sailed lightly
O'er the sky, and glowing brightly
In the East the colors seven
Gloriously linked, seemed Heaven
There to bring; the rainbow's fairness
Glowed with such celestial rareness.
In this splendor did the maiden
To her lover so grief-laden,
Bid a fond farewell; yet never
Would their spirits seem to server.
Then in anguish and despairing
At his blasted hopes, but wearing
On his brow a calm reflected
From her dying peace, selected
He a spot strewn with rare flowers
Where she soon must lie, and hours
Long as at a shrine he'd tarry,
And his burdened heart could carry
There its grief for that sweet maiden
Whom he wept for, sorrow-laden.
In the antique forest dreary,
Where the thrushes never weary,
Sang when Dawn with touch uncertain
Streaked with gold night's sable curtain,
Sang until the owlets muttered
At the faintest notes they uttered,
In the antique forest lonely,
Slept the pensive maiden only.
After years of battle gladly,
Though sore wounded, where so sadly
He had sorrowed, came he dying,
And e'en on the loved grave lying,
Yielded he his life. Thus never
Were they parted and as ever,
In the antique forest dreary,
Sang the thrushes never weary.
Now within the forest lonely,
Rest the knight and maiden only.
Musidora's Vision
Fair Musidora starry-eyed,
With blue-black tresses floating wide,
And cheeks like tinted shells beside,--
Was seated in her tower one night,
Above the hills whose purple light
Merged in the moonlight's golden-white.
Her garments girdle-clasped, flowed round
By zephyrs stirred with leafy sound,
An amethyst her forehead crowned.
Afar surged the eternal sea,
Nigh, droves cooed in the bloss'ming tree,
And shadows crossed the gloomy lea.
But neither billows crested white,
Nor blossoms fairest to the sight,
Could woo her soul from thought that night.
She lingered at her telescope,
While through far worlds her mind did grope,
With something of unuttered hope.
The searching glass the stars had brought,
In answer to her earnest thought,
And fast the tiny thread she caught,--
Whose labyrinthine mazes lead
Through paths of splendor, rare indeed
To those who all their myst'ries heed.
She gazed and mused and gazed again;
Calm science yielded richest gain,
But could not soothe her nameless pain.
Then with a gesture of despair,
She clasped her slender hands so fair,
And raised her eyes as if in prayer.
How came the lady in the tower,
On gloomy leas, at such an hour,
When rarest beauty was her dower?
Her father was a knight so bold
His deeds of prowess ne'er were told;
And all uncounted was his gold.
A picture in her father's hall,
Gazing with pensive smile, was all
Her sainted mother to recall.
She loved Sir Roderic the brave,
And tender was the love he gave,
Knight great of heart, of aspect grave.
But one sad morn, in conflict dire,
When war was venting all its ire,
Slain were the lover and the sire.
She wrung her hands, fair Musidore,
She fastened up her bower door,
And vowed she'd see the world no more.
She bound her blue-black tresses back,
And nursed her soul, hungry for lack
Of love and bruised on sorrow's rack.
But sorrow nursed becomes despair;
So yielding all her heart in prayer,
She craved of life some little care.
And one calm dawn when larks began
With song, celestial heights to fan,
She left the busy haunts of man.
Up in a tower to scan the skies,
And woo weird Nature's sage replies,
She went to hush despairing sighs.
And on the night when science wise
Failed to appease her restless cries,
Sweet dreams slid through her hazel eyes.
A vision met her eager gaze:
A palace gem-set, through the haze
Of clustered star and planet rays,
Gleamed rose-resplendent, in the air;
Fairer than could with greatest care
Rise to the architect's fond prayer.
There, shone illumined pillars veined
With crystal tracery, and stained
With blood-red hues round which were trained
Rare purple buds and amaranths pure,
So fragrant, gods they would allure
A life with mortals to endure.
The dome upon these pillars lay,--
The constellated Milky Way,
Where bright-eyed stars 'mid snowstorms play.
The palace carpet was of flowers,
Fairer than e'er in Naiad's bowers
Were spread to woo the dancing Hours.
A fountain silver waters flung;
Through greenest foliage rose-bells hung
A-trembling where the zephyrs sung.
From arch to arch air-curtains slid,
The pure blue iris shyly hid
Pale regal aster blooms amid.
Through the calm silence of the place
Soft music stole with soothing grace;
Transfigured seemed the list'ner's face.
On high with all the myst'ry blent,
Eolian harps their sweetness lent,
And through the palace such strains sent
Celestial symphonies they seemed;
And Musidora fondly dreamed
Her angel mother on her beamed.
Three marble columns interlaced
With porphyry, the entrance faced,
On which these words were finely traced:
On the first column simply, "Sad,"
"Because," the second only had,
"Alone," was all the third did add.
Mused Musidora: "What is this?
Methinks it were the deepest bliss,
Apart from love's sweet smile and kiss,--
"To dwell within these fairy halls,
Where fountains echo to our calls,
And rarest landscapes deck the walls.
"But who comes here? I seem to see
A mortal: do my senses flee,
Or is she really like to me?"
A lady clad in spotless white,
With eyes like stars some frosty night,
And hair disheveled, rose to sight.
Where did she come from? Like a sprite
From fair fount rising, jeweled bright
With sunbeams, there she did alight.
She hoped her chiseled lips to speak,
Her countenance all shining meek,
Yet sad as one whom Grief might seek.
She said: "O stranger sweet of face,
And moving with majestic grace,
How cam'st thou in this saddest place?"
Then Musidora: "Know I not
How in this strange, enchanting spot
I came, but would it were my lot
"Within these halls to spend my days,
Soothed by the fountain's silv'ry lays,
And utt'ring naught save hymns of praise."
Then said the sad one: "Dwell with me,
Though mine the palace that you see,
Alone I cannot happy be.
"Saw'st thou the columns at the gate?
Those words I utter early, late;
Alas! They speak my tragic fate.
"Come, come and love me, Lady fair,
I will requite thee with fond care,
And for thee shall be all my prayer."
They clasped each other hand in hand;
Each would the other understand,
Her name would know, her native land.
Heart throbbed to heart as soft they kissed.
Silence was in that place, I wist;
The fountain even seemed to list.
The vision fled as morning broke,
And at the matin bell's faint stroke,
Glad Musidora slowly woke.
Up to the radiant, calm air,
She raised her eyes in holy prayer,
In thanks that life was still so fair.
And then the dreamer earnest-eyed,
Therw back her tresses, wand'ring wide,
Clasped close her hands and nobly cried:
"Selfish I long have been and blind,
My duty I can only find
In love and suffering with mankind."
Echo's Complaint
O rare Narcissus! sunny-haired!
O mild-eyed youth of godlike mien!
O thou that sittest by fair streams,
And in their trembling, silv'ry sheen
Thy lovely countenance dost view,
Turn but once more thy magic gaze
On one who utters sad complaint,
One who will love thee many days.
'Mid sylvan haunts I dwelt of yore,
Where morning mists shone wondrously,
And fountains flung their diadems
Of liquid rainbows. Unto me
Each day was gladness; grottoes cool
With trickling rills and murm'rous leaves,
Lured me to seek their spacious shades;
But not for these my spirit grieves.
When Dawn in rose-decked chariot strewed
Pale gold down Twilight's violet aisles,
I first beheld thee: ah! how fair!
I trembled 'neath thy radiant smiles.
Thou pensive, glidedst through the groves,
While I, unthought of, with the breeze
In lightness vying--followed near,
Did not some spell thy spirit seize?
I sighed: naught save the wanton wind
Returned my plaint. Thou, peerless youth,
Back tossed thy amber tresses; glad
Thou sangst, for me thou hadst no ruth
Day threw gold arrows o'er the plain,
And glist'ning grew each vine-clad height;
Stars robed in silver tissues, paced
To solemn music, welcoming Night,--
Ere my sad soul could utter low
To thee its grief. Rememb'rest thou
That evening? All the lawns were bright
With lum'nous splendor; o'er the brow
Of you fair mount, the stately moon
Looked call-eyed on the sleeping world;
In the dim glades rare asters lay
On grassy banks, all dew-impearled.
On high Olympus mighty gods
Held carnival with matchless song.
Yea, earth was jubilant, yet I,
Apart from all the festive throng,
Told to thine ear my soul's complaint.
Thou didst not heed my spirit's moan;
Then pity now, O peerless one!
Oh! leave me not unloved and lone.
Gaze not within the sunlit stream
So ling'ringly, there but to see
What in my soul is mirrored: may
Not eyes of love thy mirror be?
Come, rare Narcissus! deign to smile
On Echo, nymph in sore distress,
Who ever, shadow-like, will go
With thee, till thou shalt love confess.
'Tis said I'm fair and love for thee
Will make me fairer, ay, as fair
As glorious Aphrodite, come
And let me kiss thy sunny hair,
Thy marble brow; ay, let me kiss
Thy dewy lips, thy peerless eyes.
One clasp from thee, one long love-clasp
Will change to joy-notes all my sighs.
Thus wailed sad Echo: but to all
Her lamentation naught replied
Unmoved Narcissus; and the nymph,
Sweet Echo, thus in love sore tried,
Was seen no more; but on the breeze
Her voice was heard, her voice alone
Was left, -- an answ'ring cadence there
Love thrilling still its ling'ring tone.
Antigone and Oedipus
Slow wand'ring came the sightless sire and she,
Great-souled Antigone, the Grecian maid,
Leading with pace majestic his sad steps,
On whose bowed head girm Destiny had laid
A hand relentless; oft the summer breeze
Raised the gold tresses from her veinèed cheek,
As with a dainty touch, so much she seemed
A being marvelous, regal yet meek.
Thus spake sad Oedipus: "Ah! whither now,
O daughter of an aged sire blind,
Afar from Thebes' pure, crested colonnades,
Shall we, sad exile, rest and welcome find?
Who will look on us with a pitying eye?
But unto me sweet resignation's balm
Suff"ring and courage bring; yet moments come
When naught restores my spirit's wonted calm.
"O rare dim vales and glitt'ring sunlit crags!
O vine-clad hills soft with the flush of dawn!
O silver cataract dancing to the sea,
And shad'wy pines and silent dewy lawn!
I ne'er can see you more. Alas! alas!
But whither go we? Speak! O daughter fair;
Thou must indeed be sight unto thy sire.
Does here a temple consecrate the air?"
"My father! grieve not for our distant land."
Thus made Antigone reply: "I see
Amid the forest's music-echoing aisles,
A spot of peace and blest repose for thee.
In solemn loftiness the towers rear
Their stately pinnacles; my eyes behold
The holy laurel decked in festive robes,
The olive pale, waving in sunset-gold.
"In the green leafage, tender nightingales
Are chanting dulcet harmonies meanwhile,
In the clear river's liquid radiance
The early stars, of when resplendent, smile.
It is a sacred spot; here we may shun
Dangers that threaten, and in sweet content
Ere we need wander more, a few short days
May in these hallowed shades be calmly spent.
My father! sorrow not because of Fate!
Perchance the gods may kindly deign to look
With glance benignant on our mournful doom.
Together thou and I, can we not brook
Th' assaults of stern-browed Destiny? May not
The fatal mesh contain some golden thread,
Ere it be spun complete with all of woe?
Father! my father! raise thy drooping head!"
"Immortal asphodels ne'er crowned a brow
More queenlike than is thine, my peerless child,
Calm-browed Antigone! an woe! sad fate!"
Then spake Antigone with aspect mild:
"My father! cease thy sadness! wherefore grieve?
Oh! let us dream that from the azure sky,
The gods gaze on us with a pitying glance.
Oh! let us hope a little ere we die!"
Anita and Giovanni
Through the dusky purple glimmer
   Of a twilight sky,
Clear uprise the fountain's shimmer,
   Jets of spray flashed high.
In the gardens zephyrs only
   Fanned the myrtle leaves,
Through the hush of meadows lonely,
   Sighed the golden sheaves.
In the vineyards grapes were purpling
   'Mid the foliage green,
Mountains dim stood up encircling
   Dreamy vales between.
On a bank with flowers laden,
   By the Arno's tide,
Sat a cavalier and maiden
   Musing, side by side.
He was strong-limbed, but false-hearted,
   Lithe and willowy she;
Naught save truth could have imparted
   Her expression free
From a shadow of dissembling,
   Yet Love ruled her gaze,
And her veiled eyes mused, resembling
   Star-gleams through the haze.
Unsuspicious was the lover
   That the maid knew well
Of the wrong his smiles would cover;
   So he begged her tell
Why she sat mute in the gleaming,
   Heeding not his words;
Why her very glance seemed roaming
   With the restless birds.
Ay, the lover's looks were tender,
   Well he could disguise;
Yet there gleamed a tragic splendor
   In the maiden's eyes.
"Giovanni, thou decevest",
   Calmly said she then;
"If in women thou believest,
   I believe not men!"
Slow she raised her long dark lashes,
   Showing weird brown eyes,
Where a glance like lightning flashes,
   Vied with calm surprise.
And her gaze, than words far keener,
   Pierced her lover through.
"Canst thou love the fair Hermina,
   And Anita too?
"Shall I tell thee of thy wooing,
   O false lover mine?
How thou cam'st in capture suing,
   And my heart was thine?
Shall I tell thee how I shivered
   When I heard the same
Tender words to which I'd quivered,
   Breathed to her I name?
"'Twas the sunset hour and slowly
   Strolled we through the meadows fair,
While the vesper bell so holy,
   Poured its pleading on the air.
O'er the waves the cadence trembled,
   And the sky was golden-red,
And our loving words resembled
   Lispings of the birds o'erhead.
"Ling'ring in the citron bower,
   Thou didst clasp my hand in thine,
Placing in my hair a flower,
   And `Carissima, be mine,
For I love thee only, only!--
   Soft thou murmur'dst in my ear,
And my heart, before so lonely,
   Gave its all without a fear.
"Last eve, 'mid the grape leaves sitting,
   Plunged in tender reveries,
Gazed I on the moonbeams flitting--
   Tinted crystals-- o'er the seas.
Sad the nightingale was singing,
   And I caught his pensive mood,
Melancholy music bringing
   Charms that cannot be withstood.
"Sudden heard I voices quiver,
   Were they in the air or nigh?
Something made me pale and shiver,
   Something told me thou wert by.
Did no pitying spirit warn thee?
   Hope offtimes our fear belies;
Yet the nightingale gazed on me
   With compassion in his eyes.
"Thou didst clasp her hand, false lover,
   Place a flower in her hair;
O'er her thou didst fondly hover,
   And I gasped in wild despair.
'Fair Hermina, thy sweet glances,
   All my soul with rapture fill;
None like thee,'-- thou saidst-- `entrances
   Love me, bid my fears be still!'
"That was all I heard no longer,
   And I hungered for love's sake;
Yea! my love grew fiercer, stronger,
   And I knew my heart would break
Unless peace came with the dawning;
   So, resolved to break the chain,
I cast love away, grasped scorning;
   Scorn can conquer deepest pain"
Then the lady paused: the lover
   Blanching, called her name.
"Sweet Anita, do not cover
   My best love with shame;
For I knew not what I uttered
   In the grove, yestreen.
Love me, love me," low he muttered,
   "Try me, noble queen!"
"Cease! false cavalier, thy weeping!
   Love has changed to scorn;
That heart is not worth the keeping,
   Would to two belong.
If the lady's eyes are sweeter,
   Go! thy suit renew!
Who would win the proud Anita
   Can no other woo!"
Listening Nydia
Meanwhile Nydia, when separated by the throng from Glaucus and Ione, had in vain endeavored to regain them.... Again and again she returned to the spot where they had been divided-- to find her companions gone-- "Last Days of Pompeii."
Breathless she stood, her graceful head bent low,
And dinty fingers round her chiseled ear;
The cherished staff held tenderly as erst,
When knew the tender heart nor grief nor fear.
A startled dove she seemed amid the gloom
And wrath of Nature wakened from soft dreams;
Yet her imploring soul's reflection shone
Like the rare moonlight over summer streams.
The ashes seemed to leave her fragile form
Unharmed, despite the fierce volcanic show'rs;
She listened in an agony of doubt,
Fair Nydia, lately twining fairest flow'rs.
Her sightless eyes seemed praying, lightly veil
By quivering silken lashes wet with tears;
The mystic soul that leaps o'er bound's had made
The child a woman, bowed 'neath weight of years.
Aglow with hope, with love-light luminous,
Her features shone pure in the fitful gleams
That broke o'er column, arch and fleeing slave,
O'er speechless gladiator and blue streams.
Expectancy's embodied model she,
The potent force of gesture all suppressed;
But in her motionless, intent repose,
The soul's arrested pleading was confessed.
The mountain lava-washed, raised menacing
Its peaks majestic toward the brooding sky;
And unappeared, the earth groaned piteously,
While multitudes aghast, fled cowering by,
But still pale Nydia stood amid the wreck,
In sculptured attitude: the broken lights
Shed magic radiance o'er her, and she gleamed
Like a chaste vision caught on starlit nights.
Blind Nydia! proud Pompeii's flower-nymph!
Child of rare intuitions, hidden sight!
Was it the moaning of the far off sea,
Or yearning love that chose thy path aright?
But though for thee, alas! none listeneth,
Type of devotion! thou immortal art!
Clad in renunciation's purest robes,
Enshrined with love in each devoted heart!
Mignon
What art thou, Mignon, child of mystery?
A woodbird e'en in galling fetters caught?
Dwelling apart in charmed reverie,
Crushed by the weight of undeveloped thought,
Thou seem'st some weird, sad spirit of the Past,
Guarding a secret life cannot unfold;
Yet was thy soul's calm rapture lily-pure,
Thy heart's fond treasures bright as rarest gold.
Dim pictures of soft skies and orange groves,
Of marble statues with their pitying gaze,
Lured thee to musing; while the cloudlets built
An airy path for thee amid the haze.
Sweet are thy songs of longing; thou didst dream
Of sunny isles where no rude questioner
Shall need to ask of man or woman more, *
And no unrest thy weary soul shall stir.
What depths of sorrow in thy dreamy life,
Around which Mem'ry wove a subtle chain;
Thy ev'ry gesture, ev'ry glance expressed
Intensity of yearning deep with pain,
Yet lit by Hope's illuminating smile;
Faith hov'ring over thee, thou phantom bright.
Shed gleams along thy tragic path, until
Thy spirit's wings unfolded in the Light.

The Fisherman's Story
Draw a little closer, comrades!
For I promised you should know
How I found my little Alice,
In the storm so long ago.
Hear the wind? 'tis but an echo
Of the fury of that hour;
Nature seemed in mood defiant,
Proving well her utmost power.
Loud the tempest roared and muttered,
High the breakers dashed that night;
Stiff' and stark against the heavens
Stood the cliffs so marble white.
Many a storm I've weathered, comrades,
But a something strangely sad
Seemed to seize upon my spirit,--
Feelings I had never had.
In my window burned a rush-light,
And the curtains were half drawn,
While I gazed upon the billows,
Thinking of my lot forlorn,
Of my Jennie in the churchyard,
And our only boy, our pride,
Sleeping far beneath the surges,
Ever since that Christmas-tide.
Oh! the wind that moaned that midnight!
Never fiercer tempest raged
As I strode into the darkness,
Feeling like a bird long caged;
And the thought of human beings
Tossed perchance, upon the sands,
Helped me climb the rocky ledges,
Made me, clench my wrinkled hands.
Sudden as I turned the headland
There I saw what I had dreamed;
For the black hull of a vessel,
By the breakers sorely seamed,
Lay still heaving: all was over.
Bodies whence the life had fled,
Strewed the wet rocks. I, the living,
Stood alone amid the dead.
While I scanned the ruin closely,
With my torch-light lifted high,
Something glistened through the shadows
Like a star dropped from the sky.
'Twas a babe's eyes, large and lustrous,
And as if in holy prayer,
She with look of strange beseeching,
Gazed through her dead mother's hair.
Tenderly I raised the wee one
Breathing there amidst the dead;
How the wind shrieked through the cordage!
How the tempest ragedo'er-head!
Tenderly I bore her homeward
To the fisher's dreary cot;
Like a star her presence' radiance
Much has cheered my lonely lot.
Now draw closer, faithful comrades!
When I viewed the mother's face,
Who was it but little Mary,
Flaxen-haired and full of grace;
Mary, favorite of the village--
And I loved her somewhat too--
But she loved a foreign soldier,
And her life-work now was through.
So I brought the little Alice
To my hearth so poor and lone;
Now she's left me for another,
For a fireside of her own.
Happiness attend her, comrades!
For my strength is getting low,
And I would not grudge the pleasure
She may with another know.
Now draw closer still, my comrades!
Hear the tempest raging high!
Though the stars are veiled in darkness,
They are steadfast in the sky.
So, although our days are dreary,
Let us take what joy we may!
With the courage of a hero,
Let us live our little day!
Snow Song
From the sombre clouds fell snow
On the meadows far below,
On the river late so calm,
When the waves had hushed their psalm.
Through the softly falling snow
Something fluttered to and fro,
Gold light shimmered through the snow;
And a murmur filled the air.
Was it melody or prayer?
Like resplendent shooting stars
Radiance gleamed through snow-flake bars;
Through the silence of the night,
Said the trav'ler on the height,
"What can be that vision rare?"
'Twas a maid with golden hair,
Singing in the frosty air,
Ay-- a carol faint and low,
Through the softly falling snow.
Glad the shepherd piped at home,
And the hunter feared to roam,
For the waves had hushed their psalms
Folded in the ice king's arms.
But the echoes brought a strain
To the ear against the pane,
As the maid sang this refrain:
"Life hath joy and life hath woe!"
Through the softly falling snow.
Plaintively the weird notes fell
With a sorrow in their swell;
Tenderly the soft voice rose,
Speaking pain and yet repose.
Said the knight with hasty feet,
"What can be that music sweet,
Quickening the warm heart's beat?"
"Life hath joy and life hath woe!
Through the softly falling snow.
Thicker fell the snowflakes white,
Wilder grew the stormy night;
Louder, stronger came the strain,
Deeper with its sense of pain.
And the golden radiance still
Shimmered 'neath the ice-bound hill,
As she sang with deathless will;
"Life hath love: ah! be it so!
Through the softy falling snow.
As the swan's most perfect lay
Tells it may not longer stay,
So those flute-like notes seemed lent
By some seraph earthward sent.
Yet once more the calm voice rose,
Faint, but sweet with rare repose,
And the strain did not quite close.
"Life hath love," was all to flow
Throught the softly falling snow.
Pastoral
Annette came through the meadows
Where daffodils did blow;
A bonnie maid, a winsome maid,
With hat all drooping low
O'er eyes of wistful candor;
Did ever timid swain
Look in their depths, their liquid depths,
And hope for peace again?
'Twas sunset on the meadows,
And down the leafy lane,
With tinkling, tinkling, mellow bells
That made a soft refrain,
The drowsy cows passed homeward;
While in the orchard green,
The robins trilled their gayest songs,
All earth was glad, I ween.
A youth came through the meadows,
The squire's son was he;
He saw the maiden's rosy blush,
And thought none fair as she.
"Which way, O sweetest damsel,
Go I to yonder town?"
Quoth he: She archly showed the path,
With hat all drooping down.
Beneath the broad brim gazed he
Into her shining eyes,
Then with true grace said: "Thanks, dear maid."
And when the sunset skies
Grew dimmer, rode he forward,
Saying with gentle pain,
"Ah! what a bonnie, comely maid,
I'll ride, that way again."
Annette came through the meadows,
No unaccustomed thing;
And yet, and yet, what new, new song
Was it her heart did sing?
Was she the selfsame maiden?
Nay! not the one of yore,
For in that heart a siren note
Will ring forevermore.
IDYL
Sunrise
Down in the dell,
A rose-gleam fell
From azure aisles of space;
There with light tread
A maiden sped,
Sweet yearning in her face.
Amid the sheen,
The lark, I ween,
Trilled love-lays to his mate;
The maiden sang,
Her joy-notes rang;
"He cometh, so I wait"
Noontide
Upon the grass,
Soft! let her pass!
Bend back, ye purple flow'rs!
With fawn-like grace,
Hope in her face,
She nears those sylvan bow'rs,--
Where sunbeams glide
This fair noontide,
And tint each bending bough,
And many a fold
Of purest gold,
Enwreathes her marble brow.
Yes! he is there!
The amber air
Grows soft with love-notes, while
Such perfect peace
It ne'er should cease,
Illumes her eyes and smile.
Sunset
In western skies
Rare radiance lies
Aslant from jeweled seas.
The nightingale
Tells not a tale
More tender to the breeze
Than he to her;
No thought could stir
The calm within her soul.
When life's a dream,
Does it not seem
That love can all control?
Midnight
The gem-like stars
Through fleecy bars
Send down their ambient light;
'Tis Splendor's reign,
Before her fane,
Each suppliant kneels to-night.
The Tryst is o'er,
Yet what a store
Of love the maid doth hold.
The gift is fair
As moon-kissed air,
And bright as burnished gold.
The Enchanted Shell
Fair, fragile Una, golden-haired,
With melancholy, dark gray eyes,
Sits on a rock by laughing waves,
Gazing into the radiant skies;
And holding to her ear a shell,
A rosy shell of wondrous form;
Quite plaintively to her it coos
Marvelous lays of sea and storm.
It whispers of a fairy home
With coral halls and pearly floors,
Where mermaids clad in glist'ning gold
Guard smilingly the jeweled doors.
She listens and her weird gray eyes
Grow weird'er in their pensive gaze.
The sea birds toss her tangled curls,
The skiff lights glimmer through the haze.
O strange sea-singer! what has lent
Such fascination to thy spell?
Is some celestial guardian
Prisoner within thee, tiny shell?
The maid sits rapt until the stars
In myriad shining clusters gleam;
"Enchanted Una," she is called
By boatmen gliding down the stream.
The tempest beats the restless seas,
The wind blows loud, fierce frown the skies,
Sweet, sylph-like Una clasp the shell,
Peace brooding in her quiet eyes.
The wind blows wilder, darkness comes,
The rock is bare, night birds soar far;
Thick clouds scud o'er the gloomy heav'ns
Unvisited by any star.
Where is quaint Una? On some isle,
Dreaming 'mid music, may she be?
Or does she listen to the shell
In coral halls within the sea?
The boatmen say, on stormy nights
They see rare Una with the shell,
Sitting in pensive attitude.
Is it a vision? Who can tell?
Chateaux En Espagne
Ethel in her crimson row boat,
Floats amid the river reeds;
Dreaming dreams of nameless longing,
Little she the gleaming heeds.
Castles grand and rare in beauty
Rise on pinnacles of air;
Knights on royal steeds salute her,
And she listens to their prayer.
One with winning speech draws near her,
May not took a long delay;
So she bows her head in answer,
For she cannot say him nay.
Bows her head,--ah, yes! fair Ethel!
Now thy golden locks are caught
In the pliant river rushes,
And the, knight whose pleading sought
Thee to capture, is a phantom.
Where the castles in the air?
Faded in the misty gloaming,
With the love that thine would share.
Hasten home! sweet fairy Ethel,
To the cottage in the lane;
Surely when the years have vanished,
Knight and love will come again.
The Fading Skiff
The moon hung low 'mid clouds enshrined,
The waves caught in its sheen,
Dashed up the rugged cliffs; the sky
Wore a mysterious mien.
I watched a skiff, a fragile skiff,
From out my window's height,
Whose shad'wy gliding seemed attuned
To that enchanted night.
He did not know that I was there
To soothe my soul's unrest;
I watched the flutter of the sails,
Far down the starry west,
And felt my heart in unison
Keep flutt'ring with its pain;
Yet why uplift my dreary plaint,
Does the sweet moon complain?
He went to meet her in the town,
Grand Sybil, proud and fair.
He did not know that he had left--
Beside his raven hair--
Strange yearnings in a maiden's heart,--
A fisher maiden she.
But ah! alas! he could not know,
To sail away from me.
He said my eyes were sapphires rare,
He called my hair bright gold;
Then left me with this aching pain,
And the great world so cold.
Yet why complain? Is it not best
To have Love's gracious boon
E'en for awhile? I cannot tell:
What think'st thou, silver moon?
The Maid of Ehrenthal
Fair nights beneath the mellow moon,
Foul nights when Nature's wildest tunes'
The tempest howled, on high,
A maiden sat in wan despair,
Veiled in her shining golden hair,
And this her piteous cry:
"ye nettles gray, spring up, ah! quick!
My head's aflame, my soul is sick;
My love awaits the bridal morn,
It cannot come till ye be grown;
Of your sharp strands the robe to spin,
Ere I my only love can win.
"A bridal robe fine spun for me,
And then a shroud; whose can it be?
'Neath these green mounds my parents sleep,
From their hearts' dust your roots must creep.
So said the cruel master: woe!
That I must p'en be wedded so!"
From out the gloomy mine at night,
Weird spirits came, and ere the light
Played verdant on the hill,
Behold the nettles, robe and shroud,
By dwarf hands spun, with craft endowed
Such missions to fulfill.
She wears the robe, the master proud,
Pale in death's sleep, lies in the shroud
By hands uncanny plied.
No longer now in wan despair,
But roses in her shining hair,
She smiles, a joyous bride.
Mildred's Doves
The moan of doves in immemorial elms.-- Tennyson's "princess."
Fair Mildred wide her lattice threw,
And beckoned tenderly:
"Come, glad wood doves, come, pretty doves,
And coo a while to me!
Come nestle fondly in my arms,
As hopes do in my breast,
That list'ning to your cadence sweet
May lull my fears to rest."
The doves from out the branches flew,
And nestled round the maid;
She whisp'ring low her lover's name,
Gazed wistful down the glade.
The postman halted at the gate,
Pale Mildred's heart beat high;
"Why comes he here instead of Ralph?
O Sorrow, pass me by!"
He quick unto the lattice sped,
She read, then cried aloud:
"Alas! my Ralph beneath the waves,
With seaweed for a shroud!
It cannot be! it may not be!
Depart! ye cruel dreams!
Depart ye doves, sad, moaning doves!
Your song a mock'ry seems!"
The orange moon rose in the east,
The flow'rs swayed in the breeze;
Unconsciously yet mournfully,
The doves cooded in the trees.
She wrung her hands imploringly,
"Ah! woe is me! I seem
To be unwaking; cease, sad doves!
He lives! 'tis but a dream!"
Little Fay's Thanksgiving
The squire sat alone beside the board,
So lavish with its sumptuous fare that day,
With costly glass, and shining silver decked;
But naught could banish gloomy thought away
From his deep musing. 'Twas Thanksgiving, yes!
Yet could he offer thanks with no one near
To join in grateful praises? Why to-day
Was he so utterly devoid of cheer?
What were the words the preacher said that morn,
Words that so smote upon his weary heart?
"Lo! as ye've done it to the least of these,
Ye've done it unto me." Had he a part
In that sweet homily? Then why alone
Sat he to-day beside his sumptuous board?
Were there no poor to feed, no famished ones,
To catch some crumbs from his abundant hoard?
And as he sadly mused a vision seemed
To lure him backward, for his Mattie came,--
His only daughter who had wed with one,
In whom his poverty was counted shame
Unto the squire, and he cast her off,
His child, his only child, and then she died;
And now, yea! all his gold he'd freely give
To have her back--so humble was his pride.
The squire woke and raised his weary head;
There stood the table with its dainties piled.
But hark! he hears the patter of a foot;
A low, soft tread as of a little child.
Yes! gazing at him with wide, wistful eyes,
He saw a tiny girl of winsome face--
Clasping her rosy fingers round a shawl--
Whose ev'ry attitude spoke childish grace.
"My wee one, who art thou?" the squire said:
"I'm little Fay and live with grandpa there
Down by the big elm tree," the child replied,
Smiling and throwing back her tangled hair.
"Grandpa is blind and pretty baskests weaves
While I sing to him," prattled little Fay;
"But grandpa's sick and all the bread is gone,
And so I've come, for 'tis Thanksgiving Day.
"And Sallie Wayne, the girl who lives next door,
Says ev'ry one must have a feast to-day;
A great big turkey and some pies and cakes;
And so I've come-- you're very rich, they say--
And you must send my grandpa, o, a lot
Of goodies, and he'll eat and cry and say,
'Oh! what a happy grand,pa I must be,'
And then he'll end: 'God bless thee, little Fay!"
She ceased a moment and the squire rubbed
His moistened eyes, and kissed the trustful child;
And though the snow a fleecy curtain hung
About the windows and the wind shrieked wild,
He sent a bounteous store to that drear home;
For was it not that unto such as she--
The little ones-- we should do loving dent?
And a changed man from that glad day was he.
"Grandpa, I've brought your dinner, o come quick!
Cried little Fay who from a carriage stepped;
And then the blind man rose with happy heart
From the low pallet where he long had slept.
Oh! what a feast they had, grandpa and she;
It was indeed a glad Thanksgiving Day!
And as he raised his sightless eyes to Heav'n
In thanks, he cried: "God bless thee, little Fay!"
CHANSONS D'AMOUR
The Dawn of Love
Within my, casement came one night
The fairy Moon, so pure and white.
Around my brow a coronet
Of shining silver quaintly act
With rainbow gems, she there did place;
But when I turned my wistful face,
Lo! she had vanished, and my gaze
Saw naught save shadows 'mid the haze.
I felt a throb within my heart,
In which sad sorrow had no part;
Within my soul a yearning grew,
So sweet it thrilled me through and through.
A flute's soft warble echoed nigh,
As if an angel fluttered by;
And on my lips there fell a kiss;--
Speak! fairy moon, interpret this!
The Siren Bird
A little bird, a tender bird,
Flew singing 'neath my eaves;
Its note was one that in the soul!
Unrest and yearning leaves.
'Twas not the bluebird on the branch,
'Twas not the lark on high,
Sending delicious melody
From deeps of pearly sky.
'Twas not the robin to his mate,
Piercing the matin air,
'Twas not the dove in shady wood,
Pouring mysterious prayer.
What are thou, art thou, wee, wee bird
Bathed in ecstatic song?
Those burnished plumes, that siren strain
Must to strange realms belong.
'Twas Love came singing 'neath my eaves,
My heart's eaves, tenderly;
And this the burthen of his song;
"Sweet, may I dwell with thee?"
O mystic bird, come home to me!
Here dwell and muse and sing;
Lull me forever with that strain,
Fold me beneath thy wing!
Reunited
Sang a maiden in a meadow;
O so lonely though so fair;
And her plaintive carol fluttered
Like, a psalm along the air.
Soon a youth came gaily tripping,
Full of fawn-like, airy grace;
And he heard the maiden singing,
And he looked in her sweet face.
In her lovely face so mournful,
Where her star-eyes gleamed with tears,
And he said: "Fair maid, take comfort!
For I've loved thee many years,
"Oft thou camest like a vision,
Flinging wide thy golden hair,
While thine eyes, so sweet, so holy,
Seemed to make for me a prayer.
"Long I've sought thee in the meadow,
List'ning ever, for thy song;
Thou art she, that radiant vision,
To each other we belong."
Light he tripped along the mountains,
With the maiden by the hand;
And I heard her joyous carol
Echoing through the summer land.
Love's Vista
Love oped a vista rare with stars
That overshone a dewy height;
Glad-Heart enwrapt in dreams, saw naught
Save radiance and bloom and light.
The fairest dove sang in the boughs
The sweetest songs that e'er were heard;
Glad-Heart strayed reckless down the glade,
Lured strangely by the cooing bird.
Yes! strangely lured, till suddenly
The dove did moan and wail, and lo!
The stars went out in darkness: all
Was bitterness and gloom and woe.
Ah! haste, Glad-Heart, go back, go back!
The vistas are not bloomy now;
Veiled is the dewy height: henceforth
Unto the tempest bare thy brow.
Yet sweet, sweet dove, when life is drear,
Come chant again that dreamy lay;
O tender Love, send shining stars.
To light her soul, once more, some day.
My Spirit's Complement
Thy life that touched the edges of my life,
All glistening and moist with sunlit dew.
They touched, they paused--then drifted wide apart,
Each gleaming with a rare prismatic hue.
'Twas but a touch! the edges of a life
Alone encolored with the rose, yet la!
Each fibre started into strange unrest,
And then was stilled, lulled to a rhythmic flow
Perchance our spirits clasp on some fair isle,
Bright with the sheen of reveries divine;
Or list'ning to such strains as chant the stars,
In purest harmony their tendrils twine.
God grant our souls may meet in paradise,
After the mystery of life's sweet pain;
And find the strange prismatic hues of earth
Transmuted to the spotless light again.
Recompensed?
She roamed the meadows long in hope
That in some sunny dingle fair,
She'd meet her youth with golden hair,
Giving to her some little care;
Alas! unloved she seemed to grope.
He was not there, in vain her prayer.
One morn she saw him; 'gainst her will
Her waiting heart did faster beat;
And yet he came not her to greet,
Nor did his eyes her sad eyes meet.
"O wayward heart!" she said, "be still!
It is not he! it cannot be!
"Ah! welladay! my dream is o'er.
I must the bitter truth believe;
Why still my soul with hopes deceive?
'Twas he! and yet the more I grieve
I love him better than before
Ah! if he knew, he'd love me too."
The Messengers
Sat a damsel on the hillside
In the fading afternoon,
When the Summer flung her roses
In the grassy lap of June;
Came three elves and danced around her,
Blithesome, sprightly creatures they,
Like the birds that soar above us,
Or glad children at their play.
Said the first one: "Damsel, follow!
With us to the forest hie;
Lisping streams will bid thee welcome,
As they mirror back the sky.
Sad-eyed doves will coo a greeting
As they flutter "mid the leaves."
Said the damsel: "Nay, I cannot,
For my tender mother grieves."
Said the second: "Damsel, hear me!
We have there a home for thee,
Where we've built fair jess'mine bowers
Through the sunny greenery.
We will dance at early morning,
And sing quiet lays at eve."
Said the damsel: "Nay, entreat not,
For my mother much would grieve."
Said the third one: "Damsel, Damsel!
Love is waiting for thee there,
With a wreath of shining moonbeams
Twined about his flowing hair.
He has taught soft flutes to quiver
With the music of his heart.
Little Damsel, charming Damsel,
Wilt not come and do thy part?
Then the damsel rose and followed
To the dreamy forest glade,
And a tranquil, rippling cadence
Was the only sound she made.
Had the lisping streams enticed her?
Were the jess'mine bowers so fair?
Or was it a mystic heart-call
That is potent everywhere?
O Restless Heart, Be Still!
O restless heart, be still!
'Tis thine by peaceful founts to rove;
Why comes the cruel archer Love
To shoot with reckless will?
Peace! restless heart, be still!
Calm, restless heart, so calm,
Thou ling'redst dreamily to wait
Where sang the ringdove to his mate,
A quiet, holy psalm.
Calm, restless heart, so calm!
Now, restless heart, 'tie done!
No longer under starry skies
Thou'lt stray with yearning in thine eyes;
And yet, poor fluttered one,
Is comfort 'neath the sun?
Nay! nay! but sure 'twere best
That Love should fold thee 'neath his wing
And to thy soul sweet snatches sing;
Yet it must be confessed
It is not surely rest!
Boat Song
O rocking boat, rocking boat poised on the wave,
Sway gently, sway gently; the bird to his nest
Is speeding, while Day with the airiest tread,
Approaches the wond'rous rose-courts of the West.
O rocking boat, rocking boat cradled 'mid foam,
Glide swiftly, glide swiftly, for there on the shore,
In dreams 'neath the trysting tree, murm'ring my name,
Is she whom my heart will enshrine evermore.
O rocking boat, rocking boat, low swings the moon,
The stars kiss the billows, I may not delay;
Draw nearer, draw nearer, I see the trees stir;
We're moored and my darling is mine, mine for aye!
Cuckoo Song
Cuckoo, glad cuckoo, Oh! where wilt thou rest to-night.
Cuckoo, fly southward and find a new nest to-night.
         Birds that are roaming
         Far 'mid the gloaming,
         Hie to their leafy home
When they have ceased to roam.
         But where is thine,
         Ay, and where mine?
Hesperus, silver star, glow in the West to-night?
Restless I wander and cannot find rest to-night.
         Golden thou gleamest,
         And ever seemest
         Like eye of seraph fair,
Lone in the radiant air.
         Fair evening Queen,
         What may it mean?
There's a sweet singing bird comes to my breast to-night,
Fluttering strangely, builds there a nest to-night.
         Cuckoo, hast sent him,
         And swift wings lent him?
         Hesperus, sunset star!
Comes he from thee afar?
         Love is his name,
         Me shall he claim?
QUATRAINS
At Sunset
Into his rosy chamber stepped the Sun,
Fair Venus lit her vestal lamp of gold;
A magic stillness did the earth enfold,
The coming Night a newer grace had won
Life's Boundary
Life is a glass wherein we dimly see
Foreshadowings of our devious plans and was;
Life is a glass. Lo! 'tis Eternity
That bounds the dim perspective of our days.
Charity
I saw a maiden, fairest of the fair,
With every grace bedight beyond compare.
Said I, "What does thou, pray, tell to me!"
"I see the good in others," answered she.
Awakening
The faint-flushed buds awake within the cup
Of myriad folded roses yet to be;
Ere Life can drink its utmost sweetness up,
Love flutters, wakens, O how sweet to see!
Lost Opportunities
When it is past -- golden moment--gone!
How we do rend ourselves, undone, forlorn!
The jewel left a moment in the hands,
We search, yet find it not o'er widest lander
Ambition
What is ambition? 'tis unrest, defeat!
A goad, a spur, a Quick'ning the heart's beat;
A fevered pulse, a grasp at shadows fleet,
A beck'ning vision, fair, illusive, sweet!
Full Vision
But look a trial down from some far height,
And 'twill diminish to a speck in air.
Half-vision irks and frets. Let on the light!
The demon vanishes before a prayer
After the Storm
Sol took his nightcap off and gazed
Through cloudy curtains. At the sight
The mists fled scared to windy haunts;
And lo! the earth was filled with light.
At the Cascade
The waters rippled, gleamed and fell;
Sweet Jessie tripped adown the dell
She heard his voice, their fond lips met;
The rocks with silver spray were wet.
Nature's Uplifting
The soul that's fed on Nature is content
To lift itself in all-adorning love
Unto the Father who such glories sent,--
A shadow of the fairer joys above
Instability
What we to-day prize and most fondly cherish,
To-morrow scarce may claim a moment's reck'ning
Yet why adjust the cause? Let doubt all perish.
Can argument withstand the spirit's beck'ning?
The Afterglow
The rose and gold and violet
Were fairest when the sun had set;
So when life's noblest battle's won,
Peace comes at setting of the sun.
THE PROCESSION OF THE SEASONS
January
To herald in another year,
With rhythmic note the snowflakes fall
Silently from their crystal courts,
To answer Winter's call.
Wake, mortal! Time is winged anew!
Call Love and Hope and Faith to fill
The chambers of thy soul to-day;
Life hath its blessings still!
February
The icicles upon the pane
Are busy architects; they leave
What temples and what chiseled forms
Of leaf and flower. Then believe
That though the woods be brown and bare,
And sunbeams peep through cloudy veils
Though tempests howl through leaden skies,
The Springtime never fails!
March
Robin! Robin! call the Springtime!
March is halting on his way;
Hear the gusts. What! snowflakes falling
Look not for the grass to-day.
Ay, the wind will frisk and play,
And we cannot say it nay.
April
She trips across the meadows,
The weird, capricious elf!
The buds unfold their perfumed cups
For love of her sweet self;
And silver throated birds begin to tune their lyres,
While wind-harps lend their strains to Nature's magic choirs
May
Sweet winsome May, coy, pensive fay,
Comes garlanded with lily-bells,
And apple blooms shed incense through the bow'r,
To be her dow'r;
While through the leafy dells
A wondrous concert swells
To welcome May, the dainty fay
June
Roses, roses, roses,
Creamy, fragrant, dewy!
See the rainbow shower!
Was there e'er so sweet a flower?
I'm the rose-nymph, June they call me.
Sunset's blush is not more fair
Than the gift of bloom so rare
Mortal, that I bring to thee!
July
Sunshine and shadow play amid the trees
In bosky groves, while from the vivid sky
The sun's gold arrows fleck the fields at noon,
Where weary cattle to their slumber hie
How sweet the music of the purling rill,
Trickling adown the grassy hill!
While dreamy fancies come to give repose
When the first star of evening glows.
August
Haste to the mighty ocean,
List to the lapsing waves;
With what a strange commotion
They seek their coral caves.
From heat and turmoil let us oft return
The ocean's solemn majesty to learn
September
With what a gentle sound
The autumn leaves drop to the ground;
With many-colored dyes,
They greet our watching eyes.
Rosy and russet, how they fall!
Throwing o'er earth a leafy pall
October
The mellow moon hangs golden in the sky,
The vintage song is over, far and nigh
A richer beauty Nature weareth now,
And silently, in reverence we bow
Before the forest altars, off spring praise
To Him who sweetness gives to all our days.
November
The leaves are sere,
The woods are drear,
The breeze that erst so merrily did play,
Naught giveth save a melancholy lay;
Yet life's great lessons do not fail
E'en in November's gale.
December
List! list! the sleigh bells peal across the snow;
The frost's sharp arrows touch the earth and lo!
How diamond-bright the stars do scintillate
When Night hath lit her lamps to Heaven's gate.
To the dim forest's cloistered arches go,
And seek the holly and the mistletoe;
For soon the bells of Christmas-tide will ring
To hail the Heavenly King!
THE SEER, THE SINGER AND THE SAGE
Dante
Rare medieval Spirit! brooding Seer!
Grand, lonely Poet! scaling heights divine
And lifting from grave mysteries the veil,
Through the dim centuries thou speakest still
In tones of thunder; and subdued by awe
We listen, for thy intutions fine,
Thy insight keen discovered motives hid,
And aim close wound in aim thou couldst perceive,
Unwinding minor aims in which 'twas wrapt.
Knit with the very fibres of thy soul,
Thy country's weal a cherished charge became;
And Destiny stern frowning o'er the land,
Upheaved thy feelings and inflamed thy speech.
Indignant at the wrongs that Florence bore,
Florence, thy well-beloved, thy hallowed home,
With stern denunciation thou didst wage
Against the law's lax mandates bloody war,
And all unawed, rebuked the false decrees
Of kings, of conquerors, popes and cardinals,
The pure "white flower" waving in thy hand.
Thy thought self-poised, self-centered, dragged thy soul
Into what depths of grief and deepest pain!
But to posterity thou didst bequeathe--
Despite the scathing of the contest fierce--
Thy reveries' illuminated page.
The groans of spirits plunged in woe's abyss,
The sweet repentance of the wistful souls
Climbing in patience Purgatory's steep,
Called thee to muse on life's strange mystery.
Before thy vision what fair vistas stretched,
Empurpled with the glow of Paradise!
Thou heardst in dreams the harmonies sublime
Of martyr glorified and rapturous saint.
And she, Beatrice the celestial one,
Who woke thy heart's best love and sweetest joy
Alone was meet to guide thy willing steps
From planet to fixed star, and onward still,
Above the splendor of the luminous stars,
Where blessed souls their orisons uplift
And isles supernal bloom with amaranth fair,
Up to the Empyrean's crystal courts,
Where Majesty Divine enthrones itself.
And soon the perfect Vision met thy gaze,
The mystic Trinity all solved by light,
Three colors, three reflections in the one,
Christ was reveals--the Human, the Divine!
God's plan for our redemption clear to thee!
And now, O lonely Spirit, brooding Seer!
So long in conflict, weary with unrest,
Within the beatific realms above,
Bathed in that Light Ineffable thou dwell'st,
O yearning Soul, at last, at last in peace!
Longfellow
The "Psalm of Life" for thee is o'er,
O bard serenest! on the shore
Of shad'wy Time, we see complete
Thy life, so rounded, fair and sweet.
Thy tender thoughts, thy soothing rhyme,
Like sweet bells ringing, e'er will chime
With much of hope and joy and need.
For thou couldt soothe and cheer indeed.
Like pictures in some stately hall,
Hung where the loving gaze of all
May seek contentment, thy true verse
May to each one some truth rehearse.
Who now can climb the Alpine height,
Nor see clear in the gleaming light,
The word that mystic banner bore,
That potent word,--"Excelsior?"
When dainty moonlight veils the stars,
We see framed in its "golden bars,"
"Endymion and Dian" fair,
While Love floats radiant through the air.
Shall we not oft at midnight hour
When silence reigns with mystic pow'r,
Hear loud "the old clock on the stairs,"
Its requiem mingling with our prayers?
When fierce the tempest roars o'erhead
And e'en the mariner knows dread,
Behold the little maiden fair,
The seaweed clinging to her hair!
Evangeline and Gabriel!
When woman's constancy we tell,
Her name in brightest hues shall shine,
Who made devotion so divine.
And Minnehaha! we can see
A scene of grace and witchery
When her we call; and then the grief
And pathos of her warrior chief.
When round the hearth some vacant chair
Is all the answer to our prayer,
We hear thee say, "Death is transition"
But leading to the "life elysian."
When "day is done" and misty shades
Are deep'ning all the solemn glades,
And sadness comes, who well as thou,
Can rest and cheer and calm us now?
We fain--the "architects of Fate"--
Would wisely build; though naught of great
May be the end of all our care,
We still will hope and nobly dare.
So runs our life with thine, sweet friend,
And now when all thy soul-songs blend
With Heaven's music, shall not we
Still sweeter rev'rence give to thee?
A Thought at Walden
(After visiting the site of Thoreau's Hut)
O sylvan priest of Nature! rightly thou
Didst read her lessons; on thy solemn brow
Was left the dew of morning, and thine eyes
Saw deepest meaning in the changing skies.
Thine ear attuned to catch her subtlest sound,
Heard quaintest music trilling from the ground.
The robin warbling on the leafy spray,
The lark upsoaring to salute the day,
Were more than simple warblers unto thee,
And e'en the tinest insect on the lea.
Nature, thy mother, taught thy spirit fine
The essence of her cadences divine;
And earth being to thee naught save joy and praise,
Made of thy living rare and wondrous days.
HEROIC ECHOES
Quebec
O antique city on St. Lawrence shore,
A relic, e'en a page of ancient lore
Thou art! Thy granite fortress tow'ring high,
Stretching its massive bulwarks toward the sky,
Tells of the march of war when nations proud
Proclaimed the force of arms in accents loud,--
The mighty cannon's boom; and valor rose,
While fearless armies ranged themselves as foes.
Here met two noble souls,--two chieftains brave,
Cast in heroic mould. Stern Fortune gave
To one,--the victor's meed; to each, a grave!
Renowned Champlain first gave these rocky heights
A name. Of yore full oft on starlight nights
The Indian war-whoop echoed round these plains,
And smote the desert shores with sad refrains.
Thy limpid waters, fair St. Lawrence, bore
Unchecked the rude canoe. Forevermore
In song and story will the red man be
A part of thy broad stream. Time unto thee
Will add fresh lusture as the ages roll,
And from life's warfare many a thoughtful soul
Hither repair, as to a pilgrim's goal.
Yet why a pilgrim's goal? Was it not here
That valiant armies met, and ev'ry fear
Was lulled in hope of conquest? Was't not here
On sunlit plains Wolfe's gallant troops drew near
And marched to vict'ry ere the morning broke?
Yes! e'en on Abraham's plains when courage woke,
The great commander closed his eyes in death;
But as he yielded up life's fitful breath,
And to proud England's isles the honor gave,
He claimed the poet's lines--this soldier brave:
"The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
A stately column here attests his worth,
And e'en the hero to whom France gave birth,
Despite he fell, shorn of the conqueror's wreath,
Not without glorious deeds within the sheath
Placed he his sword. His honored ashes lie
Where soft the vesper hymn goes echoing by,
Within the quiet convent's pious shade.
Such are the heroes that thy glory made,
O antique city by St. Lawrence shore!
And long as round thee mighty waters roar,
Thou wilt remain,--a page of ancient lore!
In Memoriam.
(Frederick Douglass)
One whose majestic presence ever here,
Was as an inspiration held so dear,
Will greet us nevermore upon the earth.
The funeral bells have rung; there was no dearth
Of sorrow as the solemn cortege passed;
But ours is a grief that will outlast
The civic splendor. Say, among all men,
Who was this hero that they buried then,
With saddest plaint and sorrow-stricken face?
Ay! 'twas a princely leader of his race!
And for a leader well equipped was he;
Nature had given him most regally
E'en of her choicest gifts. What matter then
That he in chains was held, what matter when
He could uplift himself to noblest heights.
E'en with his native greatness, neither slights
Nor wrongs could harm him; and a solemn wrath
Burned in his soul. He well saw duty's path;
His days heroic purposes did know,
And could he then his chosen work forego?
Born to a fate most wretched, most forlorn!
A slave! alas! of benefits all shorn
Upon his entrance into life, what lot
More destitute of hope! Yet e'en that blot
Could not suffice to dim the glowing page
He leaves to History; for he could wage
Against oppression's deadliest blows a war
That knew no ending, until nevermore
Should any man be called a bondman. Ay!
Such was a conflict for which one could die.
Panting for freedom early, he did dare
To throw aside his shackles, for the air
Of slavery is poison unto men
Moulded as Douglass was; they suffer, then
Manhood asserts itself; they are too brave,
Such souls as his, to die content a slave.
So being free, one path alone he trod,
To bring to liberty--sweet boon from God--
His deeply injured race; his tireless zeal
Was consecrated to the bondman's weal.
He thought of children sobbing round the knees
Of hopeless mothers, where the summer breeze
Blew o'er the dank savannas. What of woe
In their sad story that he did not know!
He was a valiant leader in a cause
Than none less noble, though the nation's laws
Did seem to spurn it; and his matchless speech
To Britain's sea-girt island shores did reach.
Our Cicero, and yet our warrior knight,
Striving to show mankind might is not right!
He saw the slave uplifted from the dust,
A freeman! Loyal to the sacred trust
He gave himself in youth, with voice and pen,
He had been to the end. And now again
The grandest efforts of that brain and heart
In ev'ry human sorrow bore a part.
His regnant intellect, his dignity,
Did make him honored among all to be;
And public trusts his country gladly gave
Unto this princely leader, born a slave!
Shall the race falter in its courage now
That the great chief is fallen? Shall it bow
Tamely to aught of injury? Ah, nay!
For daring souls are needed e'en to-day.
Let his example be a shining light,
Leading through duty's paths to some far height
Of undreamed victory. All honored be
The silv'ry head of him we no more see!
Children unborn will venerate his name,
And History keep spotless his fair fame.
The Romans wove bright leafy crowns for those
Who saved a life in battle with their foes;
And shall not we as rare a chaplet weave
To that great master-soul for whom we grieve?
Yea! Since not always on the battle-field
Are the best vict'ries won; for they who yield
Themselves to conquer in a losing cause,
Because 'tis right in God's eternal laws,
Do noblest battle; therefore fitly we
Upon their brows a victor's crown would see.
Yes! our great chief has fallen as might fall
Some veteran warrior, answering the call
Of duty. With the old serenity,
His heart still strung with tender sympathy,
He passed beyond our ken; he'll come no more
To give us stately greeting as of yore.
We cannot fail to miss him. When we stand
In sudden helplessness, as through the land
Rings echo of some wrong he could not brook,
Then vainly for our leader will we look.
But courage! no great influence can die.
While he is doing grander work on high,
Shall not his deeds an inspiration be
To us left in life's struggle? May not we
Do aught to emulate him whom we mourn?
We are a people now, no more forlorn
And hopeless. We must gather courage then,
Rememb'ring that he stood man among men.
So let us give, now he has journeyed hence,
To our great chieftain's memory, reverence!
Greeting
To Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, on her Eighty-fifth Birthday
We greet thee now upon this festal morn,
O Friend of Freedom! thou who in those days
When human rights were scorned and Justice slept,
Though loud the bondman cried, didst dare to raise
Thy voice to aid the lowly. Many a soul
Was roused to nobler thinking, many a heart
Impelled to braver doing by thy words,
And in the contest fitted to bear part.
We read, and lo! a vision rises there.
Who is't comes here? A hero crowned with bay?
Ah, no! a slave in chains, of meekest mien,
Treading with patient step a thorny way.
'Tis Uncle Tom, sad Uncle Tom! He turns,
He backward points, and what do we descry?
Unnumbered hosts in shackles, bleeding, torn,
To whom it were a blessing but to die.
Anon the vision passes! and we see
Another host,--a smiling, happy band.
The chains are torn away, and chants of praise
Vibrate along the mountains, through the land.
Such was the boon that thou didst help to give,
O noble woman! and as years fleet by,
Does not the thought of ransomed Uncle Toms
Moisten with tears of thankfulness thine eye?
For surely naught can e'er avail to check
A blessed influence: it still will live
While the majestic stars in solemn rhythm
Wheel in their mighty orbits. What could give
Such impulse unto Justice as the scenes
On thy pathetic pages? Who could learn
The story of that rare, heroic life,
And not with deepest indignation burn?
The nation's shame was lifted by the force
Of words like thine, far more than by decrees
Of lordliest statesmen in their councils grave.
And when war's din had ceased, and on the breeze
The silv'ry cadence of fair Freedom's chimes
Rang out in joyful measures, was the peal
Not sweeter for the work that thou hadst done?
Whose worth the coming years will still reveal.
So may thy birthday be all bright with bloom
Of happy thoughts, and from the stirring past
May sweetest mem'ries come of those brave deeds
For Freedom ventured. Lo! time speedeth fast,
And loved ones haste again with greeting glad
And as around they flock their gifts to lay
Before thy feet, our dearest prayer is this:
God's peace be thine upon thy natal day!
In Memoriam 
Paul Laurence Dunbar
The Muse of Poetry came down one day,
And brought with willing hands a rare, sweet gift;
She lingered near the cradle of a child,
Who first unto the sun his eyes did lift.
She touched his lips with true Olympian fire,
And at her bidding Fancies hastened there,
To flutter lovingly around the one
So favored by the Muse's gentle care.
Who was this child? The offspring of a race
That erst had toiled 'neath slavery's galling chains.
And soon he woke to utterance and sang
In sweetly cadenced and in stirring strains,
Of simple joys, and yearnings, and regrets;
Anon to loftier themes he turned his pen;
For so in tender, sympathetic mood
He caught the follies and the griefs of men.
His tones were various: we list, and lo!
"Malindy Sings," and as the echoes. die,
The keynote changes and another strain
Of solemn majesty goes floating by;
And sometimes in the beauty and the grace
Of an impassioned, melancholy lay,
We seem to hear the surge, and swell, and moan
Of soft orchestral music far away.
Paul Dunbar dead! His genius cannot die!
It lives in songs that thrill, and glow, and soar;
Their pathos and their joy will fill our hearts,
And charm and satisfy e'en as of yore.
So when we would lament our poet gone,
With sorrow that his lyre is resting now,
Let us remember, with the fondest pride,
That Fame's immortal wreath has crowned his brow.
Lincoln
Centenary, February 12,1909.
We lift the curtain of the past to-day,
And chase the mists and stains of years away,
Once more, O martyred chief, to gaze on thee,
The worth and purpose of thy life to see.
'Twas thine, not worlds to conquer, but men's hearts,
To change to balm the sting of slavery's darts,
In lowly charity thy joy to find,
And open "gates of mercy on mankind."
Long will they come, the freed, with grateful gift,
From whose sad path the shadows thou didst lift.
The years have rolled their changeful seasons round,
Since its most tragic close thy life-work found.
Yet through the vistas of the vanished days
We see thee still, responsive to our gaze,
As ever to thy country's solemn needs.
Not regal coronets, but princely deeds
Were thy chaste diadem; of truer worth
Thy modest virtues than the gems of earth.
Stanch, honest, fervent in the purest cause,
Truth was thy guide; her mandates were thy laws.
Rare heroism, spirit-purity,
The storied Spartan's stern simplicity,
Such moral strength as gleams like burnished gold
Amid the doubt of men of weaker mould,
Were thine. Called in thy country's sorest hour
When brother knew not brother--mad for power--
To guide the helm through bloody deeps of war,
While distant nations gazed in anxious awe,
Unflinching in the task, thou didst fulfill
Thy mighty mission with a deathless will.
Born to a destiny the most sublime,
Thou wert, O Lincoln! in the march of time,
God bade thee pause and bid the oppressed go free--
Most glorious boon giv'n to humanity.
While slavery ruled the land, what deeds were done!
What tragedies enacted 'neath the sun!
Her page is blurred with records of defeat,
Of lives heroic lived in silence, meet
For the world's praise; of woe, despair and tears,
The speechless agony of weary years.
Thou utteredst the word, and Freedom fair,
Rang her sweet bells on the clear winter air;
She waved her magic wand, and lo! from far
A long procession came. With many a scar
Their brows were wrinkled, in the bitter strife,
Full many had said their sad farewell to life.
But on they hastened, free, their shackles gone;
The aged, young,--e'en infancy was borne
To offer unto thee loud peans of praise,--
Their happy tribute after saddest days.
A race set free! The deed brought joy and light!
It bade calm Justice from her sacred height,
When faith and hope and courage slowly waned,
Unfurl the stars and stripes, at last unstained!
The nations rolled acclaim from sea to sea,
And Heaven's vault rang with Freedom's harmony.
The angels 'mid the amaranths must have hushed
Their chanted cadences, as upward rushed
The hymn sublime: and as the echoes pealed,
God's ceaseless benison the action sealed.
Exalted patriot! illustrious chief!
Thy life's immortal work compels belief.
To-day in radiance thy virtues shine,
And how can we a fitting garland twine?
Thy crown most glorious is a ransomed race!
High on our country's scroll we fondly trace,
In lines of fadeless light that softly blend,
Emancipator, hero, martyr, friend!
While Freedom may her holy sceptre claim,
The world shall echo with Our Lincoln's name.

A TINY SPARK 
 To My Dear Reader. 
 Don't criticize my writing 
     Cause I ain't well trained you know 
 I hab al-way's been so sickly
     Dat I haben had much show. 
 Don't laff and ridicule me 
     Cause 'twill make me feel ashamed, 
 For I knows dat I ain't great 
     Nor neither have I fame. 
 Some of dese poems you'er reading 
     Was written long ago, 
 When I was jist a little kid 
     Of thirteen years or so. 
 Don't criticize my poems, 
     'Cause I wrote 'em all for you; 
 I ain't had much training 
     'Tis de best dat I can do.
 And if you find's my book 
     Ain't good as fought to be, 
 Jist leave it to my ignorance 
     And don't you laff at me. 
The Love of a Slave Mother. 
 Just between the dawn and daylight 
     Down by the Swany River shore 
 Crept a slave mother with her child 
     Clasped to her bosom tight. 
 She looked upon her and whispered 
     ''So Mas'er was gwine to sell you 
  And we's done run away. 
     Now Mas'er won't see us no mo' 
 T'will de break of Judment day." 
     She casted her eyes toward heaven 
 And sent up a silent prayer 
     That Jesus the King of Glory 
 Would take her and baby there. 
     Just as the Sun of heaven 
 Kissed the earth with its blessed light 
     She whispered softly to baby 
 "Cling to yo’ mother tight." 
     Within that very moment 
 The sound of a splash was heard, 
     And silence came over the waters 
 As though nothing had occured. 
     But upon the morning breezes 
 Rose a soft and tender sound, 
     It floated to her master's house 
 And lingered upon his ground. 
    "So Mas'er was g-wine to sell you 
 And we's done runaway 
     And Mas'er won't see us no mo' 
 T'well de break of Judgement Day." 
 The Soldier's Letter. 
 Dear Mother, it gives me bitter pain 
     To break this news to you, 
 That I, your son, am dying, 
     But dying brave and true. 
 I know when you receive this 
     Your heart will break in twain. 
 But mourn me not, dear Mother, 
     For I do not die in vain. 
 Some of our bravest soldiers 
     Are lying cold and still. 
 They shed their blood most freely, 
     In the fight on San Juan's Hill. 
 Let your heart be filled with pride 
     For the Negro boys fought well; 
 They faced that fearful battle 
     Fearing neither shot nor shell. 
 I have not forgotten, dear mother, 
     How—the day I marched away— 
 You said, "My son, for mother's sake 
     Don't forget to pray." 
 I've kept your bidding, mother, 
     For I've prayed both day and night. 
 And on San Juan's bloody hillside 
     In the thickest of the fight, 
 Found my prayer ascending upward 
     To the King above the heighth. 
 I fear not Jordan's billows 
     Though they do fiercely roll; 
 I'm safe in Jesus, the anchor of my soul. 
     I can hear his voice a calling 
 I know my work is done; 
     Meet me in heaven, mother, 
 From your true and loving son. 
 Chillun and Men.

The American Flag. 
 Wave on, old Flag, with all thy might! 
 Wave on, and show thy colors bright! 
     Wave on, oh, Flag of Liberty! 
     You are welcome to wave in the land of the Free. 
 You've sparkled your stars, you've waved your stripes, 
 To wave you have tried in the stormest night 
     Once all around you cannons roared like thunder. 
     And shots fired through you rent you asunder 
 But on waved the threads, all left of thee, 
 Waved on until our country was free. 
     God the mighty and the just 
     Has given thee, oh Flag, to us. 
 You deserve more honor than we can give to thee 
 For you represent to us our Liberty. 
     All we can do, is look at you and say,
     "You are the greatest of all Flags today." 
The Negro's Flag and Country. 
 "Why do you write of the American's Flag, 
      Of its stripes of red and white? 
 And why do you call a flag your own 
     To which you have no right? 
 Why do you praise the white man's flag, 
     When you have not one of your own? 
 And why do you love this country 
     When this country is not your home?" 
 These words were said to me by a member of my race. 
 The fire was kindled within me as I looked him in the face. 
     I call this Flag my own, because long years ago 
     A war broke out for freedom and the land was full of woe. 
 The white man old and young fought with all their strength and might. 
 But they found the field was pretty hot, then the Negro joined the fight. 
     The Negro shed his blood without a murmur or complaint, 
     And though they faced many a hardship, their brave hearts did not faint. 
 My claim upon this country is sealed with Negro blood. 
 That swept many a battle field in royal crimson flood. 
     I claim it, yes! I claim it! because for many years. 
     We have mourned the loss of our heroes with bitter hearts and briny tears. 
 Give me back my death bound warriors, and I'll bow my head and cease: 
 But no! they are g'one, yes gone forever, so let heir bones rest on in peace. 
     Then sing it in the school house, then cheer the Negro's Flag. 
     Ring it in the school bell, don't let its banners drag. 
 Sing of the Negro heroes who fought in the days of yore; 
 Sing it until it echoes on the banks of eternity's shore. 
     The Negro's Flag and country, long may thy glory shine, 
     And know ye that I, a Negro, claim the Royal Flag as mine. 
Advice From Uncle Enoux. 
 Mother, train yo' chillun jest de way yo'd hab 'em go, 
 ‘Cause jest like you bends de saplin, da't de way its gwine to grow. 
 Father, teach yo' sons jest de ting yo'd hab 'em know, 
 'Cause de way you aims yo' arrow dat's de way its gwine to go. 
 Now don't you tink yo' chillun is too good to learn to work, 
 'Cause a little bit a hardship, now and den aint gwine to hurt,
 For dey's got one ting to learn, and dat is—neber shirk 
 If dey's workin' in a office or a'diging in de dirt. 
 You may hab plenty money and a plenty something eat 
 And may leave it to yo' chilluns when you lays you down to sleep; 
 And evyting at first will run right smooth and sweet 
 T'well de money dat you left 'em gine to sneak, and sneak, and sneak. 
 Den if you aint taught 'em nothing, but to set and hold dey hands 
 Dey can't earn demselves a libing, and a'how you spose dey can? 
 Den dey'll end up in de po' house, 'cause 'tis jest is true and show 
 Dat de way you aim yo' arrow, dats de way its gwine to go. 
Alone. 
 I think 'twould been nice if mamma had stayed 
     And had not gone to heaven so soon; 
 And happy I'd been if my little brother Jim 
     Had not followed her to the tomb. 
 T'was just yesterday when they layed father away, 
     And left me in the wide world alone 
 Don't make the parlor cheerful, 
     Don't turn the gas light on,
 For it brings back sad memories 
     Which pierce my heart like a thorn. 
 No mamma to read by the fireside,
 No brother to kiss and chide, 
     No more smiles from father 
 I wish that I too had died. 
     If I should wander in the orchard. 
 Oh! my heart, what do I see? 
     Only our favorite play ground under the old oak tree.
 But instead of mamma's hammock and brother's swinging chair. 
 Three newly made graves, side by side, lie there. 
I Am Happy—Dat Is All. 
 When I see's de nice white snow 
 Den dar's fun fur me I know. 
 De winds may blow, and storms may rise, 
 And clouds may gather in the sky; 
 But I gits my sled and slicks de rounds, 
 And away I shoots across de ground. 
 When de rain come pouring down, 
 I trys to pout and trys to frown, 
 But when I looks up on de she'f 
 Dar's something: dar dat takes my bref, 
     —Dat ol' Banjo. 
 When de wind does howl and blow, 
 What shall I do, whar shall I go? 
 Down by the fire I stretch myse'f. 
 Like a little birdy in her nest; 
 And while de wind does weep and wail 
 Grandpa tell me old time tales. 
 Oh! I's happy as kin be, 
 No kind ob weather troubles me, 
 I loves de Summer in its bloom, 
 I loves de Winter in its gloom, 
 I loves de Spring, I loves deFall, 
 I am happy—dat is all. 
What the Master Said. 
 "Suffer little children to come unto me,” 
 The Master said one day
 I am the light, in Me is no darkness, 
 I am the only true way. 
 He that beleiveth and is baptized 
 Beyond this world his treasure lies; 
 And he that in My foot path-tread, 
 Sweet I'll make his dying bed. 
 Spring. 
 The violets at last have awoke. 
 Their underground cells they have broke; 
     The birds again are on the wing, 
     Singing of the beautiful Spring. 
 Leaves are hanging on the trees,
 Dancing at every passing breeze; 
     And the sky is clear and blue— 
     Everything in Spring seems new. 
 The pretty dandelion with its golden head, 
 And the grasses and clovers have left their bed; 
     Mother Nature has made her call, 
     Now the Glory of God surrounds us all.

 Look, de rain-bow's in de sky—

The Depth From Whence We Came. 
 My fore-parents were slaves, 
     I'm not ashamed to say; 
 Thougfh many a one disdains the fact, 
     And fain would drive it away. 
 Why should we be ashamed to know 
     Of the depth from whence we came? 
 When we see the progress of our race— 
     They have risen from slavery to fame. 
 We once were crushed to the earth 
     And bound with a heavy chain,
 And a seal was put upon us 
     "Thou shall lose and never gain." 
 How tight that chain did hold us, 
     And the seal, how well it did last, 
 While the Negro toiled on and grew weary, 
     The chain and the seal held fast. 
 For many long years did he toil thus, 
     With no sign of deliverance near; 
 To God he prayed with patience,
     But it seemed that He did not hear. 
 The old men died and left the yoke 
     For the younger ones to bear 
 The young men grew old and others were born 
     With the chain of slavery to wear. 
 But before the earth was created, 
     God saw the slave bound man; 
 He wrote in His holy scripture 
     "Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand.'' 
 After many years of slavery 
     God's ligfhtening was seen in the sky, 
 His voice was heard in thunder saying, 
     "Let the Negro rise." 
 Lo! the chain was broken, 
     And the seal was torn away; 
 The Negro saw in the heavens 
     The dawn of his coming day
 He shook the dust from his shoulders, 
     And stood face to face with the world 
 He has proved his grit and courage 
     Though rocks at him were hurled. 
 He grasped every opportunity
     And rose in spite of all, 
 Whenever duty demanded him 
     He did not need be called. 
 You have risen, oh Mother Race, 
     So be thou not ashamed, 
 Let the once cursed name of Negro 
     Stand for the word of Fame. 
My Mother. 
 I have friends, yes I can't count them that have been so kind to me. 
     My relatives too have I that I love affectionately
 But there is one I have not named, whom I love above all others 
     Who's name is sacred, sweet and charming—'tis my mother. 
 Her eyes are full of a mother's love, 
     They are soft and tender as those of a dove. 
 When she speaks I only hear sweet music ringing in my ear 
     No other hand can sooth my pain 
 Or drive sorrow back with fierce disdain 
          But my mother. 
     No! I have not forgotten my father, who is loving, kind and g-ood, 
 Who has always done as much for me as any father could. 
     His eyes too are tender, his voice is low and sweet, 
 He brightens our home with his loving deeds, his presence is always a treat. 
     But, my mother! She's my mother you know 
 No matter who else there may be. 
     And I just can't help from thinking 
 There is nobody like her to me.
The Child. 
 Precious to my heart is this sweet little child 
 Come my dear, just one kiss, rest here awhile. 
     Nestle closer to my breast, 
     Slumber there, oh! thou blessed 
           Fair little flower. 
     Thou little one knows no care,
     Dwells in castles built of air,
     Would there I too could share 
           Thy little bowers. 
 Resolve For Today. 
 Another day has dawned, another day has broke 
 To toil for the Master and to bear His righteous yoke. 
     And though the day be sulky, and dry for want of rain, 
     And our feet tired and weary, and our bodies full of pain. 
 We'll take the gospel plow and plow up the field of sin. 
 And we will sow seeds of kindness where the thorns of sin have been.
Manish Tom. 
 When little Tom was five years old 
 He received a watch of solid gold 
     Said he, "I am a little man 
     And as brave as any in this land." 
 But a'last, a dog came in sight 
 And put poor manish Tom to flig-ht, 
 Our Faithful Guide. 
 I lay me down in peace to sleep and I think not of the morrow, 
 Yet I know not whether it will bring to me joy or sorrow. 
     But still I slumber peaceful and leave it all to Him, 
     Who rules the earth and heaven, mortal and immortal men. 
 And if we always trust Him with our tiny might 
 He'll safely lead and guide us through the day and night. 
The Little Seed. 
 A little seed fell to the earth, 
     'Twas the seed of an apple tree. 
 'Twas too small to grow I could plainly see— 
     Why it was'nt as large as a pea. 
 But the little seed planned of days to come, 
 When his body would be great and tall. 
 But how could that be, when he was so wee, 
 He could scarcely be seen at all? 
 By and by the seed broke in twain, 
     'Twas the death of him I said. 
 But instead of death, a pretty stem 
     Lifted up his little green head. 
 The stem grew up with perfect g-race 
     And looked with wondering eyes. 
 At the painting of Nature's wonderfull art. 
     Until he became very wise. 
 Little leaflets too came forth, 
     With beauty that can't be told. 
 So the seed that was wee, grew into a tree 
     'Twas a wonderful sight to behold. 
The Christian. 
 I is on my way to heaben, 
     Steady bound fur cannons shore. 
 I has turned my back on Satin 
     I don't like dis world no more. 
 I has got de sword of truth 
     Holding fast in my right hand, 
 And I's gwine to cut and slash old Satin 
     Twell I reach de promis land. 
 Life I know won't be so smooth now 
     Stumbling blocks is in de way. 
 But dey aint a gwine to hender 
     If I ondly wach and pray. 
 Don't you tink by me a talking, 
     Dat I's tink myself so strong, 
 Cause I aint, I's weak and sinful, 
     But I knows de right from wrong. 
 I can't preach like brother Jacob 
     Nor can I sing like sister Green 
 But I can tell anybody of 
     The one on which I lean. 
 I can tell you how he suffered 
     When he died on Calvry's tree: 
 I can tell ob how in Glory 
     Jesus pleads for you and me. 
 I can tell ob wonderous mercy 
     Dot he showed to my po' soal; 
 How he helt de hand of justice, 
     Under mercy's sweet control. 
 How when I has most forgot Him, 
     And wanders out in depth of sin, 
 How His voice so sweet and tender 
     Calls me back to Him again. 
 So it aint no use in loving 
     All these fadeing earthly things, 
 I hab set my heart on heben, 
     And I'se gwine to meet de King". 
 Slack Religion. 
 Folks is getting mighty slacky, 
     Dese days dey don't pray no mo' 
     And when Jesus comes a knocking, dey jist turns Him from de do.' 
 Went down Sally's house las' nig-ht and she ups and says to me, 
 "Look'er here, sister Mandy Jinkens come go to de dancing bee." 
     Den I turned in mazing wonder, sot my eyes on dat air gal 
 And I said in soder whisper, "Show'ly you don't mean dat, Sail?"
Why 'twas jest last quarterly meeting dat you shouted up so high, 
 Thought upon my word and honor, dat yo'd showly touch de sky;

     And I'm gwine to dance all I want to, 'twell de brake of Judgement morn." 
 Now Sally Carline Johnson can go rite on hur way,
 But you bet yo' life dat Mandy aint a gwine to git too gay,

 To the Memory of Rev. George W. Lee. 
 "He is gone!" our elder deacon said, 
     "He took his heaven bound flight. 
 The world looks on and says, ‘He is dead,' 
     But he lives in the land of light." 
 And while the deacon spoke thus 
     Ever eye was wet with tears, 
 For we had lost one of the noblest men 
     That had lived in our country for years. 
 The deacon said, "Let us rise and in one great body pray 
     The prayer our blessed Saviour taught his twelve disciples to say." 
 And our voices were lifted to heaven, in a mournfull and grief stricken tone, 
     And God sent us down a blessing, from around the dazzling white throne. 
 We have lost a noble hero, who's place can never be filled,
     And though years may pass away yet his memory will ever live. 
 'Twas in the morning he took his flight to the land of the blessed, 
     And I know that Reverend Lee, was glad to go to rest; 
 For many a time I’ve heard him say, when death's chilly stream was passed, 
     How he'd lay his head on Jesus breast, and cry, "I am home at last!" 
 So let him rest and mourn him not, since we know it will not be long 
 Ere we too shall follow in his steps, and join the happy throng. 
My Prayer. 
 In the morning- when I arise, a little pray I pray: 
 "Lord keep my heart and tongue from wrong 
 Throughout the live-long day." 
 And when the evening shadows fall a little song I sing: 
 "Oh! may this weary soul of mine, soon go to meet its King." 
 And when the night comes and I lay me down down to rest, 
 I pray a thankful prayer, for I know I have been blessed. 
     And my soul within me whispers: 
     "Lord, watch thy humble child." 
     And I know my prayer is heard, 
     For I feel the Saviour's smile. 
 When I’m Dead and Gone. 
 When I'm dead and gone don' weep and wail fur me 
 'Cause I's a gwine to heben to sing a Jubilee. 
 And when you carries me to de church, don' bow yo' head and cry 
 'Cause I t'ink 'tis a blessed thing, dat man was made to die. 
 I don't want to stay and suffer in this lowlyland of sin 
 So when I's dead and gone to heben clear yo' throat and say "Amen." 
 When you carries me to the grave, and lays my bones beneath de sod, 
 Jest remember dat my spirit lives above de world wid God. 
 Don' you drap yo’ lower jaw, 'twell yo' face is two yards long, 
 Don' you drap yo' se'f in moaning, don' you sing no moanfull song; 
 'Cause way up yonder in glory around the glassy sea 
 My po' soul a gwine to shout a mighty Jubilee. 
 The Forsaken Mother. 
 I am all forsaken, an outcast all alone. 
     My children all have left me, 
 Their hearts have turned to stone. 
     My husband died and left me with little children four 
 And it was all that I could do 
     To keep poverty from our door. 
 There was Willie, Johnie, Fannie and Bess— 
      I worked for them and did my best. 
 Through honesty I raised them everyone, 
     Twas a hard task, but alas it was done.
 My children married and settled down. 
     Fannie went away to live, 
 But the others stayed in town. 
     I went to live with Bess, 
 The youngest of them all. 
     She said there was not room enoug-h, 
 The house was very small. 
     I went to live with Willie, 
 But his wife said to me 
     That she thought there was not 
 Room enough in the house for three. 
     My feet were tired and weary, 
 My humble heart was sore. 
     As I slowly trudged along 
 To find my Johnnie's door. 
     But Johnnie said, "Mother you can't stay here, 
 For I rent my rooms, house rent is dear, 
     If it were not for that you could welcomely stay. 
 But you see for my rooms you are not able to pay." 
     Then, "Son," said I, "to the poor-house I must go." 
 And on I trudged to the poor house, with my heart full of woe. 
     "O, God, bless my children," the poor woman cried. 
 Then she casted her eyes toward heaven 
     And bowed her head and died.

 Mary's Little Goat. 
 Mary had a little goat 
     With wool upon his back; 
 And every time the goat did wrong, 
     He got a little slap. 
 He followed her to school one day, 
     And butted all around. 
 After Mary got him home, 
     She whipped him good and sound. 
 She carried him to the sea-shore 
     And took him to the bay,
 When the tide was coming in, 
     He'd butt the tide away. 
 She carried him for a motor ride, 
     To see the country fair. 
 He butt the chauffeur out the car 
     Away up in the air. 
 She carried him to the country 
     To get a little fat, 
 He chased the cows and butt the pigfs, 
     And fought duels with a cat. 
 She carried him to a circus; 
     So he thought he'd butt the clown 
 But he didn't stop a butting, 
     'Till the tent was up side down. 
 So Mary took her goat 
     And whipped him 'till he cried, 
 And gave him bread and water 
     Until he up his heels and died. 
 Then Mary had his funeral, 
     And she wept for her dead; 
 But late that night he rose again 
     And butt her out of bed. 
 A Tale told by Grandma. 
 I was seting in de cabin do'. 
     One moon shin' summers night, 
 When I heard a mighty noise. 
     An' I seen a mazzing sight. 
 Some soldiers was a coming, 
     Jest a tearing down de road 
 And dey busted Mis 'us do' in 
     An' thro’ de house dey poured. 
 Mis'us had hur bacon, 
     All packed up in de wall. 
 But de eoldiers broke de wall in 
     And I clar' dey took it all. 
 Dey called out po' ol' Hanner,  
     An' dey made her cook some meat 
 An' I can't beg-in to tell you, 
     How dem Yankee men did eat. 
 Dey catched every chichen, 
     An, dey killed every pig
 An' Mis'us had histericks 
     'Twell she farly danced a jig. 
 Den dey went in de garden 
     An' dey striped de place right bare 
 Left de place a lookin' 
     Like a syclone passed thro dar. 
 Den dey went in de barn, 
     An' took de co'n and wheat 
 An' dey clared de hoi' plantation 
     Of eberyting dats fit to eat. 
 Dey took all of Mis'us wine, 
     An' dey camp out on de place 
 An' de way dem soldiers carried on 
     I tinks it am disgrace. 
 Some of 'em got toxicated, 
     An' dey cracked de wo'ses jokes 
 An' dey laffed an' squarled an' hollered 
     'Twell I frought dey sho' would choke. 
 'Twernt nobody on de place, 
     Got a drap of sleep dat nig-ht 
 Ebery eye was so red nex' mornin' 
      Woulden a thought dey had a white, 
 Ol’ Mar'ser he had g-one to war. 
     So po' Mis'us she was lef 
 Dout a soal fer to perfect hur 
     But her own po' measely sef ' 
 Well I neber was so sorry
     Fur a body in my life 
 As I was fur po' ol' Mis'us 
     She was scared as little mice. 
 Why de way she ran across de yard, 
     An' fell in Hanner's do' 
 Would of made you clar 'fore heben 
     Dat she'd los' hur reason sho'. 
 Scared po' Hanner twell she hollered. 
     Lowd enough to make you def' 
 Lawsy Mis'us w'ats de matter? 
     Why you don't look lik' yo' sef' 
 You am fraid about dem soldiers 
     'Twell you'se white as any sheet. 
 But don't worry honey 
     You jest lay you down an' sleep. 
 But as I has formost told you 
     'Twernt no sleep for us dat night, 
 We jest huddled up toget'er 
     Watching fur de morning light. 
 Well atlas' when mornin' came 
     An' de soldiers went away 
 Dey diden leave us vittles nough 
     To las us thro' one day 
 But de Holy Father knowed, 
     An' he woulden let us starb, 
 So he sent us to a neighbor 
     Dat de soldiers didn't rob 
 An' so my story's ended 
     An' I aint gwine tell no mo, 
 So taint no use for to ax me 
     Cause my answer will be no. 
The Pie That Sister Made. 
 Mamma was eating a pie one day, 
     And 'twas a fly in it. 
 She did'nt know it and took a bite, 
     And down on the fly she bit. 
 My sister who made that pie was my mother's pet, 
     But after mamma bit that pie, she was no more, you bet. 
 My mother grabed a round out of the old armchair 
     And on my poor sister's bones she took a liberal share. 
 A Verse for Dark Days. 
 When the days are long and dreary,
     And your soul is tired and weary, 
 And when your burdens seem too heavy to bear, 
     Just think of Jesus who is on the other side; 
 He is fixing you a home over there. 
     And remember this, that Jesus said, "Even tho' I go away, 
 I will send my spirit down, so watch ye here and pray." 
     So weary heart leap for joy, cease thy dark dispair. 
 And think of Jesus who is on the other side, 
     He is fixing you a home over there.
The Night is Fast Approaching. 
 Why stand ye hear and idle, 
     When there's work enough to do, 
 And the nig-ht is fast approaching, 
     Soon the sun will be hid from view? 
 Why not work whilst the Sun doth warm thee, 
     For I warn you, it's beams will not last. 
 For the night is fast approaching 
     And this day with its beauty shall pass. 
 Cease plucking fading flowers. 
     Go! gather the golden grain 
 For the night is fast approaching, 
     When the idler shall be slain. 
 Shake thy lazy spirit,
     Leap up in the strength of thy might, 
 For the night is fast approaching 
     And the world shall have no lig-ht. 
 Go work with faultless courage. 
     For the Master will pay thee well; 
 When the shadows of the black nig-ht falls, 
     He'll save thy soul from Hell. 
 Love and Hate. 
 Two daughters had mother wisdom— 
     The pride and joy of her life— 
 One was called Love and tenderness. 
     The other Hate and strife.
 Love was the sweetest creature 
     That ever abounded on earth.  
 When the heart was filled with sorrow, 
     She would change it into mirth. 
 But Hate was indeed the vilest, 
     How poisenous was her breath. 
 She would crush the tender heart 
     Until it longed for death. 
 But when Hate has been abusing, 
     Love will always find a way' 
 To sooth the tender aching heart, 
     And take Hate's thorn awav. 
 Samson No. 2. 
 I's brave as de bravest, 
     I kin fight from sun to sun, 
 I can lick Jack Johnson— 
    Yes lick him till he runs. 
 But my jints is kinder stiff. 
     And I needs to limber up. 
 And I need a bit more practice, 
     On dem things called upper-cuts. 
 Everybody says dat Jack 
     Is mighty powerfull strong, 
 But I clair I could lick him 
     If he ever catched me wrong.
